COMMENTARY: GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS  
(DW)

 (Subs 3rd graf to make it read: `battle casualty'; subs last graf
to make it `stumbled' stead of `blundered')  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What should we think of Thursday's news of a potential deal in
Kosovo? We should think there is potential good news here and
potential bad news.
</P>
<P>
   What the Serbs acknowledged Thursday is that the air war has
really hurt them, that they are ready to sit down and negotiate,
and they are ready to do it according to the principles set out by
NATO and Russia. In other words, what happened Thursday is not the
end of negotiations, it is the beginning of them. NATO wanted to
avoid a ground war in Yugoslavia and it may have done that with the
air war. But the purpose of the air war was to determine who would
go where, with what arms and with what mandate on the ground, and
all that will now have to be negotiated by military men on both
sides _ and the air war can't stop until it is.
</P>
<P>
   If the details can be negotiated, and they really do allow a
strong NATO presence in Kosovo, the first piece of good news would
be that NATO's basic objective _ getting the refugees back home
under some form of credible international protection _ will be
possible, without splitting the alliance, without NATO having
suffered a single battle casualty and without a ground war. That
ain't beanbag.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to worry about is what NATO has won: the right to
manage relations between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs indefinitely,
just as NATO is now doing between Serbs, Croats and Muslims in
Bosnia. Why should one worry about that? Because Kosovo is not
Bosnia. The Bosnia peace accords began with a political agreement
between the leaders of each faction for a de facto partition of
Bosnia. The military arrangements were then built around that core
understanding. That is why it has been so stable.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is just the opposite. We are going to have a military
arrangement on the ground, with no political understanding between
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on what the political future of Kosovo
should be. The Kosovo Albanians still want full independence; the
Serbs still want NATO out and permanent sovereignty over Kosovo.
This means that NATO and Russia will not be sitting on basically
contented parties, but on still-aggrieved parties that could draw
the U.S. and Russia into their ongoing feud.
</P>
<P>
   If this deal is real, the second bit of good news is that
Milosevic will have been seen to lose in some very important ways.
He personally has been indicted as a war criminal; he would be
accepting foreign troops on his soil, something he had rejected;
and his army and his economy have both been mauled as punishment
for his actions. No one can say he is walking away a winner. He
will, though, be walking away a survivor, because NATO is not going
to go after him, so as not to upset any deal. As in Bosnia, there
will be a trade-off in Kosovo between justice and stability.
</P>
<P>
   If this deal is real, the third bit of good news is that the
Russians will have tacitly signed on to NATO's basic agenda in
Yugoslavia, and that's important. It could turn out to be a bridge
for re-establishing broader NATO-Russian cooperation. The thing to
worry about is that if Russian troops are to be in one zone in
Kosovo and NATO troops in another, friction and misunderstanding
will always be possible _ particularly if the Kosovo Liberation
Army seeks revenge on the Serbs in the Russian zone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from the start the Kosovo problem has been about how we
should react when bad things happen in unimportant places. Some
argued that Kosovo was so unimportant that you just had to ignore
the bad things happening there. Some argued that what was happening
in Kosovo was so bad you had to overlook its strategic
insignificance for America and mount an all-out ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including myself, argued that once the refugee evictions
began, ignoring Kosovo would be wrong, mounting a ground invasion
would deepen the disaster, and therefore using a huge air war for a
limited objective was the only thing that made sense. If this deal
proves real, it will establish that an air war for limited
humanitarian goals can be effective, albeit costly.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, though, the Clintonites stumbled into this
strategy, after completely underestimating Milosevic's intentions
and capabilities. The Kosovars have paid heavily for these
blunders. We will be lucky if the majority of them can now return
home. Which is why whatever this war proves about what air power
can do to achieve limited humanitarian goals, it is not something
anyone is going to want to try again real soon.

U.S. AND CANADIAN SALMON TREATY HAILED AS MAJOR STEP FORWARD

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Endangered chinook salmon runs of Puget Sound and the
Columbia River system emerged as apparent big winners Thursday as
U.S. and Canadian officials offered details of the 10-year Pacific
Salmon agreement reached by the two countries' negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Oregon achieved a key conservation goal as Canada
agreed to sharply cut back fishing for U.S.-bound chinook in waters
off Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make it much easier to promote restoration of salmon
habitat. Before, it was difficult to make the case for habitat when
not many fish were coming back to spawn,'' Oregon Gov. John
Kitzhaber said.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen in Alaska waters will continue to catch hundreds
of thousands of chinook, sockeye and coho salmon bound for rivers
in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be a major kill,'' Canada's fisheries
minister David Anderson acknowledged after a Seattle news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said, however, that the agreement is ``a step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has agreed to take fewer fish in years when runs are
weak. The two countries will replace fixed quotas with an
``abundance-based'' system that adjusts the catch to relative
abundance of runs.
</P>
<P>
   During 1996, when Canada closed its fisheries due to low runs,
Alaska took 170,000 chinook. The average Alaska chinook catch has
been about 250,000 fish a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if chinook salmon populations remain similar to those
observed in the past few years, Alaska-based fishermen under the
agreement can catch between 150,000 and 207,000 chinook a year.
They also will be able to catch sockeye and coho salmon bound for
Northwest rivers.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark wasn't pleased by the
agreement, saying it entrenches ``the right of Alaskans to catch
more B.C. salmon than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ which ends a five-year conflict between the
United States and Canada _ appears likely to produce certainty and
allow long-term planning for salmon conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of the impasse at sea produced relief by most
officials of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy, but after five frustrating years of
negotiating breakdowns, we finally ended the stalemate,'' said
Washington Gov. Gary Locke, whose ad hoc fish conservation
agreements with Anderson last year helped open the way for a
long-term settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Both government officials and fisheries groups said they can
concentrate on preserving and restoring salmon habitat now that
peace is in place in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's agreement is absolutely integral to our long-term
strategy to bring the salmon back,'' Vice President Al Gore said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and Kitzhaber had particular reason to smile. Canada's
concessions are likely to mean more _ many more _ salmon returning
to Northwest streams, according to figures released Thursday by the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement had been in effect the past few years, between
25 percent and 30 percent more salmon would have returned to Puget
Sound rivers. The return of chinook salmon to the Columbia River
would have been 40 percent higher. Imperiled Snake River salmon
runs would have seen double the number of spawners.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement won't come cheap, however.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as the price of preserving chinook and coho
salmon, the United States agreed to limit its catch of Fraser River
salmon to 16.5 percent, down from a historical average of 20
percent. Last year, U.S. fishermen took 25 percent of the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and Washington state are expected to
appropriate another $30 million to $35 million to buy out the
licenses of U.S. fishermen, including some Indians, who will lose a
big chunk of their customary Fraser River catch.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets up two funds, under joint U.S. and Canadian
management, for fisheries science, restoration and enhancement. A
$75 million Northern Fund would cover Alaska as well as northern
and central British Columbia, including B.C.'s troubled Skeena
River fishery. A $65 million Southern Fund would cover southern
British Columbia _ including the Fraser River _ as well as
Washington, Oregon and Idaho's Snake River basin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has committed to seek money to pay the $140
million for both funds _ in addition to the $100 million salmon
enhancement program already proposed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get it,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.,
pointing to the number of Northwest lawmakers on the appropriations
committees that control Congress' pursestrings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deeply felt differences were apparent Thursday,
particularly between Alaska and British Columbia fisheries
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska fishermen ``should not be made to make more
concessions,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee. However, Young praised negotiators and said he
was ``glad we have a long-term agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clark argued that last year, British Columbia
fishermen caught no B.C.-bound coho salmon in order to assure
survival. ``At the same time, Alaskans caught 800,000 B.C. coho,''
Clark said. ``This year B.C. will not catch any endangered coho.
The Alaskans will. In fact, Alaskans will catch endangered B.C.
coho next year, the year after that and every year for the next 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The premier's concerns were reflected even among British
Columbians who generally support the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any deal was better than no deal, and the real danger is that
our salmon runs will disappear,'' said Ric Careless, director of
B.C. Spaces for Nature, a conservation group. ``The real question
is what will happen up the coast with Alaska's continued
interception of chinook and coho.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fulton, who represented Prince Rupert in Canada's parliament
for 14 years, added: ``I wish this were a better agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Curtis, western conservation director for Trout Unlimited
in Portland, raised a different concern. ``The agreement is
incredibly technical,'' Curtis said. ``Can they pull it off? Manage
the details? And will Congress put up the enormous amount of money?
Those are the questions remaining before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the agreement acknowledged as much. ``This is a
beginning,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Strong, a longtime leader of the Columbia River Intertribal
Fisheries Commission, compared challenges facing U.S. and Canadian
negotiators to salmon trying to find their way home from the
Pacific Ocean to the river of their upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the dispute has ``spawned new perspectives'' about
conserving a resource shared by different countries and cultures,
Strong said.

SOME MOVEMENT TOWARD AGREEMENT ON NEW YORK STATE BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Prospects for approving a state budget moved
Thursday from abject stalemate to the realm of serious negotiation
as Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver agreed to cut his house's
spending proposals by $1 billion or more, the first significant
movement by any side in three months.
</P>
<P>
   The shift means that the overall budget figure proposed by the
Democratic-controlled Assembly is near that of the
Republican-majority Senate, though both still want to spend
significantly more than Gov. George Pataki, a Republican. The two
houses are close enough that they could soon convene a conference
committee to decide how the available money should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki welcomed the Assembly's movement, but he said Thursday
that the state remained far from settling a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have felt under siege over this budget, now 64 days
overdue. For months, Pataki has loudly assailed their proposal as
unrealistic and irresponsible, while refusing to get involved in
budget negotiations, an unusual stance that was intended to
distance him from the looming fiasco of another very late budget.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear that he felt no pressure to jump-start
negotiations and did not mind keeping the government running with a
string of emergency spending bills, a stopgap that Democrats
disliked because it limits spending to last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
   A new law that requires withholding legislators' paychecks when
a state budget is not completed by the deadline of March 31 has
begun to exert great personal pressure on some lawmakers. And
social service agencies, school districts and hospitals that rely
on state money have begun to clamor for some degree of certainty
about what they will receive as they prepare their own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Assembly adopted a plan that was, by the
Democrats' estimates, $2 billion higher than the governor's.
Republicans insisted it was actually $4 billion more. The Senate
adopted a plan $1.1 billion higher than the governor's.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Silver said he had agreed to cut his overall
spending plan to $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion over the governor's
plan, suddenly putting the Assembly on the same general terrain as
the Senate and nearly eliminating the main obstacle to a conference
committee. By the Democrats' estimate, they had reduced their
demands by about $1 billion; the Republicans said Silver had come
down by $2 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Silver, clearly angry at the governor and
the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, blamed them for
reducing allocations for programs he said were needed, and delaying
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, normally a reticent, colorless public speaker, gave an
agitated account of the year's budget process, at one point giving
a four-minute response to a simple question.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining how the Democrats' retrenchment began with a
conversation he had with the governor late Wednesday, the speaker
charged that Pataki's exploration of a possible presidential run,
an idea that he abandoned last week, had consumed the governor's
time and attention, leaving no time for state issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that his presidential campaign has come to a halt,''
Silver said, ``and he's been here, I chose to speak to him and
explain to him his characterization of the Assembly budget has
always been wrong, but that I was prepared to meet him more than
halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver and Bruno agreed that once the conference committee
convenes, a detailed budget can be hashed out in 10 to 14 days,
raising the prospect _ all but unimaginable at the start of the
week _ that a budget could be passed by the scheduled end of this
year's legislative session, on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki tried to douse any high expectations that might be
raised by the Democrats' new stance, saying, ``We are still very,
very far apart.''

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY PILOTS TRIED `EVERYTHING IN THEIR BAG OF
TRICKS'
</HEADLINE>
 _ 1st Lede Writethru (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Flight data recorder information shows that
the pilots of American Airlines Flight 1420 tried ``everything in
their bag of tricks'' to keep the plane under control as it
careened uncontrollably down the runway before crashing, a federal
source said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that wing spoilers that would have
helped slow down the plane after it landed did not deploy, and that
the pilots apparently tried twice to use the engines' thrust
reversers to control the aircraft's speed on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder showed that only one of the two
thrust reversers activated about eight seconds before the plane
crashed, said George W. Black Jr., the National Transportation
Safety Board member in charge of the crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That data, Black said, could indicate that the thrust reversers
malfunctioned or the pilot was attempting to use them to steer the
plane as it careened down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the source, who asked not to be named, said the
evidence so far points to pilots who were trying desperately to
control an aircraft that was being pushed sideways off the runway
by high winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indications are that pilots were trying to use everything in
there bag of tricks to bring the aircraft under control and get it
stopped,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's tires left sideways scuff marks on the pavement,
the source said. That evidence, the source said, is consistent with
strong cross winds blowing the aircraft sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Black said the pilots of doomed aircraft had
been alerted to wind shears but had no way of knowing the severity
of the thunderstorm pounding Little Rock National Airport with high
winds, blinding rain and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar that is installed at
major airports, not even the air traffic controllers guiding the
pilots knew that the thunderstorm packed the severe rating of Level
6, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew could not have known it was a Level 6 storm,'' Black
said. ``We only know that from our analysis of the Doppler weather
radar data after the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather is suspected as a primary factor in Tuesday night's
fiery crash, which killed the captain and eight passengers on the
McDonnell Douglas Super 80 jetliner. At least 82 others were
injured, some critically, but 136 people survived.
</P>
<P>
   The plane _ whose pilot had aborted one landing to make the
ill-fated approach from the opposite direction _ slid off the
runway, hit a large steel stanchion supporting runway lights, broke
apart and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the pilots had been given regular updates on the
deteriorating weather conditions, consisting primarily of wind
speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was changing rapidly,'' Black said. ``There's even
indications the tower controller was providing sort of a
play-by-play wind direction and velocity sequence of radio
transmissions during the approach.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB chief investigator Greg Feith described the stormy
conditions as ``a very dynamic situation, with wind conditions
changing every 20 to 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Feith and Black both emphasized, however, that it was up to the
plane's captain, not the controllers, to decide whether to land or
divert to another airport.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers initially cleared the aircraft to land from the
north on Runway 22-Left. Informed of the shifting wind, the pilots
then requested permission to land on the same runway, but from the
south.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft touched down about 2,000 feet down the 7,200-foot
runway but then veered off the concrete, went over an embankment at
the end of the runway, hit a steel support for runway lights and
broke in two, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have not determined the plane's speed
when it touched down, whether it was blown off the runway by a
strong wind gust or whether the aircraft's tires hydroplaned on the
wet pavement, causing the plane to go out of control, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed at 11:51 p.m., when airport winds were clocked
as high as 35 mph. Within five minutes, the safety board said, a
gust of more than 80 mph was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burnett, a former safety board chairman, said the pilots had
enough information about the tumultuous storm that they never
should have tried to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to race a thunderstorm to the airport is like trying to
race a locomotive to the railroad crossing,'' said Burnett, who
served as safety board chairman from 1982 to 1988 and is now a
Clinton, Ark., lawyer and transportation safety consultant. ``Even
if you tie, you're in bad shape. And this airplane tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president of operations,
cautioned against speculation blaming the pilot for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, he said, must learn ``exactly what the facts are
regarding the wind velocity and direction ... exactly when that
airplane was making the approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to want to try to figure out exactly what the
\Rcockpit\S crew knew. What did the tower tell them? What did the
en route \Rair traffic control\S center tell them? Did the crew
have the information to make an intelligent decision? And then what
were the actual wind conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett also said pilot fatigue could have played a role in the
decision to land rather than divert to another airport.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Buschmann, 48, the pilot who was killed, and
Michael Origel,the co-pilot who survived with a broken leg, had
been on duty 13 hours, 20 minutes at the time of the crash. The
limit for American pilots is 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked longer than 14 hours yesterday, but nothing I did
affected the lives and safety of anyone,'' Burnett said. ``With
pilots, the last thing they do at the end of a 14-hour shift is
land an airplane, which is the most difficult part of any flight.
They were called upon to make value judgments as well as to use
their flying skills to bring that airplane down safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 14 hours is just too long for pilots to work.
Eventually something will go wrong, like it did here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett also said the accident might have been averted if the
airport had the Federal Aviation Administration's state-of-the-art
Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, which could have given controllers
better information about the position and intensity of the
thunderstorm approaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated radar system has been installed at such major
U.S. airports as Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, Dallas' Love Field and
Houston's George Bush Intercontinental, but smaller airports such
as Little Rock's were not budgeted to get the multimillion-dollar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, who left the safety board in 1991 while the Terminal
Doppler Weather Radar program was being developed, said he was
pressured by the federal Office of Management and Budget ``not to
advocate a lot of these radar systems'' because of their expense.
</P>
<P>
   The Doppler radar was developed in direct response to the deadly
1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport, which was
attributed to a microburst of wind from a thunderstorm over the
airport as the pilot of the Lockheed L-1011 tried to land.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure, questioned why the Little Rock
airport did not have the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the system at Little Rock now, this radar could warn
the pilot in advance that dangerous winds were developing,'' he
said. ``There is no reason that airports like Little Rock should be
lacking the latest in weather prediction technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock has a regional Doppler weather radar facility about
seven miles northeast of the airport, but it does not provide the
detailed information about wind shear and microbursts _ highly
localized, high-speed downward blasts of wind _ that an airport
Doppler system is designed to detect, safety board officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport does have a less-sophisticated, low-level wind-shear
alert system with sensors that measure wind speed and direction. A
computer links the sensors and compares their information to give
controllers information about wind shear _ rapid changes in wind
speed and direction that can be deadly to a low-flying aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That system alerted controllers to wind shear as Flight 1420
approached the airport, and that information was relayed to the
pilots, Black said. (Staff writer Maria Recio contributed to this
report, which contains material from The Associated Press.)

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ Wednesday's guarded optimism turned into Thursday's
false hope, and today the Astros find themselves in the same rut
that has plagued them throughout their lengthy stretch of mediocre
play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too little offense, too many lapses in the field and just enough
mistakes on the mound add up to defeat. That was the
all-too-familiar story line in Thursday's 4-1 loss to the Milwaukee
Brewers at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed just seven hits Thursday and only 21 in the
three-game series. They are hitting .195 in their last 15 games,
going 7-8 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's would-be breakout (nine hits, nine runs) seemed like
ancient history Thursday when the Astros were shut down by Steve
Woodard, Eric Plunk and Bob Wickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (Wednesday's) game, I said I wasn't sure if that meant
we were ready to break out,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``It sure didn't look that way today.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers manager Phil Garner said of Woodward, ``Even though I
didn't think he was as sharp as I've seen him in the past, he did
manage to hold them down. He used more off-speed pitches today, and
even though he wasn't as sharp with them as I've seen him in the
past, he stayed out of trouble by going to his off-speed (stuff).''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' run came on Bill Spiers' home run in the second
inning. They advanced only two runners into scoring position after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shane Reynolds gave up four runs on nine hits,
including a pair of solo homers by Brewers catcher Dave Nilsson,
who was 3-for-3 and scored three runs. Reynolds lasted 5 innings,
his shortest outing since the Expos knocked him out after three
innings May 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane was below normal in terms of his velocity,'' Dierker
said. ``He obviously didn't pitch one of his better games. But the
bottom line is that you have to score more than one run if you're
going to win most games.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was 4-1 with a 2.65 ERA in April but dropped off to 3-3
with a 4.69 ERA in May. He is 2-4 with a 5.45 ERA in his last six
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been having trouble getting into a groove, and I never
could get into one today as far as getting the ball down.''
Reynolds said. ``It was just a situation of them capitalizing on my
bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson made sure the Astros' one-run lead didn't last long when
he launched a hanging splitter into the right-field bleachers in
the bottom of the second. The lefthanded slugger hit three home
runs and a double in his final six at-bats of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was just a bad pitch,'' Reynolds said. ``Everyone
knows my out pitch is the splitter, and he was sitting on it. When
they're waiting on the split and it's not a good one, they're going
to hit it. They have a good-hitting lineup, and you have to give
those guys credit. They did their job, and I didn't do mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson struck again in the fourth, and Mark Loretta singled
home Geoff Jenkins to give the Brewers a 3-1 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit Shane Reynolds at all,'' said Nilsson. ``I
think if you'd speak to him, he'd say they were mistakes. When
you're going well, that's what you hit is a lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was knocked out of the game in the sixth, but he might
have been able to hang around a little longer with some help from
center fielder Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson led off the sixth with a deep fly to center field.
Everett drifted to the warning track and seemed in position to make
the catch but mistimed his leap and came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball should have been caught,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds quickly retired the next two batters, which meant he
would have been out of the inning had Everett prevented Nilsson's
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed it,'' Everett said. ``I should have caught it;
that's all there is to it. I drifted and didn't come up with it. I
don't know what kind of leap that was. The ball landed in my
footprint. I may miss another one, but I won't miss another one
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins made the Astros pay for their fielding snafu, stroking a
two-out, two-strike RBI double to left field. Second-guessers might
question why Reynolds pitched to Jenkins with the pitcher's spot
next in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker visited the mound to discuss the situation with his
righthander, and they agreed to take their chances with Jenkins. It
turned out to be a moot point because Brewers manager Phil Garner
sent Rich Becker out to hit for Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew the pitcher wasn't going to bat,'' Reynolds
said. ``I thought I made good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a day when the offense returned to its struggling ways,
it wasn't enough.

EX-SURGEON GENERAL CHOSEN FOR HEALTH CHIEF BY PATAKI
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After a protracted search, Gov. George Pataki
nominated Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the former U.S. surgeon general,
as New York's health commissioner on Thursday, drawing cries of
betrayal from the abortion rights movement because Dr. Novello,
unlike the governor, opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing her at a news conference, Pataki praised Dr.
Novello for her extensive experience in public health. He said she
had been a trailblazer in addressing children's health issues and
would help lead the state's effort to save money by moving
recipients of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, into
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has devoted her life to public health issues,'' Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor generally supports abortion rights but adopted that
position later in his career, and some abortion rights groups
remain wary about his dedication to their cause. Questioned on
Thursday about abortion, Pataki declared that Dr. Novello would
carry out his policies rather than impose her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policies of this state with respect to a woman's right to
choose are not going to change,'' he said. ``They are not set by
the health commissioner. They are set by the executive and the
Legislature. I am pro-choice. We will continue to protect a woman's
right to choose, and continue to protect a low-income person's
access to Medicaid funding, if that is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Novello, 54, a pediatrician by training, said her beliefs _
she opposes abortion except in the case of rape, incest or a threat
to the health of the mother _ would not influence her work. ``My
personal and private opinion has nothing to do, now or ever, with
the performance of my duties,'' she said. She declined to discuss
the issue further.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has been seeking to add luster to his standing in
the national Republican party, which is dominated by politicians
opposed to abortion. With Dr. Novello, he is turning to a figure
who was popular with some conservatives for her abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   It was not lost in the State Capitol on Thursday that Dr.
Novello served as surgeon general under President George Bush,
whose son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is considered the
front-runner in the race for the Republican presidental nomination.
Pataki endorsed Governor Bush last week, and Pataki aides said
Pataki would like to be considered for the Republican
vice-presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   As a state legislator in the late 1980s, Pataki opposed abortion
but he later switched. While he does now favor abortion rights, he
has supported some restrictions, including a ban on the procedure
that opponents call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination for health commissioner requires approval by the
State Senate, which is controlled by Pataki's Republican allies,
and Dr. Novello is expected to win backing there easily. She would
be paid $197,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The job has been open since late last year, when Dr. Barbara A.
DeBuono, who was supported by lawmakers of both major parties,
resigned to become a hospital executive. Dr. DeBuono favored
abortion rights, as did her predecessors dating back to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As surgeon general from 1990 to 1993, Dr. Novello, the first
Hispanic person and woman to hold the job, repeatedly chastised
tobacco companies for what she said were marketing campaigns aimed
at children and sought to broaden public health efforts for people
in minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since stepping down as surgeon general, she has worked at the
United Nations Children's Fund and Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the aspect of her career that came under the most scrutiny
here on Thursday was her position on abortion and her support for a
rule adopted by President Bush that prohibited workers at family
planning programs receiving federal financing from discussing
abortion with their patients. President Clinton revoked the rule in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference on Thursday, Dr. Novello declined to
disavow that rule, but she pointed out that it was enforced by
other officials in the Bush administration, not the surgeon
general. She sought to focus her comments on her pleasure at
winning the appointment. ``I want to pledge to the governor, and I
want to pledge to the people of New York, that I will represent
them strongly and compassionately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some abortion rights groups reacted angrily to the nomination,
as did several Democratic lawmakers.

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Twenty-six years ago, Secretariat provided a
thrill unequaled in horse racing's voluminous history when he won
the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Chenery, owner of that massive burnished chestnut colt,
recalls: ``He was in another gear. When you watch the tapes, his
stride never changes. He doesn't accelerate. He looks as if he
could do that forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Chenery is rooting for a descendant of Secretariat, a
similarly colored and well-sized colt. She says ``it would be
wonderful'' if Charismatic on Saturday joins Secretariat and only
10 other equine gods in becoming a Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he's the same color and he has four white feet
instead of three,'' she says, comparing Charismatic and his
maternal great-grandfather. But she adds, ``He doesn't quite look
like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't strike me that he runs with the same force.
Secretariat dived with his head to get his hindquarters off the
ground. A.P. Indy had a running style like that, but I don't know
that Charismatic does.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Lukas, trainer of Charismatic, agrees: ``We're not talking
Secretariat here. I'm going to be optimistically guarded about our
chances in the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chenery feels Charismatic is unfairly downgraded for
being put up for sale in a couple of $62,500 claiming races.
</P>
<P>
   She argues: ``If Wayne had realized earlier _ and this is a
criticism he himself made _ that Charismatic was like Secretariat,
a horse that needs a lot of hard work, he would not have been a
claimer. That will forever tarnish his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he been recognized as having the Secretariat training
needs, he might be looking at a career with only a couple of
defeats _ and in greater races.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lewis, owner of Charismatic, raised no objection when Lukas
recommended entering the colt for a tag. ``I felt we needed to stop
the bleeding,'' Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   The two horsemen can be excused for discounting Charismatic's
breeding. Few of Secretariat's offspring distinguished themselves
on the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Chenery remembers how Secretariat in the 1980s was ``a dud in
the stud _ I heard that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent generations have vindicated the bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic pattern,'' she says, ``where a champion
stallion passes his genes through his daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Charismatic a great-grandson of Secretariat, the
colt is inbred to both the sire (Bold Ruler) and dam (Something
Royal) of Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roach, who along with former Houstonian Will Farish was a
co-breeder of Charismatic, says, ``He's probably got more
Secretariat in his bloodlines than any horse in America, without it
being dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach saw a trace of the equine immortal when Charismatic
charged through an outside lane on the far turn of Pimlico. He says
it was ``the best move I've ever seen in the Preakness other than
Secretariat's on the first turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Charismatic's Secretariat-loaded genes and
strong-closing style, Lukas is confident the Belmont's 1{ miles
will be no strain.
</P>
<P>
   Chenery remembers, however, the doubts surrounding her horse
even as he separated from the Belmont field. His sire, Bold Ruler,
had turned out tremendous speed in his children but limited
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know he would win it when he opened up in the far
turn,'' Chenery says. ``We were still thinking, `Bold Rulers can't
go a mile and a half.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her only regret is that she and trainer Lucien Laurin sometimes
failed to recognize Secretariat's peculiar needs: ``I feel his few
defeats were ours and not his. We didn't manage him consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Chenery now is reliving the Secretariat moment _
actually two minutes and 24 seconds, beating the Belmont track
record by two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Secretariat should have been called Charismatic,'' she
says, ``because he had such an attraction for people. After he went
to stud, he became even more popular. Claiborne Farms booked tours
so people could see him, even in the breeding season.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she believes there ever will be another horse as great
as her ``Big Red,'' Chenery says, ``I'll be disappointed when he's
supplanted, but I'm sure there will be another horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody suggests Charismatic is the one. But maybe he's close
enough to do what no horse has done since Affirmed in 1978: sweep
the Triple Crown.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PARIS _ Steffi Graf has changed her mind. Only recently, like just
a couple of weeks ago, Graf was of the opinion Wimbledon offered
the best opportunity for her to resume pursuing Margaret Court's
record for Grand Slam championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I think it's Paris,'' Graf said Thursday, relishing a
profoundly satisfying three-set victory over Monica Seles in a
wind-whipped, rain-delayed, nostalgia-laden French Open semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Graf thinks this because, after defeating her one-time nemesis
Seles 6-7 (7-2), 6-3, 6-4, she is one match away from a sixth
Roland Garros title and her 22nd in the Slams, which would leave
her two behind Court. A frustrating year that had her contemplating
retirement suddenly has turned promising. Nobody, Graf included,
could have predicted the remarkable French fortnight she has
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to play it down,'' she said of her lack of
self-confidence, brought on by a scarred, 29-year-old body that
keeps wanting to betray her. ``But deep down I didn't believe I
would be (in the final). There have been a lot of moments where I
haven't really been very happy about the way I was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I came here to get a few matches before Wimbledon,
not really thinking I'd be doing that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most severe test looms. Next up Saturday is Martina
Hingis, who has surpassed Graf as the top woman player in the
world. Hingis routed Graf's contemporary and last year's winner,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-3, 6-2 to serve notice she's ready to
complete a career Slam before the age of 19, a Steffi-sized feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she will be a little nervous,'' Hingis said of Graf,
who is competing in her first Slam final since reconstructive knee
surgery forced her into a yearlong sabbatical. Wrist surgery
followed last fall after a third-round Wimbledon flameout and a
fourth-round U.S. Open loss. She also recently has undergone a
minor foot operation.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's last triumph in a major came at Flushing Meadow in 1996.
But as for a nerves attack she suggests Hingis had best not hold
her breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously feel I don't have to prove anything,'' Graf said.
``For sure, I think that's going to work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 through last year, Graf or Seles won at Roland Garros
on all but four occasions, with three championships going to
Sanchez Vicario. In a battle befitting their stature as the two
most accomplished players of the decade, Graf and Seles made their
15th meeting one of the most memorable in the series (led by Graf
10-5) despite the nasty conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Graf chipped away at Seles with a mixed bag of old-fashioned
howitzer forehands, delicately sliced backhands and the occasional
drop shot. Seles answered with her usual barrage of grunt-driven
two-fisted blasts from the baseline, putting Graf in a 3-0 bind at
the outset and then holding on to take the tiebreaker convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But Seles' game is more sensitive to blustery conditions, and
she began to lose her edge as the wind gained strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never felt comfortable,'' she said. ``It was difficult.
I couldn't get my racket through quick enough, and I made way too
many errors because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf's crucial break at 4-all in the third came with her
returning into the face of the gale. Undaunted, she hammered back a
series of forehands with everything she had, and Seles, back on her
heels, blinked. Graf served out the match at love.
</P>
<P>
   ``After match point,'' she said, ``it was extreme joy for me.
It's a great, great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Which lasted only until the questions about the challenge Hingis
presents began. Graf admitted Hingis would be a load even if her
tired legs didn't feel so heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the final she said: ``I think that's looking too far ahead.
It's a great showing to just be able to play on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis is a huge hurdle, no question. Rarely has a defending
champion been given less of a shot going in than Sanchez Vicario
received against her. The cocky, clever Swiss miss had beaten the
27-year-old Spaniard nine times in 10 meetings, suggesting a
competitive imbalance that wouldn't be easily overcome no matter
how many French titles the latter had collected.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez Vicario never had been forced to go through Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sanchez Vicario's dogged retrieving still serves her
well against lesser players, Hingis' shot-making skills put more of
an onus on an opponent to play proactively, and such is not Sanchez
Vicario's counterpunching style. Ultimately, one must force
openings to thwart Hingis, and again she couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica played better today,'' Sanchez Vicario said. ``I had
chances, but I couldn't take advantage of enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The top seed and No. 1-ranked player prevailed in a perfunctory
first set, building a 5-0 lead after a drenching thunderstorm
pushed back the start of play. Then, breaking twice, Hingis blew
out to a 3-0 second-set bulge in just 10 minutes before suffering
another lapse in concentration, fooling Sanchez Vicario into
believing she might have a decent chance to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Losing her serve in the fourth game brought back Hingis' focus,
and she promptly closed out the match in short order. A punishing
inside-out forehand provided the felling blow, propelling her into
a second Roland Garros final in three years. Iva Majoli had
thwarted Hingis' bid for a Grand Slam here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Again Saturday, she faces a woman with vastly more experience on
Court Central and a far more impressive rsum. But the consequences
of same seem fairly inconsequential considering how Hingis is
playing after her lost year in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's either Steffi or Monica,'' she had said merrily,
``it doesn't matter. They both have won many times. I'd be happy to
win once. They can leave one for me, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably yes. But against Graf, she will have to earn it.

EL NINO HANGOVER BRINGS JUNE SNOW TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Record rainfall fell in Chatsworth. Santa Clarita
had hail. A funnel cloud hovered over San Pedro -- and snow fell on
mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days indeed for the first week of June in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are expected to warm up Saturday, with partly
cloudy skies and highs near 70, but not before another round of
drizzle Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have thunderstorms around _ there's no doubt
about it,'' said Gary Ryan, meteorologist with the National Weather
Service office in Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And commuters this morning could awaken to a closed Grapevine
through the Tehachapi Mountains, as temperatures dip to freezing.
Snow fell in Frazier Park on Thursday and could reach as low as
5,000 feet overnight, with accumulations of 3 to 6 inches possible
above 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very low for this time of the year,'' Ryan said. ``The
whole system is unusual and they never come this far south.''
</P>
<P>
   While Southern California shivered, on the other coast, Boston
was baking with a high of 84 degrees, compared with 66 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Common, Public Garden and Swan Boats were packed with
people soaking in weather more typical of late summer than late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person described it to me. They said, `How do you like
this August weather in June?','' said Bea Flammia, special events
director at Boston's historic Ritz-Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little warm and muggy, but we love it,'' she said. ``It
is a beautiful day to be out in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rain in June is odd enough, but measurable amounts are even more
rare. Rainfall was expected to range from a half-inch in the
foothills to a quarter-inch downtown late Thursday and into today.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.05 of an inch recorded in Chatsworth, at the city of Los
Angeles' northern reach, for the 24 hours ending at 5 p.m. Thursday
topped the record for a June 3, which was a trace in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Record rainfall for the date also was reported at:
</P>
<P>
   --Los Angeles International Airport, with 0.05 of an inch
compared with 0.02 in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   --Pasadena, with 0.23 of an inch compared with 0.08 in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   --Mount Wilson, with 0.38 of an inch compared with 0.04 in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   --Long Beach, with 0.02 compared with a trace in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   --UCLA, with 0.08 compared with 0.02 in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The wet roads made for dangerous driving. The Los Angeles Police
Department reported a fatal, single-car crash related to the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists attribute the unseasonable weather to the El Nino
hangover. The El Nino weather pattern that brought record rain in
1997-98 was followed by the cold and dry La Nina pattern over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect to go back to normal, but we're not back to
normal,'' said Bill Patzert, a satellite oceanographer at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. ``The climate system is really
still out of balance and so we're getting a lot of unexpected
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this much rain in June is really unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather system moving across the basin Thursday and into
today is a low pressure area dropping from the Gulf of Alaska that
contains unseasonably cold air.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said overnight lows were expected to drop near 50, which
compares with lows typically near 60 degrees. Today's highs should
reach into the upper 60s, which compares with highs typically in
the high 70s to lower 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain lows and forecast for snow left motel managers
wondering whether Caltrans might close the Golden State Freeway,
sending motorists in search of lodging. That's what happened in
April when the last unseasonably cold weather hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past time that it snowed, we had people sleeping in the
hallways and the lobby. We had people that didn't even know each
other sharing rooms,'' said Laura Mendiola, who helps run the
54-room Caravan Motor Inn in Gorman, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans officials said there were no planned closures, but snow
and ice can change the driving climate quickly on the Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually see this kind of stuff to start June off
with,'' said Sgt. Tim Kappen, night shift supervisor for the
California Highway Patrol's truck stop at Castaic.

TIMES MIRROR CEO STEPPING DOWN AS L.A. TIMES PUBLISHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. chief executive Mark H. Willes
stepped down Thursday as publisher of the Los Angeles Times after
20 controversy-filled months and named second-in-command Kathryn M.
Downing to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Willes was an executive at cereal maker General Mills when he
joined Times Mirror in 1995 and pledged to reinvent the newspaper
business. In naming Downing as publisher, he said the foundation
has been laid for significant gains in profits and revenues. ``The
time is right for me to step back and allow Kathryn to continue to
lead the revitalization of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, 57, remains Times Mirror chairman, chief executive
officer and president.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper world was surprised when Willes took the reins of
one of the nation's largest newspaper publishing companies in
mid-1995. Among his first moves was slashing 800 jobs at the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was delighted and Times Mirror's long-depressed
stock price rocketed upward. But Willes' promise to boost
circulation by 500,000 has been unfulfilled, and recently the
company's stock performance has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with reporters Thursday, Willes
acknowledged that many executives have departed during his reign
because of other opportunities and disagreements over strategy. But
he emphasized that he has become ``increasingly comfortable and
confident'' with the senior management team.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, 46, was named president and chief executive officer of
the Times 15 months ago. She joined Times Mirror as head of its
legal publishing arm in 1995.

IRREGULAR SETTINGS FOUND IN PLANE THAT CRASHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating new top of story) (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Devices to slow a plane's landing appear to have
been deployed irregularly as an American Airlines jet touched down
in Little Rock, Ark., on Tuesday before crashing, killing 9 people
on board, an air safety official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, George W. Black, the member of the National
Transportation Safety Board who is in charge at the scene, drew no
conclusions about what role the irregularities played in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the flight data recorder show that thrust
reversers, which make the engines brake the plane, were set up in
an unusual way in the last seconds of the jet's skid down the
runway, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight seconds before the end of the data, he said, the recorder
showed that the left thrust reverser was deployed but the right one
was not. Thrust reversers are usually used in tandem, to prevent
uneven forces that could make the plane turn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, the reversers had been opened and closed twice
moments before the crash. That would be unusual in a normal
landing.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, when one thrust reverser was deployed and the
other was not, the engines were near idle. Usually if the plane is
still moving fast, the engines are at higher power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that the only person who knows the answer to that
question is no longer with us,'' Black said of the captain, who was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said it was possible that one of the reversers was
damaged in the landing, but that asymmetric deployment of thrust
reversers can cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said that the spoilers, devices that pop up on the
tops of the wings to spoil lift and make sure the plane stays on
the ground, did not deploy on landing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, Black said that air traffic controllers had
given detailed weather information to the pilot of the jet before
and even while it crash-landed in high winds and rain at Little
Rock National Airport on Tuesday. But he did not say whether that
information should have led the pilot to abort the landing.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty were also injured in the fiery crash of the MD-80.
</P>
<P>
   Two wind-shear alerts had been issued before the crash, but
officials have yet to determine how major a factor the weather was
in the crash, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight touched down with plenty of room for a controlled
landing under normal conditions but slid right and then left before
plowing off the end of the runway at high speed, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Black praised the flow of information from the control tower to
the pilot about the wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they provided even more than they'd get at a busier
airport, because it appears they were getting periodic wind
vectors,'' he said of the descriptions of wind direction and speed.
``Actually, they continued to give wind vectors after the aircraft
had already crashed. They didn't know it had crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service tracked a powerful thunderstorm
approaching the runway from the northwest as the plane, Flight
1420, came in from the southwest. But thunderstorms are localized
phenomena, and Black took pains to note that the storm had not
reached the airport at the time of the crash. Safety board
investigators are trying to reconstruct weather conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As investigators here and in Arkansas examined evidence from the
plane, including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder, the Federal Aviation Administration began looking into
the characteristics of the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman, said that since the late 1980s
the agency had required 1,000-foot overrun areas at the ends of new
runways. The runway involved in the crash does not have one, and
the airport had evidently been given a waiver, but officials were
not immediately sure why.
</P>
<P>
   The airport authority, Ms. Spitaliere said, has been planning to
install an ``arrestor bed,'' a long pad of crushable concrete
designed to stop runaway planes, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420, with 145 people on board, was landing on Runway 4
Right, which at 7,200 feet is typical for a runway for big jets,
but is 1,073 feet shorter than Runway 4 Left.
</P>
<P>
   The two runways have the same equipment for handling instrument
landings, but only the right one has big steel light standards at
the end of the runway, which the American Airlines jet struck after
landing and losing control. The jet split open and burst into
flames after that impact.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were not certain which of the two men in the
cockpit was flying the plane, although they said they believe it
was the captain, Richard Buschmann, who was killed in the crash,
with communications being handled by the first officer, Michael
Origel. Origel was hospitalized and investigators hoped to talk to
him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the plane executed its approach is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   In general, pilots approaching runways in bad weather increase
speed, to counter the danger of shifting winds. A headwind that
suddenly reduces in speed, or turns into a tailwind, can cut a
plane's speed through the air to the point where the craft becomes
uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the air speed to compensate for the wind conditions
would also make the plane somewhat harder to stop on a slick
runway. Black said that investigators would measure the traction of
the runway where Flight 1420 landed, which is grooved for better
water drainage.
</P>
<P>
   When flying in a crosswind, as the airplane was doing, normal
procedure is to approach in a ``crab'' position, with the nose
pointed into the wind, which in this case would have been somewhat
to the left of the plane's course over the ground. If the plane
were pointed straight ahead, the wind would blow it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But to avoid landing sideways, according to pilots, just before
touchdown the crew would align the plane with the runway, dip the
left wing into a slight bank, and move the rudder slightly to the
right, to keep the plane moving straight over the ground. That
would make the left landing gear touch down first.
</P>
<P>
   A swept-wing jet like the one that crashed acts like a weather
vane, its nose seeking to point straight into the wind. The MD-80
is slightly longer than many other planes and shows that tendency
more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   A gust just before landing, or just after, could twist the
plane, experts said, although it is too soon to say that happened
in this case. If the plane were not pointed straight down the
runway when the crew engaged the thrust reversers, that, too, would
tend to twist its course.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's crash was the airport's second weather-related crash
in recent years. A 21-seat Gulfstream II jet crashed there in
January 1990, killing all seven people aboard. The safety board
attributed the crash to pilot errors and a faulty weather
instrument on the ground.

WHITSITT HAS TRAIL BLAZERS ON TITLE TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Paul Allen, billionaire owner of the Portland
Trail Blazers, usually sits courtside for home games at the Rose
Garden, near his team's bench and with a guest to his left.
</P>
<P>
   Often on his right is one of his best investments in the past
five years _ Bob Whitsitt, the team president and general manager
he got from the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are playing in the NBA Western Conference finals
Friday night in Portland largely because of Whitsitt. From the
coach to each name on the roster, he added every facet of this
team.
</P>
<P>
   And all it cost Allen to get him, besides Whitsitt's salary, was
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the mutual release agreement between Whitsitt and
the Sonics, any NBA team that signed him within 12 months of his
release owed the Sonics that sum.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Whitsitt joined Portland three weeks after leaving
Seattle, where he had been team president for eight years, and the
Blazers fullfilled the June 20, 1994 agreement by writing a total
of four $125,000 checks over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer obtained a copy of the previously
confidential agreement from a source close to the league.
</P>
<P>
   What seemed like a small sum at the time is paying big dividends
for the Blazers. They are playing for a trip to the NBA Finals for
the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances surrounding Whitsitt's departure from the
Sonics remain unclear. He says he was fired, although he did sign
the agreement and sent a memo to owner Barry Ackerley on May 25,
1994, asking for his release. The Sonics refuse to comment
officially but believe Whitsitt wanted to go to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt, 42, had offers from about six teams at the time he was
available. Vancouver and Portland made the strongest pitches.
Whitsitt said he chose the Blazers because of their tradition and
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mature operation with a great track record,'' Whitsitt
said. ``Plus, Paul genuinely wants to win a championship. And I'm
not just saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Portland, he has transformed the oldest team
in the NBA to the fourth-youngest, the deepest and most versatile
team in the league. The player who has been with the Blazers the
longest is center Arvydas Sabonis, who is in only his fourth
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't argue with success,'' backup point guard Greg
Anthony said. ``Bob knows what he is doing. He's aggressive and
that's how you have to be in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   A Blazer game is one of those rare occasions you will find
Whitsitt idle.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he spins the wheels on his car and in his head about
the same: Hard and fast.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitsitt is not physically transporting himself from Portland
to Seattle _ where he moonlights as president of the NFL's Seahawks
_ his mind is in motion on eyebrow-raising deals.
</P>
<P>
   What Whitsitt did was make 12 lively trades that eventually
yielded 11 players picked in the lottery without actually making
those draft choices himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes to be a little more aggressive and more of a
risk-taker can cost you your job. You may not go very far, but you
may keep your job,'' Whitsitt said. ``We've always taken the
position that we owe it to the fans to do everything we can
possibly do to make our team a good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   An easy workday is 12 hours. A tough day could be 16 to 18. He
seems to work seven days a week doing homework and legwork, acting
on his vision.
</P>
<P>
   A source of pride for Whitsitt is the Blazers are an
inexperienced group that seldom plays like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these players on (contending) teams are 33, 34, 35
years old when they get to this level,'' Whitsitt said, ``So it
gets pretty exciting to know that we're a good basketball team now
and we should could continue to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt had to grow on the Blazer faithful. After all, he came
from the hated Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have given them free money and they wouldn't like
me,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt also was the one who had to break up the veteran team
that made the 1992 Finals. That included trading All-Star Clyde
Drexler to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked to be traded,'' Whitsitt recalled. ``But even if a
guy asks to be traded, if he's popular fans aren't going to like it
... It seems like I'm always the guy who has to climb and build.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you did not know, scaling obstacles is Whitsitt's forte.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were a 31-win team when he arrived in Seattle.
Ackerley hired the then-30-year-old Whitsitt in 1986, making him
the youngest team president in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Under Whitsitt's watch with George Karl as his coach, they won
the franchise's second Pacific Division championship, played in the
Western Conference finals, posted astonishing regular-season
records and developed Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whitsitt's Sonics missed the playoffs in 1990. His
63-win team lost to Denver in the first round in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round debacle led to a strange series of events.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt, who was named Executive of the Year, was locked out of
his office less than a week after he requested his release in the
memo to Ackerley.
</P>
<P>
   The tumultuous and baffling period ended with Whitsitt's
departure before the NBA draft. That would have been the last time
Whitsitt legitmately drafted a lottery player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd had been there it would have turned into Eddie Jones
(10th overall pick), or worst case Jalen Rose (13th pick),'' said
Whitsitt, who watched the Sonics take Carlos Rogers with the 11th
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that if I had stayed in Seattle we
would have won a championship. We were pretty close to the top of
the mountain. ... Having said that, I'm very happy where I am and
our future looks pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Whitsitt has found his way near the top again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of the four teams standing do it the way we do it,''
Whitsitt said. ``Look at the depth of New York, the depth of
Indiana and the depth of Portland. The people that tell you what
you can't do are the people who aren't playing. If we're still
playing we must be doing something right.''

POOR MARKS IN CITIZENSHIP FOR UW, WSU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that there is hope for peace in Yugoslavia, it's
time to bring troops home where they're needed _ protecting the
communities surrounding our state's citadels of big-time college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have read that some football players from the
University of Washington and Washington State are in danger of
scoring poorly on the citizenship part of their report cards. This
is considered serious, because the category makes up one-third of
the overall score, along with penmanship and lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Poor report cards mean big trouble for football players. They
have to work harder to stay eligible, which can mean doubling the
number of girlfriends willing to write papers under the fellas'
names.
</P>
<P>
   Such a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a football player at Humungous State U., there's so
much to remember. There's the playbook, the weight-room records,
the booster handhake$, the andro supplements, the football-loving
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it, there is an expectation to remember right from
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, how much can be demanded of unpaid entertainers who
represent the last vestige of indentured servitude in America?
</P>
<P>
   What unfair burdens.
</P>
<P>
   So as these miscreant Huskies and Cougars think about putting on
the well-worn robes of victimhood, here's a helpful guide (clip and
save) to stick in the wallet next to the coach's phone credit card.
</P>
<P>
   1. Don't slug women. (Or men, unless it's Don King).
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't steal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't throw furniture through frat-house windows and clobber
persons within.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are a little complicated, for sure. And since nobody
other than their mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers,
aunts and uncles had mentioned these things to them in the last
week or so, the list is easy to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if just a handful of Cougars and Huskies had just known
these things, we could have kept our troops working over Belgrade
embassies and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Pending a summer-quarter class that will help the players
memorize these theorems, there is another option that can be
employed by coaches Rick Neuheisel and Mike Price to aid in
retention:
</P>
<P>
   Football suspension and denial of all athletic privileges.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to take credit for this novel suggestion, but Price
beat me to it. The Cougar coach Wednesday suspended wide receiver
and co-captain Nian Taylor, who allegedly blasted down an apartment
door in order to punch a woman in the chest. No word yet on whether
she refused to write a paper, but he was arrested and charged with
assault and malicious mischief.
</P>
<P>
   He also acted in a similar fashion with running back Kevin
Brown, wide receiver Jason White and defensive back Ramin White
after they were charged, in an unrelated episode, for stealing
$1,900 worth of electronic equipment from a Pullman apartment.
</P>
<P>
   If the players are found guilty, Price has promised to boot them
from the team, presumably including loss of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, however, is waiting. The Husky coach had several
players involved in a two-night fracas that resulted in $5,000
damage to a frat house near campus. Since none of the players have
been identified publicly and the issue is still under
investigation, no charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   But my guess is Neuheisel knows exactly what happened and who
was involved. His predecessors, Jim Lambright and Don James, knew
just about everything that went on. Some football players have a
way of making almost as many enemies as friends, and many of those
enemies are delighted to share their observations. Whether the
coaches cover up or deal honestly is a subject for another day.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan of due process, I'm a believer that the perpetrators
have a right to be heard. I also believe high school and college
athletic participation is a privilege, and it can be denied for
well-articulated team rules that are shy of legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarship revocation is a more serious matter, which requires
more due process than most athletic departments generally indulge.
Players are often so scared they don't challenge a revocation
despite what may be unfair claims.
</P>
<P>
   But most coaches are efficient in dragging the truth out of
their wayward charges. Besides, in these episodes, there were
multiple witnesses. Coaches rarely need more than a day to
determine whether a player is responsible for misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   A suspension based on a preponderance of evidence, particularly
if it cuts out meal, workout and tutorial privileges, makes a far
more persuasive statement than muddling around waiting for a court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the Huskies as individuals will pay back the frat for
damages is hardly a resolution. That's what they're supposed to do.
It's like wanting applause for driving down the right side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Too many players, drunk at minimum with a sense of entitlement,
need a fuller grasp of consequences than is provided in an order to
run extra sets of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they owe it to the large number of their
teammates who are solid citizens and students to avoid creating a
rich target for wise-guy columnists.

SISTER RECOUNTS VIOLENT ENCOUNTER DURING SLEEPWALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sister of accused killer Scott Falater testified Thursday
that he threw her across the room while sleepwalking more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned around and lifted me up and just tossed me through
the air,'' said Laura Healy, who said the incident began when she
brushed against her brother in an effort to stop him from leaving
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Healy added that her brother later had no memory of the event at
their Illinois home.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, a freelance medical editor, also testified that her
Internet research was the genesis of the legal defense that claims
Falater was sleepwalking in early 1997 when he killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother initially rejected her suggestion that he
was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 44 times in the back yard
of their Phoenix home, then hid the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, if you don't believe me, and you're not willing
to look at these articles, then what happened, Scott?' '' Healy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's parents also testified Thursday about several
instances when he had walked in his sleep as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who divorced when Falater was in high school,
described him as an introspective, mild-mannered boy who sometimes
wet the bed. They said he had once intervened to stop his alcoholic
father from choking his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Healy's testimony also countered Wednesday's startling
revelation by the prosecution of a potential witness who overheard
Falater, three weeks before his wife's death, discuss a Canadian
case in which a sleepwalking defense led to acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez hopes that that witness, likely to be
called to testify later in the trial, will help prove that Falater
committed premeditated murder of his wife of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Healy fondly recalled her brother as brainy and low-key, the one
most likely to break up fights among his four younger siblings. She
drew smiles from the jury when she described him as ``a nerd (who)
wore that plastic pocket protector'' in his shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Healy's testimony also countered Martinez's theory that her
brother's marriage had turned sour by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She described a Dec. 27 trip to Sedona for a Jeep tour with
Scott and Yarmila Falater and their two children, Megan and
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Healy read to the jury an e-mail she received from Falater after
the trip. In it, he expressed affection for his wife, whom he would
kill about three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan is always ragging on Yarm and me because she claims
we're always making out in front of her. . . . We have more fun
kissing in front of her just to tease her,'' Falater wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor is seeking to undermine the credibility of more
than a dozen defense witnesses who have described Falater as a
loving husband, dedicated father, faithful Mormon and respected
engineer at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session in Maricopa County Superior Court is scheduled
to begin with testimony from a witness who originally testified for
the defense but later contacted the prosecution with potentially
damaging information about Falater.
</P>
<P>
   With the jury out of the courtroom, Motorola colleague Randy
Keadle is expected to tell Judge Ronald Reinstein about information
he received that Falater may have once dragged his daughter up some
steps by her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has indicated in court that Keadle also may talk about
another Motorola worker, who allegedly overheard Falater talk about
the Canada sleepwalking case.
</P>
<P>
   That third Motorola worker is secretary Debbie James, already a
witness for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein said he will announce Friday whether he will permit
testimony from Ann Walker, a former neighbor of the Falaters and a
nurse practitioner who allegedly provided Yarmila Falater with
information about a venereal disease. Martinez said Walker will
testify that she told Yarmila that Scott had been ``mess ing
around.'' &QL;

TACOMA YOUTH PASTOR CHARGED IN MOLESTATION OF BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ The youth pastor at one of Tacoma's largest
churches was charged with eight counts of rape and child
molestation Thursday for what police say was part of a
four-year-long series of sexual assaults on at least 17 children _
most of them members of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Herman Glenn of Bethel Christian Assembly Church
pressured the 13- to 15-year-old boys into having sex with him by
convincing them he had an evil alter ego he couldn't get rid of
without their sexual favors, prosecutors said in papers filed in
Pierce County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 34 and youth pastor at the 2,000-member church since
1991, made up an elaborate video-style game with codes and
passwords to ensnare the youths in the sexual activity, police and
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   He led them to believe the sexual activity occurred while he was
sleepwalking, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of mind control was involved in it,'' said Pierce County
Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bethel Christian Assembly Executive Pastor Julie Jenkins said
Thursday the church had no warning there was any problem with
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   But court and police documents indicate that in 1993, two years
after Glenn's arrival in Tacoma, the church received a telephone
call from a Chicago-area church where Glenn had previously worked
warning that allegations of inappropriate touching had been made
against Glenn by two young boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Tacoma church sent Glenn to a counselor, who dismissed the
incident as ``experimenting'' by a young person, court documents
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins would not reveal the name of the Chicago-area church.
</P>
<P>
   None of the alleged sexual assaults took place in the church,
Troyer said. They occurred at Glenn's apartment in University Place
and at other locations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bethel Christian Assembly learned of the activity Tuesday
afternoon after a church elder became suspicious and confronted
Glenn at a revival service. The youth pastor confessed to raping or
molesting 17 children and resigned his church post, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn then wrote letters of apology to church officials and his
victims, telling the teenagers they weren't responsible for the
sexual activity and he hoped they could forgive him, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prayer is that the Christ of heaven will bring complete
healing to your heart and life and that you will not allow my sin
to be a lasting destruction to your walk with Jesus Christ,'' he
said in his letter to the
</P>
<P>
   youths.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials immediately notified the sheriff's department,
touching off a round-the-clock investigation that led to filing of
the eight charges Thursday after-
</P>
<P>
   noon. Glenn was charged with six counts of third-degree rape,
one count of second-degree rape and one count of child molestation
resulting from alleged sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who is being held in the Pierce County Jail in lieu of
$75,000 bail, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on the criminal
charges that carry a potential penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told Pierce County Superior Court Judge Sergio
Armijo that the eight charges involved only two of the victims and
more charges are likely to be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Police and church officials said none of the children _ some of
whom are now adults _ ever accused Glenn of sexually assaulting
them.
</P>
<P>
   Police praised church officials for contacting them about the
matter immediately after learning of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has been fully cooperative and very timely in
this,'' said Troyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked and devastated by this, and all of our energy
is focused on assisting those who have suffered,'' Jenkins said,
adding that the church is offering counseling to the victims of the
alleged assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the report of the local counselor to which Glenn was
sent and the lack of criminal charges filed against him in
Illinois, Bethel Christian Assembly kept Glenn on as its youth
pastor, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Like all church personnel, he was supposed to follow a church
policy that requires two adults be present any time young people
visit the homes of church staffers. Police and prosecutors say
Glenn ignored that policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bethel Christian Assembly, which is slated to move into a new
$10 million building in Parkland this fall, is the second Puget
Sound-area church to be rocked by a sex scandal during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, elders of Overlake Christian Church in Redmond,
Wash., said they have testimony that supports allegations of sexual
misconduct against the Rev. Bob Moorehead, who resigned last year
from Washington's largest congregation amid a cloud of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the elders dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct
against Moorehead by 17 men. They said the incidents weren't
substantiated by eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But now elders say they have received supportive testimony since
Moorehead stepped down last June and they have concluded Moorehead
violated the scriptural standards of trust, self-control, purity
and Godly character required for the office of elder and pastor at
Overlake.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges were filed against Moorehead for the alleged
violations in King County.
</P>
<P>
   Moorehead came under scrutiny starting in late 1997 when it was
learned he had been charged with masturbating in a public restroom
in Daytona Beach, Fla., in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped under controversial circumstances, but
disclosure of his arrest prompted several men to allege that
Moorehead sexually molested them during adult baptism and wedding
ceremonies in the 1970s.

MCCAIN CAMPAIGN VIDEO HAS SOME FOOTAGE THAT ISN'T REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Viewers of John McCain's presidential campaign
video, which shows spectacular Vietnam War footage of the former
POW, may be surprised to learn that some of the most dramatic
scenes aren't the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   When the video was released this week, it appeared the producers
had uncovered amazing archival film of McCain, now an Arizona
senator, parachuting to Earth after his plane was shot down on a
bombing run over Hanoi during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out the parachuting man depicted in grainy
black-and-white is not McCain at all, but stock Defense Department
footage of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   And a clip of an ``angry mob'' seen ready to grab the
unconscious McCain is actually a generic group shot of some
Vietnamese people, not really the hostile bunch that confronted the
fallen Navy pilot after he landed in a lake, a McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other liberties taken in the nine-minute video
biography, titled ``The Character to Do What's Right. The Courage
to Fight for It.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they are not told, viewers will have little way of knowing
that some scenes are genuinely part of McCain's story _ a part of
American history, really _ while others are representations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said that they never intended to deceive anyone and
that it is common to use representations in such videos if the
story itself is true.
</P>
<P>
   The look-alike scenes, some of them quite heroic, are
interspersed with the others and often appear in the same jerky,
black-and-white footage as the real McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   The tape dramatically tells the story of how McCain, on a
bombing mission, ejected from his plane and was captured, beaten
and imprisoned from October 1967 until March 1973. McCain sent
50,000 copies of the video biography this week to likely voters in
New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The actual McCain clips in the video are dazzling. Some were
obtained from the Vietnamese government and helped to fill in gaps
in the history of the war and to illustrate the experience of
McCain, regarded by many as a U.S. hero.
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes seem very real, but are not.
</P>
<P>
   During the parachute sequence, for example, the voice-over
declares, ``McCain ejected as his plane spiraled violently to
earth. The force of the ejection knocked him unconscious. Both of
his arms and one leg were broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The video seems to perfectly match the narrative by showing a
grainy, unrecognizable figure who appears to be unconscious falling
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   There's no indication that it's not a shot of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The voice-over then declares that an ``angry mob'' formed on the
ground that was ``seeking retribution for the rain of bombs.
Dragging (McCain) from the lake, they broke his shoulder with a
rifle butt and bayoneted him repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   A mob is seen forming, but, ``I don't think that's the mob that
approached McCain,'' said Mark Salter, McCain's chief of staff. ``I
think that's just a Vietnamese mob.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, the narrator refers to the ``infamous Hanoi
Hilton'' where McCain spent most of his captivity. In fact, the
video shows a clip of another prison where McCain was first held
that Americans had nicknamed ``The Plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually know what prison that is (in the video) because
I've been there,'' Salter said. ``It's the first prison John was
held in. It's not the Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no attempt to mislead anyone, said Greg Stevens, whose
Virginia-based media firm produced the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a representation of what happened,'' he said. ``I
don't know any footage that exists showing John McCain parachuting
from the plane. We have to put something up there that represents
what's going on. I've probably done 30 or 40 of these (videos) and
it's very common.''
</P>
<P>
   While most newspapers will inform readers if representations are
used to depict people or events, the standard is different for
videos and often for television, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the words reflect the truth and do the pictures illustrate
the words? We're absolutely on target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The video producers said they enjoyed making the video because
they consider McCain a hero.
</P>
<P>
   More than other presidential candidates, McCain is relying on
his personal story, particularly the war years, to support his
campaign theme that he has the courage to be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The video also features a clip of a dazed McCain lying on his
back and being interviewed by a French film crew after he was
captured.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a shot of the Hanoi sky and landscape as McCain
and the other Americans were over a power plant on his ill-fated
bombing run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at that very closely, you'll see a little fireball
up in the top right hand corner, and that is his (McCain's) plane.
All the smoke and stuff is the power plant they were bombing,''
Salter said. The photo was taken by another pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at anything on TV, for example, and even in news
reports there are demonstrations and depictions,'' said Howard
Opinsky, McCain's campaign spokesman. ``When you're telling the
whole story, you don't want to be limited to just what you have
footage of.'' &QL;

RULINGS, NEW HEARINGS ARE FAVORING WENATCHEE DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As Washinton state's high courts continue to untangle
questions of injustice surrounding the Wenatchee child
sex-investigations, Doris Green, a 36-year-old mother of four
imprisoned since 1994, has won the right to a new hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals in Spokane has ordered a rare
investigative hearing to look into and gather evidence in Green's
case, echoing its calls for similar hearings in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling follows last month's rejection by the state Supreme
Court of prosecutors' arguments against holding the same kind of
hearing for Manuel Hidalgo-Rodriguez, who won the right to the
evidence-gathering procedure in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chelan County prosecutors, meanwhile, have told Henry
Cunningham, 50, whose 47-year conviction was overturned by the
appeals court in February, they will not try to send him back to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Green, Hidalgo and Cunningham were Wenatchee residents accused
of child sex-abuse during a sweeping _ and since discredited _
series of investigations in the Wenatchee area in the mid-1990s. A
total of 43 people were arrested, accused of nearly 30,000
instances of sexual abuse involving 60 children.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation of questionable
actions by local police, prosecutors, state social workers and
others in Wenatchee was published in early 1998, when 17 defendants
remained in prison. Since then, six defendants have been freed by
higher courts.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a 37-year-old mother of four, is serving a 23-year prison
term imposed in 1994 on child rape and molestation charges
involving children of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The court, responding to her appeal, ordered the yet-to-be
scheduled fact-finding session known as a reference hearing.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Whitman County Superior Court Judge Wallis Friel
will examine several issues raised by Green's lawyer, Suzanne Lee
Elliott. These include whether former Wenatchee Police Detective
Bob Perez used improper and coercive techniques to prompt Green's
confession. Perez and state Child Protective Services investigators
have been criticized for failing to keep records of their
interviews with accusers and the accused.
</P>
<P>
   The high court wants Friel to determine if Perez used
inappropriate techniques to obtain accusations of abuse from two
children in Green's case.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also documented a variety of other apparent
improprieties, including conflicts of interest involving Perez and
judges and lawyers connected with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Chelan County Prosecutor Gary Riesen said he is ``perplexed''
about the legal basis for Green's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to hang on the belief that Detective Perez coerced
the confession from her, but that's not what was proven in her
trial. Nor have the children who testified against her recanted
their accusations,'' he said. ``But we'll hold the hearing and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott disagreed. She said the question is not whether children
recanted, but whether statements they made were planted or
suggested by Perez, who worked closely with CPS investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant decision that goes right to the heart of
the case. The actions of Detective Perez and his coercive
techniques in getting accusations and confessions,'' Elliott said.
``This has the potential be a house of cards for the rest of the
Wenatchee group in prison ... what will it take to get the state to
accept that something was very wrong with all the cases?''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cunningham was freed from prison in February after Riesen
asked the state Court of Appeals to free Cunningham pending a
decision on whether he would be tried again. In 1994 Cunningham was
sentenced to 47 years on 23 counts of raping and molesting three of
his four daughters. In a scathing review of the case, an appellate
court said his court-appointed lawyer was so bad that he did not
receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's appeal, written by a team of lawyers that has taken
on the Wenatchee cases as the Innocence Project Northwest, said
Cunningham's lawyer urged him to plead guilty while failing to seek
witnesses to corroborate his client's alibi. Riesen said he won't
challenge the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much time has gone by since the incident. The children, the
victims, are now grown and have their own lives and their own
families,'' Riesen said. ``I don't know if it's in anyone's best
interest, including the community, to go through another trial.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, Friel will begin taking testimony and evaluating
evidence in the case against Hidalgo, a 36-year-old fruit picker
who was charged in 1995 with two counts of first-degree child rape
and two counts of child molestation. He was convicted of one count
of sexually touching a child and was sentenced to 5{ years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer earlier this year reported that one of
the girls has admitted she and her sister lied when they accused
Hidalgo, and that medical evidence used to convict Hidalgo was
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle lawyer Robert Van Siclen, who with New York appeals
specialist Robert Rosenthal last year took on Hidalgo's appeal,
said the upcoming hearing will highlight errors common in all of
the Wenatche cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these cases are tied together, all are cross
contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Siclen and Elliott are among the 60 lawyers, law professors
and students volunteering their time and services to the Innocence
Project Northwest.

TIP FROM SCHOOL GUARD MAY HAVE PREVENTED ANOTHER SCHOOL TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A school guard's tip about a series of drive-by
shootings led police to the home of an Auburn, Wash., teen
Wednesday night. What they found inside his bedroom was more
chilling than the crimes that brought them there.
</P>
<P>
   Pasted on the wall above the 18-year-old suspect's bed were a
handful of newspaper headlines about the teen killers and death
toll from the Littleton, Colo., school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we averted another school shooting,'' Black Diamond
police Detective Chris Hurst said. ``If this person wasn't
predisposed in that direction, I don't know who is.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenager, who is expected to be charged Monday, has a
juvenile criminal record for fourth-degree assault in 1997. He was
booked into the Kent Regional Justice Center early Thursday morning
on suspicion of felony second-degree assault for allegedly firing a
.17-caliber pellet rifle at pedestrians and bicyclists from a
moving car.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency doctors told police one of the victims might have died
had the pellet struck a major artery just centimeters from his
wound.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary court appearance is scheduled for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The tip that led authorities to the suspect came Wednesday from
a security officer at a Kent high school. Students there told the
guard the suspect, who attends an alternative high school in
Auburn, was behaving strangely. When they suggested the teen was
involved in the drive-by shootings, the guard called police.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the youth's home last night went unanswered, but Hurst
said the suspect's parents ``were pretty shocked'' when they
learned that police were investigating his role in a pair of
drive-by shootings on March 31 and April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the shootings occurred just before 6 p.m. when an
off-duty firefighter was struck while bicycling near the Lake
Sawyer area of Black Diamond. Witnesses said the shots were fired
by a passenger in a pickup truck and struck the man once in the
hip.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, a real estate agent was strolling with his wife and
young daughter just after 5 p.m. when he was shot in the groin by a
passenger in a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, police learned of a third shooting in unincorporated
King County that occurred on the same road about an hour after the
real estate agent was shot. That victim was struck in the hand
while standing outside a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were picked at random, just for the purpose of seeing
what it would be like to shoot someone,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Although different vehicles were used in the assaults, police
suspected early on that the drive-by shootings were related because
slugs recovered from two of the victims were of the same small
caliber and displayed similar markings.
</P>
<P>
   They appear to match the 17-caliber pellet rifle found in the
suspect's bedroom along with a sniper's scope, a few violent
videotapes and the disturbing newspaper clippings.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ The natives, of course, do not refer to their Grand Slam
tennis tournament as the French Open. Non, mon dieu! It is Roland
Garros, s'il vous plat.
</P>
<P>
   In case you might have forgotten _ not that Bud Collins would
ever let you _ M. Garros was an ordinary, undecorated, barely known
aviator who perished just days before World War I ended. But the
members of his sporting club, unaffected by the fact he apparently
didn't even play tennis, chose to honor his memory by naming their
grounds after him.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they also decided to turn the facility over to
France's tennis association to use as the site of its annual
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain everything. It pays to be obscure, the more
obscure the better, around here. La diffrence est normal. Among the
men pros, if not necessarily the women, nothing levels the deck
quite like the lovely red clay.
</P>
<P>
   Libert, galit, fraternit indeed. By any name, the French Open
has become exactly that in the closing decade of the 20th century.
Wider than wide-open. Gaping-chasm open. A tournament for the
huddled masses, yearning to be free.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, wrong country metaphor there. Excusez-moi.
</P>
<P>
   As a 66th-ranked nobody, Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten blasted
through the field unscathed two years ago. As the favorite, if not
the top seed, following victories on clay in Rome and Monte Carlo
this spring, Kuerten got samba-ed out on his ear in the quarters,
beaten soundly in straight sets by the previously slumping
Ukrainian, Andrei Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
   Before Roland Garros, Medvedev hadn't won two matches in a row
since October.
</P>
<P>
   Need a new no-name Brazilian to cheer? Say hello to 54th-ranked
Fernando Meligeni, a flaky free spirit whose abject anonymity might
be his greatest asset as he closes in on the Slam that least lends
itself to handicapping.
</P>
<P>
   Of the final four hommes, only Andre Agassi is famous, and only
Agassi was seeded coming in _ a so-what 13th, which has been a
lucky number for him. He has been a finalist twice, but it was a
long time ago, back when he had hair.
</P>
<P>
   Should Agassi prevail, he would join countryman Jim Courier and
Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov as just the third champion of Roland
Garros over a bizarre 10-year span who has won as many as one of
the other four majors. The terre battue has turned into a cimetire
for the most famous and celebrated players of the day, Pete Sampras
toweringly conspicuous among them.
</P>
<P>
   Figures. You have to be starving to win on this dirt. You can't
rest on your big-serve assets. You must bow your back, suck in your
gut, set your jaw and harden your resolve, then be willing to
expend hour after grimy, thankless hour hacking your way through a
thicket of gritty Spaniards and robotic Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   It's grubby, nasty work, tennis for the proletariat, not the
haute bourgeoisie who occupy most of the seats in the stands. The
Metro strike paralyzing Paris has had a minuscule impact on
attendance at Roland Garros. This crowd, believe me, does not deign
to travel by public conveyance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players do, though. If Meligeni, 28, who hadn't
survived a fourth round in any of his previous Slam appearances,
has been in a limo, it's because the nouveau-riche Kuerten gave him
a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando is the modern French Open, right down to his clay-caked
socks, stringy hair and cap, which he wears backward.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang, only 17 and hence too naive to know any better,
launched the procession of upstart winners in 1989. Champions since
have included Courier, the prototypical lunch-pail-lugging type;
Spain's one-trick pony, Sergi Bruguera; and Kafelnikov, who as the
world's No. 1 player didn't make it through the second round last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity doesn't pay in Paris, unless you are trying to shop
on the Rue Fauborg-St. Honore.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Agassi takes on the vowel-challenged Slovak, Dominik
Hrbaty; Medvedev and Meligeni scuffle in the ``who's-he?'' semi.
Should Hrbaty and Meligeni _ or, for that matter, Medvedev _
advance, NBC might fall on its sword and pull the plug on the
weekend telecast. You could count the U.S. television audience on
one hand and not need your thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers-Spurs would look like Celtics-Lakers to the network
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Agassi can save the show by his lonesome as he pursues the
completion of a career Grand Slam, something no man has
accomplished in 30 years. Andre's resurrection as a contender is a
lifesaver for the ATP Tour, such a dreary place these days that
Kafelnikov clings to his top ranking despite having won two matches
in eight tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a Y2K bug. That computer needs chucking, not a
tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, nothing can be done to it to create a reliable form
chart for the annual French crapshoot. They should pick the seeds
here out of a chapeau. The result couldn't be less reliable.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ So much for the grieving.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things in New York evaporate faster than yesterday's
tragedies, so the fact Patrick Ewing will miss the rest of the 1999
NBA playoffs was suitably chewed over and subsequently swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's practice for the Knicks meant it was time to move on,
especially because the Eastern Conference finals continue Saturday
at Madison Square Garden, leaving precious little time for
hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   Especially because the Knicks are trying to earn a trip to the
NBA Finals. With that in mind, Ewing addressed his teammates before
Thursday's practice at Purchase College, hoping to get them focused
on the quest for an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel that we have an opportunity to win it,'' Ewing
said. ``I'd love to be a part of it. I mean, I'd love to be healthy
and be a part of it. I want to be on the floor to help the team
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be on the sidelines cheering them on _
patting them on the back, cursing 'em out _ doing whatever I have
to do to help them win. I'm human, I want to be out there
performing. But I'm not going to be able to. I just have to do the
next best thing. I feel very confident in my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that before practice started that I believe in
them, for them to go out and get me my ring.''
</P>
<P>
   As in NBA championship ring, something for which Ewing has been
striving throughout his 14-year NBA career. Ewing led the Knicks to
the 1994 NBA Finals, but they lost to Hakeem Olajuwon and the
Rockets in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to try to get a ring anyway,'' said Allan
Houston of the team's reaction to Ewing's talk. ``It's not like now
we're really going to try. We're here for a reason, we've done some
things to get to this point. If we do get that ring, it will be
that much more special because of this injury, this adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk fired up Ewing's teammates, who appear to have a new
sense of purpose about their best-of-seven series with the Pacers,
which is tied 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play, I'm juiced up,'' said backup power forward
Marcus Camby, who figures to get a lot more playing time. ``I wish
we were playing today. The mood was great, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew about (Ewing's) situation yesterday, so we knew
coming in we had to work harder today. It won't be easy losing our
captain, our go-to guy. But somehow we have to find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy must instead wring a few
victories out of his suddenly depleted talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find some answers,'' Van Gundy said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for those answers began Thursday, when the Knicks went
through their first practice minus Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good atmosphere,'' Houston of Thursday's practice.
``Everyone when they first found out was a little overwhelmed _ it
takes you aback. We feel terrible for Patrick, but we don't have a
lot of time right now to let our emotions carry over to the court.
We have to get ready for Indiana right now. Practice was great. One
of the best we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission won't be as difficult as it seems because the Knicks
had begun to retool the offense that had been de-emphasizing Ewing
anwyay. With Houston, Camby Latrell Sprewell and Chris Childs more
comfortable in the running game, the Knicks have put pressure on
the Pacers in Games 1 and 2 by fast-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll run more if we get the (defensive) stops,''
Sprewell said. ``We didn't do a good job of getting stops and
rebounding last time. We have to do a better job of getting stops.
Can't run without the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone knows I like to run. That's the way I play.
It's ingrained in my brain. So any time I have an opportunity to
go, I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers seem to have done better with Ewing on the floor,
outscoring the Knicks by six points in Game 1 (86-80) and by 19 in
Game 2 (57-38) while Ewing hobbled about the court.
</P>
<P>
   In Chris Dudley, the Knicks have a defense-minded center who can
at least put a body on Indiana's 7-4 Rik Smits and force him out of
the post. But Dudley doesn't want to be called Ewing's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm supposed to be the man, but I'll cover
Smits, and do whatever,'' Dudley said. ``I'm going to do the same
things I do when I come off the bench. The shots will just go
different places. But we've been playing kind of that way anyway,
so it's more of the same, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the same, as in things are never easy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been like that around here,'' Houston said. ``This
is just an exclamation point.''

NEWS OF PEACE DEAL COMPOUNDS THE UNCERTAINTY FOR REFUGEE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After escaping from the terror in their Yugoslavian
homeland for placid Mercer Island, a refugee family from Pristina,
Kosovo, viewed Thursday's news of a proposed peace accord and
wondered what next?
</P>
<P>
   So what if the war ends back home, Shkelzen Syla was asked?
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old looked to his father for an answer, but one did
not come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is peace, we go back,'' the father said, his son
translating. ``But only if NATO is there. We are still afraid of
the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sylas _ Shkelzen and his sister, Mirjeta, 14; their father,
Shaquir, 57, a firefighter; and Habibe, 51, their mother _ arrived
in Seattle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying them were Shaquir's brother, Hasan, his wife,
Hasime, and their only child, 12-year-old Remzie.
</P>
<P>
   They are ethnic Albanians, the targets of ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo by Serb forces, led by Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for either family to ignore the news of Belgrade's
capitulation to NATO's demands even as they moved into apartments
and began to sort out a new life in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   How long might they stay was anyone's guess, they said. But
again, there was a long pause before the answer came from the
father through his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am old. She is old,'' Shaquir Syla said, pointing to his
wife. ``We don't matter. But if they want to stay,'' he said,
gesturing toward his children, ``it will be all right with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shkelzen wore a wide grin, enough to communicate the relief he
and his family feel now that they have a place to live in Mercer
Island's Shorewood apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   As Shkelzen told of the families' flight to America, he spoke in
English he learned at school and by watching American action
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Sylas _ mother, father, son _ sat in straight-back
chairs around a table in the apartment's dining area while Mirjeta
lounged on the couch. A small color TV rumbled in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The memories of their last few hours in Pristina won't soon
fade, especially the sight of a burned man lying dead in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will they forget their neighbors, Serbs, who marched them at
gun point to the train station, on their way to a camp in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   What other possible horrors awaited them had they lingered have
been documented since Milosevic launched his ``ethnic cleansing''
policies.
</P>
<P>
   As the International Rescue Committee's Seattle office helped
the two Syla families settle on Mercer Island, other Seattle-area
refugee agencies were girding for the arrival of as many as 300 to
500 more Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Most will arrive as the Sylas did, from a processing camp at
Fort Dix, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to their
placements with various relief agencies, said Bob Johnson, the
International Rescue Committee's director in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian effort is unfolding on the fly, he said,
holding up a cryptic fax he received, which noted , ``26 and 27 . .
. deletion.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, Johnson said, means that two people listed on an
airline manifest list would not be arriving as expected. Johnson
helped secure the Syla families at Shorewood, where they will be
allowed to stay for 90 days, rent-free.
</P>
<P>
   Shorewood spokeswoman Debbie Hanan said her experience helping
house Bosnian, Somali and Iragi refugees helped paved the way for
the latest relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Not as lucky so far is Cincy Koser, refugee resettlement
director of Catholic Emergency Services in Seattle. Koser said
Thursday her agency has been dealt two families of eight people
each, and doesn't yet know where to put them.
</P>
<P>
   `We've been told to stand by and to expect just 48-hours
notice,'' Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to walk by the fax machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Koser said she has had offers to house one or two people, ``but
not a family of eight. Since we'd like to keep them together, we're
in a bit of a panic right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising real estate prices have driven up rents. A home big
enough for a large family would cost about $1,500 a month range.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we desperately need is something for $500 to $600,'' she
said. ``And a van. We need a van for that many people. We don't
have one.''

SOURCES: RAMBIS WILL RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Nothing is signed yet, but the Lakers are prepared
to hand Kurt Rambis the reins of the team for at least one more
season _ this time a real, 82-game season, not a lockout-marred,
soap-opera whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources close to the team, Lakers management wants
to retain Rambis and will offer him either a two-year deal or one
year with a team option for a second.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' reappointment is awaiting only final approval from team
owner Jerry Buss, who is known for taking his time on major
decisions. And with Rambis and his staff under contract through the
end of the month, the Lakers feel no urgency to make the deal
official.

<P>
   An announcement is not expected until at least June 14, after
the annual pre-draft camp in Chicago next week. Rambis will be
attending the camp with executive vice president Jerry West and
general manager Mitch Kupchak. The draft is June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have declined comment on other reports regarding
Rambis, and West reiterated that the team continues to mull
coaching options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still discussing it. Obviously we'd like to get it done
as soon as possible,'' he said, dismissing reports that Rambis will
be retained as ``more speculation than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' agent, Lon Rosen, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some team observers said Buss is delaying a decision in case a
more intriguing candidate emerges. But the obvious candidates are
unlikely to get much consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have long shied away from high-profile coaches with
large salary demands, which would rule out former Bulls coach Phil
Jackson and retired Magic coach Chuck Daly, who both command in
excess of $5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris, who coached the team for four-plus seasons before he
was fired in February, earned less than $1.5 million in his final
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also have a long tradition of promoting from within,
and the 41-year-old Rambis has been with the team as a player and
coach for a combined 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Rambis removed himself from consideration for head
coaching jobs with the Clippers and Sacramento Kings, preferring to
remain an assistant under Harris for a fifth season. He was
rewarded for his loyalty when Harris was dismissed after a 6-6
start.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was named interim coach Feb. 26 and guided the Lakers to
a 24-13 record in the regular season and a 3-1 first-round playoff
series win over the Houston Rockets. But the Lakers' season ended
with a disappointing sweep at the hands of the San Antonio Spurs, a
series in which Rambis' coaching was criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in light of all the Lakers had to endure this season _ the
firing of Harris, the trade of Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell for
Glen Rice, the Dennis Rodman experiment _ management felt it would
be hasty to give up on the promising Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't evaluate him fairly,'' West acknowledged
after the Spurs series. ``He was put in a most awkward position.
The on-the-job training is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has called the past season a learning experience and
admitted to making some mistakes but said he hoped to prove himself
in a full season, starting with a complete roster and a training
camp.

EARTH MAY BE IN NEW ICE AGE, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  If you think this spring is colder and wetter than any you've
ever endured, just imagine what it's been like around the world for
the past half-million years or so.
<P>
   Drilling a hole straight down through more than two miles of ice
in Antarctica, scientists from Russia, America and France have
found evidence from their drill cores that four long and bitter ice
ages must have frozen vast portions of planet Earth and lasted as
long as 100,000 years at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the global warming trend of recent years, a new ice
age may have begun only 18,000 years ago, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   But during the intervals between all those ice ages, the Earth
was much warmer. Even in the big deep freezes of long ago, the same
``greenhouse gases'' produced by modern industry probably polluted
the ancient atmosphere naturally and helped speed the warming
process, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty researchers have been involved in the drilling project at
Russia's Vostok Station in East Antarctica for nearly 20 years. In
a report published Thursday, they described what the ice cores have
revealed about Earth's climate over the past 420,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica, of course, is always cold, and the Vostok research
facility stands at the coldest part of the continent, where the
average year-round temperature is 67 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Over hundreds of thousands of years, however, the atmosphere has
carried trace amounts of gases that settle to the ground year after
year. In Antarctica, every snowfall traps those gases in tiny
bubbles of ice to form a continuous, permanent record of the
climate, the local temperature, the rate of snowfall and even the
strength of the winds.
</P>
<P>
   The gases include carbon dioxide and methane, which are major
components of today's rising levels of industrial pollutants that
scientists blame for the increasing rate of global warming during
the past century. One of the rarer isotopes of oxygen in the ice
bubbles provides clues to changes in the world's ice volume and
precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the journal Nature, the Vostok team said the past
420,000 years have been marked by ice ages that began about 335,000
years ago, 245,000 years ago, 135,000 years ago and 18,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   By that calculation _ and if the 100,000-year intervals between
ice ages are continuing _ then despite the past 100 years of
continued warming, the Earth is heading into another ice age even
now.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Still Just a Theory
</P>
<P>
   According to J.R. Petit, the French lead author of the Vostok
team's report, several factors have played a role in the world's
climate changes from icy cold to relative warmth. These include
subtle shifts in the Earth's orbit that bring it alternately closer
and farther from the sun; changes in the sun's own heat output; and
periodic changes in the levels of ``greenhouse gases'' that can be
emitted by decaying plankton in the oceans and other plants on
land.
</P>
<P>
   But the exact causes of the regular cycles of cold and warmth
over the millennia are in dispute, according to Bernhard Stauffer,
a climate physicist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who
commented on the Vostok team's report in a separate Nature article.
</P>
<P>
   To Stauffer, the most likely explanation for the end of each ice
age would begin with a subtle change in the Earth's orbit, then an
increase in greenhouse gases that decaying plants produce as a
result of the warming, and finally even more warming as the
continent-sized huge ice sheets shrink and the bare earth is
exposed to absorb the sun's heat.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is still theory, however, noted Frank Carsey of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, who leads an
international team planning to look for signs of life in the lake
that lies beneath the bottom of the Vostok drill hole.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that greenhouse gases are a major influence in the
cycles of past ice ages is ``surprisingly strong,'' and it's quite
likely that changes in the Earth's orbit can ``kick-start the
process,'' he said in an interview. But building an entire theory
that explains just how ice ages start and end ``still takes a
certain amount of cheerful belief,'' Carsey said.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has
worked... &QL;

   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the
``family photo'' with European leaders at Thursday's summit in
Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has had an ambivalent relationship
with the military since his first presidential campaign, when
documents suggested he dodged the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.

should be heralded at an EU summit. It reminds us that this was a
European problem, albeit one that Europe proved unable to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most depressing spectacles of the last 10 weeks has
been that of European leaders, so solid in their support for
military action before the going got tough, so adept later at
turning spineless on ground troops and criticizing NATO's choice of
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither America nor Europe has very much to be proud of in all
this. We fought half a war. It would not be surprising if we were
rewarded with half a peace... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has

   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the

Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen

March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.

NEWS ANALYSIS: CHINA'S TRADE STATUS SAFE DESPITE OUTCRY
OVER  RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is no small irony that President Clinton called
for an extension of China's favorable trading status Thursday on
the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   It was blood on the streets of Beijing that gave birth to the
annual congressional fight over trade. Led in part by San
Francisco's Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the fight over the terms of China's
trade status became a vehicle to pressure leaders in Beijing into
taking human rights more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But each year it becomes increasingly clear that China's human
rights policy has been largely unaffected by the threats of a trade
war. And under enormous pressure from the business community, which
has billions of dollars at stake, the United States has shown less
and less of an appetite to use trade as a bargaining tool.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even during this low moment in U.S.-China diplomacy, the
debate in Washington is not whether to suspend trade relations but
whether to extend them permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a real threat to cutting off the annual renewal,''
said Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Sacramento. ``We've had so much trade with
China in the last decade that it is very difficult to now cut it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The House, which received formal notification of Clinton's
decision Thursday morning, will now go through its yearly China
trade dance, a complicated series of steps choreographed by a
25-year-old law governing commerce with communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on Clinton's certification of China's ``normal trade
relations'' _ formerly known as ``most favored nation'' status _ is
expected in July. Although congressional approval of China's trade
status is a foregone conclusion, relations between the two
countries have soured less than two months after Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade _ as well as
the anti-American rage on display in Beijing afterward _ and recent
allegations that China has stolen many of the United States' top
nuclear secrets as part of a vast espionage program have embittered
many on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a business decision,'' said California Rep. David
Dreier of San Dimas in Los Angeles County, who, like many other
Republicans, has been harshly critical of Clinton's overall China
policy but supportive of continued trade. ``It is very important
for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The more suspenseful debate is likely to take place later this
summer, when Congress is expected to consider a deal to back
China's attempts to join the World Trade Organization. China's
entry into the WTO would eliminate the need for annual action on
trade policy with China.
</P>
<P>
   To some, like Pelosi, that would be a loss. Pelosi, a Democrat,
believes that the annual exercise is a useful tool for pressuring
the Chinese in the areas of human rights, trade and weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in prisons told us their conditions improved every time
that (China trade) was up for a vote,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Clinton's renewal, Pelosi said: ``Just as the
president's timing is sad, so too is his policy. This
administration's China policy, like that of the administration
before it, has not succeeded in making trade fairer, people freer,
or the world safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advanced several reasons Thursday for extending trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said that trade with China ``is good for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Tiananmen Square massacre, Clinton said,
exports to China have quadrupled, and he said 400,000 American jobs
are dependent on such trade.
</P>
<P>
   The president said a deal to get China into the WTO would be
even better, and he warned that revoking trade relations ``would
derail ongoing negotiations to increase our access to China's
market and to promote economic reforms there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose decision was praised by Republican presidential
candidates George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole, also said economic
engagement remains the best way to persuade to China to make
reforms sought by the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade also remains a force for social change in China,
spreading the tools, contacts and ideas that promote freedom,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A continued policy of principled, purposeful engagement
reinforces these efforts to move China toward greater openness and
broader freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see another motive _ money. American businesses earn
hundreds of billions of dollars from trade with China, and they
have spent tens of millions on a lobbying effort to enhance their
access to the lucrative Chinese market. Pelosi and others have
accused Clinton, and President George Bush before him, of being
bought off by the ``exporting elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's involvement with the annual trade debate sprung from
the violence in Tiananmen Square. Shortly after the June 4, 1989,
massacre, which left probably hundreds dead and thousands injured,
she introduced legislation to stop Chinese students studying in the
United States from being forced to return home. Congress passed the
bill, which was vetoed by Bush. But Bush later relented and signed
an executive order that spared the students from having to return
to China.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, some members of Congress used Tiananmen
Square as an argument for revoking China's trading privileges.
Pelosi seized the issue as a valuable way to ``leverage'' China
into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, the debate ... is a referendum on the
administration's policy,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been shaped to a great extent by the brutality
met the 1989 protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiananmen Square has affected U.S. policy because it serves as
a reminder to the American people of the repressive nature of the
(Chinese) regime,'' Pelosi said. ``It speaks more eloquently than
anything we can say about the oppression in China.''

PEDESTRIAN MAN KNOWS WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ On my way to a meeting with Pedestrian Man, I
stepped into a crosswalk on Stockton and got my shoes run over by
the car of a very important person probably late for his job of
finding a cure for cancer.
<P>
   On closer inspection, the guy missed my feet. You know the old
saying about how there are two types of pedestrians: The quick and
the dead. I train by jumping over candlesticks.
</P>
<P>
   But quick and nimble as I be, I almost became a white chalk
outline on the pavement, which would have been a hilarious
coincidence, since dead-pedestrian outlining is what Pedestrian Man
does.
</P>
<P>
   Under cover of darkness, he spray-paints a generic outline of a
body on San Francisco streets. Each outline notes the time, age and
gender of a person killed by a car at or near that spot. (He omits
the name for several reasons, including respect for privacy.)
</P>
<P>
   PEDESTRIAN MAN doesn't call himself that. He calls himself Ken
Kelton. He's surprisingly normal for a guy who commits illegal
vandalism all over the city in his one-man crusade to raise
awareness of pedestrian wipeouts, to help stop 'em, and to
memorialize the fallen.
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping for the sake of this column that Ped Man would look
like Rasputin and have a bit of fire-and-brimstone action. Alas,
Kelton has neat gray hair and a neat beard; he dresses like the
respectable contractor he is. He looks like a CPA lumberjack.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks quietly and carries a spray gun.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes it is a weapon of mass destruction of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Kelton compiled a list of recent pedestrian
deaths in the city. The list now spans 21 months and has 50 names,
plus info on each tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   He creeps into the streets at 4 a.m., sets up construction
barriers with blinking lights at a corner where a walker was
killed, and spray-paints the stencil.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ken's 23-year-old son Jesse comes along to help out.
So far, Kelton has painted 50 of the outlines.
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE the answers to two of the more obvious questions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Yes, his wife thinks he's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Basic citizenship,'' he explains. He saw a problem and
opted to become part of a solution. Nothing more dramatic than
that.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that struck Kelton when researching the human road
kills was how minor and fleeting was the notice. A small story in
the paper or no story at all, some police markings at the scene, a
brief report, then POOF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fatalities are all terribly isolated,'' he says. ``I just
want to connect the dots. I'm raising the questions; I don't have
any answers. I'm just a construction guy. But I know this (what's
being done now) isn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   KELTON FIGURED if he collected some data, some trends might be
spotted, then brought to the attention of people who might be able
to make corrections.
</P>
<P>
   He nailed a map of the city to his office wall. He stuck red
pins for fatalities, yellow pins for serious injuries. Fifty reds,
137 yellows.
</P>
<P>
   He started to see things. Surprise: The biggest clump or red
pins was right in his own neighborhood, eight deaths within a few
blocks of Mission and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton's wall became a graphic representation of the carnage.
But on the streets, the dead people were quickly gone and
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Ken is bike rider (mountain bikes; he says city
biking is too dangerous) and through the S.F. Bicycle Coalition, he
heard of a New York man who paints dead-ped street outlines. Kelton
talked to the man, decided to try it here.
</P>
<P>
   It appealed to the neo-anarchist (his description) in his soul.
Kelton volunteered for Vietnam, did his time in the combat zone
with the Seabees (Construction Battalion), became disillusioned and
radicalized. He went back to college and became an anti-war
protester, then grew up and got a job.
</P>
<P>
   Now his kids are both college age, business is good, he's got a
little spare time and he decided to start flexing his social
conscience again.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began his 4 a.m. painting parties.
</P>
<P>
   (He's got a web site, www.pedsafe.org.)
</P>
<P>
   What Kelton hopes will happen:
</P>
<P>
   -- City officials becoming more outraged. ``This level of
carnage is unacceptable,'' he says, ``but the city government is
accepting it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A more detailed analysis of data by the Department of Parking
and Traffic.
</P>
<P>
   -- More ped-safety education for drivers. Kelton feels many
drivers just don't know the rules and laws.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, I think he is being either generous or wrong.
Drivers who endanger pedestrians know what they're doing, but don't
give a flying fig, since car-pedestrian collisions rarely kill
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton would also like to get the city's official OK for the
street-outline memorials, and he'd like to re-do them with better
paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fade quickly; they get worn off,'' he says. ``But they're
still lasting longer than the memory of the people who died.''

 &HT;    'FAITH IS THE CENTER OF MY LIFE,' GORE SAYS
 &HT;    Repeating for all needing in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is usually thought of as a
politician who understands science and technology, so it is
surprising to see a Bible-quoting Gore running for president by
talking about his ``personal faith tradition'' and enlisting
``faith-based organizations'' to help government tackle social
ills.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, a former divinity student, told a small group of
reporters at the White House last week (May 29) that his religious
ideals and government service have never been separate in his mind,
and that he frequently consults the Bible in order to better
understand current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the Earth circle the sun and still believe in
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a holist. He believes that dividing the world into
different categories _ fact and value, science and religion, art
and morals _ misses the most important point, that the world is a
living, integrated whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific revolution has given us, as a civilization,
previously unimaginable power to dissect each little narrow slice
of the world, `` Gore said. ``But (it) took away an appreciation
for many of the gestalts and many of the most important meanings
that are found only in the whole and not in the sum of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the breach between science and religion is on the
mend, he said, and science's ``contempt'' for a belief in God is
``giving way to a more tolerant blend and a more nuanced
intellectual view that, yes, maybe there is something to this idea
of faith and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is the center of my life,'' he said in response to a
question about his personal religious beliefs. ``I don't wear it on
my sleeve. But I'm happy to respond to your question by affirming
my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think the purpose of life is to glorify God. I
turn to my faith as the bedrock of my approach to any important
question in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that presidential candidates speak so openly of their
personal faith, especially Democratic candidates. Jimmy Carter, a
self-described ``born-again'' Christian who won the White House in
1976, was the exception in a party that is largely agnostic in
terms of religious values _ one reason for its poor standing among
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's soulful speeches of late, as well as his new proposal
to provide government subsidies to religious groups doing social
work, have met hardly a peep of protest from Democratic activists
or political allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a change in the larger structure of philosophical
debate within which our civilization moves along that makes it
easier for people to make reference to faith-based principles that
are important to them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Gore believes, is the profound affect the
deaths of 15 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
has had on the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aftermath of the tragedy at Columbine, a lot of us did
a lot of soul searching,'' he said. ``And when you look hard enough
for answers to something that is really difficult, you kind of
naturally reach into your faith tradition. I do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he added, ``I not infrequently will look for scriptural
reference to illuminate my thinking about current events.''
</P>
<P>
   He also frequently consults all manner of religious texts. Most
recently, he has been influenced by ``The Marriage of Sense and
Soul,'' by Ken Wilber, who lives in Boulder, Colo. Wilber's idea is
that modern civilization is a ``flatland'' lacking depth and
meaning because it exalts the rational and the material over the
spiritual and the emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Gore inherited the faith of his father, Southern Baptist. But
growing up, he and his family alternated attending services at his
father's church and at his mother's, the Church of Christ. Then,
too, there were the daily chapel services he attended while a
student at the Episcopal-run St. Albans school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended a year of divinity school at Vanderbilt University
in 1971 after returning from military duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to intensively explore those questions I had which
seemed then _ and seem now _ to be the most important questions
about life: What is the purpose of life? What's our relationship to
the Creator? What are our spiritual obligations to one another?''
he said. ``I didn't find all the answers I thought I might, but I
found better questions. And I found a process of living out better
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's faith was tested in 1989 when his young son was struck by
an automobile and nearly died. The introspection that resulted led
to his best-selling book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' which is as
much about Gore's search for an ``inner ecology'' of faith as it is
about environmental threats to the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent emphasis on religion has been viewed with some
cynicism by critics. GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer
suggested it has more to do with ``the political calendar and
polls'' than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But in his book, which was published in 1992 before Bill Clinton
selected him as his running mate, Gore sounded many of the
value-laden themes now common in presidential campaigns in both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about the ``retreat into the seductive tools and
technologies of industrial civilization'' that has left people
feeling isolated and disconnected from their roots, about ``a
spiritual crisis in modern civilization that seems to be based on
an emptiness at its center and the absence of a larger spiritual
purpose, of the need for faith as ``the primary force that enables
us to choose meaning and direction and then hold to it despite all
the buffeting chaos in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can often say the same thing in a secular framework,''
Gore said at the White House meeting. ``And I have often in the
past and still do try to say it both ways, because it's true that
some people are still uncomfortable with a faith-based
vocabulary.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ The renting out of the
Atlanta Motor Speedway is drawing protests _ some are disturbed
over violent lyrics that apparently are stock in trade for some of
the bands. In light of Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, they have
reason to be disturbed. If what we suspect is true, we need to do a
bit of adjusting on the First Amendment while we're tinkering with
the Second. Keeping military weapons away from civilians and
keeping guns away from criminals and children has nothing to do
with the right of a militia to bear arms. Marketing violence to
kids has even less to do with freedom of speech and press. (Jim
Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

resurrected an unsolved mystery over the disappearance, in the
mid-1800s, of the mummified remains of Ramses I, the founder of
ancient Egypt's most powerful pharaoic dynasty. Where did he go? No

 &HT;    Holocaust exhibit finds fitting home at Air Force Museum
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``What does a Holocaust exhibit have to do with
the history of aviation?''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Air Force Museum fields that question about
``Prejudice and Memory: A Holocaust Exhibit,'' its new permanent
installation. ``I fail to see any connection between (the museum's)
objectives and the Holocaust,'' stated a recent letter to the
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Does a Holocaust exhibit belong at the Air Force Museum? Visit
``Prejudice and Memory'' with a group of schoolchildren, as I did
recently, and you'll have the answer. Dozens of children stood
intent, solemn-eyed, before a concentration camp uniform, or
listened to one of a half-dozen volunteer docents.
</P>
<P>
   For teacher Susan Lightcap, the connection is clear. ``All you
have to do is go around the corner and look at the World War II
exhibit,'' said Lightcap, among eight teachers squiring a group of
85 fifth-graders from Harold Schnell Elementary School in West
Carrollton. ``It all ties together very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, after all, is about a lot more than airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Retired Maj. Gen. Charles Metcalf, the museum's
director. More and more, Metcalf said, the museum is telling
people's stories _ the human element in combat and the development
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane is the biggest artifact in a museum, but in many
cases it's not the most important,'' Metcalf said. ``The airplane
is a big unfeeling thing, with no sense of loyalty or devotion to
duty, of service to one's nation, of sacrifice. All of those are
very human emotions and traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf deserves credit for having the vision to make the
exhibit a permanent installation. A four-year labor of love for
project director and curator Renate Frydman, the exhibit had
traveled to 10 locations in 18 months. Initially, it was to be a
temporary exhibit at the Air Force Museum as well, until the day
Metcalf came to Frydman and said, ``What if we told you we like it
so much we want to keep it?''
</P>
<P>
   Frydman, who worried about security for the exhibit, was
overjoyed that it now had a home where 1.25 million people a year
could view it.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is one of only a handful nationwide that focus on
local Holocaust survivors. For the Air Force Museum, it hits close
to home in other ways as well. Airmen not only helped to liberate
the concentration camps, Metcalf said, but some were imprisoned
there: ``It's a little-known fact, but every one of the internment
and extermination camps held American POWs ... held as long-term
prisoners. At the Berga concentration camp in 1944, they celebrated
Christmas by decorating 14 U.S. airmen as Christmas trees and
hanging them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the case all the more that we need to tell this
story,'' said Metcalf, who plans to expand the exhibit to include
more Air Force history.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get far into the exhibit before you see the connection
with Air Force history. A wall panel titled ``The Liberators''
features local airmen and soldiers who served among the troops
liberating concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Unger of Dayton was one of them. Serving under Gen.
George Patton, he was among the troops from the 90th Infantry
Division who liberated the Flossenburg concentration camp in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the American soldiers were coming in, the survivors were
being shot as fast as they could be shot,'' Unger said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit deserves a home at the Air Force Museum, he said;
the Holocaust is the supreme example of what the Allies were
fighting. ``This shows the Air Force Museum is sensitive to the
fact that the Holocaust is an intrinsic part of World War II, and,
as such, deserves a place in this museum,'' Unger said.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Weil agreed. The Harrison Twp. man came to tell the
students his remarkable story of survival and loss. By a fluke of
fate, he made it out of Frankfurt on one of the last children's
trains out of Germany. His parents and sister died at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. prides itself on justice and freedom _ the kinds of
things taken away from people in the Holocaust,'' he said. ``The
U.S. Air Force is a branch of the government that defends those
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubters have been few, Metcalf said; the response has been
overwhelmingly supportive. Each week the exhibit draws almost 2,000
students, who go on to explore the rest of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Proof positive, he said, that this exhibit fulfills the museum's
primary mission: Education.
</P>
<P>
   Frydman, he said, carefully constructed an exhibit that would
touch children. She avoided graphic photos, telling the story
instead through powerful artifacts and family photos.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, the students were quiet, attentive, engaged.
Megan Lee and Nicole Valencia, both 11, said the Air Force Museum
was the right place for the exhibit. ``People could come to learn
about planes, and wander back here and learn about the Holocaust,''
Megan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could teach people not to make the same mistakes,''
Nicole added. ``It could teach people that, even though someone
looks different or does different things, he is still a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The children's interest, Metcalf said, is exceeded only by the
veterans'. ``They are very, very intent on this. This is the reason
they were fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans understand better than any of us, after all: Airplanes
alone can't tell the story of war.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the story, you need the concentration camp uniform, the
violin miraculously saved from the Nazis, the snapshot of the
smiling child with the caption in ink: ``Killed by the Nazi
extermination.''
</P>
<P>
   To tell the story, you need more than military hardware. You
need humanity.

 &HT;    Lawless lyrics and disorder
 &HT;    By Jim Minter

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Newspaper headline: ``150 Rally in Griffin
to protest RockFest '99 scheduled for June 7 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time renting out the superspeedway for a
music festival has caused controversy. We had some tense moments
back in 1969 when promoters leased what was then Atlanta
International Raceway to put on a Southern version of Woodstock,
the signature event of the '60s youth rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Alf Knight, one of the early promoters of grass-roots stock car
racing _ every driver for himself, no corporate sponsors _ was
track superintendent. He and his wife, Madaline, had a home on the
premises, just off the first turn. Their friends included a young
couple from Plains. They listened to country music together and
sometimes visited dirt tracks on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter ran for governor, the Knights were among his
earliest supporters. Alf would introduce him to guests in the press
box while Madaline helped out with mailings and things like that.
After the Carters moved into the Governor's Mansion, they hosted an
annual barbecue for the Knights and their automobile racing
friends.
</P>
<P>
   When the Carters moved to Washington, they did the same at the
White House. Madaline made out the guest list, which ranged from
Lewis Grizzard to Willie Nelson to Richard Petty and Bobby Allison
spinning their cars around the South Lawn driveway while everybody
sipped cold longnecks iced down in Sears, Roebuck rowboats. The
'70s were hard years for Atlanta International Raceway, often
referred to as Atlanta International Rainway because of a pattern
of costly rainouts. AIR seemed forever on the verge of bankruptcy,
and suspicions were that Alf and Madaline sometimes subsidized
operations from their personal funds. Although he was technically
only an employee, Alf definitely felt an ownership stake in the
troubled track.
</P>
<P>
   When the owners rented it to promoters who were putting on a
weekend rock festival, he continued to do business as usual. He and
his work crew were making an asphalt patch in the third turn when
one of the promoters came up and ordered them to clear out. Alf
didn't cotton to being ordered off his own track. After a short
conversation, the promoter was observed in a prone position in the
middle of third turn, victim of a right-hand punch that made Alf
rather famous in racing circles.
</P>
<P>
   AIR's owners, anxious to avoid more trouble, offered Alf and
Madaline an all-expenses vacation for the duration of the rental
agreement. Naturally, they chose Daytona Beach. They had been there
only a few hours when Alf's foreman called from Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister Alf,'' he said. ``You better get yourself home. Them
hippies done broke your plate glass window, and they're in your den
drinking beer and smoking marijuana.'' Alf's return trip from
Daytona set a highway speed record that likely still stands.
</P>
<P>
   As the festival wound down and finally ended on a Sunday
afternoon, local police had trouble getting the crowd to leave. The
infield was still filled with guests in various stages of
intoxication Monday morning when management of the track reverted
to Alf. With a trusted aide at his side, he picked up a length of
2-by-4 and began clearing the premises. By 10 a.m., everyone was
gone except for a young woman sleeping stark naked in the pit area
and a loaded Volkswagen about to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Alf shouldered the young lady, walked over to the Volkswagen
packed with six young men, poked his head into the window, and
inquired: ``Where are you fellows going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Miami,'' they replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Alf said, opening the door and poking the young lady
inside. ``So is she.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Alf won't be around to supervise the events of June 7 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway, I wish the media _ newspapers and
television _ would give extensive coverage to RockFest '99.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffin protesters, indulging clergy and Spalding County
Sheriff Richard Cantrell, are disturbed over violent lyrics that
apparently are stock in trade for some of the bands.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, they have reason to
be disturbed. I don't know what the lyrics say. I hear only
smatterings. Despite the reasons we hate to hear such things on
television and read them in newspapers, it's time to let the world
know exactly what our kids are listening to.
</P>
<P>
   If what we suspect is true, we need to do a bit of adjusting on
the First Amendment while we're tinkering with the Second. Keeping
military weapons away from civilians and keeping guns away from
criminals and children has nothing to do with the right of a
militia to bear arms. Marketing violence to kids has even less to
do with freedom of speech and press.

 &HT;    Jointing shouldn't table a project
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A question has arisen about how best to prepare and
edge-glue boards to make something like a table top. Actually it is
one of the easier tasks in woodworking, given a well-tuned jointer
plane and the proper clamps.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, select the boards for the project and cut them to
length and square them up. Although I use a jointer and planer to
square the boards, I always prepare the edges by hand. Why? Well,
for whatever reason, I always seem to get a better joint that way.
At least I think I do.
</P>
<P>
   Determine the face side of each board and the sequence. This is
very important to the final appearance of the top. Move the boards
around to get the most harmonious appearance, blending the figures
as best you can. The idea is to wind up with a top that looks as if
it was one incredibly broad plank. While this is seldom possible,
judicious arrangement will usually obscure to some degree the
disparity between the boards' color and figure.
</P>
<P>
   Some woodworking texts tell you to alternate the faces of the
boards to minimize any tendency toward cupping of the entire top. I
disagree; I've never seen this phenomenon, and I won't let the
possibility of it dictate the appearance of the completed top.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sequence is satisfactory, mark the boards' face side
with their place in the sequence and their face side.
</P>
<P>
   Now take boards 1 and 2 and place them back to back on the
workbench, with the edges to be joined uppermost. Clamp them _
remembering to use scrap wood pads under the clamp jaws _ with the
ends even.
</P>
<P>
   If the boards are fairly long, it's usually best to secure them
in the bench vise, still with the joining sides up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take the jointer plane and square this two-board edge. The
plane should be set to take the thinnest shaving, and you must take
care, of course, to keep from rounding off the ends.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of doing both edges at once is that inadvertently
canting the plane will do no harm. If the combined edge is, for
instance, off of 90 degrees by 10 degrees or so, the edges will
still match perfectly when the boards are laid flat and brought
together.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you are taking a full ribbonlike shaving off both of
the boards, you can stop.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this routine through the sequence of boards. Next will
come the other edge of No. 2 and the matching edge of No. 3, and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're ready for glue up, a task that should not be rushed.
Some shops, I know, have a standing rule that there will be no
glueup at the end of the day, when everyone is tired and ready to
hang it up.
</P>
<P>
   If the top is fairly large, an extra pair of hands is extremely
useful, if not a downright necessity.
</P>
<P>
   If a lot of boards are required, consider glueing them in
segments. For instance, if you've got a six-board top, glue up two
sets of three boards, let them set up, and then glue the two
segments together.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks glue up on a special table, some on a sawhorse setup
and others on the bench. Whatever the case, cover the work surface
with wax paper to protect it and minimize the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Get your clamps ready, set to the proper length, with plastic
pads on the jaws or wood scraps ready to serve the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If the top is long enough to need more than two clamps, it's a
good idea to alternate them top to bottom. If you're going to do
that, put the bottom clamps in place and cover them with wax paper,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners always have trouble determining the right amount of
glue. You want a happy medium. If there's no squeeze-out when you
apply clamp pressure, you probably didn't use enough glue. But you
want just a little squeeze-out; you don't want to be up to your
elbows in glue.
</P>
<P>
   Run a bead of glue down the edge of the first board and use a
thin piece of scrap or cardboard to spread it evenly across the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   The glue bottle will tell you to put glue on both edges. Not
many woodworkers do that.
</P>
<P>
   From here, things must proceed at a quick, but not panicky,
pace, since the glue begins to set in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this sequence until there's glue on every joint.
</P>
<P>
   Now bring the clamp jaws up and begin applying pressure, a
little bit at a time, with each clamp, working from the ends
inward. Don't bear down with one clamp a great deal more than with
the clamp next to it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to bring enough pressure to bear on the boards to
get an even line of glue squeezeout across each joint. You don't
want to squeeze all the glue out, and you don't want to apply so
much pressure that the top begins to bow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the boards want to slide around on the glue and get
out of alignment. If you can't control that by hand, you'll have to
prepare some scrap boards with at least one flat edge, cover them
with wax paper and clamp them top and bottom across the workpiece
to keep the alignment. Usually two sets, one near each end, will do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is secure, clean up as much of the squeezeout as
you can with a damp cloth. Leave the workpiece in clamps for 24
hours, and remember that all the dried glue that didn't get wiped
off will now have to be scraped off, because it won't take a
finish.

Egyptian mummies. The curatorial coup that brought the world-class
mummy collection to the Emory University campus has quietly
resurrected an unsolved mystery over the disappearance, in the
mid-1800s, of the mummified remains of Ramses I, the founder of
ancient Egypt's most powerful pharaoic dynasty. Where did he go? No
one knows. But Emory University scientists say the latest in 20th
Century genetic technology may enable them shed new light on the
riddle if it can answer another question: ``Who's that mummy?''

 &HT;    Jointing shouldn't table a project
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A question has arisen about how best to prepare and
edge-glue boards to make something like a table top. Actually it is
one of the easier tasks in woodworking, given a well-tuned jointer
plane and the proper clamps.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, select the boards for the project and cut them to
length and square them up. Although I use a jointer and planer to
square the boards, I always prepare the edges by hand. Why? Well,
for whatever reason, I always seem to get a better joint that way.
At least I think I do.
</P>
<P>
   Determine the face side of each board and the sequence. This is
very important to the final appearance of the top. Move the boards
around to get the most harmonious appearance, blending the figures
as best you can. The idea is to wind up with a top that looks as if
it was one incredibly broad plank. While this is seldom possible,
judicious arrangement will usually obscure to some degree the
disparity between the boards' color and figure.
</P>
<P>
   Some woodworking texts tell you to alternate the faces of the
boards to minimize any tendency toward cupping of the entire top. I
disagree; I've never seen this phenomenon, and I won't let the
possibility of it dictate the appearance of the completed top.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sequence is satisfactory, mark the boards' face side
with their place in the sequence and their face side.
</P>
<P>
   Now take boards 1 and 2 and place them back to back on the
workbench, with the edges to be joined uppermost. Clamp them _
remembering to use scrap wood pads under the clamp jaws _ with the
ends even.
</P>
<P>
   If the boards are fairly long, it's usually best to secure them
in the bench vise, still with the joining sides up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take the jointer plane and square this two-board edge. The
plane should be set to take the thinnest shaving, and you must take
care, of course, to keep from rounding off the ends.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of doing both edges at once is that inadvertently
canting the plane will do no harm. If the combined edge is, for
instance, off of 90 degrees by 10 degrees or so, the edges will
still match perfectly when the boards are laid flat and brought
together.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you are taking a full ribbonlike shaving off both of
the boards, you can stop.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this routine through the sequence of boards. Next will
come the other edge of No. 2 and the matching edge of No. 3, and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're ready for glue up, a task that should not be rushed.
Some shops, I know, have a standing rule that there will be no
glueup at the end of the day, when everyone is tired and ready to
hang it up.
</P>
<P>
   If the top is fairly large, an extra pair of hands is extremely
useful, if not a downright necessity.
</P>
<P>
   If a lot of boards are required, consider glueing them in
segments. For instance, if you've got a six-board top, glue up two
sets of three boards, let them set up, and then glue the two
segments together.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks glue up on a special table, some on a sawhorse setup
and others on the bench. Whatever the case, cover the work surface
with wax paper to protect it and minimize the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Get your clamps ready, set to the proper length, with plastic
pads on the jaws or wood scraps ready to serve the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If the top is long enough to need more than two clamps, it's a
good idea to alternate them top to bottom. If you're going to do
that, put the bottom clamps in place and cover them with wax paper,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners always have trouble determining the right amount of
glue. You want a happy medium. If there's no squeeze-out when you
apply clamp pressure, you probably didn't use enough glue. But you
want just a little squeeze-out; you don't want to be up to your
elbows in glue.
</P>
<P>
   Run a bead of glue down the edge of the first board and use a
thin piece of scrap or cardboard to spread it evenly across the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   The glue bottle will tell you to put glue on both edges. Not
many woodworkers do that.
</P>
<P>
   From here, things must proceed at a quick, but not panicky,
pace, since the glue begins to set in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this sequence until there's glue on every joint.
</P>
<P>
   Now bring the clamp jaws up and begin applying pressure, a
little bit at a time, with each clamp, working from the ends
inward. Don't bear down with one clamp a great deal more than with
the clamp next to it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to bring enough pressure to bear on the boards to
get an even line of glue squeezeout across each joint. You don't
want to squeeze all the glue out, and you don't want to apply so
much pressure that the top begins to bow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the boards want to slide around on the glue and get
out of alignment. If you can't control that by hand, you'll have to
prepare some scrap boards with at least one flat edge, cover them
with wax paper and clamp them top and bottom across the workpiece
to keep the alignment. Usually two sets, one near each end, will do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is secure, clean up as much of the squeezeout as
you can with a damp cloth. Leave the workpiece in clamps for 24
hours, and remember that all the dried glue that didn't get wiped
off will now have to be scraped off, because it won't take a
finish.

NINE WAYS TO FIGHT FOOD POISONING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Wednesday, June 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE YOUNG  
 c.1999 Redbook Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food safety quiz:
</P>
<P>
   What does a hamburger teeming with sickening amounts of bacteria
taste like? Answer: A hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with most food poisoning _ the bacteria that
cause the misery of stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
cannot be tasted, seen, or smelled, according to an article in the
July issue of Redbook magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And what may cause you a few days of feeling yucky can be a
serious, even life-threatening, illness for your child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to the
toxic effects of food-borne illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D.,
director of the Poison Control Center at Rainbow Babies and
Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from
vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock. Since 50
to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of food in the
home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family safe.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the summer troublemakers you're most likely to
overlook:
</P>
<P>
   1. Shopping trip-ups:
</P>
<P>
   The average food item in your local supermarket has traveled
nearly 1,000 miles to get there, notes Robert Hollingworth, Ph.D.,
director of the National Food Safety and Toxicology Center at
Michigan State University. And while the Food and Drug
Administration and other food safety experts estimate that
perishable foods items such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish,
and vegetables can stay out of the cold for a total of four hours,
``It's probably way too long,'' says Winkler Weinberg, M.D., a
member of the Georgia-Pacific Health Smart Institute Advisory Board
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Assume any such food's time in the safety zone is nearly expired
and keep it out no longer than an hour, less if it's very hot _ 85
degrees or above.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hot cars
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is your car's hottest spot, and heat incubates
bacteria and other food-borne menaces. Stash groceries in the back
seat and turn on the air- conditioning, says registered dietitian
Molly Gee of the Methodist Health Care System in Houston. And make
grocery shopping the last stop on your list of errands.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cold storage
</P>
<P>
   If your refrigerator and freezer are stuffed full, air can't
circulate properly, which can create warm, germ-friendly spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your refrigerator is only 10 degrees above what it should
be, bacteria will grow,'' says Hollingworth. Keep shelves as clear
as possible and check your appliances' temperature: Refrigerators
should register 34 to 40 degrees and freezers should be at or below
0. (If your appliance doesn't have a built-in thermostat, buy one.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Problematic produce
</P>
<P>
   Raw fruits and vegetables are increasingly the culprits in
food-borne illness. Although much of our produce is now imported
from countries with less-than-rigorous food safety policies, you
can't be less vigilant with homegrown produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been problems with local organic and small-farm
fruits and vegetables,'' says Hollingworth. Unless it needs to
ripen at room temperature, produce should be refrigerated
immediately. Don't bother to wash before storing _ it could get
contaminated in the fridge, and you'll need to wash it again, notes
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse before eating, then wipe dry with paper towels. Laboratory
tests show that rinsing plus wiping removes 99 percent of
contaminating germs while water alone removes only 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to wash and wipe even thick-rind fruits like
melon _ any microorganisms on the outside will be transported
inside as you slice.
</P>
<P>
   5. Germy hands
</P>
<P>
   Running the tips of your fingers under cold water does not count
as hand-washing, says Weinberg. ``Not only are your hands still
contaminated, but so is the dish towel you wiped them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Make sure all family members wash their hands for two minutes
(with warm, soapy water) after using the bathroom and before
eating.
</P>
<P>
   6. Marinating mishaps
</P>
<P>
   Defrosting or marinating meats on the kitchen counter provides
ideal conditions for bacteria to proliferate. E. coli and other
troublemakers can lie dormant in frozen meat and can begin to
multiply again at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, defrost or marinate all meat in the fridge. To make
sure the raw juices do not drip onto other foods or fridge
surfaces, defrost or marinate on the lowest shelf. Place paper
towels under the plate or tray to soak up any drips.
</P>
<P>
   7. Botched barbecue
</P>
<P>
   Partially grilling meats, then refrigerating or allowing them to
sit out before finishing them off on the barbecue basically warms
the innermost part to ideal germ-generating temperatures without
heating it to the kill point, says Gee.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to straight grilling or precook in the oven and move
straight to coals. Use a clean platter, not the one that held the
raw meat, to serve, and wash and dry the forks, tongs, and spatulas
used with the raw meat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, potatoes grilled or baked in aluminum foil and left at
room temperature can harbor botulism (this organism lives in the
soil). It turns out that a foil-wrapped spud holds in moisture,
preventing its skin from reaching a high enough temperature to kill
botulism spores. The safest bet: Bake potatoes but do it without
foil.
</P>
<P>
   8. Contaminated convenience foods
</P>
<P>
   Convenience store refrigerators are opened so often that they
may not stay cold enough to prevent bacterial growth in prepared
salads and sandwiches. Cold air sinks, so pick from the bottom of
the cooler, toward the back.
</P>
<P>
   9. Uncool coolers
</P>
<P>
   Coolers are not portable refrigerators-packing a cooler full of
warm food and tossing in a cold pack is not enough to chill
contents to the requisite 34 to 40 degrees. Thoroughly chill or
freeze foods before placing in the cooler. Put the most perishable
items at the bottom, and put ice packs on the top.

 By STEPHANIE YOUNG  
 c.1999 Redbook Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, E. coli in a Marietta, Ga., water park infected and
hospitalized six children who were swimming in the kiddie pool. It
was the same strain of the germ-0157:H7-that in 1993 killed four
children who ate contaminated fast-food hamburgers in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. coli isn't the only bacteria you need to worry about in
pools. Microbes that cause gastroenteritis, salmonellosis,
shigellosis, and rotavirus (all of which result in vomiting,
diarrhea, and stomach distress) can all survive in water,'' says
David F. Knoop, technical service consultant for Arch Chemicals.
Here are his tips on what to look for in a pool that's safe for
your kids to swim in:
</P>
<P>
   _ CLEAN ON THE OUTSIDE: If a public pool's changing rooms, rest
rooms, and diaper-changing areas are messy, chances are the aquatic
housekeeping is not up to snuff either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get cross-contamination between the pool and the
bathroom and diaper decks,'' says Knoop.
</P>
<P>
   _ CLEAR WATER, SPARKLING WALLS: Water that's hazy and pool walls
that are slippery with (invisible) algae indicate poor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   _ A BARELY NOTICEABLE CHLORINE SMELL: The stronger the chlorine
odor, the more you should be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlorine smells more the more it reacts with nitrogen
products, such as urine and perspiration,'' says Knoop. A stronger
smell means dirtier water.
</P>
<P>
   _ FEWER SWIMMERS: If your pool is always crowded, the chlorine
is less able to do its job. And the more people there are, the more
germs they're potentially spreading.
</P>
<P>
   If yours is a busy pool, don't hesitate to ask the manager or
senior lifeguard how often the pool is cleaned (the answer you want
to hear: at least once a day) and how often the pool is ``shocked''
or treated with high concentrations of chlorine (anywhere from
every two days to once a week, based on the number of swimmers, is
acceptable).
</P>
<P>
   _ A BUBBLY SPA: The pool may look okay, but check out the spa,
if there is one. Jacuzzi jets churn the water, but you should not
see foam on the surface. Foam comes from accumulated skin oils and
other microscopic debris and it means the spa is not being properly
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   _ IF YOUR KID GETS FOOD POISONING: ``Infants and small children
are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of food-borne
illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D., director of the Poison Control
Center at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from
vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock.
</P>
<P>
   Since 50 to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of
food in the home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child is puking and pooping, whether it's food
poisoning or something else, it's important to be in contact with
your pediatrician,'' says Cornelia Franz. M.D. ``You and your
doctor can determine whether the child needs medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases of food poisoning go away by themselves, but you do
have to guard against dehydration, according to Franz.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your doctor how long the vomiting and diarrhea have been
going on, whether you've noticed any decrease in urine production
in the past 12 hours, and whether the urine looks dark or smells
particularly strong. These are all signs of dehydration, which, if
left untreated, can lead to organ failure, shock, and possibly
death.

<P>
   Your doctor may recommend that you give your child an
electrolyte-based drink, such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, says Franz.
(If your child doesn't like these, try mixing several ounces with a
clear soda.) ``In the long run, it's more important to get fluids
in, no matter what kind.''

WHAT TO DO IF YOUR CHILD GETS FOOD POISONING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Wednesday, June 9)   (With BC-FOOD POISONING)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Redbook Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips on how to respond if your child gets food
poisoning:
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from
vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to the
toxic effects of food-borne illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D.,
director of the Poison Control Center at Rainbow Babies and
Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Since 50 to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of
food in the home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child is puking and pooping, whether it's food
poisoning or something else, it's important to be in contact with
your pediatrician,'' says Cornelia Franz. M.D. ``You and your
doctor can determine whether the child needs medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cases of food poisoning go away by themselves, but you do
have to guard against dehydration. Tell your doctor how long the
vomiting and diarrhea have been going on, whether you've noticed
any decrease in urine production in the past 12 hours, and whether
the urine looks dark or smells particularly strong. These are all
signs of dehydration, which, if left untreated, can lead to organ
failure, shock, and possibly death.
</P>
<P>
   Your doctor may recommend that you give your child an
electrolyte-based drink, such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, says Franz.

 &HT;    IRS DEMANDS FOR BACK TAXES A 'P.R. GAME,' UPS SAYS
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ United Parcel Service says the Internal Revenue
Service is playing a public relations ``game'' by continuing to
file tax cases while both sides await a U.S. Tax Court decision on
the 1983 spinoff of Overseas Partners Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   UPS filed a petition May 24 asking the tax court to overturn an
IRS order seeking $495.19 million in back federal taxes, penalties
and interest for the 1988-90 tax years. In April, UPS filed a
petition appealing an IRS demand for $333.3 million for 1985-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the IRS continues to play this P.R. game, it appears we
will be seeing more of these filings,'' said Norman Black, the
company's chief spokesman. ``We're not exactly sure why they feel a
need to file this stuff. It just seems to be a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another chapter in a very old book, and it's getting
very old,'' Black said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``What
the IRS is doing for each three-year block is saying that, 'If we
win this, this is how much UPS will owe us.' They have no more
grounds to assume they're going to win that case than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending tax
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the issues for the 1988-90 tax years are a replay of
those in the 1985-87 tax case, and involve investment tax credits
and depreciation schedules and deductions.
</P>
<P>
   All these are peripheral matters, he said, which could be
resolved in negotiations with the IRS once a decision is reached by
Tax Court Judge Robert Rowe in the 1995 trial.
</P>
<P>
   That case is over possible tax consequences to UPS from the
firm's decision on Dec. 31, 1983, to give its shareholders a
dividend in the form of Overseas Partners Ltd. (OPL) stock that
made the Bermuda-based reinsurance company independent. UPS claims
the OPL stock
</P>
<P>
   dividends are taxable to the shareholders who received them. The
company claims it has no ties to OPL.
</P>
<P>
   OPL offers reinsurance to companies on policies that UPS
customers buy from independent insurance companies such as National
Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh to insure packages that are
worth more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very comfortable and confident about our position on
that particular issue of OPL,'' Black said. ``We're confident about
our case and we look forward to receiving the judge's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, which was founded in Seattle in 1907 and has 330,000
employees worldwide, argued in its latest petition that the IRS
erred when it ruled that the construction of 15 package delivery
centers were depreciable property, but that land improvements
</P>
<P>
   couldn't be depreciated.
</P>
<P>
   The company also challenged the IRS ruling that it had to
depreciate rather than deduct inspection and maintenance costs of
its fleet of jet cargo aircraft, and the amount and timing of
investment tax credits for the purchase of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS notice of tax deficiency was filed Feb. 23, and the
agency has 60 days to respond to the company's May 24 petition. If
the case is not resolved in negotiations, it could go to trial
before a tax court judge.

   Cells that have been hailed as the future of transplant medicine
could also provide a quick, accurate way to identify drugs that
might damage the liver. A biotechnology company in California
believes that cultures of embryonic stem (ES) cells could screen
out excessively toxic experimental pharmaceuticals before they are
tested on animals or people.
</P>
<P>
   ES cells have the potential to develop into any of the body's
tissues. This has led some researchers to suggest that they could
be used to grow unlimited supplies of tissues or organs for
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But VistaGen of San Carlos is more interested in the fact that
they produce high levels of enzymes that are normally found in the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, because most drugs are metabolized in the
liver, possibly yielding toxic products. The liver is the organ
most likely to be damaged by experimental pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the major clearing house for drugs in the body,'' says
Ralph Snodgrass, a developmental biologist and chief executive
officer of VistaGen.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to screen out dangerous compounds early on,
pharmaceuticals companies often test the effects of potential drugs
on liver cells taken from cadavers. But once in a Petri dish, human
liver cells often stop producing the enzymes that break down drugs
into toxic byproducts _ so the side effects of some drugs aren't
spotted until they show up in animal tests or even in clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   VistaGen's scientists have treated mouse ES cells with two drugs
known to damage the liver, and several others with no known
toxicity. The cells produced a distinctive spectrum of proteins in
response to the toxic drugs. Snodgrass plans to repeat the
experiment with human ES cells.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sistare, a pharmacologist with the Food and Drug
Administration in Washington, says that the VistaGen team must now
prove that ES cells predict drug toxicity better than current
cell-culture systems.

   An intelligent microwave oven that knows how to cook convenience
foods could also warn people with allergies that their dinner may
contain potentially dangerous ingredients such as peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Many microwave ovens are hard to operate, as their front panels
often contain confusing arrays of badly labeled buttons. With
trials due to start in six months, the Intelligent Microwave Oven
aims to end that problem _at least for convenience foods.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to cook your ready meal by simply swiping the
packaging over a bar-code scanner on the oven's front panel.
</P>
<P>
   The bar code will contain information telling the oven how to
cook the food, explains Kit Yam, who developed the system at the
Department of Food Science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick,
N.J. The work is funded by Samsung, the Korean consumer electronics
company.
</P>
<P>
   Yam says the microwave assures that the food is cooked as the
maker intended, at the right temperature for the right amount of
time _ crucial for killing dangerous bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, says Yam, you can customize the microwave to
suit your tastes. If you are a vegan and find it a pain to check
each label for gelatin-containing products, or if you are allergic
to nuts or gluten, the microwave can be programmed to warn you.
With the cooperation of the food industry, says Yam, it may even be
able to tell you if your food contains genetically modified
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   William Cookson, an allergy specialist at the John Radcliffe
Hospital in Oxford, says that most people with life-threatening
food allergies train themselves to scrutinize labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things in food that people would need to know about
and for that reason this might be helpful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The trick has been putting together proven technologies and
getting the food industry to make the bar codes more detailed.
''What's new here is the information put into the bar code,'' says
Yam. ''The key is the partnership with the food industry because
the microwave oven companies cannot do it by themselves.''

   Melting Himalayan glaciers are threatening to unleash a torrent
of floods into mountain valleys, and ultimately dry up rivers
across South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, due to be presented in July to the International
Commission on Snow and Ice (ICSI), predicts that most of the
glaciers in the region will vanish within 40 years as a result of
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the glaciers in the middle Himalayas are retreating,''
says Syed Hasnain of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, the
chief author of the ICSI report. A typical example is the Gangorti
glacier at the head of the River Ganges, which is retreating at a
rate of 30 meters per year.
</P>
<P>
   Hasnain's four-year study indicates that all the glaciers in the
central and eastern Himalayas could disappear by 2035 at their
present rate of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers cover around 17 percent of the Himalayas and contain
thousands of cubic kilometers of water. Taken together with those
on the neighboring Tibetan plateau, they represent the largest body
of ice on the planet outside the polar regions.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, their meltwater makes up two-thirds of the flow of
great South Asian rivers such as the Ganges, on which hundreds of
millions of people depend.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasnain's working group on Himalayan glaciology, set up by
the ICSI, has found that glaciers are receding faster in the
Himalayas than anywhere else on Earth. Hasnain warns that as the
glaciers disappear, the flow of these rivers will become less
reliable and eventually diminish, resulting in widespread water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the retreating glaciers have formed dozens of
precarious meltwater lakes. Water accumulates between the tip of
the glacier and the mound of debris and rock, known as moraine,
left behind by the glacier when it was at its longest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moraine is unstable. Occasionally these lakes burst,
releasing enormous amounts of water,'' says Hasnain, ''This is
recognized as a serious problem in India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Tibet
and China.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest breakout so far came in August 1985, at Dig Tsho in
the Khumbal Himal region of Nepal. A wall of water up to 15 meters
high rushed down the steep valley for 90 kilometers, drowning
people in their homes and destroying a hydroelectric plant.
</P>
<P>
   The next disaster could be downstream of the Imja glacier lake
in Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park, a popular trekking
destination. A lake that began forming there in the 1960s now holds
about 30 million cubic meters of water. Researchers predict that it
will burst within five years.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not alone. According to Bidur Upadhyay, a hydrologist
at Tribhuvan University in Nepal, the breaching of the nearby Tsho
Rolpa lake, which covers more than a square kilometer, ''could
cause a catastrophe any summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ICSI study follows reports of a worldwide decline in
glaciers. Alpine glaciers have retreated by 25 percent over the
past hundred years. Scientists blame global warming, as global
average temperatures are now more than 0.5 degrees C higher than a
century ago. &QL;

   Sports people who are pushing themselves too hard could soon be
identified before it's too late by a system called PlayTrac, which
will also help coaches assess the performance of players and plan
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   PlayTrac has been developed by Pineapplehead, a software company
in Melbourne which has been working with researchers at the Royal
Melbourne Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Players wear a radio transmitter-receiver called a transponder.
The prototype is a flat rectangle about 6 centimeters by 4
centimeters. The team hopes to shrink this to a disc about 3
centimeters across that can be sewn into sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   The transponder, powered by watch batteries, has an antenna
which sends signals to three receivers around the playing field.
During training, physiological information, such as heart rate, is
relayed to medical staff from two electrodes strapped to the
player's body.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each coach will know the anaerobic threshold of individual
players,'' says Lamb. ''They will know how much running they can
handle based on the day's conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   And by knowing the position of the receivers, it will be
possible to analyze players' movements, based on the precise timing
of the arrival of the signal at each receiver. If all players on a
field wear a transponder, coaching staff will be able to decide
tactics during a game with the aid of laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Data are updated four times a second, and the system is accurate
to within half a meter.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapplehead is still filing patents, so will not reveal the
frequencies of the signals used by its system. However, they avoid
the microwave band favored by mobile phone manufacturers.

ANTHONY HOPKINS' BAD HAIR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not to disparage the thatch on one of the planet's great actors
(oh, why not?), but have you ever noticed that the length of
Anthony Hopkins' hair is directly proportional to the silliness of
the movie in which he appears?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mask of Zorro,'' a good silly movie, he suffers in
prison and grows his hair after witnessing the murder of his wife.
(Twenty years later, it's only down to his shoulders.) In ``Legends
of the Fall,'' a bad silly movie, Hopkins suffers a stroke and
grows his hair after witnessing the complete narrative collapse of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Silence of the Lambs,'' on the other hand, his hair is
short, neat, brutally slicked back _ as befits a blade-sharp serial
killer. In ``Howards End,'' it's clipped and Edwardian. ``Remains
of the Day'': short. ``Amistad'': bald on top, longish in back,
reflecting the uneven merits of the film. ``Shadowlands'': short.
``Bram Stoker's Dracula'': over the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Given this trend, it's obvious what to expect from ``Instinct,''
a film in which the Hopkins hairdo hits Monica length, minus the
flip. Playing a growly scientist jailed for killing Rwandan park
rangers, Hopkins is watchable, which he always is, and believable,
which he usually is, and ogrish, which he sometimes is. He's also
one of a few remotely interesting elements in a movie so fat with
cliches it needs liposuction to squeeze through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' was directed by Jon Turteltaub (who gave us the
more felicitously cliched ``Phenomenon'') and ``suggested'' by
Daniel Quinn's eco-novel ``Ishmael,'' implying that not much other
than environmentalism and large primates were borrowed from it.
Hopkins is Ethan Powell, a career-obsessed anthropologist who
spends two years living in the African jungle with a family of
gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell whacks a pair of rangers with a wooden club, he gets
arrested, turns mute and is quickly extradited to the psychotics'
ward in a foul Florida prison. There he encounters Theo Caulder
(Cuba Gooding Jr.), a young, ladder-climbing shrink with an
unctuous mentor (Donald Sutherland, no slouch in the hair
department) and the naive belief that he can get the prisoner to
answer a list of dry psychiatric questions.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he hasn't seen enough movies. If Theo had only bothered
to rent ``Silence of the Lambs,'' he would have realized that
jailed killers always seize control of every interview with all
young saplings. ``These sessions can be your opportunity,'' he
says, delivering the sort of psycho-squishy aphorism that litters
Gerald DiPego's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, Cuba Gooding is a fine actor. He exudes smarts, handles
dialogue with trim economy and holds his own with the big bear
Hopkins, who has a way of eating lesser co-stars. Their wrangling
(some of it literal) is entertaining in a skanky, visceral way,
like watching a bull trying to gore a matador or a woman pulling
her boyfriend's hair on ``Jerry Springer.'' You know Powell is
going to have the upper hand, but still, it's sick fun when he
slaps duct tape on Theo's mouth and forces him to confess his
inadequacies in thick red crayon.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what happens: Theo learns The Truth of what happened on
that fated day in the forest. Guess what else happens: He begins to
regard Powell as a friend, a teacher, a guru who awakens him to the
brutish arrogance of human beings. He also spends a major subplot
trying to reform the psych ward (peopled with offensive stock
wackos) and a minor subplot trying to patch up Powell's
dysfunctional relationship with his daughter (Maura Tierney,
underused).
</P>
<P>
   All of this is done to the tune of Danny Elfman's noisy,
sniffling score, which launches into a celestial chorus whenever
Hopkins happens to glance at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse us, but isn't it time to call a moratorium on heavenly
choirs? No more of those _ ever, on any movie soundtrack, under any
circumstances. No more people standing in the rain, arms
outstretched, faces broad and placid, as the healing powers of
water baptize them anew. And no more variations on ``I Am
Spartacus!'' There's got to be some other way to convey the
brotherhood of the oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more thing: the Hopkins hair. Snip it.

`GET REAL' CARRIES UNIVERSAL APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' is a coming-of-age film, a coming-out film, a
falling-to-pieces film and a film about coming together. It is
small and smart, painful and funny.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Simon Shore (``The English Wife,'' for British
television) from Patrick Wilde's adaptation of his own stage play
(``What's Wrong With Angry?''), ``Get Real'' rests on a simple
plot: Boy meets boy. Boy loves boy. Boy and boy cope variously, and
furtively, with the pressures of being gay adolescents in a
straight world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tale of forbidden love, told with a trickle of references
to ``Romeo and Juliet.'' It is not, therefore, either original or
surprising; anyone who's seen a few high-school movies knows
exactly which characters are going to turn out to be homophobic
louts. But Wilde's script maneuvers around stereotypes so deftly
that even the screenplay's most obvious moralizing _ about
acceptance, and love, and damaging assumptions _ never gets
saccharine or preachy. And Shore directs with a generous heart but
scant sentimentality, drawing fresh performances from a young,
mostly unknown cast.
</P>
<P>
   The standout is Ben Silverstone, whose biggest role thus far was
the young Humbert Humbert in Adrian Lyne's ``Lolita.'' As Steven, a
closeted British teen-ager with a yen for the Big Man On Campus,
Silverstone has a man-boy weariness that's half ironic
self-possession, half vulnerable schoolkid. He may brag about the
hunk he snared in the public toilets, but he's still just a child
yearning for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Steven's affections is John (Brad Gorton), a
popular, wavy-maned track star who seems to incite the lust of
every girl in school. By all indications he's straight as a pencil;
he even dates a model, surely the gold standard of male
heterosexuality. But out of nowhere, John hits on Steve in a
bathroom _ rattling Steve, terrifying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what came over me,'' he says, and quickly
disavows the urge that led him there. From the beginning, one thing
is clear: This ain't gonna be easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet John can't keep away from Steven. Despite his misgivings,
the two become lovers _ stealth lovers, sworn to secrecy and
determined to keep up facades. Both are closeted, but John is
petrified; he can't admit he's gay to himself, much less the track
team. And as they embark on their affair, the agony of being true
to each other and false to everyone else begins to chip away at
their romance, their friendship and their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   The moral is clear: Society should accept kids as they are, love
as it is and Get Real. But Shore and Wilde have crafted such a
big-hearted, character-driven story that even its most brazen
speechifying doesn't feel awkward; it's dramatically apt.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton brings transparent suffering to the riven John, turning
what might have been a boiler-plate dim jock into a complex,
sympathetic character. The rest of the cast _ including David
Lumsden as Steven's blindered dad and Charlotte Brittain as Linda,
his staunch best pal _ add humor and light to an already affable
film.
</P>
<P>
   Like most movies about randy teens (gay or straight), ``Get
Real'' takes a relaxed attitude toward sex. There's much discussion
of the act, little discussion of the consequences. Then again,
adolescents are always confusing sex for love. They're always
experimenting. And they're always looking for ways to escape _
themselves, their fears, their sense that the world at large is
always watching.
</P>
<P>
   It's a universal tale, and anyone who survived puberty will
relate.

CLINTON USES RECESS APPOINTMENT TO NAME HORMEL TO LUXEMBOURG POST

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton used a recess appointment Friday
to install San Francisco philanthropist and gay advocate James C.
Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, bypassing opposition from the
Republican Senate leadership that sidetracked the nomination for 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, issued a statement
saying: ``The president today announced the recess appointment of
James C. Hormel to serve as United States ambassador to
Luxembourg.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel thus becomes the first openly gay American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   By naming him to the diplomatic post during a congressional
recess, Clinton overcame a stubborn political stalemate with
conservative Republican senators who have blocked action on the
nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved it
in a 16-2 vote in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. _ who
likened homosexuality to alcoholism, sex addiction and kleptomania
and urged Americans to help gays change their sexual orientation _
refused to lift the so-called ``holds'' that the four conservatives
had imposed, thus refusing to bring the nomination to the Senate
floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Congress returns from its 10-day Memorial Day recess on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution empowers a president to make recess
appointments and says that they ``shall expire at the end of
(Congress') next session,'' meaning that Hormel can serve until
January of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, communications director at the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, said
Clinton's action was ``a bold move that is a testament to his
commitment to treating all people fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``This fight was never about trying to get the
first openly gay ambassador. This has always been about making sure
that anti-gay bias was not a barrier to good people doing public
service for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes Clinton's action will not invite retaliation
from Capitol Hill. ``I don't see how this is going to change things
one way or another,'' Smith said. ``The usual suspects are going to
be jacked up about this, just as they are about all gay issues.
They will continue to try to enact policies that discriminate
against gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics and conservative activists had criticized
Hormel's nomination, expressing concern that the former dean of the
University of Chicago Law School might use the Luxembourg post to
proselytize others to embrace homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a founder of the Human Rights Campaign, sought to allay
the concerns of critics last year with a letter to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use, nor do I think it appropriate to use, the
office of the ambassador to advocate any personal views that I may
hold on any issue,'' Hormel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics focused on Hormel's $500,000 donation to the San
Francisco Main Public Library, which then named a collection of gay
and lesbian material after the contributor. Researchers at the
library have access not only to the papers of San Francisco gay
activists such as the late Harvey Milk and Randy Shilts, but also
to materials provided by controversial groups such as the North
American Man Boy Love Association, an organization that critics
accuse of advocating pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Hormel also has contributed to a program that sends
speakers to discuss homosexuality with elementary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton's recess appointment of Hormel will
enable the ambassador to serve in Luxembourg for the remaining 18
months of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's maneuver gives the appointee all the legal authority
of a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate but not the
political clout that a Senate confirmation conveys.
</P>
<P>
   The senators who announced their ``holds'' on Hormel's
nomination are Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.; James Inhofe, R-Okla., and
Bob Smith, R-N.H. The fourth remains anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had won commitments
from at least 60 senators to support confirmation of Hormel, 66,
the heir to the Hormel Meat Co. fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used recess appointments in the past to install
nominees for whom he could not win Senate confirmation. For
instance, he defied Senate opponents in December 1997 to give a
recess appointment to California civil rights lawyer Bill Lann Lee
to serve as acting assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's civil rights division. Clinton acted after his
nomination of Lee, a prominent Asian American civil rights lawyer,
had languished before the Senate Judiciary Committee for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renominated Lee to the post on March 5, setting the
stage for Lee to continue in the post as an acting assistant
attorney general for the remainder of Clinton's presidency.

THE FALL OF FRANCE 59 YEARS AGO WAS A SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Sunday is the 55th anniversary of D-Day,
which in this country is probably the best-known battle of World
War II. Less well known than how D-Day happened is why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   What, on June 6, 1944, was France doing in Nazi hands in the
first place? The answer is both depressing and highly instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before D-Day _ in June 1940 _ France fell to the
Nazis. Her swift and complete surrender, after only six weeks of
combat, shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the fall of France was _ and still is _ more than the story
of an amazing military upset. It is also the story of how
attitudes, both public and private, undermined an entire nation
long before Germany fired a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, France fell so fast even Hitler was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the war in September 1939, France seemed well
equipped to defend herself. Possessing a great military tradition,
an excellent army _ the finest in Europe, according to Stalin _ and
the pride of having already beaten the Germans once this century,
she appeared, without question, ready to beat them again.
</P>
<P>
   However, as soon became clear, there were flaws in French
military preparations. Because the thick forests of the Ardennes
looked like tough going, even for tanks, they were left virtually
undefended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Maginot Line was reinforced, while the remaining
troops joined the British on the Belgian border. But it was
precisely through the Ardennes that Germany's panzers pounced,
straight into the heart of France.
</P>
<P>
   The second flaw was even more serious. France was well-supplied
with planes, artillery, tanks and infantry, but _ unlike in Germany
_ they did not operate in tandem, but rather as competing services.
</P>
<P>
   This competition crippled communications and the coordination of
action; one order took over 48 hours to travel from headquarters to
the front. By then, the front had become the rear, and the order
was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   The third _ and most vital _ flaw was strategic. France won
World War I by mounting a ferocious defense against a slow-moving
enemy, and was ready to do so again. But the Nazi war machine was
fast-moving: This was its very essence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the French knew that, having seen Germany in action in
Poland, they persisted in stubbornly planning for a gradual
conflict and a long defensive struggle. Then they were stupefied
when the Nazis didn't play along.
</P>
<P>
   All three of these flaws contributed to France's fall. But they
don't explain why she fell so fast. That failure of will lies deep
within the culture and society of pre-war France.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bloch, arguably this century's greatest historian _ and a
veteran of both world wars _ explained it best. France collapsed in
the face of the Nazis, Bloch said, because before the war even
began, she had already collapsed internally.
</P>
<P>
   Her leaders had long disdained those who voted them into office;
her electorate had long believed all politicians were corrupt. The
result was a democracy which distrusted democracy, and a nation
which, when the Nazis invaded, was already at war _ with itself.
</P>
<P>
   What Bloch called ``the timidity of the nation'' manifested
itself in numerous ways: a second-rate press which lied to the
people _ and which people knew lied _ but which nobody bothered to
challenge; an educational system out of touch with the needs of the
nation; a leftist tradition too doctrinaire to distinguish between
capitalism and fascism, and a right wing so in love with the past
it could find nothing of merit in the present.
</P>
<P>
   None of these woes was, by itself, enough to destroy a great
nation; together, however, they made France so morally weak that _
when combined with her military weaknesses _ they produced a
surrender breathtaking both in speed and totality.
</P>
<P>
   This same moral weakness prevailed for the next four years, as
the toadies of Vichy France collaborated with the Nazis, right till
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Great nations are made up of great people; when a great nation
falters, its people die. The death of France led to the death of
her greatest scholar; Marc Bloch became a resistance fighter, was
captured by the Nazis, tortured and _ 10 days after D-Day _
executed. Witnesses report his last words were ``Vvive la France.''
</P>
<P>
   Since we appear, at century's end, to be suffering similar
symptoms to those of mid-century France, we should ask ourselves
what we can do to cure ourselves, and how soon we can do it, before
another great nation aids its enemies by defeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   For how much wiser _ and easier _ and less heartbreaking _ it is
to combat cynicism, distrust and moral weakness now, than to read
about our martyred heroes at some bleak future date.

 &HT;    KUKES: A POOR ALBANIAN CITY HOSTS EVEN POORER REFUGEES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    With Photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ In the cool springtime mornings here, acrid
smoke hangs close to the ground from the burning garbage in a dump
at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The water supply, now rationed to two-hours per day, is low and
only the lucky few who rise before the sun will have showers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everywhere is the rank odor of open sewage and sweat as
the sun inches higher in the sky, and the temperature rises with
it.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the day for 25,000 locals in Kukes and four times as
many refugees living in and around the ramshackle town now
distinguished as the home to Kosovo's dispossessed ethnic
Albanians. Roughly 400,000 refugees have passed through Kukes, and
100,000 have remained in dusty tent camps and crowded private
homes, making it the epicenter of Europe's biggest humanitarian
crisis since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of fame we could have done without,''
concedes Mayor Safet Sula, 37, a democratic reformer and former
university professor. ``It goes without saying that we have big
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a tide of impoverished refugees descending on a similar
small town in the United States. Now, imagine this town was already
dirt poor, falling apart and rife with unemployment before the
influx of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of Kukes, a town blessed with beautiful
mountains and cursed by fate. Situated in remote northern Albania
and, like the rest of the country, severed politically for much of
this century from the rest of the world, Kukes is a town that
history largely passed by.
</P>
<P>
   The current town, with its deteriorating block apartments and
potholed streets, was built between 1962 and 1978 after the
construction of a huge hydro-electric dam, whose reservoir flooded
the valley and the historic village of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the people residing among the Alp-like Vikut
Mountains here stretch back to the Illyrian tribes, identified by
the Greeks when they settled the coastal areas of what is now
Albania in the 7th century B.C. Next came the Romans, whose
spreading empire incorporated the area as part of the province of
Macedonia in 146 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Turks followed to encompass the remote area as
part of the Ottoman Empire. But frigid in the winter and broiling
in the summer, Kukes never showed much promise for settlement or
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, historian Edward Gibbon wrote of Albania
that ``within sight of Italy is (a land) less known than the

</P>
<P>
   No one can seem to agree on why the place is called Kukes (which
Albanians alternatively pronounce ``kook-ESS,'' ``KOOK-see,'' or
simply ``KOOKS''). One legend says Kukes derives its name from the
cuckoo bird. Others believe two more plausible theories: that the
name either comes from the Illyrian word for ``forest,'' or that
Kukes took its name from a 17th century Turkish military leader who
commanded a garrison nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its roots, it was never a large place. A 1938 estimate
put the population at only 1,800. Electricity did not arrive until
1946, when engineers plundered a German tank left behind after the
war and used its diesel engine as a generator.
</P>
<P>
   Italian engineers carved the roads across the rough mountains in
the 1920s and little has been done to improve them since. Until
1991, private ownership of cars was restricted by the communist
regime, so few automobiles plowed the paths now being chewed up by
heavy trucks delivering supplies and moving refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the region's knotty history, schoolchildren learn of
legendary battles fought in the Kukes valley between Albanian
militias outnumbered by powerful armies -- the Turks in 1909 and
the Serbs in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist times, under the rule of Albanian dictator Ever
Hoxha, Kukes was eyed as a potential tourist spot, as it sits
astride the man-made lake and scenic mountains. But mining of
copper and chromium, once the town's major job-producer, dumped its
by-products directly into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   When Communism fell, the mines went out of business, leaving
people in Kukes without jobs and with a lake tainted by heavy
metals.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest public building, the whitewashed Mosque of Salim Ben
Mahfuz, was opened in 1995, financed by an Egyptian religious
foundation. But almost no one attends it. While Albania is a mostly
Muslim country, its legacy of Communism means there are few devout.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per capita income of Albania, a country of 3.4
million, is $830, the lowest in Europe. Officially, unemployment in
Kukes was 40 percent before the onset of the refugee crisis.
Unofficially, the figure is put at 80 percent. gap???
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the refugees live in private homes, not the
camps, stretching the resources of Kukes to their breaking point.
The city has asked international relief agencies for help to expand
its aging water system. The mountains of garbage being generated by
the population boom are simply being piled at the northern end of
town and torched.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very poor place. There are no jobs for the Albanians
who live here, much less for the refugees,'' said Imri Gashi, 38,
who worked as a construction foreman in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The main occupation is trading, much of it illegal. Since
Communist rule collapsed in Albania in 1991, the government has
been unable to control its borders. Bandits rule in much of the
northeast, emblematic of the nationwide lawlessness following a
coup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the world will never really know us -- ever,''
laments Nasif Dukle, a local teacher and the town's historian.
``I'm afraid it will be a strong and lasting memory of war and of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis has been a boom to local hotels and restaurants
in the town. English-speaking Albanians are earning as much as $100
a day working for aid agencies and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it was sent from heaven. It is raining money, and
maybe it will last only another month. But everyone is making as
much as they can now,'' says Jonas, a local translator.
</P>
<P>
   One tangible gift of the refugee crisis is a new dirt and gravel
airfield, built by engineers from the United Arab Emirates and
replacing an unusable runway built in 1937 by the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   The town's mayor wants more. He puts faith in NATO that the
Balkans can be put straight, and Kukes will for the first time in
its history have a chance to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that things will change in a good way,'' Sula, the
mayor, says. ``If the problems of Kosovo are solved and the border
is open, we can have new markets for our goods and new friendships.
This could be an important crossroads for that.''

   LEHZE, Albania _ It is early June, but the talk is of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, it is already stifling in this old
warehouse that was used in communist days to house tractors for
cooperative farms. The moist smell of perspiration is heavy in the
concrete block building that is now home to more than 560 refugees
from Kosovo. They have been here six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people on Earth must live this way?'' asks Nugret
Termkolli, a leader of the refugees who come from the tiny Kosovar
village of Bardhi I Madh(CQ). ``We are like animals in a barn only
worse,'' he says, walking down a row of cardboard boxes, blankets
and foam mattresses arranged into individual family living spaces.
``We have no toilets or suitable places to wash. The world has
forgotten us.''
</P>
<P>
   Families here sleep on makeshift beds laid on the hard concrete
floor. The women take turns at three propane-fueled stoves to cook
meals of beans and crude fried bread for their families. Food is
scarce, brought every week or so by an Englishman the refugees only
know as ``George.''
</P>
<P>
   Their water comes from a single outside hose. The children have
diarrhea. Two refugees have died. No one knows why. Doctors have
visited here twice.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of spending the winter here horrifies Termkolli.
``It's impossible,'' he says, with a tone of frustration changing
to panic. ``We have no way to keep warm and there will be an
epidemic of diseases. We would be better off taking our chances
with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, it becomes more likely that winter will
come and go before the souls in this tractor warehouse see their
homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's acceptance of an international peace plan by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government, refugees and
aid officials here alike consider it a foregone conclusion that the
nearly 450,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania will be away from home
months -- perhaps years.
</P>
<P>
   There are still the mines, they say. Many of the homes have been
burned to the ground. But most important, they just don't trust
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to believe Milosevic any more. But if NATO
goes into Kosovo, we will follow immediately,'' said Istref Veseli,
a 43-year-old from Vucitrn who had been imprisoned by Serbs for 21
days and arrived in Albania two weeks ago after being released.
</P>
<P>
   His family is still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to sit in tents in Kosovo than tents in Albania,''
he said, referring to the fact that many homes back home had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Kosovo have been through so much, but it is now
almost certain that they must endure much more. The next few weeks
will be grim. Balkan summers are hot, with many days bringing
temperatures above 100 degrees, while many refugee camps are built
on flat, treeless plains. Aid workers worry about dehydration and
disease among weakened refugees, particularly the old, infirm and
infants.
</P>
<P>
   And then they will confront the cold, wet winter with its
specters of exposure and even more disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many camps in Albania were thrown up on sites
that don't meet minimal standards for health and safety. But relief
groups, under the double pressure of sheltering the flood of
refugees and getting out of the military's way, say they have
little choice but to use what they know are unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of land the government provides is not really usable,''
said Carsten Voelz, the manager of Camp Hope, a U.S. camp for
20,000 being constructed in southern Albania. ``But you do what you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Land ownership in this country, which until 1990 forbade private
citizens from owning property, is a complex issue that renders most
sites useless. Aid groups have begun erecting shelters only to have
armed men interrupt their work to evict them. Consequently, many of
the sites made available by the Albanian government were so
undesirable that nobody was willing to fight over them.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Hope, Albania's largest camp, is on a broad, flat plain that
offers no cover from the sun in the summer or wind and rain in the
winter. The 200-acre site is below sea level, and drains poorly, a
situation made worse by the fact that local farmers for decades
have flooded the land as a way to irrigate it. It offers little
water -- the ultimate factor that limits capacity -- so camp
planners hope to pipe water from a well being dug about 10 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   At Spitalli, a German camp designed for 6,000 near the port city
of Durres, conditions are worse. The camp was placed across a
gravel road from a 20-foot wide channel that carries raw sewage
from Durres to a pool from which it is pumped untreated into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   However, the aging pumps -- a best guess places them at about 30
years old -- often breakdown, creating a pool of smelly, putrid and
ultimately unhealthy soup to gather near the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the system of ditches dug between the rows of
tents was so poorly engineered in the haste to build the camp that
water doesn't drain away from the camp. It stands brown and frothy
behind the tents and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes
and other sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster,'' said Roland Amvhein, a C.A.R.E.
International engineer who has been frustrated in his struggle to
correct the problem. ``We try to help these people, and then we put
them in a place like this. Does this make any sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Taillfer, Spitalli's manager, believes the camp must
be abandoned as soon as possible -- certainly before winter. ``It
was not a good site to begin with; in fact, it was a bad site,''
she said. ``The next step must be to move these people to hard
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The nagging, unresolved question is where.
</P>
<P>
   So far, aid workers are far from having an answer even as time
is running out to prepare shelter by September in the mountains and
October in the lowlands. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is
trying with rising urgency to find winter shelter for the refugees
and already is shipping in 15,000 winter tents. But its efforts
thus far have fallen well short of the projected need.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has identified more than 150 sites both
in buildings and parcels of land for shelter. Yet, only slightly
more than half have been opened to refugees. The maximum identified
capacity is less than 350,000 -- still more than 100,000 less than
the total of refugees now in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Few existing camps provide conditions for refugees to survive
the winter and will have to be radically modified or refugees will
have to be moved to vacant buildings adapted for them the choice
aid workers prefer.
</P>
<P>
   But, far too few buildings remain identified, and the general
condition of vacant buildings in Albania is exceedingly poor --
making it expensive to make them livable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Korca district, for example, city officials have
identified about 40 buildings that can be converted to housing for
about 50 refugees each, or about 2,000 refugees. Yet, one camp in
the district already has 2,700 refugees who will have to be
relocated to winter quarters, while the French army is finishing a
pair of summer camps that will house up to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   As she awaits word on the proposed peace plan that would halt
the NATO bombing and allow the refugees back into Kosovo, Marci Van
Dyke, a Relief International worker who manages the Qatromi camp,
worries about the arithmetic. ``We also are hearing that we may see
another 60,000 refugees from Macedonia,'' she said over coffee in a
shaded canteen at the sun-baked camp. ``There's no way that would
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, pressures are mounting on Albania to accept
even more refugees, perhaps driving the total to 1 million.
Officials in Macedonia, where there are 250,000 refugees, are
demanding that they be relocated. And NATO officials are pressing
to move the 30,000 refugees near the Yugoslavian border with
Albania in Kukes, which has been the scene of increasing military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a hurry to relocate them because something bad is
going to happen in Kukes,'' said Paul Giannone, an emergency
planner from C.A.R.E.'s Atlanta office. ``We have absolutely no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, conditions in Albania already are fragile. The crisis thus
far has been contained because of the hospitality of Albanian
families, who are housing an estimated 250,000 refugees in their
homes. But officials worry that their generosity cannot last
forever and that the burden of housing and feeding the refugees
will severely strain the resources of so many families in Europe's
poorest nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government is offering each host family a monthly
supplement of $10 per refugee with a maximum of $120, but officials
worry this is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kujtim Dashi, a municipal official in the Lezhe prefecture in
northern Albania, said the strain on host families of having
usually more than 10 refugees in their homes is immense. ``In
Albania, we say that 'Our house belongs to God, and our guests,'
but this is very difficult for them,'' said Dashi, who said that
nearly 29,000 refugees have registered in his prefecture. ``Even
Albanians have their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The strain already is proving too much. Aid workers report that
growing numbers of refugees are leaving host families to seek other
shelter. The British-built Qatromi camp in the mountains near
Macedonia already has received 1,000 refugees who had been with
host families.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rising tension among Albanian families, there
is growing hostility among the refugees who are frustrated by the
harsh realities of life as a ward of relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the mounting pressure of the refugee crisis may be too
much for Albania to bear. Genc Ruli, the president of the Institute
of Contemporary Studies, worries that Albania is sitting on a
ticking refugee bomb. ``This relative stability we see now is
fragile and temporary,'' Ruli said. ``There is a real chance that
we could descend into chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Near the tiny village of Balldren, a mechanic's garage provides
shelter to 58 refugees. They have lived there seven weeks. Among
them are women as old as 90 and newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few men, Shaban, Krasniqi, a 42-year-old welder,
speaks longingly of his two-story home near Pristina, Kosovo's
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if my home is burned down, I would go back there,' he
says, considering the prospect of spending the next months living
in the garage. ``Even there, we could face the winter when it
comes, making the best of it with our families in our own places.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks at the white concrete block building and shakes his
head. ``But here,'' he says. ``NATO must not let the winter catch
us here.''

detected years ago

<P>
   TORREON, Mexico _ The first studies indicating that lead dust
was poisoning children in this northern Mexican industrial city go
back about 20 years, enough to produce two generations of victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before Julio Cesar Olage, 4, and his sister
Guadalupe, 1, were hospitalized in May with enough lead in their
blood to put them in a coma and cause permanent brain damage and
physical harm.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother, Esperanza Olage, fears it may be too late
for her toddlers despite the treatment they are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my other children have been in special education,'' she
said, fighting grief and exhaustion. ``Just look at that one over
there, Maria Elena. She's 18 now, and she can't read or write.''
</P>
<P>
   Olage's youngest children, who have spent two weeks in the
hospital, are among the more than 2,800 children under 12 in
Torreon who have been identified in recent months as having
unacceptable, even extremely dangerous levels of lead in their
blood that could cause mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Torreon has fast become synonymous with neglect and
the tragic consequences of letting industries pollute the
environment, no matter how many jobs they provide.
</P>
<P>
   In one Torreon neighborhood, more than 90 percent of all the
children are contaminated with lead, many at levels so high they
should be under close medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   That neighborhood, the working-class barrio of Luis Echeverria,
is just a fence away from Met-Mex Penoles, the world's
fourth-largest metal refinery.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Del Pilar family, whose house is next to the
fence, lead has poisoned two generations that has breathed and
ingested dust from the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta del Pilar was 3 in 1981 when she tested high for lead
during a survey of schoolchildren here conducted by Mexican
university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   She had 34 micrograms of lead for every deciliter of blood,
which at that time was considered abnormal in the United States and
now is considered enough to cause mental retardation if exposure is
not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican environmental officials failed to react to the research.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Julieta -- who was never able to learn to read or
write -- gave birth to a son, Juan Alberto, 1. He recently tested
at an alarming 60 and Julieta, who was tested because she was
breastfeeding, was told her level was now 67.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta consider a lead
level over 10 unacceptable. Children with levels over 25 should be
in treatment and removed immediately from contaminated sites. Those
with levels over 70 are considered a medical emergency. Children
are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning because their bodies
and brains are still developing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 2,800 contaminated children of Torreon, 732 measured
at levels between 25 and 39. Another 604 registered levels between
40 and 69. The total of children over 70 is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 children have been hospitalized so far, including
4-year-old Julio Cesar Olage, who was admitted at a potentially
devastating 96 and 1-year-old Guadalupe Olage, who measured 83.
</P>
<P>
   Torreon, a stark, desert city 300 miles south of the Texas
border, was forced to confront this epidemic earlier this year,
when the Coahuila state government here ordered the Penoles
refinery to conduct a massive clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   This includes installing new equipment to contain the lead dust
released from raw ore trucked into the refinery, and working with
health officials to hospitalize some children and make sure others
are treated with vitamin and mineral supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Using a $6.4 million fund it has established, the company must
also buy the families' property in Luis Echeverria so it can be
demolished and cleansed of heavy metals and the families relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Many families here are fighting with the company over offers for
their houses, which they say are too low. Meanwhile, the majority
of the affected children are still living in the neighborhood,
which Penoles sweeps and cleans every day with industrial vacuums
and ordinary brooms in an attempt to lower the lead count in
children remaining in the barrio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have children with long-term damage. I can't deny
that,'' said Edmundo Mesta, a doctor and occupational health
specialist who has worked for Penoles for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Mesta has been put in charge of registering children, cleaning
the barrio and trying to reverse Penoles' credibility gap with the
community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, Penoles was audited by environmental officials
and ordered to improve equipment to reduce dangers inside the plant
and threatening emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking inside the plant, at our workers and their
health,'' Mesta said. ``But no one took the time to stop and think
about what we have done to the community in our almost 100 years of
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesta and environmental officials say that lead dust wafting
over the fence from deliveries of raw minerals is the prime source
that's been poisoning the children. Neither emissions from
processing or a giant heap of slag that towers over the refinery's
property are culprits, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say the full magnitude of Torreon's
environmental health disaster -- one of Mexico's worst to date --
hasn't yet been measured.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and toxicologists say children should also be
tested for traces of other heavy metals, including cadmium and
arsenic. Both are carcinogenic and are so abundant around the
Torreon factory they too pose a major health risk, according to a
study by Dartmouth Medical School published in April.
</P>
<P>
   More children living in barrios beyond Luis Echeverria should
also be tested, said Jose Manuel Velasco, a Torreon pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could a minimum of 6,000 children affected,'' Velasco
said. ``The government's work is not over with.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Velasco found lead in alarming quantities in infants
and toddlers he was treating for other ailments. He reported to
state health officials, who did nothing, and then brought his
grievances to the state legislature, which ordered testing.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been slow to adopt standards governing lead emissions
and other safety requirements that could have prevented the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists argue that studies indicating that Torreon
was in trouble have long been dismissed because officials were
reluctant to crack down on powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologist Lilia Albert began surveys of lead in Torreon's
children in 1978 while she was affiliated with Mexico City's Center
for Investigation and Advanced Studies of the National
Polytechnical Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ``tried to minimize our findings,'' Albert said. ``I
think the problem was that they didn't want to affect the economy
because the refinery employs so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penoles refinery, owned by Alberto Bailleres, one of
Mexico's wealthiest men, employs about 2,100 here.
</P>
<P>
   Torreon, a city of 500,000, is a company town, where Penoles
distributes coloring books to children about a happy miner and a
main street is called Metallurgical Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although she can't recall exactly when, Albert reported her
initial findings of high lead levels at an academic conference not
long after she took hair samples from children in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   She also informed federal environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   They told her the hair samples were too few and were
insufficient proof of a problem, Albert said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert's findings as well as the conclusions of other surveys
taken in 1981 were published in a document in 1986 she says was
also ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The company and federal environmental officials argue that the
studies were not corroborated or widely disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a toxicologist at Mexico's University of Durango
-- working in cooperation with the refinery -- published a study
that also confirmed that children were contaminated by lead.
</P>
<P>
   That helped spotlight Torreon's epidemic, although some in the
community had already been demanding action for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story of complicity between the company and the
government,'' said Francisco Valdez, a university science professor
in Torreon who said he called studies to officials' attention more
than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, parents keeping vigil at Torreon hospitals and those
with children still in the barrio are worried their children are
not receiving proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 children in hospitals are receiving succimer, a
drug that removes lead from the body in extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how many they're treating, that's nothing,'' said
Andres Lugo of the West Texas Regional Poison Center in El Paso,
Texas. He was asked to go to Torreon to give doctors training in
the treatment of heavy metal poisoning.

HERO OF LATIN SOUND PREPARES TO RELEASE NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREG HAYMES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran guitar hero Carlos Santana _ a pioneer of the Latin-rock
sound, one of the sparkplugs of the 1969 Woodstock festival and a
member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame _ is about to release a
new album that will almost surely guarantee his return to the top
of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Slated for release June 15, the album titled ``Supernatural'' is
Santana's first for Arista Records and reunites him with Arista
executive Clive Davis, who signed Santana to his first record deal
with Columbia Records more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural'' also finds the guitar great collaborating with
a top-notch collection of special guests _ longtime friends and
compatriots as well as newcomers _ who have been influenced by
Santana's music over the years including Eric Clapton, Dave
Matthews, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Everlast, Rob Thomas (of
Matchbox 20), Eagle Eye Cherry and more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the parade of multiplatinum musicians who grace the
album, Santana didn't have his eyes on chart-success when he was in
the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album was conceived directly to touch our children in
junior high schools, high schools and universities. With everything
that's happening in our schools, all of these shootings, it's
important to create something that can bring us all together and
not divide us,'' he said during a recent telephone interview from
his New York City hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music is not entertainment. This is healing music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look in the dictionary under `healing,' it says `To
be whole and sound.' That's how I wanted the music to sound, with
that kind of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a deeply spiritual side to Santana's
instantly recognizable, supremely soulful guitar playing. For all
of the ferocious fire and intensity that he pours into his playing,
there's an undeniably spiritual center to his music, a kind of calm
at the eye of the raging, swirling sound.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Supernatural'' is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The ball started rolling back in February, when Santana
performed with golden girl Lauryn Hill at the Grammy Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Clapton was sitting in the front row that night, and he
wanted to know if he could participate in my album,'' Santana
recalls. ``He said, `If you can hear me on your album, I'd like to
be on it, if there's any room for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Santana laughs. ```Oh, my God,' I said. `Sure.' From there, it
was like a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, the album was really just a concept, but kind of
like the Bible says, `This begat that, and that begat this,'''
Santana explains. ``It wasn't intended to be an all-star-studded
album, but the songs really dictated different singers and
different musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really grateful because everyone who participated really
brought the best of their hearts. There was no ego-tripping. Nobody
had a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most musicians would be touring straight through to the end of
the year to support such an impressive new album. Santana takes a
more civilized approach to his roadwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my wife and I had our first child, we decided that it
was important to find a balance,'' Santana says. ``So I go out on
the road for three weeks, and then I'm home for three weeks. I'll
go out for four weeks and stay home for four weeks. Five weeks is
the most time that I'm willing to spend out on tour at one time. I
don't care how much money they dangle in my face, after five weeks
I go home and just be a father, take out the garbage and stuff like
that. Being a person is more important to me than being a
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more important than my family my wife, my
children, my mom. I'm a person first, middle and last. It's just
that I happen to play the guitar, and people like it, and that's
wonderful. It beats washing dishes for a living. So that's what I
do, but that's not who I am completely.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Santana lineup of musicians has constantly evolved over the
years, and includes such distinguished alumni as keyboardist Gregg
Rollie, drummer Michael Shrieve, vocalist Buddy Miles, bassist
Alphonso Johnson and guitarist Neal Schon (who will be playing at
the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
later this month as a member of Journey).
</P>
<P>
   The current band features former Tower of Power keyboardist
Chester D. Thompson, former Miles Davis bassist Benny Rietveld,
percussion master Karl Perazzo, conga player Raul Rekow, drummer
Rodney Holmes and vocalist Tony Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Santana is often credited with inventing the fusion of Latin and
rock with his early albums ``Caravanserai,'' ``Santana III,''
``Abraxas'' and his self-titled '69 debut. He doesn't see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, one of the first people who cracked that door open was
Ritchie Valens with `Donna' and `La Bamba,''' Santana says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent upsurge in popularity of Ricky Martin and the
whole rock en espanol movement, Santana isn't comfortable with the
term ``Latin music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This music from `La Bamba' on down is really African music,''
he declares. ``So this whole wave of Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez
and Gloria Estefan is really popularizing African music. It's not
Spanish or Latin. It's really African music, whether it's a bolero,
cha-cha, rhumba or samba. Whatever you call it, it's still African
music, and I always like to clear that thing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I play, and that's what I've played from the
beginning _ African music. I combined it with blues, and that's
what made it different, but it's always been African music.''
</P>
<P>
   The blues have remained one of the foundations of Santana's
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can play the blues completely nakedly and truthfully,
then you can play just about any kind of music,'' Santana explains.
``You can't lie when you're playing the blues. You're either
telling the truth or you're trying to fake it. You can't hide.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the young guitarist formed his band back in 1966,
it was originally called the Santana Blues Band. Three years later,
the band, with the name then shortened simply to Santana, burst
onto the national rock scene with a historic performance at the
Woodstock festival, even before the band had released its first
album.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his most vivid memory of that legendary
Woodstock performance, Santana doesn't hesitate. ``When I close my
eyes, I can still hear the sound,'' he says. ``I remember that I
could hear the sound before I played it. I heard it inside my head,
and then it came out through my fingers. Then through the monitor
speakers. Then the PA. Then from the PA, the sound went out all the
way across this ocean of bodies. Then it came back to me again. So
I was hearing a kind of six or seven dimensional sound coming in
rounds.''

STUDY TO FOCUS ON RISE IN DIABETES IN BORDER STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Health officials plan an ambitious, binational
project to try to tackle the rising incidence of diabetes along the
U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The undertaking, which will entail door-to-door contacts with
nearly 3,000 border residents, involves the six Mexican border
states as well as Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials from each country will attempt to monitor the
increasing prevalence of diabetes among people who live along the
border. They also plan a comprehensive diabetes prevention
education campaign that would be tailored to the specific health
needs of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Espey, an epidemiologist with the New Mexico
Department of Health, told members of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health
Association on Thursday that the existing statistics on border
diabetes and related risk factors are not extensive enough to
adequately measure the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it really looks like there is a much higher
diabetes burden on the border,'' he said. ``But we need a more
complete picture about conditions on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Espey said, is the lack of a uniform
sampling method. The aim of the new initiative, called the
Collaborative U.S.-Mexican Diabetes Prevention and Control Project,
is to gather comparative data from both sides of the border, Espey
said. Existing statistics indicate Mexican border states have
experienced a dramatic rise in recent years in the mortality rates
associated with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Those increases have ranged from 5 percent to 13 percent. The
U.S. side of the border also is struggling with the scope of the
problem. For instance, the prevalence of diabetes in the lower Rio
Grande Valley is about three times the national average,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The onset of diabetes in adults is most often associated with
poor diet, obesity and other health factors. The disease attacks
the eyes, kidneys and heart, although proper medical treatment can
reduce the effects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the border project remains in the development stages,
public health officials plan to begin a door-to-door survey of
residents at risk for diabetes. Health officials plan to interview
350 residents in each of the four U.S. states and 250 residents in
each of the six Mexican states.
</P>
<P>
   Information collected will include a person's height, weight,
blood pressure and access to health care. Participants then will be
given a financial incentive to follow up at a local laboratory for
diabetes glucose testing.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with information on the scope of the problem, health
officials hope to more effectively construct diabetes prevention
programs, Espey said. The survey is scheduled to begin in about six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health has committed $60,000 to fund the
initial stages of the project. Several other funding sources from
both sides of the border are ``coming together,'' Espey said.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Association's annual
meeting, held in San Antonio, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
stressed that more needs to be done to support public health in the
border region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to redouble my efforts in Congress to make sure that
this area of the country is getting its fair share of the
attention,'' she said.

<P>
   Hutchison commended the Texas Legislature for recently
earmarking $50 million for a new Border Health Institute, to be
located in El Paso. She also stressed that the North American
Development Bank needs to make more headway on certifying water,
sewer and other environmental projects along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison also said she supported collaborative efforts by the
United States and Mexico to try to eradicate tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is stunning to me that in the United States of America, we
have had a resurgence of tuberculosis,'' she said. ``This was a
disease that we thought was a disease of the past.''

mornings, acrid smoke from the garbage dump hangs close to the

few who rose before the sun will have showers. Nearly everywhere is
the rank odor of open sewage. So begins the day for more than
100,000 refugees and 25,000 locals in Kukes, a ramshackle town
famous as the home to Kosovo's dispossed. A profile of a poor town

confidential investigations into possible drug trafficking by
President Zedillo's secretary and Carlos Hank Gonzalez, one of
Mexico's wealthiest men and a two-time cabinet member. McCaffrey
said if the United States had very strong evidence of guilt, it
would have taken it to Mexican authorities. The commission is

HEAR THE YOWLS ABOUT FIREARMS AND HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been more than six weeks since the massacre at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., but the hysterical scapegoating
continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have responded to the tragedy by demanding anti-gun
legislation or by lashing out at Hollywood for its promulgation of
violent entertainment _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, to name one, has been pushing for more
extensive gun control but has also taken a potshot or two at the
show-biz folks who dish up excessive violence in movies, TV shows
and video games. According to news reports, the Hollywood elite
were so shocked by their friend Clinton's criticism of their
product that they howled in protest.
</P>
<P>
   They were reportedly most indignant about the president's
announcement that the Federal Trade Commission will spend $1
million studying the entertainment industry's use of marketing
techniques that target youthful consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Hollywood is only now discovering what so
many Americans ascertained long ago: With a friend like Clinton,
you don't need an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a card-carrying Clinton-hater to know that
the life span of Slick Willie's loyalty to any individual, group or
point of view must be calculated in terms of its political
usefulness. Since Clinton is loyal only to himself, it stands to
reason that people and ideas have value to him only as long as they
impart benefits to him.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the country is in a fever about Hollywood violence _
and now that Clinton is a lame duck who doesn't need Hollywood's
campaign contributions _ the president is free to double-cross his
pals in the show-business community.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the club, Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   The movie folk, meanwhile, continue to train their guns ... I
mean, sights ... I mean, weapons ... I mean ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's put it another way. The movie folk continue to single
out the American people's historic and cherished right to bear arms
as the cause of schoolyard violence.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has surely heard about actress/comic/talk-show host
Rosie O'Donnell's rude and irrational attack on Tom Selleck, who
thought he was appearing on her TV show for the purpose of plugging
a movie. Seems that Selleck is on record as supporting the National
Rifle Association's efforts to preserve and protect the Second
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and therefore is
beneath contempt, in O'Donnell's view.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Rosie is a national spokesperson for a
discount-store chain that rakes in big bucks through gun sales;
hypocrisy has never been an impediment to mindless rants by
bleeding-heart liberals, in or out of show business.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes actress Mia Farrow, who seems to be making a career
out of bashing Woody Allen and his curious union with one of
Farrow's adopted daughters. Heaven knows, Allen deserves any
bashing he gets, but you'd think that Farrow might have better
things to do than constantly show up on television to rehash her
unfortunate relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Let's at least give her credit for changing the subject when she
appeared on ``Larry King Live'' the other night to propose that
Congress repeal the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   After Farrow delivered a prepared and detailed diatribe about
the evils of firearms, King reminded her that owning a firearm is a
constitutional right in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's time we rethink that right,'' Farrow said, and then
proceeded to urge viewers to contact their representatives in
Congress in support of a constitutional amendment that would do
away with the Founding Fathers' guarantee of gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be fair to say that some of these people have gone off
the deep end on this subject?
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes _ the politicians blaming Hollywood and Hollywood
blaming the Constitution, and virtually no one attempting to answer
the most relevant question about the school shootings in Colorado
and elsewhere: What made those kids so angry that they transformed
themselves into homicidal maniacs?
</P>
<P>
   We could pile up guns and pipe bombs and hand grenades in front
of well-adjusted youngsters all day long, and not one of them would
consider grabbing those devices and using them to slaughter
teachers and fellow students. What has happened to kids who would
do such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to deal with that because it's too difficult. It's
much easier to lambaste moviemakers, or scream for new gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice between difficult and easy, we Americans will
go for easy every time.
</P>

FOUNDER TO RETURN TO STRUGGLING ELECTRONICS RETAILER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The original Good Guy is back.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald A. Unkefer will again take the helm of the consumer
electronics retailer he founded 26 years ago. But this time around,
he'll be in charge of saving the chain, which has been losing money
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Guys, which has 79 stores in California, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington state, posted a 1998 loss of $8.9 million on sales
of $929 million. The Brisbane, Calif.-based company's stock also
has been in the doldrums in trading on the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer, who will begin his post as the company's chairman and
chief executive on July 1 and is taking a 10 percent stake in The
Good Guys, said his first priority would be to beef up profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to restore it to its glory days,'' Unkefer said
Thursday in a telephone interview from Dallas, where he's been
chairman of a venture capital company, First Ventures, for 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is still positioned well,'' he added. ``Sales have
not gone down. The customer base is still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer said he did not yet have a specific plan for restoring
the company to profitability, but he's considering a reorganization
of the company, a strategy that would stock the stores with new,
higher-end electronics, or a combination of both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``By July, when I show up, I'll have a clearer plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer said he would definitely strengthen The Good Guys'
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Guys has enjoyed the upper-end niche of the market,''
he said. ``We have to make that point clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the company becomes profitable, Unkefer said The Good Guys
would launch a ``monster Internet site'' where customers can buy
products.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer replaces Robert A. Gunst, who resigned in April after
serving as the company's chief executive since 1993. Gunst, who had
been with The Good Guys a total of 13 years, was previously the
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer left The Good Guys in 1996. To date, he has invested in
eight high-tech start-ups, including Redwood City, Calif.-based
InfoGear Technology Corp., a small company that makes phones with
mini-computer screens for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer wouldn't comment on the financial problems at The Good
Guys, but analysts said the company has suffered from a dearth of
new product offerings and growing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Guys has ``a lack of new product introductions, and
they've shifted toward more commodity products,'' said Annie Erner,
an analyst at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``So you can buy them
at Wal-Mart as easily as a consumer electronics retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Alton, managing partner of the San Francisco investment
bank L.H. Alton &AMP; Co., said other retailers, particularly Circuit
City and Best Buy, have chipped away at The Good Guys market, which
was once the dominant retailer in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, Alton was optimistic about Unkefer's
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron has charisma,'' Alton said. ``Of all the people I've known
in this business, Ron would have a chance. Gunst is really a CFO
and should never have had the helm. The difference between being a
CFO and a good marketing guy is figuring out what customers need
and how to get it to them.''

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Before he falls asleep, Harvard senior
Selamawi ``Mawi'' Asgedom pulls a sheet across his face, a
protective ritual he has repeated every night since he was a young
boy fleeing strife in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me to always sleep with a sheet over my head to
keep away the snakes,'' says Asgedom, a half-Ethiopian,
half-Eritrean refugee. ``In the refugee camps there were cases of
people who were killed after snakes slipped into their open
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long journey from the snake-infested refugee camps
in the Sudan to Harvard's Tercentenary Theatre, where Asgedom will
stand next week before thousands and give the senior English
oration on Commencement Day.
</P>
<P>
   But America has not been the safe haven Asgedom's family thought
it would be. Having escaped civil war in the Horn of Africa,
Asgedom's father and brother were killed in separate accidents by
drunk drivers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Asgedom has never shown any outward sign of anger, said
Richard Marius, a retired senior lecturer of English at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gentleness that has come from the horror,'' said
Marius, who was among the judges who picked Asgedom as speaker.
``You and I might become very bitter . . . But Mawi has become very
gentle as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgedom was born in 1976 on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border. Since
the early 1960s, Eritrea had been locked in a brutal civil war for
independence from Ethiopia, a conflict that left many thousands
homeless, wounded, or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Asgedom's father, Haileab, was a rural doctor and an ardent
Eritrean nationalist allied with a rebel group, the Eritrean
Liberation Front. When another rebel group took control of the
area, Haileab, afraid for his life, fled to neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Seven or eight months later, fearful that they would be
murdered, the rest of the Asgedom family began the long, perilous
trek to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by donkey and camel but mostly by foot, the family
made their way to dusty, semi-desert grasslands on the border with
Sudan. Asgedom's mother, Tsege, carried the 3-year-old Selamawi and
his 2-year-old sister, Mehret, for hundreds of miles while their
7-year-old brother, Tewolde, walked.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached a refugee camp in Kassala, Sudan, they were
reunited with Asgedom's father. The camp was a desperate,
fly-infested place, and many of the refugees arrived more dead than
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman,'' recalled Asgedom, ``walked the soles off her
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asgedoms spent three years in a UN camp. With assistance
from the Wheaton, Ill.-based refugee assistance group, World
Relief, his family was able to move to the United States. A church
in Wheaton provided the family with clothing, food and housing.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a painful transition. ``I got Cs and Ds in first
grade,'' Asgedom said. ``It was hard being poor and black and not
speaking English in an all-white community. Kids would call us
names, things like `Black Donkey.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The change was particularly hard on Asgedom's father. Unable to
qualify as a doctor in Illinois, he took a job as a janitor. But
after a few years he had to stop work because of failing eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has always been one of the saddest things for me,''
Asgedom said. ``I only knew him as a handicapped individual. He'd
gone from being one of the most esteemed and respected and useful
people to someone who didn't feel useful and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   By third grade, Asgedom was speaking fluent English. By the
junior year of high school, he had done so well that he was told he
could attend any college he wanted. He was accepted at both Yale
and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bittersweet triumph for Asgedom, who had lost his
brother in 1992, when a drunk driver crashed into Tewolde's car as
he drove to visit a friend in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming home to see my mother screaming and my
father screaming,'' said Asgedom, whose dorm-room wall is decorated
with a photograph of his brother flanked by flags of Ethiopia and
Eritrea. ``We were really close.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, tragedy struck the Asgedom family a second
time. A woman struck Asgedom's father as he rode his bicycle just a
few yards from their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems impossible that the same thing could happen to the
same family twice,'' said Asgedom. ``The fact that my father and
brother both survived war, famine, and disease things, but came to
America and couldn't survive drunk driving seemed amazingly tragic
in a twisted, Shakespearean sort of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, Asgedom still considers himself fortunate. At
Harvard, which paid for much of his tuition, he concentrated in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there have been some nasty blows along the way _ two
really nasty ones. But I can't forget the things I've been given
that a lot of my countrymen will never have. There are still a lot
of reasons to keep smiling in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   When he graduates, Asgedom wants to set up an Africa-based Web
site and teach. In his spare time, he said he wants to speak to
schools about his life experiences and about the dangers of drunken
driving.

ALLEGED PLOT BY MICHIGAN TEENS FUELS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JON HALL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HURON, Mich. _ It started with several students in the back
of a classroom discussing Time and Newsweek articles about the
shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, then continued on a
dock near the shoreline of Lake Huron.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the students were upset about family problems, not
getting along with parents and a couple of fellow students. Soon
the talk turned to re-creating the violence at their own middle
school. They kept talking about it for several days. Others
overheard, and three weeks ago, four of the youths were charged
with plotting a mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defense lawyers says the plot might be better named
after the movie ``Dumb and Dumber.'' ``If this was adults, we'd be
laughing,'' said Kenneth Lord.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the town of 34,000 is laughing, as police and
prosecutors try to build a case against the youths, based on the
overheard comments and the words of one of the 14-year-olds, Justin
Schnepp.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Schnepp's statements that he and others intended to
``shoot up'' the school are a confession. Defenders of the youths
say the comments are just teenage bravado blown out of proportion
by authorities overly skittish in the aftermath of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Fick and Jonathan McDonald, both 13, have been bound over
for trial in Circuit Court, while a decision is pending on whether
there is probable cause to try Schnepp and another 14-year-old,
Jedaiah ``David'' Zinzo. A decision on the latter two is due after
legal arguments are submitted June 11. A trial date will be set for
the younger two on June 14.
</P>
<P>
   A tough stance against students making threats is not unique to
Port Huron. Nationwide, police and school officials are cracking
down on any behavior that appears threatening. Civil rights lawyers
say they have heard a string of complaints from parents whose
children have been arrested or disciplined for everything from
vaguely threatening speech to unconventional dress or disturbing
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a case similar to the one in Port Huron, four boys in
Jacksonville, Ark., were detained by police after they allegedly
discussed bringing guns to school, and one had reportedly said he
could get a gun from an uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Sklar, executive director of the Arkansas American Civil
Liberties Union, was quoted by the Washington Post as saying the
boys' gun talk was ``schoolyard chatter,'' and criticized the
Arkansas law for not distinguishing ``what's a threat from what's a
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, defense lawyers say the law forces the use of a
harsh statute on conspiracy to commit murder. Even that, they say,
requires definite acts, deeds, and agreements that have not been
shown in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the government's case is this: Several students
say they were present when the suspects said they planned to steal
guns, go to school, attack the principal, then call an assembly, at
which they would murder as many students as possible. Also, one of
the suspects reportedly asked another student to help work up a
map, but the student refused and told school officials the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no physical evidence of the alleged scheme _ none
of the hit lists, maps, or annotated plans that police had said
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked ... for the hit list, any maps, etc.,'' said
another defense lawyer, Frank Mitchell. ``The prosecutor's office
doesn't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspects had guns, and testimony in court hearings
during the last week indicated little agreement on how they might
rob a local gun shop, attack the school, or kill students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consistent version,'' said Fred Lepley, another
member of the defense team. ``You get different stories from
everybody, and there's a simple reason for that because there
simply was never any agreement in this matter. There's no
conspiracy here to commit murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony indicated that the Port Huron plot was only idle,
angry chatter, much of it in classes or hallways of the school.
``If you're going to do this,'' said Mitchell, ``you certainly
don't tell half the school.''
</P>
<P>
   One key witness, student Dana Thomas, testified that she did not
think the four youths were serious. ``I figured that they were just
blowing off some steam because they were all pretty angry with
their parents that day.'' She and others also testified that some
of the four were angry at being teased by other youths.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent William Kimball refused to discuss the
facts or evidence, but said he does not think authorities
overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Michael Wendling, one who is handling the
case, agreed that at another time, the situation would have been
handled differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``As prosecuting attorney, I look at the facts that are brought
to me,'' Wendling said. ``I would agree that maybe 10 to 15 years
ago, things, threats of this nature wouldn't have been taken so
seriously in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says that in light of the school shootings, he has to
take the threats seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any parent that would want us to throw
the dice,'' Wendling said, ``or take a chance on this just being an
childish prank.''
</P>
<P>
   And with some reason. The day after initial phone threats to the
592-student Holland Woods Middle School and the arrests of the four
youths, a pipe bomb was found near an outside wall. The origin of
the bomb remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, police arrested more students in connection with
making bomb threats, both to Holland Woods, and for threatening a
``blood bath'' at the city's high schools. Police said there is no
connection between the latest arrests and the murder-conspiracy
case.

NATO WINS THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the right war for the right reasons in the place it had
to be fought if the West were to stand for anything. The NATO
bombing was necessary to curb a far greater evil. The West won; the
West was always going to win; the West had to win.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was late. Sure, there were lots of things we should
have done, or tried to do, before the first Cruise missiles flew.
Maybe late, maybe disorganized, maybe not as skillfully or as
resolutely as, in hindsight, we might have wished, but the right
thing was done to rectify a dreadful situation not of the West's
making.
</P>
<P>
   NATO redeemed its promises, its budget commitments, and its
intricate command-and-control structure, a miracle of high-tech
string-and-chewing-gum that held together a fragile coalition. But
an even greater miracle was the delivery of a fierce onslaught from
the air without a single NATO combat casualty.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Tony Blair, and the political chieftains of
NATO prevailed. Slobodan Milosevic capitulated. Driven farther back
into his cave by a barrage of air attacks, the rogue Serb is
finally contained.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his self-imposed impeachment ordeal, Clinton was
physically and psychologically exhausted, personally embarrassed,
financially imperiled, and substantially diminished. Politically,
he was near-impotent. Even the newspapers that had editorialized
against impeachment routinely treated him with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   No moral authority, thundered his critics. He can't lead. He's
too weak, too indecisive, too accommodating. His Republican enemies
_ and a lot of them are true enemies, not just political opponents,
after Clinton's year of living dangerously _ savaged him over the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not worth the life of one American Marine,'' blustered Pat
Buchanan, the Vietnam-era speechwriter whose bad knee kept him out
of Nixon's war. The Republican majority in the House even denied
Clinton formal authorization of the US-led NATO bombing campaign, a
gratuitous gesture spawned in the post-impeachment swamp that
swallowed the GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the 11 Republicans running for president, Senator
John McCain of Arizona called for a win-at-any-cost strategy,
including the commitment of ground troops, a commitment Clinton
refused to make. ``Although I agree that American interests and
values are at such risk in the Balkans that we must fight to
protect them,'' McCain said, ``what has concerned me most has been
the president's willingness to sacrifice American stature and honor
abroad, his willingness even to lose a war, rather than risk his
own political capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The nub of McCain's argument is that Clinton should have been
willing to accept American casualties to press the war. This is the
Ulysses S. Grant approach, admirable in a warrior, but not always
dominant in the mind of a politician who has more to think about
than just the military man's preoccupation with victory on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the Russians, the Chinese, or European public opinion
would rebel against the United States are now fading. NATO leaders
gambled that air power alone would defeat Milosevic, and won their
bet. Milosevic started the whole thing, driving one million ethnic
Albanians from their homeland at bayonet-point _ their homes
destroyed, their men shot, their women raped, their papers
destroyed, their cash and valuables looted.
</P>
<P>
   The UN says that 983,451 individuals have fled since Milosevic's
dogs of war were let loose 15 months ago, an exodus of biblical
proportions. Not since Hitler raged across the European land mass
in the 1940s has so much bloodshed been triggered by one evildoer.
Those who argue that the bombs aggravated the refugee situation
have to account for two uncomfortable facts: 100,000 refugees
sought asylum or were driven out before the first bomb fell, and
the overwhelming majority of them approved of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 72 days since March 24, NATO warplanes flew 31,529 combat
sorties over some of the roughest terrain, in some of the lousiest
weather, and brought every man in every air crew back alive. That
is a phenomenal record. The professionalism, training, and
equipping of the NATO airmen forced the Serb dictator to back down.
</P>
<P>
   By NATO's count, the Serb forces that had ravaged Bosnia,
Croatia, and Slovenia before Kosovo lost over 100 aircraft, 314
artillery pieces, 471 military vehicles, 120 tanks, 14 command
posts, 45 rail and highway bridges, 57 percent of fuel stockpiles
and 29 percent of ammunition stores.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic capitulated because he had no other choice. The Serb
forces must retreat, and then come back to clear their land mines.
Now, there's a job for Slobodan. With any luck, he'd be Slobo-gone
in short order after a stint of mine-clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's ranking war criminal has wrecked the country he has led
for 12 years. ``No one will dare to beat you,'' he roared to Serb
partisans in Kosovo 12 years ago. He never figured NATO would step
up as it did.

IMUS RECEPTION WEAKENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Imus, who was briefly the toast of Boston's morning
drive-time radio, now has ratings so low they could walk under a
rattlesnake with a top hat on.
</P>
<P>
   The I-man, laughably dubbed one of ``the 25 most influential
Americans'' by Time magazine in 1997, took a huge hit when Howard
Stern started broadcasting mornings here two years ago. In his key
demographic, men between the ages of 25 and 54, Imus's market share
declined from 8.4 to 6.6 from winter to spring of 1997. Now it's
even lower. The latest Arbitron numbers show Imus off 31 percent
among men (4.7 share) from the previous quarter and 58 percent
among women, meaning that his two remaining female listeners must
be Cokie Roberts and Anna Quindlen, whose work he continually
promotes. Stern's own ratings have been declining here, although he
remains No. 1 in the  &UR; morning  &LR; slot.
</P>
<P>
   Imus didn't answer my respectfully worded fax seeking comment on
his ``ankle-high'' ratings. But 'EEI program director Jason Wolfe
rose to the defense _ sort of _ of the I-rrelevant man. Wolfe
invoked Stern: ``Howard takes younger listeners away from everybody
and dominates that slot around the country. Imus's core audience is
older now.'' In fact, Wolfe says, Imus's ratings are holding steady
in a narrower, older demographic: men aged 35-54. Asked about
friction between 'EEI's successful sports show hosts and the
lagging Imus, Wolfe deflected the question diplomatically. Imus's
contract is up for renewal later this year, and 'EEI will
undoubtedly use the subterranean ratings as a bargaining tool.
</P>
<P>
   Another radio favorite of yesteryear _ Howie Carr _ has ratings
problems of his own. Carr's WRKO afternoon drive show has plummeted
42 percent in age 25-54 market-share rankings from a year ago. But
at least Carr and his bosses have some creative excuses. Arbitron
added new listeners from Worcester and southern New Hampshire to
its survey base, which had an especially negative impact on the
Boston-y Carr, says his program director, Kevin Straley. 'RKO
officials also attribute their dismal winter numbers to early
nightime meteorological conditions. ``After dark, you can barely
hear the station in Wellesley,'' Carr complains.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more!
</P>
<P>
   A defamation claim by Carr's wife, Katherine, against the
injudicious I-man has been settled. Here's the background: Carr
slurred Imus on his show. Retaliating, Imus slurred Carr's wife.
Oooops! Katherine Carr is (was) a private, as opposed to a public,
figure. Harvard law prof Alan Dershowitz agreed to handle the
claim, working with Kenneth Sweder in the Boston office of Stroock
&AMP; Stroock &AMP; Lavan. Carr hinted on his show that his wife was going
to come into some serious money as a result of the settlement, but
his lawyers have since told him to keep his trap shut.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguing social note: WRKO, which broadcasts Carr, and WEEI,
which handles Imus here, are both owned by Pennsylvania-based
Entercom. But Ms. Carr's claim, which was settled before it went to
court, was directed against Imus and his syndicator, CBS Radio.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass _ ``I'm on a mission,'' Monty Roberts sats,
before a small group gathered recently at the Harvard University
Coop to listen to the man who listens to horses. ``I'm on a mission
of nonviolence. Nonviolence toward animals and nonviolence toward
people. That's what I've learned from the horses. That violence
never works.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an old-time revivalist, Roberts, who earlier in the day had
spoken at Angell Memorial Hospital, travels from town to town
spreading the latest gospel on nonviolent horsemanship and, through
metaphor and parable, the message of gentler human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday night, he preached to the viewers of Channel 11,
the New Hampshire public television station, during their auction
period. Later, before an overflow crowd at the Topsfield
Fairgrounds, he illustrated his ``Join-Up'' method for training
horses through cooperation rather than domination.
</P>
<P>
   While Roberts, 64, made his reputation as a horseman, it wasn't
until his first book, ``The Man Who Listens to Horses,'' hit The
New York Times bestseller list and stayed there for two years that
Roberts's reputation transcended the horsy set.

   ``What we've done to the horse is criminal,'' he says. ``We must
make it up to a species that has been wonderful to us while we've
abused and mistreated them. For no reason except ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   He hits the last word hard.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts learned a bit about performing while working on movie
sets. In 1940, at the age of 5, already an accomplished horseman,
Warner Bros. signed him to do stunts and bit parts. His movie
career included doubling for Roddy McDowall in ``My Friend Flicka''
(1943) and riding for Elizabeth Taylor in the long shots in
``National Velvet'' (1944).
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, the studio asked him to become a technical adviser on
Elia Kazan's ``East of Eden,'' starring James Dean. Roberts and
Dean became friendly, and the young actor asked Roberts to look for
a horse farm he might buy. On Sept. 30, 1955, Dean was on his way
to a California auto rally and to look at a farm with Monty when he
was killed in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked him very much,'' says Roberts. ``He was a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   (Roberts's most recent experience with the movie business was
different. Although Nicholas Evans interviewed Roberts for his
novel, ``The Horse Whisperer,'' and Robert Redford inquired about
his availability to be a technical adviser on Redford's film
version, the trainer was disillusioned by both experiences.)
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who raises racehorses, realizes that the time around
Triple Crown events elevates public awareness of matters equine.
His New England visit is sandwiched between last Saturday's
Massachusetts Handicap, where Real Quiet, last year's Kentucky
Derby winner, finished third, and Saturday's Belmont Stakes, where
Charismatic is a threat to become the first colt since Seattle Slew
in 1977 to win the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   While Roberts doesn't object to horse racing, he's trying to
persuade jockeys to drop their whips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the advantage if none of the horses are hit?'' he asks.
``(Track announcer) Trevor Denman, who's seen thousands and
thousands of races, says that 95 percent of the accidents are
caused by whipping. The horses drift into each other because
jockeys whip tiring horses. Scandinavia is out of the whipping
business. Germany is beginning to take steps. As is England. The US
is foot-dragging.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Roberts, there are now dozens of books on nonviolent
training methods. Most training used to be based on forcing horses
to submit, primarily through fear, to man's will. Trainers broke
horses with all the force and violence that the verb implies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reality that hits close to home. Roberts's father, Marvin
Earl Roberts, was a traditional trainer who, by tying ropes around
a horse's fetlocks and running them up to the halter, could force a
horse to submit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father abused horses and he abused me,'' Roberts says. ``I
had a brutal father.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts pauses. ``Brutal. But he taught me one important lesson
_ violence is never the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A humane touch
</P>
<P>
   Roberts came up with his ideas about training horses from
observing mustangs in California's high desert country. Like Jane
Goodall, who studied apes in the wild, Roberts saw the manner in
which wild horses were treated in the herd. Those who didn't
cooperate were ostracized. Over years and years of being around
horses, Roberts developed his equine sign language.
</P>
<P>
   For decades no one really listened. That's where Queen Elizabeth
II comes in.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1988, Roberts received word that Her Majesty would like
to see, first hand, his training methods. The following January,
several members of the Royal Staff visited the Flag Is Up Farms to
observe Roberts's ``Join-Up'' techniques. He passed the test. In
April 1989, he demonstrated the technique for the royal family and
gave 14 lectures/demonstrations at various English cities. Then he
was offered the job of training horses for the queen. The results
were so astonishing, she encouraged him to write the book that
became ``The Man Who Listens to Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Shy Boy,'' with photographs by Christopher
Dydyk, Roberts details how the mustang featured in his PBS special,
``Monty Roberts: The Real Horse Whisperer,'' deals with the tough
decision of whether to return to the wild or stay with Roberts at
his farm.
</P>
<P>
   The mustang's plight mirrors the decision many a troubled
adolescent has confronted.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 40-plus years, Roberts and his wife, Pat _ who
have three biological children _ have touched the lives of 47
foster children who came under their care. Like the horses, most of
the children benefited from a system of hard work, dedication,
truth telling, and respect for self and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty of them are real success stories,'' says Roberts. But
it's the ones that got away that eat away at Roberts at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one young girl in particular,'' he tells a woman who
was getting her copy of ``Shy Boy'' signed after Roberts's
discussion at Harvard. ``Her parents were both cocaine-dependent
and alcoholic. They were the abused who became the abusers.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts pauses. His blue eyes cloud up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed a deal that said we'd send her home after a year for
a visit,'' he recalls. ``A week or two before she was to return she
started showing signs of aggravation. I could tell she didn't want
to go, but a deal was a deal. In retrospect, it was a terrible
mistake _ after she'd been home for just two days she stuck a knife
in her mother's stomach and killed her. Now she's in prison. That
remains a heavy burden for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, Roberts says that his next book, due next year,
will be about ``human-to-human communication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence never solved anything and it only teaches us to be
more violent,'' he says. ``The other day, after that terrible
tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, where the schoolchildren ended up
dead, the president came on a press conference and asked how such a
thing could happen. Where did the children learn about such
violence? Later that same day he went on the television to talk
about bombing Kosovo. Where does he think they learned it?''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts allows the question to linger in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we start looking for alternatives to violence,'' he
says, while signing another copy of his book, ``we're doomed.''

HANNIBAL LECTER , WITH A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INSTINCT &QL; 
Directed by: Jon Turteltaub &QL; 
Screenplay by: Gerald DiPego, based on Daniel Quinn's novel,
``Ishmael'' &QL; 
Starring: Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Donald Sutherland,
Maura Tierney, George Dzundza, John Ashton, John Aylward, Thomas Q.
Morris, Doug Spinuza, Paul Bates &QL; 
Rated: R (some intense violent behavior) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hopkins is at that point of his career where he's never
boring. He always gives you something. No matter how limited the
material, he'll give you reason to go on watching. Signing him was
the best thing the producers of ``Instinct'' could have done
because it's a pretty predictable outing, to the point of being
cliched.
</P>
<P>
   It trades shamelessly in Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter vibe, as he
plays Ethan Powell, a primatologist imprisoned in Florida for a
grisly murder in a Rwandan jungle, where his immersion in the study
of gorillas was bloodily interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   He won't talk about the crime _ or anything else. He just sits
in prison, looking murderous, although heavily medicated. Enter
Cuba Gooding Jr. as Theo Caulder, a young shrink on the career fast
track, figuring that getting the accused to open up will move him a
few rungs up the ladder and land him a hefty book deal besides.
It's mostly a nice piece of work from Gooding, who may be following
Robin Williams in trying to veer away from motormouth comedy by
playing a sensitive healer. Yes, Gooding's psychiatrist does find
his sensitivities getting the better of his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   He also finds Hopkins's primatologist getting the better of him.
Powell displays withering contempt for the mind games he wards off
with insolent ease, and even more contempt for the shrink's values.
Although Caulder does get him talking rather easily, Powell hasn't
much use for so-called civilization. He'd rather be back with the
gorillas. Apart from sentimentalizing nature, the film is rather
too simplistic and schematic, as Powell elevates the sights of the
shrink just as the gorillas have made Powell a better human being.
</P>
<P>
   If Hopkins's Powell recalls Hannibal Lecter as he glowers
murderously at bad-news guards and fellow inmates, he's at least a
high-minded Hannibal Lecter, erupting for the best of reasons. And
the truth is that it's fun to watch Hopkins override the cliches in
the script and compel our attention. The others turn in good work,
too, but face a more uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding proves that he can be just as convincing in a
show-me-the-values role as a show-me-the-money role. John Ashton's
thuggish guard, George Dzundza's malleable prison doc, and Paul
Bates's hulking bully tamed by Powell have their moments, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, amazingly, does Maura Tierney as Powell's daughter,
shortchanged emotionally by her father's lifelong careerism. But
her role is scanted most in a film that backs away from the
interpersonal complexity that could have generated more of the
dramatic conflict it needs. Instead, we're left with a simplistic
ennobling process passed from primate to prof to callow young
shrink. Hopkins even makes disgust and menace fun to watch but,
while good, he isn't superhuman. Thus, he can't disguise the
thinness of this film, which never seems to take on a life of its
own because it's too busy reminding us of other, better originals _
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' or
maybe an environmentalist ``Shawshank Redemption.''

MOCKING THE MATING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEX AND THE CITY &QL; 
Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis,
Cynthia Nixon, Christopher Noth &QL; 
On: HBO &QL; 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. &QL; 
Rated: TVMA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers never watched it, but HBO's ``Sex and the City''
was one of last summer's small delights. A very cynical comedy
series, it openly mocked the mating games of successful single
women and slippery bachelors in New York City. It laid bare the
pretensions of the chic nightclub scene, turning a neon-lit
flirtation into a grueling chess game in which the women usually
end up as pawns. And it managed to reach through its own layers of
irony to touch on the despair, frustration, and self-sabotage that
lie behind all the ogling and angling.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at 9, ``Sex and the City'' returns for its second
season with as much savvy and withering wit as ever. It's a
pint-size show, really, one whose half-hour seems to pass in a New
York minute. But it's worth a gander if you enjoy hip urban
reference, shrewd satire about relationships, and the kind of frank
genital humor that fueled so many famous gags on ``Seinfeld''
(remember ``shrinkage''?). Sarah Jessica Parker plays Carrie
Bradshaw, a journalist and self-labeled ``sexual anthropologist''
who uses her adventures, and those of her three best friends, to
write a column about Manhattan's night life. The comic action turns
on the stories the women trade at their gab sessions, as they
dabble in girlfriend truisms (you always see an ex when you look
most awful) and explicit sexual matters (lovers who talk dirty
during lovemaking).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sex and the City'' scripts are always drum tight, partly
because, as with most HBO series, only a few new episodes air each
season. (The writers delivered 12 half-hours last year, and promise
18 this year.) Also, the writing benefits by avoiding the standard
sitcom setup-punch line rhythm, as it glides meditation-like
through the observations Carrie makes in her newspaper column. Each
episode establishes a loose theme _ Sunday's premiere is about
breakups _ and then portrays each of the women dealing with that
theme. The season premiere, which relies on a tacky ball-and-bat
metaphor, has Carrie rebounding from a love affair by pursuing
``The New Yankee,'' while the hopeful Charlotte is dating a man
compelled to adjust his crotch in public. At the same time,
predatory Samantha is distraught about her boyfriend's
measurements. ``Me, James, and his tiny penis are one big happy
family,'' she groans. (Next week, he drags her to couples therapy,
and she suddenly longs ``for the simple days of emotional
unavailability and hot one-night stands.'')
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Seinfeld,'' the show never pretends to have any serious
moral value. It fairly revels in the superficiality of its
characters, and the ways that New York can serve as a massive
distraction from honest self-scrutiny and spirituality. Elaine
Benes would fit in perfectly with the ``Sex and the City'' crowd.
This is bound to turn off some viewers, as is the show's somewhat
retro view of women. Like Ally McBeal, who has undergone her share
of public criticism, Carrie and her friends are professionally
empowered, but obsessed with finding the right man to make them
happy. Next week, sensible Miranda stalks out of a typical
breakfast conversation about men: ``It's like seventh grade with
bank accounts,'' she yells. ``Does it always have to be about
them?'' But later, devastated after seeing her ex-boyfriend with
another woman, she reverses her opinion and affirms the show's
guy-talk premise. David E. Kelley could have written it.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Sex and the City'' is based on Candace Bushnell's
columns in the weekly New York Observer, it is brought to cable by
Darren Star, the creator of ``Melrose Place.'' But don't expect cat
fights and back stabbing among these attractive women. One of the
few sincere undercurrents of the show is the power and solace the
four find in one other's friendship. The actors form a comfortable
ensemble, with Kim Cattrall stealing scenes as man-eating Samantha
and Kristin Davis offering nice moments as her Charlotte clings to
innocence. And Cynthia Nixon is effective at showing Miranda's
struggle between intellect and emotions. As Carrie, Parker
successfully holds the show together with the right mix of fashion
sense, romantic longing, and wry self-consciousness. It's sweet to
watch her, distraught about her breakup, pulling a piece of gum out
of her mouth to submit to the consolations of Miranda's wee-hour
diner fries. Someday, she still hopes, it will be breakfast at
Tiffany's.

SENSE OF CONNECTION FORTIFIES NEW SAYLES OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMBO &QL; 
Written and directed by: John Sayles &QL; 
Starring: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Straithairn, Vanessa
Martinez, Kris Kristofferson, Casey Siemaszko, Kathryn Grody, Rita
Taggart, Leo Burmester, Michael Laskin &QL; 
Rated: R (language) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Sayles's ``Limbo'' is two films.
</P>
<P>
   The first is beautifully textured, giving its actors material of
a richness and originality that are as rare as they are humane.
It's set in contemporary Alaska and focuses on a couple _ or at
least we hope they'll become a couple _ that have been around the
block a few times.
</P>
<P>
   David Strathairn's Joe has handled with grace a couple of
misfortunes _ injured knee that finished a basketball career, fatal
accident that ended his fisherman's career (just as well because
fishing is being downsized). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Donna is
keeping her singing career alive, although just barely, and worries
about her relationship with her teenage daughter, Vanessa
Martinez's Noelle, who completes the satisfyingly realized trio.
</P>
<P>
   America's last frontier, in other words, is a place of narrowing
options, where the self-reinvention had better happen fast if the
inhabitants are going to survive. Joe is pushed back into risk
taking, first by a couple of local women who are trying to restart
a small fishing business, then by his rolling-stone brother, who
shows up after having been away for years and talks Joe into taking
a trip he doesn't realize will be fraught with danger. But the most
interesting throw of the dice is the one involving Donna and Joe.
</P>
<P>
   As they edge together, you find yourself caring what will happen
to them _ so much so that you don't mind Sayles switching his
attention from the economically squeezed Juneau community to the
couple.
</P>
<P>
   Watching and listening to Mastrantonio make you realize how good
she is and make you wonder why she isn't seen more. Your heart
gravitates with ease and speed to her nervous but emotionally
courageous woman. Donna is something of a rolling stone herself,
working cruise ships, clubs, wherever the work is. You believe not
only in her connection to singing (as a bonus, Mastrantonio turns
out to be a very good singer), but in her prickly connection to her
daughter. You don't want anything bad to happen to Donna when she
rebuffs the advances of Kris Kristofferson's bush pilot, who has a
tangled history with Joe.
</P>
<P>
   But then, one adventure later, Joe, Donna, and Noelle find
themselves on a wilderness island, and the film goes aground.
Suddenly, this rich, affecting trio finds itself marking time,
turning away from pursuits we feel are living, breathing
interactions and veering into something airless and abstract, right
up to an ending that may be justified, but is exasperatingly
unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Until it goes off course, ``Limbo'' not only is up to Sayles's
high standard, but extends it. Its first part is so filled with
several kinds of rightness, including the believable tentativeness
that necessarily must be a part of any impending relationship
between people who bear emotional scars, that I wish it were
possible for Sayles to go back and rework the second part.

COUNTRY SUPERSTAR TAKES OFF HIS COWBOY HAT FOR YET ANOTHER
MARKETING MAKEOVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM and DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it looked as if Garth Brooks would lay down his bat
for the San Diego Padres and pick up his Stetson again, he has
another new gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the superstar credited with bringing ``event
marketing'' to country music is trying ``a concept album.''
</P>
<P>
   And if history is any indication, he'll score big again.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of what's to come is the mysterious album cover
making its way around the Internet. It's Garth all right, but he's
hidden behind the makeup, hairpieces, bangs, lighting and touch-up
wizardry of Hollywood stylists.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as an actor getting into character, says Scott Stem
at Capital Records in Nashville. Then think of Garth ``acting'' on
a CD. That's what a concept album is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Garth, the singer, has been talking about Garth, the actor,
since 1997 at least. He has said he wants to do a movie. This album
is the soundtrack to a upcoming movie called ``The Lamb.'' It's
about a rock star named Chris Gaines, and although the script isn't
finished and producers haven't decided whether Garth will play
Gaines, Garth will at least ``sing'' for Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   Garth? Singing rock?
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the new gig, too.
</P>
<P>
   His love of rock 'n' roll has been well-documented. He speaks
often of his love of Kiss and Styx, among others, and how the
former's massive stage productions inspired his own stage shows.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brooks recorded his own version of Kiss' ``Hard Luck
Woman'' on a Kiss tribute CD several years ago. A major fan of
Billy Joel, he also recorded the piano man's ``Shameless.''
</P>
<P>
   But the upcoming album, ``In the Life of Chris Gaines,'' is a
complete departure for Brooks. The concept here is that the 14
songs are Gaines' ``greatest hits,'' and are drawn from Gaines'
catalog of CDs, none of which actually exists, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The CD comes out in September. The first single, ``Lost in
You,'' will be sent to radio stations in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to make you a fan of Chris Gaines before you go
see the movie,'' says David Waldman, an assistant to Brooks'
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Waldman says some of the songs have ``an '80s John
Mellencamp/Bruce Springsteen'' feel. At least one is reminiscent of
Eric Clapton's smash hit ``If I Could Change the World.'' Brooks
will not be touring to support the ``Gaines'' CD, Waldman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting as a way not to alienate his country fans and
make a pop album,'' says Jamie Mattison, the country editor of
``Gavin.'' ``This is arguably the biggest pop entertainer of our
generation, and now he wants to do a pop album. But he's doing it
so that it's not ``Garth Brooks'' doing a pop album. It's really
strange, but if it works it'll be amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it work?
</P>
<P>
   History says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Garth ranked 15th in last year's Forbes list of the 100 richest
people, and part of his $54 million comes from an uncanny ability
to market himself and his music.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the free concert in Central Park? The live HBO special?
There was a record-breaking ``Double Live CD,'' the CD taped in a
Los Angeles studio and broadcast live to every electronics
department in more than 2,000 Wal-Marts. There was the NBC special,
the Rockefeller Center gig, and yes, the spring spent playing as
No. 77 for the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether Brooks' enormous country
audience, which bought more than 1 million copies of his ``Double
Live'' CD in its first week of release, will want to hear Garth
play pop-rock. And will mainstream pop-rock fans accept the songs
on the Gaines CD?
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Gaines'' is being marketed directly to Top 40 and adult
contemporary radio, not country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calculated risk,'' says Kevin Carter, the Top 40 editor
of ``Gavin.'' ``He's going after a whole new audience. It's a way
to stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter heard Brooks perform a number of the ``Chris Gaines''
songs recently at a Paramount sound stage, and walked away
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it had a familiar sound. You think you've heard it
before,'' he says. ``There was pop-rock stuff and some R&AMP;B-tinged
numbers. He prefaced the music by saying, `You have to imagine me
as the character. Go along for the ride with me on this.' He looked
like Garth, but he didn't have a cowboy hat on. I think he can
cross over. The songs are strong and fun, and if people are willing
to go along for the ride, this could be very successful.''

   SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY &QL; 
Directed by: Adam Bernstein &QL; 
Screenplay by: Bernstein, Marc Gerald (novel: Charles Perry) &QC; 
Starring: Norman Reedus, Deborah Harry, Adrien Brody, Elina
Lowensohn, Jerry Adler, Isaac Hayes &QL; 
Rated: R (graphic bloody violence, strong language, sexuality and
brief drug use) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Perry's novel, ``Six Ways to Sunday,'' makes him seem a
soul brother to Jim Thompson, the godfather of pulp noir. In his
film of ``Six Ways to Sunday,'' Adam Bernstein drolly preserves
Perry's rollickingly outrageous sense of mischief, reveling in its
perversity as opposed to judging it.
</P>
<P>
   The film is centered _ if that's the word _ on the off-kilter
mother-son tandem of Deborah Harry and Norman Reedus, and loses no
time zeroing in on its mix of grotesque comedy and twisted eclat.
When it errs, it errs on the side of the lurid as it traces the
odyssey of a young hamburger flipper turned mob enforcer for the
Jewish mafia of Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   If Reedus's Harry Odum had a mother who owned a motel, he'd be
the next Norman Bates. As it happens, they live a low-rent life,
but Odum has a pal who asks him along on a collection errand to a
deadbeat strip-joint proprietor. It brings out the tough guy in the
hitherto mild-mannered Odum. He finds himself with an instant mob
job after having successfully terrorized the callous owner. It soon
becomes obvious that there was an Oedipal component in his violent
behavior. And as soon as we've seen a little of his stiflingly
possessive mother, Kate, played with droll, blowzy obliviousness by
Deborah Harry, it removes any mystery about why her grown but
retrograde son should experience the difficulty with women that he
does.
</P>
<P>
   Then Odum falls for Elina Lowensohn's maid in the mansion of
Jerry Adler's mob boss, and she reciprocates his feelings. The
scene when he takes her home to his anything but welcoming mom is
one of the film's peaks, especially as he tries not to notice how
chilly and poisonous the atmosphere gets. The gorier but no more
vicious mob stuff is OK, too, especially when the lethal
instability of its personnel, including Odum's underboss mentor,
becomes ever more inescapably clear in its bullet-riddled way. And,
just to round out the feast, there's a vaguely creepy atmosphere
pervading the overlord's overdecorated lair.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the world of the film seem akin to Thompson's is its
tongue-in-cheek acceptance of everyone's warped behavior and
refusal to be shocked by any of it. The film does hit a few
glitches, the most serious being Odum's violent alter ego, which
never is smoothly or persuasively incorporated into the film's
clever tabloid attitude. The Youngstown setting (moved from
Brooklyn in the '30s) is a help. Postindustrial Youngstown suggests
a huge piece of gritty found art and bolsters the film's pervasive
feeling of dislocation. Isaac Hayes is another plus, as a tough,
corrupt cop. So is the period jazz scoring. ``Six Ways to Sunday''
is a juicy updating of yet another festering piece of the American
dream.

 By BETSY SHERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sayles was able to duck out of his downtown Boston hotel
for a stroll around the neighborhood. ``There are a lot of
Vietnamese restaurants; there used to be only Chinese'' is one
quick impression of Boston, 20-plus years after he used to live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles and his producer and longtime companion Maggie Renzi
lived in East Boston in the mid-1970s, before they embarked on a
movie career with ``The Return of the Secaucus Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles, 48 _ in town to promote his new movie, ``Limbo'' _
invokes defunct Boston institutions such as The Real Paper and the
Orson Welles Cinema (where ``Secaucus Seven'' had a long run) as he
speaks of his days working at an East Cambridge sausage factory. It
was after he'd been laid off and was collecting $48 a week on
unemployment that the Schenectady, N.Y., native and Williams
College graduate wrote his first novel, ``Pride of the Bimbos.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles shot ``Secaucus Seven'' in 1978 in New Hampshire, with a
cast of actor friends. He launched the project with the $40,000 he
had earned as a Hollywood scriptwriter for hire, notably for Roger
Corman's New World Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The paycheck wasn't the only pleasure, says Sayles. ``The best
thing was that you actually got to make the movies. Big studios
make one out of 20 screenplays that they develop. But if Roger
developed a screenplay, it was going to be a movie very quickly. I
got to work with the directors, and see what my stuff looked like
up on a screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-taught filmmaker soon won a devoted following for his
independent films, which combine character studies with an edge of
social commentary. These range from the satiric ``Brother From
Another Planet'' to the miners'-union story ``Matewan,'' from the
Irish fantasy ``The Secret of Roan Inish'' to the baseball-scandal
picture ``Eight Men Out.'' In true maverick style, Sayles followed
his attention-getting 1996 ``Lone Star'' with the Spanish-language
drama ``Men With Guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' began with the marrying of a place and a group of
characters. Sayles and Renzi accepted an invitation 11 years ago to
hold film seminars in Alaska. The territory and the people stuck in
Sayles's mind. Two things in particular struck him, that one could
walk 15 minutes outside of the capital city, Juneau, and be in the
wilderness, and the way ``a lot of people had gone there to
reinvent themselves. You meet college professors who became bush
pilots. You didn't need a pedigree to get ahead there. There was a
frontier quality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another jumping-off point was a true story about some fishermen
who had caught so many fish that, while they were sleeping, their
boat sank and some of them drowned. ``I started to think about who
that survivor would be. That got me thinking about risk, and how
people react differently to having risked something and failed.''
The male protagonist of ``Limbo,'' Alaska native Joe Gastineau,
``basically hasn't taken another risk for 25 years. He hasn't gone
back to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe, played by David Strathairn, begins a relationship with
itinerant singer Donna, played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
Unlike Joe, Donna has risked her emotions repeatedly, in spite of
frequent heartbreak. Sayles added a third protagonist, Donna's
lonely teenage daughter Noelle. ``There are kids I know or have
read about who have, not really diseases, but symptoms. Anorexia,
bulimia, cutting themselves. They've seen what the world has to
offer, and they don't want to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first movement of ``Limbo'' paints a vivid picture of a town
in transition from an economy based on fish factories and the
timber trade to one dependent on the tourist industry. The shpiel
of the tour guides becomes a sort of Muzak, counterpointed by the
true-to-experience stories told by the natives in the local bar.
</P>
<P>
   Joe, Donna, and Noelle ``can exist in this society,'' says
Sayles, ``but they're really isolated within it.'' Then, because of
a con perpetrated by Joe's half brother, Joe and the women end up
stranded on an uninhabited island, with the threat that a group of
drug dealers may come back to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   In the harrowing second half of the film, Sayles wanted to
explore the concept that ``people are romantic about nature, but
nature is not romantic about people. Only if you find yourself in
nature by accident, unprepared, do you realize just how hard it is
to survive. Most people don't want to rough it that much. They
might want to go down the river, but they want the river guides
there when it's time to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' was an opportunity for Sayles to craft a lead role for
Strathairn, who has been in six of his films. The mysterious Joe
``doesn't have much dialogue. Getting information out of him,
especially about himself, is a lot of work. So we hear stories
about him from other people.'' Strathairn, who attended Ringling
Brothers Clown College after going to Williams, ``is a very good
physical actor. He's also a competent person _ he can do carpentry,
he can run a boat, he can throw a curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sayles, the film's title provides a key to
understanding its stylized ending. ``I was raised Catholic. When I
thought about risk, I thought about the concept of limbo. It's
supposed to be the place where unbaptized souls go. It's not
heaven, and it's not hell, and it's not purgatory. Purgatory is
temporary, but limbo is forever and ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about how many people exist in that
neither-here-nor-there state, because they have to stay in a
certain job they hate, or a relationship, or a political situation.
The way out of limbo is basically a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: If you prefer no clue to the film's ending, read no
further.) As a final image, Sayles employs a fade to white, which
has a different visceral effect than the more familiar fade to
black. ``For me, a fade to white is like going to the infinite. It
says, nothing ends or begins here, we are bringing you to a certain
moment and you don't know what happens next. We do this with the
sound as well, where we raise it and raise it until it's almost
unbearable, and then cut it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do with this ending is send you back into the
movie. `If it wasn't about them living or dying, what did I get
from this? What did happen on that island? Well, the last thing I
saw was these three people together, after all those shots of them
alone, disconnected.' This isn't an action-adventure movie that's
all about plot. There is an emotional resolution, which is that the
three are touching each other for the first time. They're going to
be a family.''

CHAPIN-CARPENTER ENLIVENS GREATEST HITS PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a greatest-hits collection meant just that _ a
collection of hits that had originally been done in the studio.
Today, many artists expand the concept to include hits and a
coupleof new songs to entice collectors and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mary Chapin Carpenter has taken the concept even further.
She not only adds two new songs to the just-released ``Party Doll
and Other Favorites'' but attaches some live versions of hits and
some oddities pulled from her appearances on TV specials and film
soundtracks. The result is an enchanting potpourri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want this to be interpreted as a definitive
collection, but as more of an informal one,'' says Carpenter, who
comes to Boston July 23. ``When I see a lot of greatest-hits
records today, it seems they come from artists who have maybe two
hits. But I wanted this collection to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, a crafty singer-songwriter who straddles the world of
country, folk, and rock, has recorded for 10 years and enjoyed a
slew of hits. But the fun part of the new disc is how some of these
were done: the spicy ``Down at the Twist &AMP; Shout,'' for instance,
was taken from a live performance with Beausoleil at the Super Bowl
in New Orleans two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original studio takes of ``Shut Up and Kiss Me,''
``Passionate Kisses'' (written by Lucinda Williams), and ``He
Thinks He'll Keep Her'' were included. But other additions are a
cover of Mick Jagger's ``Party Doll'' (from his solo album,
``Primitive Cool''), a cover of John Lennon's ``Grow Old With Me''
(from the tribute album to Lennon, ``Working Class Hero''), and
``Can't Take Love for Granted,'' from an appearance on ``Late Show
With David Letterman'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The album is fleshed out with live tracks from theaters in
England, Wisconsin, and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; and two
new tunes in ``Almost Home'' (co-written with Beth Nielsen Chapman)
and ``Where You Are,'' with some of Carpenter's most tender lyrics:
``I'm looking for a strong and steady heart / I'm looking for some
eyes that have shed some tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter not only shook up the notion of a greatest-hits CD,
but has shaken up her band. Instead of using dual guitarists Jon
Jennings and Duke Levine (a Bostonian) as she's done in the past,
she has installed Levine at lead guitar and moved Jennings over to
bass. ``There are times when I miss the stereo guitars, but it's
important to change things around sometimes. It shakes up the
repertoire, too.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Carpenter is still at heart a wordsmith with a guitar.
``Every time I wake up and can still call myself a songwriter, I'm
ahead of the game,'' she says.
</P>
<P>

   Axl Rose surfaces: Guns N' Roses singer/fusebox Axl Rose is on
the cover of the Spin magazine that comes out Tuesday. He confirms
that guitarist Slash is no longer in the group and that the new
lineup contains guitarists Paul Huge (a childhood friend of Rose's)
and Robin Finck (who played with Cirque du Soleil). Other members
are keyboardist Dizzy Reed, bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of the
Replacements), and punk drummer Josh Freese (formerly with Suicidal
Tendencies and the Vandals). A new, supposedly more
industrial-sounding album is being produced with Sean Beaven, who
has worked with Nine Inch Nails and Pantera. Here's a peculiar
note, though: hoop star/rapper Shaquille (I Got Swept Again) O'Neal
is on a track, following a chance meeting with the band in a
recording studio. ``I saw Guns N' Roses listed on the bulletin
board in the lobby of the studio, so I stuck my head in to check it
out,'' says O'Neal. ``They asked me to join them, so I started
freestylin' over their track. It was the first time I ever performd
with a rock group, and it felt good.''

A NEW LEASE FOR `RENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that ``Rent'' is a certified theatrical institution, what's
new to say about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still news, only now it's just theater news, back on the
theater pages,'' says Jeffrey Seller, who produced it on Broadway
in 1996. ``For a while, it went off the theater pages and became
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things have surprised me about this show,'' he adds,
``that I find myself now regularly surprised.'' He was speaking on
the phone from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The show is returning June 15 to Boston's Shubert Theatre for a
newly extended engagement through July 11. It played a
record-breaking 29 weeks here in 1996, the first city it toured
after its Broadway success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent,'' of course, is the massively hyped hit Pulitzer Prize-
and Tony Award-winning rock musical, the fifth musical to win both
a Pulitzer and Tony, the most honored musical since 1976's ``A
Chorus Line.'' Billed as ``the rock opera of the '90s'' and an
``East Village `La Boheme,' '' it chronicles the struggles of urban
artists of all persuasions. It was written by Jonathan Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Seller says the show's selling points still are pertinent.
``There's been no show like this in my adult life,'' he says. ``It
speaks to young people and how they look at the world. And how they
look at themselves, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations.
How to hook up with each other. Sex. And then the collection of
songs we have in the show seals the deal. And then there was the
death of the author.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson died unexpectedly of an aortic aneurysm hours after the
production's final dress rehearsal off-Broadway, 10 days before his
36th birthday. He was hoping to see ``Rent'' confirm his belief in
it as a ``Hair'' of the '90s. Living in a grungy East Village
apartment, Larson was hanging on during the musical's seven-year
odyssey from its conception. Seller says that the show has
successfully toured, both nationally and abroad, playing 40 cities
in the United States in its second national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, it can be said the Boston audience foretold
success in such venues as Des Moines and Kalamazoo Mich.: ``Des
Moines sold every single seat. Kalamazoo, $740,000 worth of tickets
in one week.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer recounts the tales of the original plans to present
``Rent'' off-Broadway and of its eventual Broadway appearance
``with people telling us it doesn't want to go uptown and it'll
fail with the downtown audience. Twenty-four hours later, we sold
out in 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it won't sell on tour. We're up to $15 million.
Boston did $29 million the last time. When was the last time a show
toured starting in Boston on the East Coast and then sold out in
Dallas and Tempe, Ariz.? It does well in conservative areas. And in
(liberal) St. Paul; it sold out for 10 weeks. Now I'm not surprised
by anything. I expect to do well in Gainesville, Fla., next year.
And I'm looking to do well in Charlotte, N.C. We sold out Raleigh.
That's Jesse Helms country. Another thing about this show is that
it's a reaction against the politics of exclusion of the right,
against meanness. It's about inclusion, acceptance, and loving your
friends and neighbors, not hating them.''

AMERICA'S CUP HAS LOST STEAM DURING LAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Blake and the invincible Kiwis announced their plans
for the next America's Cup back in 1995 at the San Diego docks,
there were groans all around.
</P>
<P>
   The next Cup would be held in 2000, Blake said, five long years
after the Kiwi victory over the United States. So now, some 170
days until the first gun starts round one of the challengers'
series, the event picks up a thread after the longest haitus since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When the last America's Cup was raced, there was at least some
choppy continuity with the history of the event. But now, it seems,
for viewers and readers who came to expect to hear about the Cup
every three years or so, it becomes a bit more difficult to pick up
the story after such a layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the sailing teams and fund-raisers who have been working
since May 1995, to win a best-of-five race series that begins Feb.
19, and whose winner will hold the oldest trophy in sports.
</P>
<P>
   For most East Coasters, that thread is easy to follow from the
time the Cup left Newport in 1983 and went to Fremantle, Australia,
where Dennis Conner won it back in 1987. It went to San Diego and
from that point, for the next decade-plus with legal battles, the
catamaran fiasco, a new Cup class boat sailing in a light air
venue, and finally the victory by New Zealand who then took the Cup
back down under _ the America's Cup has not been easy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a coherent storyline will take shape to reawaken
interest in the Cup, whether Americans will be staying up to watch
the races on ESPN _ as they did in 1986-87 _ is a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   In that Australian season of 86-87 the storyline rang as clear
as a John Wayne movie, with Conner in the saddle: the Aussies had
taken away our Cup after 20 years of trying, they won using a
sneaky weapon at best, and by God, we were going down there and
show those upstarts a thing or two about American pride. For
emphasis, Conner flew a football field-size American flag from the
masthead of Stars &AMP; Stripes after every victory.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the conditions _ those boisterous Australian winds
and big lumpy seas that blew out sails and dismasted many a
12-meter _ all put on a compelling show to the TV viewers in those
post-midnight rituals that so many stayed up for or taped.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboat racing as dull as paint drying? Tell that to the suits
at ESPN, for whom that '87 Cup was a watershed event. Unfortunately
for ESPN, the magic never quite struck again when the Cup went to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   What will spark some excitement around the old America's Cup
home grounds is of course if Young America, carrying colors of the
New York Yacht Club, can show some real strength in the early
going. If they look believable in the three fall round robins, with
a bit of hype going into the millennium hoopla down under (where
New Year's rings in first), the guess here is that Cup fans will be
back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dream becomes palpable (and rational) that the
America's Cup would be coming ``home'' to Newport, that droopy-eyed
legion of midnight race followers will be back.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a few other challening syndicates _ four from the US
_ are trying hard to ensure this scenario remains a fantasy. One,
America True from the San Francisco Yacht Club, has wrapped up four
months of sailing in New Zealand along with Young America and
America One, Paul Cayard's campaign also based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are full on for New Zealand with a new boat,'' says Dawn
Riley, captain and CEO of America True, which is sailing in the
former Tag Heuer, Chris Dickson's boat in the last Cup. ``We are
really ahead, and on track. We have NASA and STRC software, and
also all of Bill Koch's '95 data.''
</P>
<P>
   America True, says Riley, has one boat under construction by Jim
Betts in Truckee, Calif., while Young America and America One claim
to have two-boat programs.
</P>
<P>
   But in some early pre-Cup intelligence gathering, Riley says she
has reason to believe none of the other American challengers will
be able to pull off two-boat programs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference could be night and day. Many Cup observers
believe it is virtually impossible for a one-boat program to beat
two boats. The reason: a one-boat team simply can't develop the
design data quickly enough to move forward at the speed of a
two-boat campaign, which can leapfrog its boats' performance
development.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley isn't so sure. ``The two-boat approach is minimized
these days by the strength of our computer programs,'' she says,
adding her serious doubts about the other US campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   To date, only three International America's Cup Class numbers
have been assigned to US syndicates, one each to America One (USA
49), Aloha Racing (USA 50), and America True (USA 51). Under Cup
rules, sail numbers are not allocated until boat building has
commenced, though two other US boats are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Much speculation swirls around the question of how badly Young
America was set back in its fund-raising when it had to break a
sponsorship deal with Fox Sports Net because of a conflict with
ESPN, the Cup's official broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox deal included logos on sails and boats, and ESPN
objected to televising its rival's logos, so Young America was
released from that part of the deal, said to have been worth $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Jane Eagleson said in a phone interview from the
Portland, Maine, offices of Young America that the broken deal with
FOX would not slow the syndicate's two-boat program. Its boats are
being built at Goetz Custom Yachts in Bristol, R.I.

VECSEY'S REPORTS ARE VEXING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news is Peter Vecsey is not a medical doctor or an
airline pilot or in any profession in which you need to be more
than 50 percent right.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that viewers of NBC and TNT and readers of his
New York Post column don't really know whether the NBA analyst is
spreading rumors or reporting facts.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Vecsey is a decent enough guy, a newspaperman
able to transform a ruffled exterior into a television personality.
But even an on-air talent has some responsibility to get the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Vecsey has dropped significant ``news'' during
the NBA playoffs. The first piece involved the Celtics. He said
that Orlando's troubled _ and oft-injured _ Penny Hardaway is
headed to Boston in a trade for Ron Mercer and Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor has touched off all sorts of buzz locally. But no one,
including Vecsey, really knows whether Hardaway will ever wear a
Celtics uniform. A Celtics source said the trade is on the
``backburner.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the deal sounds good. Hardaway is miffed at
Magic management for not ``respecting'' him enough. Translation: He
wants a lot more money and a coach that doesn't tell him what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   That definitely wouldn't happen under Rick Pitino, largely
because Pitino is a control freak.
</P>
<P>
   If the Celtics can't pay Mercer, then how, pray tell, are they
going to pay a perennial All-Star? And that's the problem with
Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   He's sort of like the NBA's version of CNN. He has a lot of
information but has little time to explain what it all means.
</P>
<P>
   The next troublesome Vecsey scoop is his reporting on the Phil
Jackson mess.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real sorting out this Gotham saga. Everyone involved,
from Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts to the former
Bulls coach, are unseemly at best and liars at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts had to apologize for lying to the media about his
clandestine meeting with Jackson while the Knicks were mounting
their surprisingly successful playoff run. The fact that Jackson
would even meet with Checketts while Jeff Van Gundy was still at
the helm was pathetic. But then for Jackson to reject a $6 million
offer from the New Jersey Nets and fan rumors about going to the
Los Angeles Lakers was just plain sick.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey needed to be in the gutter with these guys, but he
remained a Jackson coatholder despite having published information
suggesting that Jackson would not get the Lakers job.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times and New York Times published stories last
week that indicated Kurt Rambis would probably return as Lakers
coach. The stories went on to say that Jackson's price was too high
and that his best chance at securing that kind of money would come
from the Nets or Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey wrote in Tuesday's column for the New York Post:
``Regardless of how far the Knicks go and what Dave Checketts
ultimately decides to do with Jeff Van Gundy, it's my licensed
belief Phil Jackson won't agree to coach anyone next season except
the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Really Pete? That doesn't have anything to do with the fact the
Lakers never met with him, much less offered him a job?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to our ace reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand the situation,'' Vecsey wrote, ``from those
privy to the cunning and conversations of Jackson's agent, Todd
Musburger, neither the Nets nor the Knicks particularly captivate
the six-time coaching champion. But it doesn't hurt to elevate his
market value by playing the passionate interest shown by both
franchises for all its worth in an effort to whet the appetite of
LA owner Jerry Buss.''
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey did manage to describe Jackson's secret meeting with
Checketts as a ``low-rent stunt,'' and then went on to flesh out
his story with interesting but irrelevant blather about Kobe Bryant
boning up on the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey concludes: ``Given the pick between helping (presidential
candidate Bill) Bradley or the Lakers, I say he goes political. The
Democrats win more than the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, during the Knicks-Pacers playoff game, Vecsey
reported as much during TNT's halftime report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers haven't contacted Jackson at all,'' Vecsey said.
``I believe he is going to help Bradley next year. That's where he
is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   As rumors go, Vecsey's reports were fine. But they missed one
important bit of analysis: just how sleazy the NBA has become.

AN UNREPENTANT FAGAN THUMBS HIS NOSE AT US ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts let a liar, charlatan, and cheat get away
_ again.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Stephen Fagan, the daddy dearest who kidnapped
his two daughters 20 years ago, could have sent a powerful message
to parents who take the law into their own hands. Instead, the case
for morality, decency, and compassion disintegrated into a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard the one about the Palm Beach con man? He fooled
the women he married, the two girls he fathered _ and the
prosecutor who pursued him.
</P>
<P>
   That is a harsh, even cruel, assessment of the Commonwealth
versus Stephen Fagan. But a week after Fagan's PR circus blitzed
Boston and then blew out of town, this much seems very clear:
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley got a guilty plea
from Fagan. But Fagan got more. He has his freedom; he will spend
not a second in jail. And he won another opportunity to viciously
denounce Barbara Kurth, his ex-wife and mother of the girls he
stole from her so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was poised to trash Kurth during a trial. They
trashed her without one. As Fagan's lawyer, Richard Egbert, bragged
after his client's guilty plea: ``I would have shown in open court
that she was an alcoholic, neglecting the children to the point
that they were in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one could have predicted this assault coming Kurth's
way after Fagan's guilty plea, not even an experienced prosecutor
like Coakley. But the reality is, if Coakley wanted to protect
Kurth by avoiding a trial _ she failed.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley was part of the team that skillfully navigated the
twists in the case against British nanny Louise Woodward for the
death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. Media spin control was very
much part of the Woodward case. Yet, with Fagan, Coakley admits:
``We were surprised there was a personal, vitriolic attack on
Barbara Kurth. We thought, maybe somewhat naively, that Mr. Egbert
would want his client to go quietly back to his private life. We
were wrong about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It leads to several questions:
</P>
<P>
   How could prosecutors so misjudge a man who has a long history
of doing and saying anything, no matter how despicable, to get what
he wants? Did the Woodward case affect Coakley's judgment here?
After all, she watched the defense and the press vilify Matthew
Eappen's mother. She watched a judge turn a second-degree murder
charge into a manslaughter verdict. And then she watched Woodward
return to England, a folk heroine.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in trying to protect Kurth from similar harm, did
prosecutors wrongly avoid a trial?
</P>
<P>
   Coakley makes a strong case for her decision to accept Fagan's
guilty plea. A trial, she says, would have exposed Kurth to more
trashing. A jury could have decided Fagan did what was necessary,
given the circumstances. Or, a judge could have altered a guilty
verdict, as in the Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial would have been war, and there would have been
casualties of war,'' says Coakley. After prosecutors laid out a
probable trial scenario, Kurth did sign on to the plea agreement,
according to a Jan. 6 letter from her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's argument is convincing _ in the prosecutor's
office. Back in the journalist's office, it is less so. The eyes
wander from the computer screen to the sort of family photos that
decorate desks everywhere. It is summer, and sunbrushed kids grin
happily, their toes in the sand and their arms around mom. Imagine
if someone suddenly snatched them away. Imagine if the someone was
a man you once loved. Imagine if he told them you were dead. Then,
when they learned you were alive, he told them you were too weak,
flawed, evil to be their mother. And believing him, the children
shoved you aside with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything that happened during a trial be worse than that?
As Kurth put it last week after her ex-husband's court appearance:
``Some days I believe Stephen Fagan would have been kinder to
really have murdered me, rather than having done so only in the
minds of my children. At least there would have been no question as
to his punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fagan case is about emotion and law. As Coakley rightly
points out, ``We can't regulate the emotional destruction of one
person by another.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true it would take much more than a criminal justice
system to turn Fagan into a decent, honorable human being. But the
law is another matter. He should be punished, and he was not. He
leaves us unscathed, unrepentant, and thumbing his nose at the
mother of his children and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

PRIEST GETS NO RESPECT FROM POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The most insidious aspect of what happened to the Rev.
Filipe Teixeira was not the most obvious, not his bizarre arrest in
handcuffs by Boston police, not even the inexplicable night he
spent in jail after he said he identified himself as a priest. It
was what he claims officer Paul Painten said through the driver's
side window upon hearing Teixeira's Angolan-Cape Verdean
accent.``You speak English?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak English?'' he seethed. ``I went to St. John's
University, majored in philosophy and theology. I speak Portuguese,
Cape Verdean Creole, Italian, Spanish . . . So when he asked me if
I spoke English, I knew it was trouble. He was saying, `You are
nothing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the next moments, Teixeira would be treated like nothing. On
the evening of May 25, Teixeira pulled up to a street fight in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood. The 33-year-old ecumenical priest
began the day meeting with police over its relations with people of
Cape Verdean descent. That afternoon, he worked out at a gym and
talked with a detective. Police commander Al Goslin said Teixeira
``has been proactive in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira has been proactive with the police, even though he has
reason to be a cynic. He said he has been stopped over 10 times for
no cause by Boston and state police in cases of DWB, Driving While
Black; WWB, Walking While Black; and JBB, Just Being Black. Each
time, he was not wearing his clerical collar.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been stopped and asked why he was driving into
South Boston. He has been accused of running a stop sign when it
was a white woman ahead of him who had zoomed through the sign. He
has been stopped by officers who seemed friendly but then asked for
an ID. Teixeira even suffered the indignity of being pulled over on
I-93 by a young white man impersonating a cop. The man fled when
Teixiera asked to see a badge. He chased the man to a restaurant
and called the police. After talking to the man, the police told
Teixeira nothing would be done. ``It turned out the guy was the son
of a former MBTA officer. So I guess that's why nothing could be
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be done for a man who picks up 50 youths for five
hours of activities and Mass on Saturdays at St. Martin the Porres.
Nothing for the man who has helped abused women graduate from
college and gotten jobs for youths with criminal records. Teixeira
said, ``I've always prayed, `Lord if this is what I'm called to do,
I want to see the results.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The results, unfortunately, come with a healthy dose of HWB,
Helping While Black. He has been berated by cops when trying to
assist in a domestic crisis and when asking why police have put
black and Latino youth face down on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, we're all dogs,'' Teixeira said.
</P>
<P>
   May 25 was Teixeira's turn to be thrown into the pound. He was
trying to see if there was anyone he knew in the fight. Then
Painten bellowed the ominous, ``You speak English?'' Teixeira said
he held tightly to his rosary beads, praying, ``My Lord, I need you
right now. Tell me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This was of too short notice even for God. Teixeira asked for
Painten's badge number. Teixeira was hauled out of his car by the
neck and jailed for blocking traffic and for not showing his
license and registration. Teixeira said he was never asked to
identify himself or move his car. He said, ``When the officer put
the handcuffs on me, I begged, `Please don't do this. I'm a priest.
Please call your captain. He knows me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Painten made no call. He declared Teixeira guilty of PWB,
Parking While Black. The final insult was not so much spending the
night with swearing drug dealers bragging about their sexual
exploits. It was not so much even that his car was towed, costing
him $115. It was when he heard the penalty for PWB was $100 or 20
hours of community service. He assumed this had less to do with
saving souls than to spear roadside trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me says this is nothing,'' said Teixeira, who survived
civil war in Angola. ``I've crossed rivers with crocodiles, jumped
over dead bodies and fired machine guns. I don't think I killed
anyone, but to this day I have nightmares.'' The other part says
this American nightmare is too searing to the psyche to remain
silent. If the police don't drop the charges, Teixeria, without his
collar, is just another dog without tags, another creature to be
impounded by the Inhumane Society. ``My altar boy came to me and
said, `Father, how can they do this to you?' '' Teixeira said.
``What do I say to him?''

CHINESE STORYTELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE KING OF MASKS &QL; 
Directed by: Wu Tianming &QL; 
Screenplay by: Wei Minglung &QL; 
Starring: Zhu Xu, Zhou Ren-Ying, Zhang Riuyang, Zhao Zhigang &QL; 
Unrated &QC;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable stories in cinema is that of Wu
Tianming. He came to prominence as head of the Xian Film Studio and
launched China's famous ``Fifth Generation'' of filmmakers, which
included Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou, Huang Jianxin, and Tian
Zhaungzhaung. In 1986, he took his place alongside them with his
own film, ``The Old Well.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when Tiananmen Square erupted and changed everything,
Wu was in the United States as a visiting scholar. He wound up
staying five years, during which he brought his family here and
supported them by running a video rental store in Los Angeles. In
1994, he returned to China and film directing. His 1996 film, ``The
King of Masks,'' makes it seem as if he scarcely had skipped a
beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' is a small gem, set in 1930, about the
bond that develops between an aging street performer and the child
he buys so he can pass along his skills. When he discovers the
``boy'' is a girl, he's bitterly disappointed. Her nickname, in
ironic keeping with her status in traditional China, is Doggie.
But, as played by Zhou Ren-Ying, she's a resilient little thing who
hangs in there. Apart from the fact that the film is set 70 years
ago, it seems of a piece with 19th-century novels in its
matter-of-fact acceptance of a self-sufficient street kid learning
to survive poverty, starvation, and danger. ``Dickensian'' is a
word that springs to mind, and that goes for the old man of the
title role, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's poor, Zhu Xu's performer is a man proud of having
mastered a demanding craft. His nickname refers to his skill at the
ancient art of face changing, using speed and a conjuror's moves as
he slips a succession of silk masks over his face. Professional and
personal pride makes him want to pass along his skill to an adopted
son. Although he's disappointed in her gender, the old man is kind
and even affectionate to the young girl. To repay him and solidify
what she hopes will become a more stable emotional bond, she hits
the streets, rescues a kidnapped boy even younger than she, and
brings him back to what's left of the old man's barge after she
accidentally had set it afire. Needless to say, there are grave
consequences she cannot foresee.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from its cliffhanger plot, the film works because of
its warm bond between outsiders. Zhu Xu and Zhou Ren-Ying, a young
real-life acrobat, convince us they care for each other in this
film, which more than slightly recalls Charlie Chaplin's ``The
Kid'' and a dozen more like it. There's a third outsider, a man who
has grown rich and famous as a performer of female roles and as the
young Buddha in the Sichuan Opera, and who exchanges a mutual
respect with the old man, whom he asks to join his troupe and whose
polite turndown he accepts with grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' isn't afraid to embrace old-fashioned
ethical values, as well as old-fashioned filmmaking virtues, and
charmingly succeeds by finding the common ground inhabited by its
old and young survivors.

FIGGIS TAKES CHANCES WITH `SEXUAL INNOCENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
Written and directed by: Mike Figgis 
Starring: Julian Sands, Saffron Burrows, Stefano Dionisi, Kelly
Macdonald, Gina McKee, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Bernard Hill, Rossy De
Palma 
Rated: R (strong sexual images, pervasive nudity, violence and
language) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its best, Mike Figgis's new feature, ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence,'' has an exciting sense of reach and striving and chance
taking. But there's no getting around the fact that it's an uneven
exercise that shows signs of having gestated too long. It's finally
sunk by a too-explicit Adam and Eve story line involving a black
man and a white woman gamboling idyllically in an Eden; it turns
out to be an estate from which they eventually are brutally hunted
down and banished by uniformed guards leading vicious dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help wishing Figgis had more faith in his main (and
what should have been only) narrative, involving the world
constantly throwing difficulties in the path of a boy we see grow
through adolescence into a troubled filmmaker, played by Julian
Sands. The film begins with the boy growing up in Kenya,
voyeuristically sneaking glimpses of forbidden sexuality. There's
more than a hint of the hermetic mystery of early Jane Campion
vignettes as the boy grows and proceeds through a frightening but
fascinating immersion in various rites en route to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   With young Nic, and the older version played by Sands, it's not
a matter of being expelled from Eden, but of never being admitted.
As a fat, awkward boy, he's humiliated. Later, as an adolescent, he
finds the road to sex torturous and booby-trapped with
embarrassments, even when the girl is willing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he's married, his wife isn't terribly willing,
although she dreams a dream that's sexually charged while he dreams
one that's threatening. The film's strength is its flow of
narratively discontinuous images that add up to an unfulfilled
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Loss of Sexual Innocence'' peaks when Nic journeys from
England to Italy to Tunisia to work on his latest film, and urgent
blasts from the past are replaced by urgent intrusions from the
present. Things climax joltingly in the desert when Nic finds
himself in a sexual crossfire between an Italian photographer
(Stefano Dionisi) and an assistant producer (Saffron Burrows), who
earlier had just missed an encounter with a doppelganger in Rome's
airport. A flareup of violence in a market square sparked by a
terrified blind woman separated from her dog, and later, a desert
tribe they accidentally wrong, remind them of the difference
between their respective cultures. And the power and stark
immediacy of these two scenes underscore the shortfall of these
qualities elsehwere.
</P>
<P>
   There is in ``A Loss of Sexual Innocence'' a genuine
experimental impulse, plus a personal dimension that makes it both
brave and rare, worthy of comparison to the likes of ``The Singing
Detective'' and early Antonioni. But except for the uneasy pilgrim,
Nic, the characters remain too sketchy and opaque to satisfy,
packing less expressive punch than the Chopin on the soundtrack.
And the naive and questionable idea of innocence being corrupted,
or blocked by self-styled civilization, falls apart, or rather
never takes convincing shape beneath the flow of sometimes
powerful, sometimes brilliant, but more often undersupplied images.

NO LONGER JUST ONE OF THE GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ginger Spice is dead. She was 25. She rests in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Halliwell lives on. She is 26, and the world may still be
her oyster.
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell _ once called Ginger Spice and before that Sexy Spice
_ is set to reemerge this month with a solo album,
``Schizophonic.'' Critics may snicker and say her 15 minutes have
been used up _ and just wonder how much more the world wants of
this buxom and brassy lass who shouted ``Girl Power!'' at us every
10 seconds _ but she's on the cover of UK editions of Allure, Marie
Claire, and Mademoiselle, and she's reinvented herself. She's still
a teeny thing, but she is looking rather . . . ladylike. Her
streaked copper hair is now strawberry blond; her freckles shimmer;
her makeup is minimal. There's less decolletage. Once, in her
pre-Spice Girl life, she modeled nude. With the Spice Girls, her
bust was pushed up. Now, she's the girl next door, not exactly
demure, but, well, much less of a pop tart. Adorable.
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell's record label, Capitol, is mounting a big push on her
album. ``She is a major, major priority in this company,'' says a
spokeswoman. ``Look at Me,'' the sassy first single, is No. 8 on
MTV and has just been released to radio. In England, the single is
near the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Me'' suggests the giddy pop sensibility of the Spice
Girls is intact _ with just a bit more bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My album is Johnny Rotten meets Julie Andrews,'' says
Halliwell, from New York. ``There's an anarchist in me.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Look at Me,'' the first single, she sings these couplets,
``Bigmakeup/little breakup. . . . Old feel-ing/new beginning. . . .
Cold blooded/hot gossip. . . . Fake honey/real plastic. . . . Fast
lovin'/Slow movin'/No rhythm/But I'm groovin'.'' She sings about
spinning ``little white lies.'' In the video, an old-fashioned
hearse passes by with GINGER written on the side. Shortly,
Ginger/Geri is in the casket, wickedly waking up from being dead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Her life in the Spice Girls, and departure from it, is ``one
level'' of the song, says Halliwell, ``but on a bigger level it's
about not taking each other at face value. I think we all put
labels on each other _ you're black, you're gay, you're fat, you're
thin _ and I just think that is a load of (expletive). . . . We all
hide behind images. The point is, whether I've got on a bustier and
some hot pants or dressed all in black, your heart and mind is the
same, you have the same hopes and fears. That's what I believe.
Call me an old hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip back in time, to about a year ago. May 29, actually. The
Spice Girls, having conquered Britain, were gearing up for their
first American tour, which would sell out almost instantaneously.
They were set to beat the bushes and discuss Spice world with the
American press. Halliwell _ de facto leader of the Girls _ was to
ring me up. At the last minute, a publicist called and said Emma
Bunton (Baby Spice) would be chatting. Halliwell was ill. Later,
that day the bombshell exploded: Halliwell would be leaving the
Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ill?'' Halliwell is asked, finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a porky pie they told you!'' says Halliwell,
ever chipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``A what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A porky pie. That's an expression for a lie.'' (Specifically,
it's cockney rhyming slang.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to clear that matter, deal with the past, go on to the
future so you know where I'm at,'' says Halliwell. ``I actually was
going to leave the Spice Girls at the end of the American tour; I
hadn't planned to go before that. But it was kind of like when
you're in a relationship and you're not in love anymore and you
think it's time to move on _ I don't love you like I did four years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in a band is like a marriage. When you first break up
and dissolve the partnership, it's a little tricky. You are
detaching yourself and it is hard. I had to create a new space for
myself. I felt I needed to rebuild. I wasn't just saying goodbye to
them, I was saying goodbye to the family and friends, the
establishment, everything. But I think that like all ex-husbands
you still love them and care for them even if you're not in love
with them. I just think I have grown out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who was Ginger Spice, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you go on a first date,'' says Halliwell, ``and
on that date you put your best clothes on, you give your funniest
lines, and there is probably one dimension of you. That was the one
side I have, and Ginger was a part of me when I was 17 years old. I
wore platform shoes. Nothing was contrived about Ginger, but I just
moved on. I was changing internally. When I left Spice Girls I
didn't know I was going to go solo. I was very afraid to admit
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell says she was entering a more serious phase of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about the money,'' Halliwell says of the Girls.
``I was on a mission. So I just thought I would like some integrity
with what I do, and leave after the tour. But then in May, the
night before (the interview) there was this breast cancer interview
I was meant to do and it got canceled, and it made me question who
I was.'' (She'd had a benign lump in her breast when she was 18;
she had just finished reading a heart-wrenching book about breast
cancer, ``Before I Say Goodbye.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but sometimes in life something happens and
it just makes you think, `Who am I? What am I doing? Where is my
soul? Has my ego eaten that up?' It is such a self-obsessed
industry. I thought I was meant to be the advocate of girl power.
And I think it had grown for me into something else, with more
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She works for the United Nations as a good-will ambassador.
``When you are famous,'' says Halliwell, ``people obviously pay
more attention to certain issues, and all I can do is lend my fame.
I'm not claiming to be a pool of knowledge. It is a lifelong
project. I am not sort of jumping in and rushing around. I think we
all have multiple careers and this is one part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell also became a champion of breast cancer research,
selling all her Ginger Spice clothes to benefit the cause.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I think is important in life is to keep
perspective on what life is all about,'' says Halliwell. Yes, she
recently bought a huge house in the country, and she can live well
forever. ``I would rather have the money than no money, but I have
to say if anyone is chasing that dream of money, well, you know the
cliche: Money will not bring you happiness. It will distract you
from unhappiness and buy you a little bit of freedom. We can all
get caught up in self-importance and materialism. When you realize
there are people starving to death in Africa and wars going on and
people dying from ignorance . . . it keeps your feet on the
ground.'' Of her charitable work: ``I get as much out of it as I
give.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her best friends is George Michael. He is her ``only
celebrity friend, but we haven't got a celebrity relationship,''
she says. ``He comes from the same area as me. We were both kind of
ugly kids at school; we both had a Mediterranean parent; we have an
empathy, and it's so nice we're in the same business.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, both have reaped stardom's benefits as well as
suffering the slings and arrows.
</P>
<P>
   Her music is ``very eclectic,'' says Halliwell. ``Like a
painting, you stare at it, and one person might get good colors and
think of it as entertaining and light, and another person might
look at it and see darkness, and meaning and depth. That's what I
try to do with my music. I think women will identify with it; it's
like a PMS mood swing. I think creatively, I write better when I'm
down. And I have no sex when I'm writing as well. It steals my
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell is no diva. She's a pop gal. ``I know I'm not Celine
Dion,'' she says, ``but I have heart and passion and the running
theme, I think, is honesty. I'm trying to talk to you as a friend
when you put my CD on. I want to keep you company. You should be
able to respond to it whether you are 16, 6, or 60. I kind of make
love to my music. . . . I always make songs that the average person
in the street can sing along to. I'm never patronizing. I hate it
when you can't join in. I think each song should touch you
differently _ some for your heart, some for your mind, some for
your feet, and some for your groin.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell does not want to take issue with her ex-mates in the
Spice Girls, nor criticize the music. ``I'm very proud of where I
come from and I never want to diss it,'' she says. ``I hope Spice
Girls fans have liked what I've done, but everybody needs to grow.
It's like nature, we are growing and changing. I had a big input
with the imagination, the imagery, the direction _ so I can't knock
it _ but obviously being in a band you've got to swallow your ego
and make room. It's a team effort to a certain degree. But whatever
I gave to the Spice Girls I took with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell would like to tour, but says, ``That's up to the great
American public.'' That is, if they buy ``Schizophonic'' in
sufficient numbers to justify a tour. She says she doesn't have
sales goals; she's not aching for a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't just bosh around with the guitar,'' she says. ``I'm
going to give you something, good old-fashioned entertainment. If
you like me or not, I'm going to make you smile. Music is very
powerful. We need joy in our lives. There is a fundamental serious
message in some of the things I sing about. It's not brain surgery,
it's escapism.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Halliwell passes the 15 minutes of fame mark and marches
boldly into the future. ``At the end of the day,'' she says, ``I
like being famous, but there's ups and downs. I've grown used to
it, so fame doesn't really exist anyway, nor does the 15 minutes.
It's more like a 30-second feeling, and you don't think about it
all the time. It's more about being given the opportunity. I feel
lucky to be given a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell, who is now partially self-managed, says she
frequently stresses out and has to keep reminding herself to chill.
The best advice she can offer anybody similarly stressed is this:
``For God's sake, laugh at yourself. Think `Is this going to matter
when I'm 80?' No, it's not.''

DARK WIND 
A Survivor's Tale of Love and Loss 
By Gordon Chaplin 
Atlantic Monthly Press, 225 pp., $23 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before sunset on Nov. 9, 1992, the Lord Jim dropped anchor
at Wotho atoll in the Marshall Islands, a cluster of dots in the
Pacific Ocean. For captain Gordon Chaplin and his partner, Susan
Atkinson, the day was full of the pleasures of arrival. They
stripped and dived into the balmy water, reveling in the interplay
of light and color as the sun slipped lower. Susan whispered,
``This is paradise. And you made it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a soft, effortless procession the days slipped by like
tradewind clouds. We were sustained by what I could catch in the
sea and what the villagers gave Susan: crab, clams, . . . conch,
snapper and more fruit. We never argued anymore; there was nothing
to argue about. The issues between us resolved themselves or faded
into insignificance. Time was different here. We had a feeling it
could go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Dark Wind'' were a novel, and a typhoon roared in and
splintered all this perfection, the cliche would be too much to
bear. But Chaplin's book is nonfiction. The storm packing 105-knot
winds is real, and the destruction and loss it leaves in its wake
are irrevocable. Chaplin and Atkinson, who had ridden out storms
before, made a fateful decision to stay with the boat. When the
Lord Jim was ripped from its anchor and dashed against a reef, they
plunged overboard with half-inflated life vests. Atkinson slipped
out of her vest, floated just out of reach, and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt, recrimination, and searing questions weigh Chaplin down
like so much ballast. Like other writers who catalog extremes,
Chaplin is the haggard survivor left to obsess over what went
wrong, and when. And why.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book began as pure therapy,'' he writes in an afterword.
It is a story cobbled together ``from highly personal
woolgatherings, love-ramblings, euphoria, hallucinations,
should-have-dones, excuses, and mea culpas.'' In the hands of a
less gifted storyteller, ``Dark Wind'' would flirt with the
lachrymose. But Chaplin's style is stripped down and unsparing, and
he sets limits on his own self-pity. He uses his journalistic
skills (he has written for The Washington Post and Newsweek) to
analyze his own role in the disaster. The result is an absorbing
and unsettling tale of hubris, hindsight, fate, and random rotten
luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the pattern of our lives lead inexorably to disaster? And,
if so, why have I been left to stand alone on the top of a hill in
upstate New York while the sun goes down another time, and another,
and I watch summer give way to fall, fall to winter, and the
twentieth century give way to the twenty-first? I am beginning to
realize that I have to write our story. By the time I finish, maybe
I'll understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin and Atkinson had put themselves at the center of storms
before. They met in the mid-'60s, when each was married to someone
else. Their first cruise, with their spouses, was on a weeklong
vacation in Maine. Looking back, Chaplin finds plenty of shadowy
portent. On the last day, in Penobscot Bay, a squall bore down on
them. Chaplin and Atkinson voted to stay with the boat, not wanting
to run from a little bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   They met again 12 years later, in the late '70s, and romance
swept in ``like an unavoidable force of nature.'' Within six
months, Chaplin had left his wife and two daughters. Sailing became
the center of Chaplin and Atkinson's lives, the place where they
felt most in synch as a couple. Chaplin wrote about their cruise
along the eastern shores of Central America in ``Fever Coast Log.''
They moved their blended family to Baja California for six months,
and Atkinson duly recorded the disasters that ensued in a
young-adult novel called ``Taking Off.''
</P>
<P>
   Both seemed courageous, adventuresome, willing to put themselves
in the hands of chance. But frailty hid behind the bravado. Chaplin
had a knack for escapism. Atkinson kept her real fears to herself.
After her death, Chaplin found a letter in a drawer at their farm
in New York. ``The thing that scares me the most,'' she wrote, ``is
that you will continue to choose not to listen to me when I voice
my fears. You don't care if I am scared. You don't stop teasing
when I beg you to stop. You ridicule and denigrate my concerns and
act as if they are not real. They are very very real.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mark of Chaplin's basic honesty that he includes the
letter. In the end, he realizes, some actions (and inactions) leave
an indelible mark in the world. If Atkinson never made it back from
the Marshall Islands, neither did Chaplin, in some sense. ``Someone
who looks like me and has my name came back. Like Pip, in
`Moby-Dick,' I'm not really here anymore. I'm at Wotho atoll with
her, planning our next leg.''

LET THERE BE LIGHT: PAINTER THOMAS KINKADE WRITES BOOK ON
JOYFUL  LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thomas Kinkade's new book is called ``Lightposts
for Living: The Art of Choosing a Joyful Life,'' and it's not too
tough to figure out. Just open the door to one of the cotton-candy
houses in his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's cutesy cottages invariably show light glowing
through the windows as approached from a cobblestone walkway lined
with red and gold flowers in the summer, fallen leaves in the damp
autumn. Smoke puffs from a stone chimney, and light beams down from
heaven. The message seems to be that a wholesome family is inside
reading Scripture, just like the Kinkades.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no people in his paintings of lighthouses, homes
or flower-laced gazebos. They're all on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of their home that is so compelling to them that
they step into that world continuously and it gives them comfort.
It gives them relief,'' says the ``Painter of Light,'' a trademark.
``People become so attached to it that they will write me letters
and say, `If there's ever a fire in my home, I'm going to grab my
old puppy dog first and my Thomas Kinkade second.'''
</P>
<P>
   Art critics and curators might like to watch a Kinkade burn, but
that doesn't bother him. He is a Christian evangelist, and God is
the only critic he hears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint sentiment because I'm not afraid of it,'' says
Kinkade, who lives in Los Gatos, Calif. ``I have in my heart a
great romance for living, and I put that in my paintings
unashamedly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's unashamed of commerce, too. Last year his Media Arts Group
showed a $55 million profit on sales of $83 million, according to
the company's Web site. Lithographs are cranked out of a San Jose
plant with a capacity of 1,000 prints a day and sold for $225 to
$35,000 at 200 Kinkade galleries across middle America. His left
hand has created the most profitable brand name in art, with
licensees including Hallmark, Avon and La-Z-Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade claims to be the most-collected living artist in America
_ according to his estimates, a Kinkade print hangs in one out of
every 20 American homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible to lounge on a Kinkade recliner while
gathering warmth from a Kinkade blanket and coffee mug, and that's
not counting the warm fuzziness in his pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Next it will be Kinkade homes filled with Kinkade furnishings.
According to his company Web site, he has entered into an agreement
with a Texas company to build Thomas Kinkade Villages inspired by
his work.
</P>
<P>
   As a business arm of the gospel, Kinkade may have commercial
reach second only to that of the Mormon Church. He's the only
artist with both a listing on the New York Stock Exchange (Media
Arts Group) and a show on the QVC home shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Lightposts for Living'' (Warner Books; $20), he has
entered the self-help market.
</P>
<P>
   The book offers bits of advice, which he calls ``lightposts.''
There are 12 principles, just like a step program, including
``Living in the Light of Abiding Happiness'' and ``Living in the
Light of the Lovely.'' These are combined with inspirational
quotes, anecdotes and images of his paintings. Every home has a
television, and every home should have a Kinkade for balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bombarded with moving images, but we have no still
imagery,'' he says. ``In the shouting of all that culture, the soft
whisper in the distance catches your attention. My paintings are
that soft whisper in the midst of the shouts of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kinkade monologue can last an hour without interruption, even
though he is booked at half-hour intervals and his next appointment
is waiting. It takes half an hour just to describe the miracles in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   The first came when he was 4 and his big sister was drawing a
driveway. It didn't look real, so Kinkade took her pencil and
corrected the driveway to recede in depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden something clicked in my brain, which was an
epiphany that shaped my whole life,'' recalls Kinkade, 41. ``I saw
that you could take lines on paper and create a third dimension,
little worlds that you can step into.''
</P>
<P>
   The second miracle came 10 years later. A poor boy growing up in
a broken home in Placerville, Calif., he needed an artist mentor,
and one moved in right next door: Bay Area figurative artist Glenn
Wessels, who had been a professor of fine arts at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``Right in those years where a father
figure is so critical, God miraculously had his hand in my life,''
Kinkade says. ``Out of nowhere, a hundred feet from our house, one
of the greatest minds in art instruction moved.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for cleaning his studio, Wessels agreed to teach the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   The next miracle came after Kinkade had washed out of the art
schools at both UC Berkeley and the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena. ``I had a conversion to the Christian faith which was
deep and it was profound,'' he says. ``When I got saved, my art got
saved. It was as though the light came on.''
</P>
<P>
   He became the Painter of Light, a missionary. That's when the
miracle of lithography touched him. He couldn't see putting his
vision into one painting for one buyer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It dawned on me if I could find a way for more people to see
it, then I might be able to get this message out more broadly.'' In
1984, Kinkade and his wife, Nanette, pooled their life savings to
make 1,000 prints of his favorite painting, which he sold for $35
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did that my artist friends said, `You've sold out,' and
it struck me as absurd,'' he says. ``That would be like a writer
not publishing a manuscript. Or a musician saying `I won't ever do
CDs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade likes comparing painters to authors and recording
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person can name the five top musicians they just
love. Literature has done the same thing. The masses have access to
literature,'' he says. ``But there has been no populist expression
of the arts. The artists have alienated themselves from the
culture, and the average person has no interest in their work.
That's the plane at which I began to think in the late '70s and
early '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s his way of thinking has resulted in a
workforce of 600 people. ``God's been good to our company,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that it's a paint-by-numbers operation, and Kinkade
just adds the light in the windows. Not true, he says. ``There's
never been a brush stroke on my paintings other than mine. I do all
my own work, all my own research. I'm just old-fashioned, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Nanette have four daughters, and no television. His
family lives simply and frugally, he says, even though the Wall
Street Journal recently calculated his worth at $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade has committed to painting 150 pictures over the next 15
years. He no longer sells the originals, which have gone for as
much as $500,000. He's now marketing a ``San Francisco
Collection,'' the tourist views in very soft focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never base my paintings on a place, and when I do I change
it so much that it's almost unrecognizable,'' he says. ``I always
tell people, `It's my world, welcome to it.'''

AN OLD PHENOMENON IN A BRAND NEW FORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a sort of weird situation on my dining room ceiling.
It's a darkish stain the exact same size and shape as the water bed
frame on the floor of the bedroom above. I don't think its a leak;
if it was it would be a lot worse. What is it, how can I get rid of
it, and how can I keep it from coming back?
</P>
<P>
   A.N., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's an old phenomenon, but in a uniquely new form: the water
bed. What has happened: the frame of the bed sitting on the floor
has made that part of the floor, and the ceiling below, cooler than
the rest of the ceiling. Water vapor condenses on that cool area,
making it damp. You may not notice it is damp, but it is, enough
for dirt to cling to it, or mildew to grow on it. To get rid of it,
test an area first with household bleach; if that area turns white
within 10 seconds, it is mildew, and can be killed and cleaned off
by wiping with a solution of one part household bleach and three
parts water. If the area does not lghten up with the bleach test,
it is dirt, and can be removed by washing the entire ceiling with
detergent and water. This must be said: Wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   To keep it from coming back, set the bed frame on short wood
blocks; 2 x 4s or 1 x 4s will do; all you need to do is lift the
frame so air will circulate under it.
</P>
<P>
   I referred to the stain as an old phenomenon; such stains
usually show up on the joists behind a ceiling or the studs behind
a wall, which are cooler than the rest of the ceiling or wall. The
water bed outline is a new variation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am concerned about gaps developing between hardwood floor
boards. Is there a way to prevent that? I want to put a hardwood
floor in a three-season porch that is still to be built.
</P>
<P>
   JIM SEE, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Those opening seams seem to be a plague, caused my moisture.
What happens is that the boards take up moisture and expand. So far
so good; the seams are tight. But when the boards dry out and
contract, they may contract enough to make gaps. This may take
several cycles of expansion and contraction to happen.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure except relaying the boards. One technique to
prevent their occurrence is to store the boards in the room for two
weeks before laying. This will make their moisture content the same
as the materials in the room, minimizing expansion and contraction.
</P>
<P>
   Also, and I think it is a better idea, install the boards in
winter, when the heat is on, and storing the boards for two weeks
will dry them out even more, making them as small as possible when
installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am ready to repaint a door, but I noticed that the plastic
film was never removed from the brass kickplate that was installed
some time ago. Now I can't get it off, or it comes off in tiny
shreds. Any easy ways to remove it?
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH RANIERE, Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try heat from a hair dryer; place the heat along an edge, to
try to get the film started in one piece; then as you pull the
film, keep the heat under the film.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try vinegar or oil; WD-40 is a good oil to use, easily
dispensed from a spray can. As with the heat, try to pull off some
of the film so you can spray the oil or apply the vinegar under the
film, pulling it off as you spray.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am installing a new deck outdoors. It will be free standing
(not attached to the house), 16 by 20 feet, four to six inches
above the ground. I have had several suggestions as how to anchor
it, all different. One adviser said to set it on Sonotubes
(concrete columns) set four feet into the ground. Another said to
put 8-inch by 16-inch concrete blocks on the ground, and set posts
on that. A third suggested smoothing out the ground, apply plastic
and crushed stone, and put the deck on that. What is best?
</P>
<P>
   LOUIS D'AMBRORSIO, Hampton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The best way is to set the Sonotubes 4 feet into the ground.
In New Hampshire, this will put the bottom of the tubes below the
frost line, so there will be no heaving or moving of the deck. (In
Massachusetts the rule is generally three feet.)
</P>
<P>
   The second best, not even mentioned, is to sink 4 x 4
pressure-treated posts into the ground, three or four feet.
</P>
<P>
   The worst are setting blocks or crushed stone on the ground and
putting the deck down. This would make it float on or near the
ground, and heave up and down in winter.
</P>
<P>
   And, being so large, it is more likely to heave in different
sections, resulting in a deck that is out of skew and off level.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A handyman caulked my storm windows and did other jobs around
the house, but he also caulked over the weep holes in the storms'
bottom frame (an alumnum sill that sits on the wood). Should I
drill new holes?
</P>
<P>
   STEPHANIE ROGERS, Newton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No need, although there is a need for weep holes. You can
probe the aluminum frame at the sill to locate the holes, which
should be as close as possible to the wood sill. Then ream out the
hole.
</P>
<P>

DIVERTING SOME MONEY WOULD EASE HEAVY DOSE OF LARGE-CAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 36-year-old woman with an annual income of $40,000.
I'm concerned my investments aren't diverse enough because they are
mostly large-cap blend funds. They include $26,152 in Fidelity Blue
Chip Growth, $25,311 in Fidelity Dividend Growth, $25,399 in
Fidelity Spartan U.S. Equity Index, $17,851 in Vanguard Index 500,
$2,075 in Vanguard Windsor II, $6,209 in T. Rowe Price Dividend
Growth, and $6,001 in T. Rowe Price Value funds. I also have
$61,863 in the ESOP plan of a former employer. Should I move some
of my money to other funds? I would like to invest in a health care
sector fund.
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no argument that the large-cap blend funds are out of
whack _ I tally 92.5 percent of the fund portfolio invested there.
You don't mention whether these holdings are in tax-deferred
account such as IRAs or are taxable. If they are taxable accounts,
you want to think about how much you'll give up to the taxman by
making changes; since it's clear that you're a good saver, if these
are all taxable accounts you might decide to work toward a better
portfolio balance by directing new investments to different market
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that you might be able to roll over the
assets in that ESOP account into an IRA, thus giving you a vehicle
which might help get a better-diversified portfolio without making
any major changes.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not possible, here's what I suggest: First divert
$20,000 from the three Fidelity funds to Fidelity Health Care, even
though it wouldn't really reduce reliance on the large caps; while
Health Care is a sector fund, its portfolio is dominated by
large-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If these are tax-deferred accounts, I'd also divert about the
same amount of money from the three dominant Fidelity funds to
Fidelity Overseas. I'd also suggest moving about $6,000 to a
small-cap fund, perhaps T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock or Vanguard
Small-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to make these moves, you would reduce the
concentration in the large-cap blend sector from that 92.5 percent
to 50.3 percent. Still, when you add in the Windsor II and Health
Care positions, you would have 70.6 percent in domestic large-cap
stocks, and I suggest you seek to reduce that to about 60 percent
by concentrating future investments in the mid- and small-cap funds
until you've achieved the desired balance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My granddaughter is 3 and has approximately $3,000 in the
bank. I told her father that he should put it into a mutual fund
and add to it as the years go by, for her education. I mentioned
Northeast Investors Growth fund. What do you think of that?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Northeast Investors Growth has a lot of the things investors
should look for, in my opinion. It has a long and strong record,
all of it under the same portfolio managers. It has no load or
12b-1 fees, low turnover, and a fairly consistent investment style.
In the last ten years, it has evolved from the large-cap growth
sector to a large-cap blend portfolio. During the last decade, it
has averaged 19.27 percent annual returns; over three years,
average annual returns have been 30 percent, and its 6 percent
year-to-date gain for 1999 has been a bit above the average for its
peer funds. All of this adds up to a top five-star rating from
Morningstar Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, two things you might think about. One is its
propensity to use leverage from time to time _ that's to say, to
borrow money against its portfolio to give more oomph to its market
plays. This can be a great thing in strong markets and with the
right market plays, but it can cause trouble when the markets are
weak and/or the manager's stock selection is off.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor which might give you pause is the fund's
tendency to concentrate the portfolio in certain market sectors
from time to time. Currently the favorite is financial stocks,
where its position represents 30.9 percent of the portfolio and is
nearly twice the concentration of financial stocks in the Standard
and Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the coin, the fund entirely spurns the
utility sector, and holds only modest positions in energy and
durable goods stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I think the plusses pretty much outweigh the reasons
an investor might pause before investing here, and I find this an
excellent choice for an investment of 15 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be retiring next month. He is 59 and I
am 58. He will have a pension of $26,200 per year and I will
collect about $600 per month from Social Security at age 62. We
have an income need of about $46,000 a year. Our savings is in two
portfolios. First is a taxable portfolio of $205,000 with 28
percent in Fidelity Equity-Income II and 24 percent each in T. Rowe
Price Tax-Efficient Balanced, T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income, and
Vanguard Prime Money Market funds. A tax-deferred portfolio of
$250,000 is 28 percent invested in Fidelity Fund, 30 percent in
Fidelity Puritan, 10 percent in Fidelity Diversified International,
9 percent in Fidelity Utilities, 15 percent in Fidelity Investment
Grade Bond, 5 percent in Fidelity High Income, and 3 percent in T.
Rowe Price Science and Technology. Our approach is this: We plan to
draw down the taxable account at a rate of $2,000 a month until it
runs out, hopefully not before ten years. This will allow the
tax-deferred portfolio to grow for another ten years. Is this plan
realistic? More important, is the deferred portfolio properly
allocated for something that will sit for another ten years?
</P>
<P>
   C.M., Medway
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you've really got a handle on this. If you achieve
average 7 percent returns from the taxable portfolio, it should do
even better than you suggest _ supporting a sequence of $2,000
monthly withdrawals for a little more than 153 months. During that
period, projecting 9 percent portfolio growth within the deferred
account, that would grow to $750,630 _ a figure which should be
sufficient to support a sequence of $3,000 monthly withdrawals with
no diminution of principal, and in fact with moderate additional
principal growth. Why $3,000? Don't forget about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   I think you have balanced the tax-deferred portfolio nicely, and
I see no reason for changes now. But I do suggest you plan to make
some modifications beginning about five years before the date at
which you anticipate drawing upon it. At that point I would begin a
slow process of moving investments toward the fixed-income side.

CLINTON USES RECESS APPOINTMENT TO NAME HORMEL TO LUXEMBOURG POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: UPDATES with reaction from Trent Lott's aide and the
Traditional Values Coalition; minor edits throughout.) 
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton used a recess appointment Friday
to install San Francisco philanthropist and gay rights advocate
James C. Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, bypassing opposition
from the Republican Senate leadership that sidetracked the
nomination for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel thus becomes the first openly gay American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, issued a statement
saying: ``The president today announced the recess appointment of
James C. Hormel to serve as United States ambassador to
Luxembourg.''
</P>
<P>
   By naming him to the diplomatic post during a congressional
recess, Clinton overcame a stubborn political stalemate with
conservative Republican senators who have blocked action on the
nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved it
in a 16-2 vote in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. _ who
likened homosexuality to alcoholism, sex addiction and kleptomania
and urged Americans to help gays change their sexual orientation _
declined to lift the so-called ``holds'' that the four
conservatives had imposed, thus refusing to bring the nomination to
the Senate floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Congress returns from its 10-day Memorial Day recess on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution empowers a president to make recess
appointments and says that they ``shall expire at the end of
(Congress') next session,'' meaning that Hormel can serve until
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Traditional Values Coalition, a conservative group claiming
to represent 40,000 churches, charged Friday that Clinton's action
was ``a cowardly tactic of sneaking in an undesirable appointment
while avoiding public scrutiny.'' It called Hormel ``a purveyor of
smut'' and said that a San Francisco center he financed ``is one of
the biggest collections of pornography and pro-pedophilia
literature ever assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Smith, communications director at the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, said
Clinton's appointment was ``a bold move that is a testament to his
commitment to treating all people fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``This fight was never about trying to get the
first openly gay ambassador. This has always been about making sure
that anti-gay bias was not a barrier to good people doing public
service for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes Clinton's action will not invite retaliation
from Capitol Hill. ``The usual suspects are going to be jacked up
about this, just as they are about all gay issues,'' he said.
``They will continue to try to enact policies that discriminate
against gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a Lott spokesman, called the recess appointment
``a slap in the face to Catholics everywhere.'' He said Lott was
concerned about what he called Hormel's support for groups critical
of the Catholic church. Czwartacki was referring to the fact that
Hormel, witnessing a parade of San Francisco drag queens dressed as
nuns several years ago, laughed at their antics targeting the
church's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican critics and conservative activists have
expressed concern that Hormel, a former dean of the University of
Chicago Law School, might use the Luxembourg post to proselytize
others to embrace homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a founder of the Human Rights Campaign, sought to allay
the concerns of critics last year with a letter to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use, nor do I think it appropriate to use, the
office of the ambassador to advocate any personal views that I may
hold on any issue,'' Hormel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The critics have focused on Hormel's $500,000 donation to the
San Francisco Main Public Library, which then named a collection of
gay and lesbian material after the contributor. Researchers at the
library have access not only to the papers of San Francisco gay
activists such as the late Harvey Milk and Randy Shilts, but also
to materials provided by controversial groups such as the North
American Man Boy Love Association, an organization that critics
accuse of advocating pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Hormel also has contributed to a program that sends
speakers to discuss homosexuality with elementary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton's recess appointment of Hormel will
enable the ambassador to serve in Luxembourg for the remaining 18
months of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's maneuver gives the appointee all the legal authority
of a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate but not the
political clout that a Senate confirmation conveys.
</P>
<P>
   The senators who announced their ``holds'' on Hormel's
nomination are Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.; James Inhofe, R-Okla., and
Bob Smith, R-N.H. The fourth remains anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had won commitments
from at least 60 senators to support confirmation of Hormel, 66,
the heir to the Hormel Meat Co. fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used recess appointments in the past to install
nominees for whom he could not win Senate confirmation. For
instance, he defied Senate opponents in December 1997 to give a
recess appointment to California civil rights lawyer Bill Lann Lee
to serve as acting assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   The president acted after his nomination of Lee, a prominent
Asian American civil rights lawyer, had languished before the
Senate Judiciary Committee for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renominated Lee to the post on March 5, setting the
stage for Lee to continue in the post as an acting assistant
attorney general for the remainder of Clinton's presidency.

HARD WORK ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Work is cool. That seems to be the new work
ethic being promoted in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant ethic is long gone. No more asceticism, except
for that black Prada look. Nobody works to get into heaven and few
work to better the community. The idea is to get into the best
restaurant, pull out the newest laptop and talk business on the
smallest cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The work ethic of slaving hard at a job you hate to better your
kids is out. Except among the poor people, of course. For the
masses, including the new ditch diggers of data entry, it's still
``Work sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   The work-is-cool ethic is for those with portfolios and projects
_ and I don't mean housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``All work of economic value is project work,'' writes Tom
Peters, author of ``In Search of Excellence,'' in the magazine Fast
Company.
</P>
<P>
   You are your projects. For columnists, that means ``You are whom
you have for lunch.'' It's not an appetizing thought.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company is the handbook of the new work-is-cool ethic. The
magazine is quite a piece of work, and it's cool-looking, as if
Wired met Forbes for a team-building exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue is filled with articles by career coaches,
consultants and others who have cool jobs telling readers how to
build teams, hold meetings, set agendas and have cool jobs (I mean
projects) on the fast track.

<P>
   The magazine even has a feature called ``Job Titles of the
Future,'' featuring trendy-looking people with titles like
``Minister of Enlightenment.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy with that cool job is a Ph.D. who says he enlightens
employees by using Kant to teach them to think independently.
</P>
<P>
   The company he works for, tellingly enough, is MacTemps, a $100
million business that he calls ``a talent agency.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd call it a temp agency, where the unenlightened are forced to
take their projects _ namely, their unemployed selves.

   How can a magazine become extremely successful promoting the
work-is-cool ethic?

   ``I think people are meant to feel they spend so much time at
work that it's this avenue for great spiritual awakening,'' said
Daniel S. Levine, author of ``Disgruntled, the Darker Side of the

day at computers.''

   What about the less successful temps, the outsourced and the
downsized?

   It's amazing how many new job titles there are for the jobless.

<P>
   ``Disgruntled'' quotes a corporation's vice president for human
resources who said, ``Jobs are being replaced by `projects' and our
`fields of work,' giving rise to a society that is increasingly
`jobless but not workless.'''

   The amount of work being piled on people keeps increasing,
whatever you call it.

<P>
   A recent study by the Council of Economic Advisors shows
families today are spending an average of 22 fewer hours together a
week than families did 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all the figures on (work) hours appear to be
rising,'' said economist Juliet Schor of Harvard University.
``There are more and more people trying to get up and out of it,
but it's not helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade ago, Schor wrote ``The Overworked American: The
Unexpected Decline of Leisure,'' which detailed the pressures that
caused American work hours to increase over the previous 20 years.
When I phoned her, she was harried and didn't have much time to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter of her book, called ``Exiting the Squirrel
Cage,'' had a few small suggestions for countering the irrational
pressure for ever-longer workweeks. The last section of that
chapter was called ``Reclaiming Leisure.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened. The squirrel cage is now filled with
obsessional objects like Palm Pilots, pagers, cell phones and
laptops, and we're running perpetually.
</P>
<P>
   An ad in Fast Company by Microsoft for hand-held PCs refers to
them as ``your significant other PC.'' Yikes, now Bill says we're
married to them.

<P>
   I was disturbed to read about the ``10-minute, mind-cleansing
virtual vacation,'' as a couple of ``futurists'' called it. The
idea is that digital slaves can take safaris or visit museums
without getting away from the screen.
</P>
<P>
   As Schor noted in her 1991 book, ``One of the most notable
developments of the 1980s is that paid time-off is actually
shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
   I hate to think that in the next millennium it'll shrink to a
10- minute ``virtual vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Cotton Mather, the New England Puritan moralist, said,
``Laudable recreations may be used now and then, but I beseech you,
let those recreations be used for sauce and not for meat.''

<P>
   Recreation and work have been turned into hash. But it's modern
fusion hash, and how do you get people to swallow something
distasteful?
</P>
<P>
   Tell them it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I take the Ronald Reagan point of view. ``Disgruntled''
quotes our former president as saying,``''They say hard work never
hurt anybody, but I figure why take the chance?''

CLINTON USES RECESS APPOINTMENT TO NAME HORMEL TO LUXEMBOURG POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: ADDS Hormel's age in 2d graf.) 
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton used a recess appointment Friday
to install San Francisco philanthropist and gay rights advocate
James C. Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, bypassing opposition
from the Republican Senate leadership that sidetracked the
nomination for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, thus becomes the first openly gay American
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, issued a statement
saying: ``The president today announced the recess appointment of
James C. Hormel to serve as United States ambassador to
Luxembourg.''
</P>
<P>
   By naming him to the diplomatic post during a congressional
recess, Clinton overcame a stubborn political stalemate with
conservative Republican senators who have blocked action on the
nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved it
in a 16-2 vote in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. _ who
likened homosexuality to alcoholism, sex addiction and kleptomania
and urged Americans to help gays change their sexual orientation _
declined to lift the so-called ``holds'' that the four
conservatives had imposed, thus refusing to bring the nomination to
the Senate floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Congress returns from its 10-day Memorial Day recess on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution empowers a president to make recess
appointments and says that they ``shall expire at the end of
(Congress') next session,'' meaning that Hormel can serve until
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Traditional Values Coalition, a conservative group claiming
to represent 40,000 churches, charged Friday that Clinton's action
was ``a cowardly tactic of sneaking in an undesirable appointment
while avoiding public scrutiny.'' It called Hormel ``a purveyor of
smut'' and said that a San Francisco center he financed ``is one of
the biggest collections of pornography and pro-pedophilia
literature ever assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Smith, communications director at the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, said
Clinton's appointment was ``a bold move that is a testament to his
commitment to treating all people fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added: ``This fight was never about trying to get the
first openly gay ambassador. This has always been about making sure
that anti-gay bias was not a barrier to good people doing public
service for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes Clinton's action will not invite retaliation
from Capitol Hill. ``The usual suspects are going to be jacked up
about this, just as they are about all gay issues,'' he said.
``They will continue to try to enact policies that discriminate
against gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a Lott spokesman, called the recess appointment
``a slap in the face to Catholics everywhere.'' He said Lott was
concerned about what he called Hormel's support for groups critical
of the Catholic church. Czwartacki was referring to the fact that
Hormel, witnessing a parade of San Francisco drag queens dressed as
nuns several years ago, laughed at their antics targeting the
church's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican critics and conservative activists have
expressed concern that Hormel, a former dean of the University of
Chicago Law School, might use the Luxembourg post to proselytize
others to embrace homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a founder of the Human Rights Campaign, sought to allay
the concerns of critics last year with a letter to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use, nor do I think it appropriate to use, the
office of the ambassador to advocate any personal views that I may
hold on any issue,'' Hormel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The critics have focused on Hormel's $500,000 donation to the
San Francisco Main Public Library, which then named a collection of
gay and lesbian material after the contributor. Researchers at the
library have access not only to the papers of San Francisco gay
activists such as the late Harvey Milk and Randy Shilts, but also
to materials provided by controversial groups such as the North
American Man Boy Love Association, an organization that critics
accuse of advocating pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Hormel also has contributed to a program that sends
speakers to discuss homosexuality with elementary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton's recess appointment of Hormel will
enable the ambassador to serve in Luxembourg for the remaining 18
months of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's maneuver gives the appointee all the legal authority
of a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate but not the
political clout that a Senate confirmation conveys.
</P>
<P>
   The senators who announced their ``holds'' on Hormel's
nomination are Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.; James Inhofe, R-Okla., and
Bob Smith, R-N.H. The fourth remains anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had won commitments
from at least 60 senators to support confirmation of Hormel, 66,
the heir to the Hormel Meat Co. fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used recess appointments in the past to install
nominees for whom he could not win Senate confirmation. For
instance, he defied Senate opponents in December 1997 to give a
recess appointment to California civil rights lawyer Bill Lann Lee
to serve as acting assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   The president acted after his nomination of Lee, a prominent
Asian American civil rights lawyer, had languished before the
Senate Judiciary Committee for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renominated Lee to the post on March 5, setting the
stage for Lee to continue in the post as an acting assistant
attorney general for the remainder of Clinton's presidency.

BABY, HE'S BACK: MYERS GETS NAUGHTY AS AUSTIN POWERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 6) 
(Eds.: Movie opens Friday, June 11) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shhh, baby. Snuggle up close, and I'll whisper a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   No way this Mike Myers chap is the same fabulously groovy fellow
playing that cool Austin Powers or that deliciously evil domehead
Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   How could this shy and rather, er, unimposing guy with straight
teeth be the irreverent, hiply stupid swinger of the summer's
second-most-talked about sequel?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting quietly in his suite at the Four Seasons, slumped in an
easy chair with his stockinged feet curled under him and his
reddish-brown hair cut so short it sticks straight out all over, he
appears the antithesis of Austin Powers, the raunchy, sex-mad
exhibitionist eager to chase anyone in a plastic miniskirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a shy person, ultimately,'' Myers explains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dozens of bizarre comic characters he did for the
``Second City'' comedy troupes in Toronto and Chicago, on
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Wayne's World'' and now ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (opening Friday), Myers looks and
acts like a businessman forced to discuss the latest sales report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd sensation,'' he says of doing interviews, groping
for a way to explain the feeling. ``It's strangely flattering. Why
should anyone be talking to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Myers, who turned 36 on May 25, has connected in
some indefinable way with the comic consciousness of young
moviegoers. His ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,'' a
seemingly 30-years-too-late parody of James Bond and Pink Panther
films, was a juvenile, haphazard hodgepodge of frat-house humor
combined with psychedelic sight gags that seemed unlikely to amuse
any modern audience.
</P>
<P>
   Think again, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The film was only modestly successful at the box office, making
about $54 million. (Plenty to impress the '60s Dr. Evil, but far
less than the ``kajillion bajillions'' the president of the United
States offers him in the new film.) But ``Austin Powers'' took off
on cable and video, creating a high demand for a much-anticipated
sequel. To hear Myers tell it, no one was more surprised than he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this whole project as a cosmic in-joke,'' Myers says of
the first film. ``I thought you would have had to grow up in my
house to get this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just basically about all the movies my father forced us
to watch on TV. We just wrote what we thought was funny and hoped
people liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know we were going to do a second one. I didn't know
we were going to do a first one!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is more _ lots more _
of the things we saw in ``Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   More double-entendres. More puns on words for usually
unmentioned body parts. More almost-naughty sight gags. More
bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, more skitlike parodies of past movies: ``From
Russia With Love,'' ``In Like Flint,'' ``A Hard Day's Night,''
``You Only Live Twice,'' ``The Exorcist,'' ``Blow-Up,'' ``The
Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Apollo 13,'' ``Dr. No,'' ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' And so on and so on. Even Myers, who co-wrote and
co-produced the movie, admits he has no idea how many films are
mimicked and satirized.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, baby: ``You Only Live Twice'' is Myers' favorite
James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that has the (Little Nellie helicopter) that
came out of a suitcase,'' he says, gleefully. ``That's just cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The volcano lair of the villain Ernst Blofeld in ``You Only Live
Twice'' is copied by Dr. Evil's volcano hideout in ``The Spy Who
Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new film also has more Mike Myers. This time, in addition to
playing psychedelic '60s secret agent Austin Powers and his ineptly
wicked nemesis, Dr. Evil, Myers also plays an 800-pound Scottish
hit man named _ they must have thought a long time to come up with
something this witty _ Fat Bastard.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, behave, baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Saturday Night Live,' I played up to eight characters a
night,'' Myers says. ``I enjoy playing multiple characters. With
Fat Bastard, I just wanted to play somebody gross.''
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds at being gross not because of the character's
appearance, but because of his unpleasant personal sex and hygiene
habits. But let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   To play the role, Myers had to endure entire days inside the
heavy body suit created by Oscar-winning makeup artist Stan Winston
(``Aliens,'' ``Jurassic Park'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I love that it took seven hours (to put on)?,'' Myers says
sarcastically. ``The suit smelled like a sulfur filtration plant. I
probably lost four quarts of body fluid. It's gelatin and latex. It
is a work of art. It could tour. It's suitable for framing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Myers put on the fat suit, he discovered there
was no way for him to go to the bathroom. So plumbing was
installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wear a little thing on my winkie,'' Myers says. ``It
was not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the characters from the first film are back, too,
including Dr. Evil's No. 2 man, played by Robert Wagner, and his
son, played by Seth Green. Elizabeth Hurley is also back, but only
briefly, as the delectable Vanessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Bond has a new girl every time. If Elizabeth was '90s,
uptight and English, we needed someone '60s, liberated and American
to have the contrast. And to underscore how much time has passed
and how much the sexual revolution has passed and left Austin
behind,'' Myers says.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``shagadelic'' heroine, played by Heather Graham, is
named Felicity Shagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, misbehaving is a prime ingredient of ``Austin Powers''
humor. Take the film's title: in Great Britain, shag is a rude term
for fornication. But Myers insists the movie is not as raunchy as
it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no actual sex; it's virtual sex. There's no actual
smut; it's virtual smut. There's no actual violence; it's virtual
violence. It's more `Tom &AMP; Jerry' than anything. It's just silly.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits the movie rejoices in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, yes. So did the first one, though. I maintain the
first one was actually cheekier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to take a page from the Monty Python book. In British
comedy, there is a long tradition of smart stuff and dirty stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition Myers knows well. Although he was born and
raised in Toronto, his English parents always spoke of home as a
magical, wonderful place.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' father, Eric, remains a powerful factor in the actor's
life. Now, several years after his father's death, Myers mentions
him over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is really a tribute to him,'' Myers says.
</P>
<P>
   How was the ``Austin Powers'' idea born? What was its genesis?
Well, zip it, and he'll tell you. Shhh! Preemptive shhh!
</P>
<P>
   ``The genesis-genesis was, I was driving home from hockey
practice, and I heard The Look of Love by Burt Bacharach come on
the radio. (Bacharach has a cameo in both Austin Powers movies.) It
brought back many, many images of the '60s and of growing up in the
early '70s and watching stuff on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved Casino Royale (a spy parody with music by
Bacharach). That was a very cool movie, and Woody Allen was in it,
Peter Sellers and Orson Welles and David Niven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had just passed away, and what it most reminded me
of was growing up in an English household in Canada. Of all the
British comedy my father had introduced to me and my brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the mood (comedy) put my father in. That's my first
memory of comedy. It made the house feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   When Myers' father died, Myers took off more than a year from
work, coming back to do the first Austin Powers. Since his father
passed away, Myers has become even closer to Robin Ruzan, whom he's
lived with for 12 years and been married to for six.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad just dug me,'' Myers says. ``When I would tell him
stuff that would happen and he would react, the journey was
complete. I have a similar situation to Robin. She's my best
friend. I write stuff on my palm during the day to remind myself to
tell Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Myers does a pretty good job of convincing people
he's a long way from the swinging Austin Powers. But if he's such
an ordinary guy, why does he do these movies?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm naturally an introvert, and I get to be extroverted,''
Myers says. ``I love the clothes, I love the fashions and the
furnishings and the cars and the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really like to make people laugh. I care about (it in)
this movie, and I also care if I'm over at somebody's house just
cracking wise. I like to make people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have the most fun I've ever had doing this. If somebody
said I had to do (an Austin Powers movie) every two years, I'd be
the happiest man on the planet.''

HEAVYWEIGHT CAST CREATES A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THAT CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON 
Starring: Paul Sorvino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Terry Kinney, Tony
Shalhoub, Gary Sinise 
Directed by: Sorvino 
On: Showtime 
Time: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boys in the band have got nothing on the self-loathing,
secret-bearing, monologue-delivering men of ``That Championship
Season.'' These five fellows aren't gay, or at least they don't get
around to that particular revelation in the course of Showtime's
adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1972 play. But they sure
are tortured, and they sure do know how to turn a little party into
a big old drunken drag, complete with plenty of blood, sweat, and
tears, not to mention vomit, which conveniently finds its way into
the basketball trophy at the symbolic center of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Championship Season,'' which airs Sunday night at 8, is
heavy going, to put it mildly. It might be compared to having a
tooth pulled with a Robert Bly audiotape blaring over the dentist's
speaker system. As it jumps from macho confrontation to dazed
soul-baring and back again, Jason Miller's script is a bucket of
Big Statements about masculinity, America, capitalism, and
fraudulence, and self-important metaphors like ``You quit on the
field, you'll quit in life. It's on the playing field that wars are
won.'' And the storyline, about the 20th reunion of four high
school basketball stars at the home of their coach, is unnervingly
static, as far too many of its critical events happened at another
time, offstage. It's two hours of verbal aftermath. Maybe the
testosterone hysterics of ``That Championship Season'' were
fascinating and fresh in 1972, but these days they're pretty
bombastic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. It takes some savvy acting to turn all this
wordy angst into something more than poetic poop, and acting is
what the Showtime version has going for it. Indeed, the cast of
heavyweights actually manages to make it worthwhile, particularly
Paul Sorvino, who also directed. Sorvino played one of the
basketball players (the amoral businessman) on the stage and in the
1982 movie adaptation, but this time out he takes the juicy role of
Coach, the demented father figure who tells the four men, ``You
boys are my real trophies.'' Sorvino puts a monomaniacal glaze
behind Coach's eyes as he tells them how to lead their lives,
delivering racist and anti-Semitic lines without a moment's pause.
But Sorvino also manages to milk a sense of tragedy out of his
pathetic character, who treats life like a competitive game,
desperately afraid to lose again after a childhood loss. He's
really in top form here.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent D'Onofrio also keeps the production alive, as the
wealthy strip miner who had an affair with a wife of the one of the
other men. D'Onofrio is one of our most underrecognized actors,
with a string of great performances that include ``Full Metal
Jacket,'' ``The Whole Wide World,'' and the classic subway episode
of TV's ``Homicide.'' His Phil Romano is a viper who needs to be
needed financially, a man whose loyalties shift with the political
wind. He's a big baby, which D'Onofrio makes abundantly clear in a
momentary facial expression after a rifle has been aimed at him. As
the cuckholded mayor, who needs Phil's money for his reelection
campaign, Tony Shalhoub is effective as a Mr. Nice Guy who's filled
with rage beneath his friendly veneer. And Terry Kinney from ``Oz''
is perfectly cowardly as James, the nervous man who wants to run
the mayor's campaign. Unfortunately, Gary Sinise is mostly wasted
in the role of Tom, the cynical alcoholic who can only speak the
truth among this group of liars. It's not a very original role.
</P>
<P>
   These are all electric stage performances, and they nearly jump
off the TV screen. When each character has his predictable
``moment,'' the actors give you something to chew on beside the
dramatic cliches. Unfortunately, Sorvino's directing instincts
didn't lead him to open up the story visually, to make it more
cinematic and less of a filmed play. The camerawork is fine, but
the claustrophic house set becomes a tedious Nowheresville early
into the second hour. By then, we already know all too well that,
20 years after their shining moment, these guys are doomed.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A health advisory panel recommended late
Thursday that the San Francisco Health Commission allow bathhouses
and private rooms in gay sex clubs to reopen, 15 years after they
were banned at the height of the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The 9 to 1 vote by the HIV Prevention Planning Council hardly
expressed deep support within the council, which makes policy
recommendations to the Health Commission. Seven panel members
abstained because they wanted to postpone the vote until the
council's next meeting. And nearly half of the council's 32 members
were absent.
</P>
<P>
   The council's recommendation went against the views of Dr. Mitch
Katz, director of the city's Department of Public Health. He urged
that bathhouses and private rooms in sex clubs continue to be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Current policy permits gay sex clubs but requires that they
provide condoms and monitor sexual activity to prevent the spread
of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. At the sex clubs, men
typically gather in large common rooms and have no privacy.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. The disease is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of AIDS deaths and new HIV patients in San
Francisco has declined since 1984, Katz said the virus is still
spread by unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is which is safer: A bathhouse or sex club in
which there is constant monitoring, or no monitoring?''' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen speakers who appeared before the advisory council
voiced support for reopening the bathhouses and of allowing sex
clubs to provide private rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denying privacy does not prevent new infections,'' said David
Attyah, of Health Watch, a group of AIDS health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monitoring merely relocates sex to other venues, precisely
because it drives away men who want anonymity, intimacy, or control
over a sexual encounter. These people end up in places that lack
the key ingredients to safer behavior: information, support and
condoms.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were deep divisions on the council, with some members
saying they needed time to digest the testimony of Katz and the
others.
</P>
<P>
   A. Toni Young was the most vehement proponent of waiting to
vote, and was cast the sole negative vote on the recommendation to
the Health Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Maria Rinaldi, who made the motion for the council
recommendation, said that the meeting had been well-publicized, and
that ignoring the mandate of those who cared enough to show up was
insulting to the audience.

<P>
   Politics and power are inseparable; there is nothing new about
that. But it is policies that, in the final analysis, define the
nature of a government, the goals that it pursues and the interest
that it serves.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the trend in many countries has been
to allow the prevalence of tactical, self-serving and even cynical
politics at the expense of responsible policy-making. This is
happening at a time when the world is changing rapidly and
fundamentally, when today's decisions could affect the future in
dramatic and defining ways. Hasty, thoughtless decisions have
already cost us dearly in a number of regions and even on a global
scale. The diagnosis of world politics today is very clear: The
patient is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   This disease has taken a particularly severe and acute form in
Russia. The political crisis here has become virtually permanent,
with reform its main victim. The attempt to solve overnight the
problems involved in the difficult transition from one system to
another has affected all aspects of Russia's life in the most
destructive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Politically bankrupt and clueless, Russia's rulers are flailing
about, rushing to extremes and changing ministers like gloves.
Endless intrigues serve to conceal continuous failure of policy.
Yevgeni Primakov and his cabinet are the latest victims of those
intrigues.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite clear from the start that President Yeltsin's
decision to dismiss the cabinet had nothing to do with his declared
intention of kick-starting the Russian economy. That was just a
pretext _ so much so that even Primakov's designated successor,
Sergei Stepashin, at first stated that he would continue the
economic policies of the previous cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, was the real reason behind the decision taken by the
small coterie of Yeltsin's close associates, whom many Russians
call the family politburo? One reason, which is clear at a glance,
was the Russian president's jealousy of Primakov's popularity and
well-deserved public support.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken over when Russia's economy was in ruins, Primakov
was able to keep the country from falling into the abyss and to
create an atmosphere of stability. And, although the life of the
average Russian has not yet improved, people were beginning to see
a ray of light, of hope that an end to chaos and some improvement
was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, of course, resented the fact that while his own
approval ratings had plummeted to 2 percent or 3 percent, Primakov
had the support of about two-thirds of the populace, according to
opinion polls. Still, that reason, while obvious, was not the main
one.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov stood in the way of those in Russia who had illegally
accumulated tremendous wealth, who had grabbed vast amounts of
property through corruption and outright theft. It is those people,
fearful of losing what they had plundered, who orchestrated an
anti-Primakov campaign, declaring war on him in the media and in
the corridors of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   By firing Primakov, Yeltsin forfeited Russia's real interests
and acted in the interests of himself and of a group concerned only
with its own future _ and with finding a successor who could make
that future secure and comfortable. A self-proclaimed ``guardian of
the constitution,'' Yeltsin is acting more like the guardian of the
property and safety of a corrupt group.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the president's actions have destabilized the
situation in the country. The fact that the State Duma, Russia's
parliament, approved the choice of new premier does not at all mean
that the government crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is continuing, now in the form of a fierce struggle
for seats in the cabinet, levers of influence and control over
major financial flows. Stepashin, who did not want to appear as a
puppet in the hands of the president's entourage and the group of
crony capitalists, is being cut off from decision-making on these
matters.
</P>
<P>
   We see emerging from the shadows and put in key positions people
who don't care one bit about economic reform and even less about
democracy. The anti-corruption drive begun under Primakov has for
all intents and purposes been stopped, and indicted officials and
businessmen are being allowed to get away from justice.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Russia's final stretch to parliamentary elections later
this year and then the presidential election in 2000 will be even
tougher than it had to be. The Duma's approval of the new prime
minister's appointment was primarily meant to deprive Yeltsin of
any pretext for dissolving Parliament and perpetuating the regime
of one-man rule. I think that in doing so, the Duma acted properly.
The important thing now is where the leading Russian politicians
will go from here. They, and the political groups now being formed
around them, must act with a sense of utmost responsibility and
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Of great importance will be what Primakov decides to do. It
would be unfortunate if his dismissal and the insulting way he was
treated caused him to leave the Russian political arena. My advice
to him would be to give the entire situation serious thought. He
could retain his broad-based support. Significantly, he continues
to lead all opinion polls. If the elections were held today, he
would most probably be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has already offered Primakov a
partnership within the political group he is now creating.
</P>
<P>
   It is my considered opinion that the ``optimal way'' scenario
for Russia would involve amending the present constitution. We must
get rid of its authoritarian straightjacket. Prudent changes in the
constitution would strike a proper balance between the presidency,
a more authoritative and responsible cabinet of ministers and a
reasonably strong parliament. I continue to believe that within
such a structure of government, Primakov would be the best choice
for president and Luzhkov for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is capable of leaving behind the overly long and painful
stage of its ``start-up development.'' Responsible policies and
policy makers must replace its current strain of politics. And,
though conditions differ, many Western countries too could set for
themselves a similar goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is achieved, we could begin to address together the
challenges of the coming century.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Terry and Julie Ann Stephens weren't always
the Bible-toting do-gooders who teach youth Bible class at First
Baptist Church of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Terry Stephens was a drug pusher and Julie Ann
Stephens was an exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now they use their not-so-wholesome backgrounds to help youths
who are off the beaten path, not only spirituality, but also in the
way they are viewed by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Stephenses describe the youths who attend their class as
``alternative.'' Many fit the ``Goth'' image, with black clothes
and black hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like our class because it's not cliquey; everyone accepts
everyone the way they are,'' Julie Ann said. ``Obviously, for Terry
and I, no wonder we don't judge. We have no place to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Columbine High School shootings, in which peer
acceptance may have been a factor, more church groups should adopt
an open-door policy, the Stephenses say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned kids who might not have come to a regular
church,'' Julie Ann said. ``Our kids, nobody expects them to be
perfect, and because nobody expects anything, they'll be open and
let it all out. Our kids are all dealing with drugs, sex and
prejudice. Other kids are worrying about, `I don't know if I'll
have a date for prom.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Terry Stephens, 35, has been open about his past
drug use makes his message a more credible testimonial for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, felt like an outsider in the church, and his alienation
led him to find new friends, who led him to a seven-year affair
with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he almost died, it wasn't until Terry prayed for
change that he stopped shooting up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought I would have gotten off it when a guy
held a pistol to my head. You would have thought I would have
gotten off it when I laid in the hospital for four days with
hepatitis and 106.1-degree temperature and they thought it was
AIDS,'' he said. ``But that didn't do it. It was God, plain and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Terry shares his testimony with the teens in his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surrendered my life to Christ to serve God years ago,'' he
said. ``I've staggered at times ... but God is using me now in a
tremendous way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Terry's past is out in the open, very few church
members and only a handful of the youth know about Julie Ann's
background.
</P>
<P>
   But at 30, she still carries the emotional scars that came with
baring her body to strangers for money.
</P>
<P>
   And though she is reluctant to share her story as openly as her
husband does, she said her testimony does make her more credible,
especially with the girls in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cases where girls are kind of going on the wild side,
that's when it comes up,'' she said. ``I say, `Hey, I've been
there, done that, it's not worth it. You just don't do something
like that and it's all over. You do something like that, and the
memories last forever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Stephenses use their life experiences to relate to the
youths in ways that more traditional Bible classes could not. And
out of that bonding have come several success stories, such as the
change that has taken place in David Howard, 20, who three years
ago was a skinhead who wore Nazi patches and terrified people.
</P>
<P>
   The first day the Stephenses met Howard, he had gone to the
church to fight with another teen. Terry Stephens stepped in the
middle and began praying for Howard. A year later, Howard was
saved.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a leader in the church and recently married the
mother of his child. And though premarital sex is considered taboo
in Christian teachings, the Stephenses have focused on how far the
boy has come.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those who have changed their lives, the class is not
without its share of failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of our kids have been to prison,'' Julie Ann said.
``Obviously, we're not proud of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with me, the change was like night and day,'' she said.
``Nothing happened before I got saved. I used to say `I'm not going
to get saved because I like what I do.' I was not going to stop
dancing (because of) God. I liked the money, and I wasn't going to
stop. I see a lot of teen-agers who are like I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Grice, a youth pastor at the church, said the couple has
had a positive effect on many youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become a part of a lot of their lives, and they can
share the victory and the pain because they're not all happy
endings,'' he said.

U.S. TRIES TO SMOOTH WAY FOR REFUGEES FROM KOSOVO

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the director of the State Department's
Refugee Admissions Office, Theresa Rusch is impresario for a vast
and far-flung operation that each year resettles tens of thousands
of people fleeing war and civil strife the world over.
</P>
<P>
   She was in San Francisco Thursday to publicize the department's
campaign to aid 20,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, refugees
America has agreed to shelter until they can be safely returned to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 6,000 refugees from Kosovo already in the United States,
the international peace plan that was approved this week by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his government is only
the latest uncertainty in the chaotic lives of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few days will be telling,'' Rusch said. ``Milosevic
agreed to many things in the past that have not come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Once processed at Fort Dix, N.J., the refugees are being flown
to their receiving cities at the rate of 100 per day. It might be
some time before any refugees can return, Rusch said, even with the
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with how fast things move and how much
destruction has to be reversed,'' Rusch said. ``That's the big
question mark right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Army and police units have destroyed homes and villages
abandoned by the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia,
which is the dominant state in Yugoslavia. In addition, the
refugees say soldiers and border guards confiscated their driving
licenses, passports and other identity papers as they fled the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, more refugees have been relocated to America
than anywhere else in the world. Since 1980, more than 1.7 million
have been admitted to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 people in Kosovo fled during the height of
reprisals by the Yugoslav military and police, and the bombing by
North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations that begin in March.
Some 28 nations have agreed to temporarily resettle some of the
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the new refugees are going to New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois, areas
with existing Albanian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Their reception is being handled by 10 agencies that are well
versed in helping refugees resettle.
</P>
<P>
   One, the International Rescue Committee, has resettled 45,000
refugees in the San Francisco Bay area since the IRC's first office
opened in here in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Like refugees the world over, these newcomers need housing, food
and medical attention. But people from Kosovo are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new about them is that they really haven't had any time
to internalize what's happened to them,'' said Don Climent,
regional director of IRC in San Francisco. ``Everything's happened
to them in a very extreme and fast way. There's no time for
decompression.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees escaping war also bring up other issues, Climent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are resettled in a situation where war or civil
strife is unresolved, it carries with it some other dimensions _
people can feel guilty for having been saved,'' he said. ``Or they
are very concerned about the safety and whereabouts of their
relatives. So it brings on a sort of heightened anxiety for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie McLeod, regional director of IRC's San Jose office, said
she saw that in the recent arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a feeling of hopelessness in the situation
over there,'' McLeod said. ``These families are families we've all
heard about _ they had two minutes to leave, were put on trains,
they went through that whole experience.''

LONG-STEMMED COSMOS FOR AN ARMFUL OF BEAUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 6) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGEANNE BRENNAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cosmos, a reliable summer bloomer, is usually available in
garden centers. The plants are often part of the dwarf Sonata
series in shades of pink, lilac, rose, white or mixed.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfortunate, because one of the splendid characteristics
of cosmos is the extraordinary height and mass of bright green,
lacy foliage; waxy buds, and broad blooms that a single tiny seed
can produce. (There are 8,000 to an ounce.) The dwarf varieties
grow only 20 to 30 inches tall, but the standard varieties reach
four feet and more.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus) was popular 30 years ago, when people
grew flowers from seed, rather than buying transplants for flower
beds. Today, however, the bedding plant business is booming, which
creates a problem for flowers like cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Bedding plants, flower transplants that give quick color, sell
better if they are blooming, but standard cosmos grows too large to
be contained in a six-pack of plants until it blooms. In those
conditions, if it grows long enough to bloom, chances are it will
be too root-bound to be of much use once transplanted into the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American Seeds in Lompoc, Calif., found a remedy, breeding
Sonata, a dwarf cosmos that blooms in a six-pack and still performs
transplanted in the garden. In 1996, Sonata, in red, carmine and
pink, won the flower industry's respected Fleuroselect Quality
Award for its novelty, and it remains a strong seller.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, Sakata Seed, a large Japanese company
known for breeding specialty strains for commercial cut flowers,
introduced its Versailles series of tall cosmos in two colors,
carmine and pink eye, followed by blush pink and pink in 1993 and
white and mixed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   These are full-size plants, which grow to four feet tall,
starting to bloom at two feet. They are popular in the cut-flower
trade because of large clusters of flowers carried near the top of
the plant on long, strong stems rising above the foliage, but they
are rarely found in six-packs at garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmos, along with the more glamorous zinnias and dahlias, is a
member of the sunflower tribe, a subgroup in the Compositae or
Asteraceae family distinguished by their flowers. Each flower is a
group of small flowers arranged to give the appearance of a single
flower. The florets in the center are disk flowers, and the florets
around the outside, which carry showy, colorful petals, are ray
flowers. The ray flowers, which are usually sterile, bloom first,
and then the disk flowers bloom in a circular pattern from the
outside in.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmos, which are annuals, are closely related to the dahlia
and, like the dahlia, are native to Mexico. C. bipinnatus occurs in
shades from white to dark purple, but C. sulfureus, a plant one and
a half to two feet tall, with thicker foliage than C. bipinnatus,
produces red or bright yellow flowers. A number of novelty cosmos
are available through seed catalogs, including some with tubular
petals, picotee edges and a new soft yellow dwarf, billed as a
Sonata descendent.
</P>
<P>
   The hardy cosmos can be grown almost anywhere and needs little
care. It is important, however, to keep the flowers cut and to
remove dead blooms, not only to insure the continuing production of
new flowers, but also because a ragtag plant covered with spent
blooms makes it difficult to find lengths of fresh flowers to cut.
Cosmos is an excellent cutting flower and is valuable in
arrangements for its flowers, as well as for its lacy leaves and
tight buds, which act as fillers in bouquets and add texture.
</P>
<P>
   To grow cosmos from seed, scatter the seeds over a prepared bed
and cover them only a scant quarter of an inch. (Do not work
fertilizer into the soil at planting, nor add it later, because
cosmos grown in rich soil become very vegetative, leggy and
scraggly, producing little or no bloom.) Keep the ground moist
until germination occurs, in about seven days, then keep the top
foot of soil moist, but do not overwater. Overwatering is an enemy
of cosmos, particularly in warm humid areas, and can contribute to
root and stem rot.
</P>
<P>
   When the plants begin to fill and bloom, they will provide
armloads of cut flowers.

<P>
   BELGRADE _ So we've won the war, have we? That's what we are now
being told by our leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Blair, Cook and all the rest are telling us that NATO
may shortly achieve its aim of returning 750,000 refugees to their
homes, of installing a NATO-Russian force in Kosovo and ensuring
the withdrawal of Serb police and troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after its failure to crush a country of 10 million people
in fewer than 70 days, can now walk tall again. All the Albanians
who trekked over the frontiers of Macedonia and Albania are going
to head home under ``our'' protection.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC and CNN have gone along with this scenario _ just as
their cameras will be there to record the emotional return of the
people of Kosovo to Pristina, Prizren, Pec and the other scorched
towns.
</P>
<P>
   All that will be missing is the truth: that we never went to war
for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   We went to war for a peace agreement accepted by the Kosovo
Albanians but rejected by the Serbs _ an agreement that NATO's
leaders have themselves now rejected in their desperation to finish
the air bombardment on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   For the price of peace for NATO is the erasure of the most
crucial paragraph in the Paris peace agreement _ the ``final
settlement'' promised to the Kosovo Albanians after three years of
autonomy that would almost certainly have led to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, we have allowed our leaders to bend the historical
record, to twist the truth out of all recognition so that NATO's
``victory'' will be the return of an army of refugees who were not
even refugees when we began this wretched war.
</P>
<P>
   And we are on the point of betraying the Kosovo Albanians whom
we persuaded to sign up for peace in Paris with a promise that the
``will of the people'' (90 percent of them Albanians) would be
respected in 2002 with almost certain independence.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot expect the BBC or CNN to rewind the film for us but we
can nevertheless spool back through the last three months of
history to remind ourselves of why we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   In their campaign of ``ethnic cleansing,'' the Serbs had by the
early spring committed a series of massacres. The world was
outraged by what appeared to be a repeat _ if on a smaller scale _
of the Bosnian war. And we in the West still had a score to settle
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic over that terrible
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the Kosovo Albanians were cajoled into signing the
American-scripted ``peace.'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright cozied up to her ``friend'' Hashim Thaci, the KLA man
known as ``The Snake'' who was then the guerrilla army's leading
officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, U.S. General Wesley Clark _ the very same general
who has been busy bombing Serbia's barracks, army, air force,
railways, oil refineries, water treatment plants, bridges,
hospitals and housing complexes _ was brought in to remonstrate
with Thaci.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanians would obtain their freedom, they were told,
because _ under the terms of the Paris agreement _ an international
meeting on Kosovo would be held in three years' time ``to determine
a mechanism for a final settlement for Kosovo, on the basis of the
will of the people, opinions of the relevant authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since only 10 percent of ``the people'' were Serbs, the KLA knew
what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   Then the war began. And within weeks, the biblical exodus of the
Kosovo Albanians was upon us, driven from their homes by the Serbs
the moment NATO commenced its bombardment of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair was to tell us that the
refugee situation would have been ``far worse'' had NATO not gone
into action _ a suggestion he mercifully forgot once half the
Kosovo nation had poured over the international frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had every reason to know what would happen if it
went to war with Serbia; on March 18, General Nebojsa Pavkovic said
in Belgrade that ``settling scores with the terrorists (sic) still
in Kosovo doesn't pose any problem and that's what we'll do if our
country is attacked from the air or the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the tragedy of the Kosovo Albanians was before our eyes,
General Clarke announced that their exodus was ``entirely
predictable.'' He hadn't shared that information with us, of
course, when the war had begun.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment, the return of the refugees was adopted as the
principal purpose of NATO's war. NATO troops would not enter Kosovo
to ``protect'' the people _ they would enter in order to ensure
their safe return from an exile which the war itself had brought
about.
</P>
<P>
   And the promises about the ``will of the people'' were
forgotten. Independence for the Kosovars was no longer mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The ``peace'' that Milosevic has now accepted is not the peace
of Rambouillet or of Paris. NATO will send in the troops and force
the Serb army out. But it is no longer offering a ``mechanism'' to
respect the ``will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians will go back to an international protectorate that
contains no formula for independence. The KLA will be
``demilitarized.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a world where crystal balls are always broken, I venture
to make a prediction about Kosovo which I sincerely hope will prove
wrong:
</P>
<P>
   - That in the days before NATO's troops arrive in Kosovo, the
KLA's new commander _ the infamous Agim Cecu who, as a Croatian
army general, ``ethnically cleansed'' 170,000 Serb civilians from
Krajina _ will ``cleanse'' the remaining Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ That the KLA will refuse to be ``demilitarized.''
</P>
<P>
   _ That in a few months' time _ at most a year _ NATO's enemies
will be the KLA, who will be raging against the West for abandoning
their hopes of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Then we shall remember how we thought we had won the war. &QL;

<P>
   Then the war began. And within weeks, the biblical exodus of the
Kosovo Albanians was upon us, driven from their homes by the Serbs
the moment NATO commenced its bombardment of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair was to tell us that the
refugee situation would have been ``far worse'' had NATO not gone
into action _ a suggestion he mercifully forgot once half the
Kosovo nation had poured over the international frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had every reason to know what would happen if it
went to war with Serbia; on March 18, General Nebojsa Pavkovic said
in Belgrade that ``settling scores with the terrorists (sic) still
in Kosovo doesn't pose any problem and that's what we'll do if our
country is attacked from the air or the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the tragedy of the Kosovo Albanians was before our eyes,
General Clarke announced that their exodus was ``entirely
predictable.'' He hadn't shared that information with us, of
course, when the war had begun.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment, the return of the refugees was adopted as the
principal purpose of NATO's war. NATO troops would not enter Kosovo
to ``protect'' the people _ they would enter in order to ensure
their safe return from an exile which the war itself had brought
about.
</P>
<P>
   And the promises about the ``will of the people'' were
forgotten. Independence for the Kosovars was no longer mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The ``peace'' that Milosevic has now accepted is not the peace
of Rambouillet or of Paris. NATO will send in the troops and force
the Serb army out. But it is no longer offering a ``mechanism'' to
respect the ``will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians will go back to an international protectorate that
contains no formula for independence. The KLA will be
``demilitarized.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a world where crystal balls are always broken, I venture
to make a prediction about Kosovo which I sincerely hope will prove
wrong:
</P>
<P>
   - That in the days before NATO's troops arrive in Kosovo, the
KLA's new commander _ the infamous Agim Cecu who, as a Croatian
army general, ``ethnically cleansed'' 170,000 Serb civilians from
Krajina _ will ``cleanse'' the remaining Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ That the KLA will refuse to be ``demilitarized.''
</P>
<P>
   _ That in a few months' time _ at most a year _ NATO's enemies
will be the KLA, who will be raging against the West for abandoning
their hopes of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Then we shall remember how we thought we had won the war. &QL;

PIANIST OVERCOMES DRUG ADDICTION AND PRISON TERM TO COMPETE IN
CLIBURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMOND, Okla. _ The Steinway grand piano was the last thing to
go.
</P>
<P>
   He placed an ad in the Sunday edition of the Daily Oklahoman,
and four days later the piano sold for $14,500. It was worth about
$27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fisher didn't care at that point. He needed the money. And
when the final $9,000 check came from the buyer, Fisher and his
girlfriend took a taxi to the bank, then to their drug dealer and
then to the Marriott Hotel in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they checked out three days later, they had smoked
$1,300 worth of crack cocaine. Within a month, the entire 14 grand
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   That was June 1995. In October, Fisher was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Orange jumpsuit, shorn hair, monthly visits from his mother:
This was Greg Fisher nine years after he left the University of
Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory, one recital shy of his master's
degree in piano performance.
</P>
<P>
   He had his excuses for leaving school: a bad breakup with a girl
he planned to marry, a struggling family business back home in
Edmond that needed a hand, the feeling that his blue-collar parents
and siblings considered his pursuit frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   So he packed his music books in cardboard boxes and went home to
help boost sales at AAA Edmond Glass &AMP; Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded _ when hadn't he? _ and was looking for ways to
spend his windfall when a new girlfriend introduced him to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of Fisher's life, the part without music, is over.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 38-year-old Fisher will perform in the first
round of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs. Just over 140 people applied, and of the 92
accepted, most make their livings as highly accomplished
professionals: the consul general of Brazil in Miami, the
philosophy lecturer at Cambridge, the ophthalmologist with perfect
pitch, the chief art critic from The New York Times, the public
policy professor and former staff member of the National Security
Council during the Kennedy administration. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fisher installs window glass. He still sees a probation
officer once a month, and most of his relatives prefer
country-western to classical.
</P>
<P>
   But his musical resume and the list of pieces he has learned and
performed were enough to convince the Cliburn Foundation that he's
worthy of a shot _ though victory is less important to Fisher than
simply having made it this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, considering where I've come from, where I've been,'' he
says, ``I've already won.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Fisher lives in a small white house that he leases from his
parents in a middle-class section of Edmond. It's a five-minute
drive to the glass shop, where he works, and a three-minute drive
to the campus of the University of Central Oklahoma, where he is
studying, again, for his master's degree in piano.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he bought a 6-foot-1-inch Baldwin grand piano that
takes up most of his living room. He should have bought a car, he
says, but he bought the piano instead for $12,000, which he is
paying off in $300 monthly installments. These days, he gets around
in a white Dodge Ram van with ``AAA Edmond Glass &AMP; Mirror'' painted
on its sides.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher works mornings at the shop, alongside his mom, dad,
brother, sister and sister-in-law. He used to manage the front
office, but that was before the drugs and the jail time and before
Fisher had sacrificed the trust of his family. When his parents
took him back into the business, they told him he'd have to work
his way up from the bottom. So now Fisher installs auto glass. He's
gotten good at it, but the experience has been humbling.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy Monday morning, Fisher replaces the driver's side
window of a Buick LeSabre. He sits on a red dolly wearing a blue
work shirt with ``Greg'' stitched onto a rectangular patch. He's
been here since 7 a.m., and his thick, square hands are grimy. Bud
Fisher watches over his son's shoulder, wearing a gimme cap on his
head and a tape measure on his belt. Greg's mother, Marlene, a
petite woman with a Sicilian temperament, nurses a plastic-foam cup
of coffee from the nearby Conoco station.
</P>
<P>
   The Fishers remain guarded, if hopeful, about their son's
recovery and his rededication to piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Bud says later while prying a window out
of a school bus. ``Seems a shame to waste the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, Greg Fisher attends class and then returns
home to practice. He sits at the Baldwin for six hours a day,
refining his competition repertoire. The pieces he's chosen
resonate with his personal experiences: Debussy's ``Ondine,'' named
for the mythological water nymph who lured men to their deaths
(Fisher says he's always been attracted to the wrong kind of
woman), and Liszt's ``Sposalizio,'' inspired by the composer's
viewing of Raphael's painting ``Betrothal of the Virgin'' (Fisher
says he owes a lot to his religious faith).

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has

   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the

Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows

</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has had an ambivalent relationship

documents suggested he dodged the Vietnam draft.

<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.

Clinton have resurrected the just war, a concept their anti-war

EDMOND, Okla.: religious faith).

<P>
   Piano is Fisher's therapy. He weeps and rages and loves through
the music he plays. He says he needs his audience to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of me,'' he insists. ``It will always be part of me.
And it took me a long time to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Fisher hadn't taken a music lesson in 13 years when Jan Steele
called him last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Steele had been his first piano teacher in Oklahoma and taught
him from ages 14 to 19. She had followed the promising trajectory
of his academic career after he left the University of Central
Oklahoma (UCO) for Kansas City. Later, she had heard about his drug
addiction. She knew he had quit piano and was now urging him to
come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what's missing in your life,'' Steele told
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he signed up for applied piano at UCO _ $300 for
two credit hours.
</P>
<P>
   The first months were frustrating. Fisher's fingers refused to
obey. His mind functioned sluggishly. ``I felt like a third-year
piano student,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At Steele's instruction, Fisher relearned all the Chopin etudes
_ complex technique studies _ and the inspiration gradually
returned. In January, he committed to a full load of classes and to
completing his master's degree. And in May, 300 people, including
family members, watched Fisher perform with the UCO Orchestra, an
honor bestowed upon the music school's top students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like classical music,'' admits Fisher's sister, Linda
Leonard. ``The only time I like it is when I hear him play. Then it
takes on a whole different meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Music was Greg Fisher's first addiction. He was 8 when he
decided he wanted to pursue piano, though no one in the family
could figure out why. None of the relatives played an instrument.
No one listened to classical music except Fisher's maternal
grandmother, Catherine Monfre, a Van Cliburn fan. But Fisher
begged, and his mother relented. After all, Marlene had yearned for
music lessons as a child and had never had them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally wanted them to play country-western,'' Marlene
says of her children. ``It never entered my mind, classical.''
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Milwaukee at the time: Marlene and Bud; Greg
and older sister Linda; Pat and Pam, the twins, younger by only 11
months. Bud delivered oil for Pennzoil before managing a glass
store and moving the family to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   By age 10, Fisher had won a partial scholarship to the Wisconsin
College Conservatory. But the lessons, instruments and travel
expenses still cost more than the family could afford at the time.
Marlene took a second job, waiting tables in addition to working at
a service station.
</P>
<P>
   Monfre thought her daughter was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would get my mom aside and say, `Just have him drop it,'''
Fisher recalls. ```It's not going to serve us any benefit, and we
can't afford it. What do you think he's going to do, go to college
for piano or something?'''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Fisher broke out in hives for two months after his family moved
to Oklahoma. He was 14 at the time, and his piano teacher in
Milwaukee had wanted Fisher to continue studying under her; she
even offered to house the teen-ager. The stress overwhelmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was very quiet, he was introverted,'' Marlene says. ``The
other kids did fine, but Greg kept everything inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher landed with Steele and eventually won a full scholarship
to UCO. He was the first person in his family to attend college.
Two years later, he transferred to the University of
Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory, a much more competitive venue.
</P>
<P>
   His self-confidence plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the worst,'' Fisher confesses. ``I mean, I used to call
home and cry to my mom, `I want to come home. I'm the worst pianist
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher nearly packed it in, but his professor, Richard Cass,
convinced him he was capable of catching up. Within two years,
Fisher had won the school's top award _ first place in the
concerto-aria competition _ and a first place in the Missouri Music
Teachers Association Graduate Honors Auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who come at piano from an intellectual
point of view, and they master it one way or another,'' Cass says.
``But Greg had a flair for it from the beginning. That's something
that can't be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakup with his girlfriend came just before Fisher would
have started buckling down for his final master's degree recital.
Her parents didn't approve of the relationship and had refused to
pay for her education if she continued seeing him. So she broke it
off. Fisher was devastated and took it as a sign.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he wasn't meant to be here. Maybe the glass shop was a
better option.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1986, he left Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' says Marlene, sitting in a back
room of the shop. ``I still am. I try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher excelled as a businessman. He worked 12- to 14-hour
days and all but forgot about piano. Sales at the shop rose, and
AAA Edmond Glass &AMP; Mirror moved to bigger quarters on the city's
main retail strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got busy, made lots of money, and everybody was happy,
happy, happy,'' Fisher says. Everyone but him.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had been out of school for three years when he started
doing cocaine on the weekends. He liked the intensity of the high,
liked being able to forget the empty feeling that followed him
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Money was no problem. Fisher had enough to buy a Jaguar and a
ski boat and finally the Steinway. He rarely played at that point,
except when his girlfriend, an exotic dancer, encouraged him to
dabble. She would tape-record Fisher's occasional Henry
Mancini-like improvs and called his melodies ``angel music.'' She
also urged him to try crack. He was hooked after the first time.

CLASSICS IN PLASTIC: ANTIQUE RADIO COLLECTION PLEASES THE EYES, NOT
THE EARS 

</HEADLINE>

By CATHY GORDON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Art dealer Thom Andriola is radical about radios.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any kind of radios.
</P>
<P>
   Classics in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   His collection of 250 plastic radios, from table-top models to
transistors, lines an entire wall of his Houston home in colorful,
flamboyant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate-brown models made of the first synthetic plastic,
Bakelite, which was patented about 1910. Rare Catalin radios from
the late 1930s and mid 1940s in rich green, caramel and
butterscotch colors. Funky finds from the midcentury in tropical
Life Savers shades.
</P>
<P>
   Eye candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just beautiful to look at,'' says Andriola, himself a
colorful statement in his royal blue shirt and matching shoes. His
Great Wall of Radios provides a visual history of the plastic radio
from the 1930s to the early 1970s. But don't stare at the
candy-colored Catalins too long. Their mouth-watering colors
confuse the senses.
</P>
<P>
   These are radios, after all. Boxes with components. Made to emit
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, however, they sit here in warm chunks of color,
arousing the taste buds as if they were giant, delectable treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catalin radios, especially, have such a richness to them.
They almost look like candy,'' says Andriola, owner of Houston's
New Gallery, which displays contemporary paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   While he cherishes the radios for their unique blend of
technology, art and style, you won't find them on display at his
gallery. This is a floor-to-ceiling private collection, started 14
years ago when his wife, Annette Wilzig, happened upon a little
brown Bakelite radio with a crack in its side.
</P>
<P>
   Wilzig, an assemblage artist, often peruses junk and antiques
shops for objects to use in her sculptures. She spotted the radio
among a sea of books at an antiques mall. Its side was stapled to
keep it from additional cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took pity on it. I had to have it. It needed me,'' says
Wilzig, who quickly snapped up the 1946 Farnsworth model, intending
to use it in one of her sculptures. But she adored its streamlined
art deco style and loved it unconditionally for what it was: ``a
permanently punctured little Bakelite radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Today that hapless little radio with staples in its side is
still her favorite, despite a collection of rare, pristine-looking
models that share shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me sentimental,'' Wilzig says. ``It was our first. And
besides, I love imperfect things.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bakelite radios are represented in the couple's
collection, as are 20 rare Catalin radios. It did not escape
Andriola's attention when Time magazine recently named Belgian
chemist Leo Baekeland, the inventor of Bakelite, as one of this
century's greatest minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody did their homework,'' says Andriola. ``Bakelite is
the first pure man-made plastic. It's probably the most important
invention for almost everything that's happened in this century as
far as economics goes, as far as industrialization goes. The entire
concept of transistorizing and computerizing _ it was really
plastic that made these things possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the radio was as important to most households as
television is today. Up to this time, wooden radios were most
common. But a society strapped by the Great Depression looked to
Bakelite as an excellent, cost-effective way to simulate the look
of wood. Along with Catalin, these plastics revolutionized the way
radios and other objects could be made.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MANY COLOR POSSIBILITIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bakelite and Catalin are of nearly identical chemical
composition, both being made of varying amounts of phenol and
formaldehyde mixed with a catalyst. Bakelite is a molding powder,
and Catalin is a casting resin. Catalin, clear or tinted to almost
any color or mixture of colors, was responsible for the marbleized
plastic effect that became so popular in radio cabinets in the '30s
and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   These brightly colored Catalin radios with modern styling were
considered ahead of their time. Some Catalin radios oxidized into
completely different colors over the years. For instance, an ivory
Catalin radio becomes a butterscotch color with age, while blue
melds into a green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, this Fada Bullet radio is blue,'' says
Andriola, holding up a green-looking radio that shows hints of its
true colors under light.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CATALIN FADA BULLET RADIOS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among Andriola's favorites are four Catalin Fada Bullet radios,
named for their distinctive shapes. The Fada Bullet's overall
styling was a radical departure from its boxy predecessors, and it
came in a variety of color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Andriola can recite model numbers, production dates and
historical facts about the radios with ease, but don't ask him
about a radio's guts. He couldn't care less if a radio works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even tried listening to them. I'm just interested in
their beauty and great design,'' Andriola says. ``It's the idea
that these radios represent the last kind of eccentric design you
see that was mass-produced in America. That's what's really great
about them. A lot of them probably work, but I wouldn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriola and his wife are not follow-the-pack collectors.
</P>
<P>
   They started collecting radios long before it was in vogue, long
before books were written on the subject and long before prices
went up and up and up, although Andriola prefers not to reveal the
collection's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the collection is worth way more today than we would ever
even think of paying for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While a rare Catalin radio costs more than $2,000 today,
Andriola says he paid from $150 to $900 for his Catalin radios.
</P>
<P>
   Radios were competing for shelf space in the couple's home a
decade before auctions on the Internet made such collecting
possible with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When others get on the train, we get off,'' says Andriola, who
admits their zest has been somewhat zapped ``by everyone coming on
board.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple preferred collecting when radios were cheaper and
finding them was a challenge. ``It's all about the thrill of the
hunt,'' Andriola says.
</P>
<P>
   And hunt they did.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Texas antiques or junk shops were of much help _ at
least not at first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TEXANS NOT BIG ON PLASTIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of collecting has really been a challenge because we
discovered that plastic radios apparently were not that popular in
Texas back when they were new,'' Andriola says. ``We'd go into
antique places and say, `Do you have any radios?' They'd show us
wooden radios. We'd say, `No, no, no. Plastic radios.' They looked
at us like we were insane. `Plastic radios from the '30s or '40s.
Who'd even want one?'''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's fascination with plastic radios from the '50s and
'60s is evident, too. These radios make a splash with loud colors
and emblematic dials.
</P>
<P>
   A 1959 turquoise-and-ivory radio by Trav-ler with its
cartoonlike biomorphic shape and Mercedes Benz-like dial, is one of
Andriola's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Midcentury Crosley radios, made to match the refrigerators in
colors such as avocado green, look ready to roll with their blaring
automobile motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the James Bond radio. Not the proper name for this
late 1950s RCA Victor model, but it seems to fit with its sleek
look and hip dial on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my nickname for it. You can just picture it next to his
bed. It's a gentlemen's radio,'' says Wilzig.
</P>
<P>
   The display of ceiling-to-floor radios impresses visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the UPS guy comes or somebody who's not expecting it,
they say, `Whoa!' Then they start pointing all over the place, and
it's deja vu. Like, `Oh, my grandmother had that one,''' says
Wilzig. ``Also, the transistors. It's like, `Hey, I had that
transistor in high school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Who can resist a transistor? Andriola can't.
</P>
<P>
   Transistors make up a large part of the collection these days.
The story of this miniaturized sound box, perfected by Japanese
technology, is represented in a bevy of brands in varying colors,
grilles and futuristic motifs that epitomized American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Andriola's latest find? An early Toshiba pocket-size transistor
called the Bathroom Scale because it resembles, well, a bathroom
scale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRANSISTORS APPROPRIATE HERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Andriola should include transistors in his
collection. After all, Houston is the transistor's birthplace. In
July 1954, engineers from Houston-based Texas Instruments met with
counterparts from an Indianapolis electronics firm to brainstorm
about this top-secret project, hoping to have the first small
all-transistor radio in stores by Christmas. The radio was dubbed
the Regency TR-1. While it didn't set the American mass market on
fire, Japan's efforts with the miniaturized radios soon did.
</P>
<P>
   One of Andriola's favorite transistors is Sony's first
commercially exported pocket-transistor, the TR-63, circa 1957, in
red with a silver grille and gold dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Sony transistor sold for $1,000 on the Net,'' he says.
``Just a few years ago, you could find that particular one for,
like, $25.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriola is also nostalgic about a 1957 black Arvin transistor
with a gold-and-black abstract applique on its grille, the first he
collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my segue to pull transistors into the collection. It
seemed to fit with its look of abstract expressionism that was so
popular back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriola and his wife say they aren't actively looking to expand
their collection. But they still keep a discriminating eye peeled
for that rare radio at the right price (preferably pocket-size
because space is lacking) that might fit the mix.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they know their plastics. Wilzig keeps a large,
leather-bound album of vintage advertisements for all kinds of
plastics, Catalin and Bakelite included.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can almost sniff it out. I've been known to track down a
woman a block away because I can hear her Bakelite bangle bracelets
clanking,'' says Wilzig, who also has a collection of rare Bakelite
jewelry. She reaches behind some radios to retrieve a 2-inch round
rod of bright red Catalin. A rod of Catalin like this was used to
make things like backgammon game pieces, she explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like with the radios. So delicious-looking. It's
like a big cherry Life Savers stick. Hard to believe a material can
look this yummy.''

EDMOND, Okla.: first time. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marlene knew something was wrong. Her son, the former
workaholic, would leave work for a lunch break and never come back.
He had run through $50,000 in savings in six months and once begged
his brother for an emergency $400 loan, swearing that his dealer
would shoot him if he didn't pay on time.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Fisher held a garage sale, selling furniture and
dishes to support the couple's $400-a-day habit. In May, the
Steinway went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a no-brainer at that point,'' he says. ``I was in a
self-destructive mode.''
</P>
<P>
   That fall, Fisher hit bottom, emotionally and financially. When
he broke into a house and was arrested on a felony burglary charge,
he was almost relieved. The judge sentenced him to five years' jail
time and five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Prison was humiliating and cathartic. Fisher says he experienced
a spiritual awakening six weeks after being jailed. When he would
awake drenched in sweat from withdrawal-induced nightmares, he
would turn to the Bible for solace. After four months, his mother
started visiting and could not believe the change in him. Other
family members started coming, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months into his sentence, the state transferred Fisher to a
work camp in Walters, Okla. He made $7 a month helping to build a
nearby church. In his spare time, he led Bible studies and played
the piano during Sunday services.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, in June 1997, Bud Fisher drove to Walters
to bring his son home.
</P>
<P>
   The first month back at the shop, Fisher worked alone painting
the outside of the building. Interacting with his family,
especially his siblings, was painful. But the tension has eased
since he recommitted to piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped focus him,'' says Fisher's sister Linda. ``It's
boosted his self-esteem and hopefully given him some sense of
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes he owes his recovery to faith; he doesn't take
his talent for granted anymore. It's God-given and God can take it
away, he says.
</P>
<P>
   When Steele presented him with the announcement of the amateurs
competition, that, too, seemed like a divine gift. ``He'll tell
you, it's like God opened up this contest just for him,'' Marlene
says.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other 142 people who applied, Fisher sent the Cliburn
Foundation $50, a black-and-white photograph of himself and his
music resume, brief compared with many of the others. Like 91 of
them, he fit the requirements of being a serious pianist, over 30,
who did not play professionally.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cliburn event has focused Fisher more than anything since he
left graduate school. He even returned to Kansas City for some
refresher sessions with former professor Cass, whom he hadn't seen
in 13 years. They are polishing his Chopin ``Ballade in g minor,
Opus 23,'' and tinkering with Debussy's ``Feux d'Artifice,'' or
``Fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the amateurs competition would mean $2,000 and perhaps
the chance to perform with some orchestras around the country. It
would probably assure Fisher admission to the doctoral program of
his choice and perhaps secure him a future teaching position at the
university level.
</P>
<P>
   Winning would be nice, but it's beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   When Marlene Fisher saw her son perform with the UCO Orchestra
in May, she cried. She videotaped the concert and took it with her
to Milwaukee for his grandmother to see.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mother's Day weekend, and as the two women watched the
tape together, they beamed with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fisher needs no other reason than that to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes everything worthwhile,'' he says. ``It makes
everything OK.''

wrong:

<P>
   - That in the days before NATO's troops arrive in Kosovo, the
KLA's new commander _ the infamous Agim Cecu who, as a Croatian
army general, ``ethnically cleansed'' 170,000 Serb civilians from
Krajina _ will ``cleanse'' the remaining Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ That the KLA will refuse to be ``demilitarized.''
</P>
<P>
   _ That in a few months' time _ at most a year _ NATO's enemies
will be the KLA, who will be raging against the West for abandoning
their hopes of independence.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has

Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.

<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.

<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.

Clinton have resurrected the just war, a concept their anti-war

   The deal demands the total withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo within seven days and the deployment of a NATO-led peace

   Next up: Frank Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime reader, first-time complainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unfortunate enough to be one of those evil white males
that seem to concern you so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. Frank is responding to an 825-word analysis of Bryant
Gumbel's return to morning television, 22 words of which asked
whether Gumbel's less-than-reputable reputation had anything to do
with what I see as a societal perception of self-assured black men
being seen as ``cocky'' and ``pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's issue: We should see folks on an individual basis. Not
by race, not by attire, not by beliefs. ``I don't like pompous
people whether they are black or white, and that's why I don't like
Bryant Gumbel or Peter Jennings,'' said Clarke, an Arlington,
Texas, resident, who added, ``Come to think of it, I probably
wouldn't like YOU if we ever had the misfortune to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Clarke, who sees us all on an individual basis. Not by
race, not by attire, and certainly not based on beliefs that aren't
on par with his own.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers also had something to say about Gumbel, the former
``Today'' co-host who will take over a retooled morning
infotainment show at CBS on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot went like this: ``Who cares,'' said caller Susanne
Lenny. ``I watch CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Many responded to Sunday's ``Best of ...'' package to wrap up
the season. E-mails ranged from ``You're brilliant'' for picking
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' as top series to ``You're joking,
right?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Joust: It's a bunch of whiny kids pontificating on sex.
Why they want it, why they don't want it. It's sophomoric. It's
wasteful. It's nauseating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Dawson's Creek''?
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Elston: ``The so-called evil menaces, the ghouls and
other out-of-this-world creatures ... they're fake and unrealistic.
And the girls can't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that ``Charmed''?
</P>
<P>
   Most began like this: ``I would like to compliment you on your
excellent taste.''
</P>
<P>
   (Best to mention here that I picked ``Two of a Kind,'' the
sitcom with the Olsen twins, as a can't-miss hit, thought
``Brimstone'' had possibilities and ``The Hughleys'' didn't.
``Two'' and ``Brimstone'' are gone; ``The Hughleys'' returns. Oh
well.)
</P>
<P>
   Cathy R. Atkinson was speaking of ``La Femme Nikita,'' the dark,
moody drama about a ruthless, underground outfit of assassins that
I ranked No. 4 for the season. ``I consider the show to be one of
the best-kept secrets on television,'' Cathy e-mailed. ``And I'm
thrilled when somebody points that out, and gives new viewers the
idea that maybe `LFN' isn't the typical fare for the USA network.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe? Airing right before ``LFN'': ``Silk Stalkings'' soft-porn
masquerading as a police drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is appointment TV for Clyde L. and
Stephanie K. Harris. ``Bet we are the only couple in their 50s who
watch and enjoy the show, in Whitney, Texas. Any takers?'' the
e-mailers wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Also on their menu: ``7th Heaven,'' ``The X Files,''
``Pretender'' and ``Profiler.'' But in ``Buffy,'' ``The characters
are realistic. We know. We were among the nameless faces in the
school halls. A cousin of my wife who was popular at school denied
that he was related to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Charity, a k a ``Taygeta,'' thinks there's a certain appeal to
Buffy being on a smaller, underdog network, particularly in the age
of the Internet. ``As you mentioned, `Buffy' is a reflection of the
high school outcast, and in the sense of Internet users, therein
lies the `Buffy' fan base,'' she e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Puckett responded to the analysis of ``Home
Improvement'' and ``Mad About You,'' sitcoms ending their long
runs.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Mad's'' Helen Hunt: ``She drove me up the wall with the
continual flipping of her hair. So I got so I counted the seconds
to the next flip instead of watching the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Home's'' Tim Allen: ``His grunting, barking, simulated body
functions, etc., to me was a huge turnoff ... Was he auditioning
for the part of cheetah on the next Tarzan episode?''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't stop there. On ``Walker, Texas Ranger's'' Chuck
Norris: ``Two or three days' growth of whiskers ... This guy's like
the clone of the dad on `The Simpsons.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, reminding us all that the quality of one's acting
doesn't mean much, also gripes about a ``really good actor'' who
has ``protruding teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems Forrest finds that distracting as well.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say which actor. I didn't ask.

HISPANIC LAWYER FILES SUIT OVER RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a
federal lawsuit on behalf of a San Jose lawyer who says the
California Highway Patrol violated his civil rights when officers
stopped him and other Hispanics allegedly because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the CHP pulled over Rodriguez and at
least five other Hispanic drivers on the Pacheco Pass portion of
Highway 152 while carrying out its federally funded
drug-interdiction program, ``Operation Pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday, charges that this stop was standard
CHP practice in which ``suspicious'' minority drivers are stopped
for minor traffic violations as a pretext for searching their cars
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was business as usual for the California Highway Patrol,''
said Michelle Alexander, director of the ACLU's Racial Justice
Project and one of the lawyers representing Rodriguez. ``They
cruise the freeways looking for excuses in the form of minor
traffic violations. Victims are searched and treated as criminals,
even when there is no probable cause. (Rodriguez's) sole misfortune
was being Latino on a California highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The CHP released a statement in response to the suit saying it
has policies prohibiting racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the ACLU has announced the filing of a lawsuit
alleging this violation of civil rights based on racial profiling
should not infer that this has actually occurred in the CHP,'' said
CHP Commissioner Dwight (Spike) Helmick. ``The CHP, as alleged by
the ACLU, does not engage in race-based stops ...''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is one of the first major legal challenges to
alleged race-based law enforcement operations in California. To
determine how pervasive race-based profiling is in law enforcement,
the ACLU led a campaign pushing the state Legislature to adopt laws
that require officers to document the race of drivers they stop.
The state Senate passed the ``driving while black or brown''
measure this week.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and
Virginia adopted similar legislation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., recently reintroduced
legislation that would require the U.S. attorney general to study
police stops nationwide to determine if the police are using racial
profiling in making traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Pipeline is a national program administered by state
patrol agencies designed to yield drug arrests through a high
volume of searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's law enforcement by hunch,'' Alexander said. ``These
tactics of engaging in pretext stops are totally ineffectual and
have a discriminatory impact on people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and Rodriguez are asking the courts to prohibit racial
profiling in all CHP operations. They also want law enforcement
agencies to begin collecting data on those stopped.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1998, Rodriguez said he was driving with an associate
on Pacheco Pass, a roughly 15-mile stretch of Highway 152 south of
San Jose, when he noticed CHP officers pulling over dark-skinned
Hispanic men, one after another.
</P>
<P>
   They photographed the stops and were eventually pulled over
themselves, purportedly for driving with headlights on and for
touching the yellow dividing line, the lawsuit states. Headlights
are required on that stretch of Highway 152.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said his car was searched and that an officer
eventually apologized for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' Rodriguez said. ``I thought that the way he
was conducting himself was illegal. I felt helpless. Essentially,
on the highway they're the law and if they are abusing or
mistreating you, you don't have any recourse. At least not on the
highway.''

 &HT;    KLA AGREES NOT TO SHOOT WITHDRAWING SERBS, BUT STILL REFUSING TO
DISARM

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Representatives of the rebel army fighting to
liberate Kosovo from Serb control said Friday they will continue
their campaign until they see Serb forces pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, however, said it will not impede the
Serbs once they begin to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never attack anybody who's running away,'' said Jakup
Krasniqi(CQ), the KLA's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not clear about what immediate role the KLA intends
to play in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic. The rebel army has agreed to demilitarize once a
peace plan is implemented but not disarm, indicating that its
members intend to hang on to their weapons even after a peace deal
is signed. The KLA sees itself as the potential core of an ethnic
Albanian security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian population, they want their own army that will
give them security in the future,'' Krasniqi said.
</P>
<P>
   This could become a major sticking point because the Serbs
consider the KLA a band of terrorists that must surrender its arms
once a peace plan is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Krasniqi expressed skepticism of the new
peace plan and a deep distrust of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the leader of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has agreed many times to many things and we still
are waiting for him to keep his word,'' Krasniqi said. ``Maybe it
is another maneuver to play for time.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic last year agreed to a plan to withdraw his troops from
Kosovo and then later ignored it, prompting NATO to begin bombing
of Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Also, KLA political leader Hashim Thaci(CQ) accused Serb troops
of attacking civilian and military targets early Friday with
grenades and other weapons in at least three regions in Kosovo
province. Thaci describes himself as the president of the
provisional government of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic on the one hand is declaring he is in favor of peace
and he is accepting the accord,'' Thaci told reporters at the
European Union summit in Cologne, Germany. ``But on the other hand
he is doing the opposite on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government on Thursday accepted a
plan envisaging a withdrawal of its forces from war-ravaged Kosovo
and deployment of an international peacekeeping force to ensure the
return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA says the peace plan approved Thursday by the Yugoslav
Parliament means little until the international community irons out
the details, however.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the KLA, which has been fighting Serb soldiers,
police and paramilitary gangs for more than a year, objects to
allowing even a small force of Serb policemen to remain in Kosovo,
Krasniqi said. The current plan calls for a small force remaining
to police border checkpoints and such.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops are expected to form the core of the international
peacekeeping force, but Russia's special envoy to the Balkans,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, has said Russian forces will be under separate
command from Moscow and will not take orders from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to include a significant force of Russian troops
also is a problem for the rebel army, Krasniqi said. ``They have to
move under NATO control, because at the moment the Russians are
under Serb control.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who is closely allied
with the KLA, also opposes the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any foreign military presence in Kosovo outside the control
and management of NATO would establish a premise for permanent
conflicts in the region and for the division of Kosovo,'' Majko
said. ``The government of Albania considers that the peacekeeping
force in Kosovo should be under the unique command of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees reacted with reservation. Sabra Jmahone, who lives with
his family at the U.S.-built Camp Hope, listened to the news Friday
morning on a transistor radio outside his tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must see,'' he said. ``But we have heard these words
before. We must see it, see the NATO troops in Kosovo, see the
Serbian troops and police go. Then, God willing on that day, I will
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, which wants Kosovo to become a separate country, has
indicated it will accept an arrangement that removes Kosovo from
Serb control and places it within the Yugoslav federation. This
would provide an opportunity for the province to seek independence
more easily.
</P>
<P>
   KLA officials in recent days have said they were making great
strides in their fight against Serb forces near the Yugoslav border
with Albania. Some have suggested privately that they believed they
were getting close to capturing a Kosovar town of Prizren. Western
military observers have been skeptical of the KLA's claims of
success. There is no independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the KLA has been flooded with volunteers,
including Americans who have been given basic training and handed
guns before being deployed at the front.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi also took a swipe at Thaci's rival, Ibrahim Rugova, who
has held the title president of the Republic of Kosovo for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova is seen by many Albanians as too moderate in his push for
an independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have not been fighting the real enemy, the Serbs,
but instead have been building their careers,'' Krasniqi said in a
clear reference to Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The deepening rift between the men is seen by Western officials
as a potentially damaging problem for Kosovo that must be resolved
soon.

 &HT;    TRINIDAD HANGS THREE CONVICTS; FIRST EXECUTIONS IN NEARLY FIVE
YEARS
 &HT;    400&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Trinidad and Tobago led three convicts bound by
straight-jackets to the gallows Friday, where they were hanged
shortly after dawn, the first in a string of nine executions to be
carried out by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The executions were the first by the twin-island Caribbean
nation in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   The hangings are being staggered because each convict must hang
from the gallows for at least an hour to make certain they are
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents feared the move would open the
floodgates to dozens of other hangings throughout the Caribbean,
where former British colonies have vowed to go forward with such
executions despite mounting opposition from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we feel this is going to become a trend in the
Caribbean,'' said Sarah DeCosse, an expert on the Caribbean for
Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly oppose the death penalty,'' she added. ``Hangings
are a cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Cuba _ a communist island that carries out
executions with a firing squad _ is the only other country in the
Caribbean to carry out an execution so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Trinidad has pledged to press forward with as many as 85
hangings over the next several months. Other nations, too, plan to
resume hangings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People deserve a severe punishment when they commit a severe
crime,'' said Barbados Attorney General David Simmons, a proponent
of hangings.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in the Caribbean, much of it drug-related, has
left most residents in favor of capital punishment, emphasizing
that the relatively small size of the region means everyone shares
the impact of even the slightest rise in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and Tobago hanged reputed drug lord Dole Chadee and two
henchman Friday for the 1994 murders of a family of four in a drug
dispute. Three other members of Chadee's gang were to be executed
on Saturday; three others on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, which petitioned Trinidad to
halt the hangings, there are about 250 convicts on death row in
English-speaking Caribbean nations, with a population of 5 million
_ one of the highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned hangings in 1991 in its five Caribbean
territories, but they remain on the books in all 12 former British
colonies in the Caribbean. Those former colonies maintain loose
ties with Britain as members of the commonwealth, and recognize the
British monarch as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Hangings were discontinued throughout much of the Caribbean,
though, in the 1980s in response to protests from human-rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, nations have taken steps to change their
justice systems and constitutions, as well as break long-standing
ties with international appeals bodies, so that the death penalty
can be carried out more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, justice ministers from more than a dozen
countries meeting in Grenada are completing a plan for a Caribbean
court to replace London's Privy Council.
</P>
<P>
   That council, which has final say on legal appeals in the
region, drew outrage from Caribbean leaders in 1993 when it ruled
that it was inhumane to execute people who had waited on death row
more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling virtually eliminated hangings since appeals often
drag on for anywhere from five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The council had strongly criticized Trinidad for its last
hanging _ of murderer Glen Ashby in 1994 _ because authorities
performed the execution only hours after lawyers revealed plans to
appeal to London.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It's manners that matters
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's nothing so proper as a fancy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to impress the head waiter, forget about
greasing his palm. Better you use a slick tongue.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean you have to lick his hand, like a dog. Just the
opposite. He'll be eating out of yours, with the right words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get to'' are the right words. Leastwise, they were for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me for asking,'' the head waiter said, after seating me
at a table that had been reserved by a friend, who hadn't yet
arrived. ``But what part of the country are you from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``East Texas,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell from the way you talk,'' he said, smiling. ``I'm
from Georgia myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to Atlanta from time to time,'' I said, ``and always
enjoy visiting there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure like the way you say 'get to,''' he said, all the more
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of down home goes a long ways for a Southerner a
long way from home.
</P>
<P>
   But I couldn't help asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you wind up so far North?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the opportunity,'' he said, shrugging as if to excuse
himself. ``A bunch of Yankees open up a fine restaurant, but they
have to pay good money for a genteel fellow from the South who
knows how to treat customers with hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   We both got a good laugh out of that. But it's true. Good
manners are inbred in the South, despite the inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   And I told him this story that had been passed along to me by an
old friend from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   I forget the exact names and places, but in this particular
county _ way north of the gnat line, to be sure _ a ne'er-do-well
had managed to marry into a prominent family a couple of
generations back.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters who had grown up since then on either side of the
family _ call them the Gotrocks and the Hadnots _ never thought
twice about it. The old folks of the prominent family had never
gotten over it.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that a couple of cousins, a young man and woman, were
visiting in the home of the aged matriarch of the Gotrocks lineage,
and she was regaling them with one story and then another about old
times not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But her memory wasn't what it once was, and she faltered
occasionally in trying to recall exact details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, now,'' she said, breaking off in the middle of a
story. ``For the life of me, I can't remember what year that was.''
</P>
<P>
   She pondered a moment and then added:
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm pretty sure it was the same year that the Hadnots
burned their house.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man couldn't help himself. Turning to his cousin, he
asked, as if in passing, ``Wasn't your grandmother a Hadnot?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, trying to keep a straight face, nodded. ``Yes, as a
matter of fact, she was.''
</P>
<P>
   The matriarch never missed a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, back then,'' she said, dismissing the subject with
a dainty wave of a withered hand, ``everybody was burning their
house.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing so fancy as proper manners.

CULTURAL FRICTION ARISES IN SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The real turf war in San Francisco's Mission
District has nothing to do with young gangs staking out their
particular corners. This is a conflict between the rich and the
poor, between those who can afford to own property and those who
can't.
</P>
<P>
   Property owners vowed to rally Sunday against what they called
``hate crimes'' targeted at their cars, homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only people left that it's OK to hate, politically _
successful Caucasians who drive nice cars,'' said Samantha Spivack,
a three-year resident of the area. She was referring to the series
of flyers posted in the Mission District over the last several
months advocating vandalism to cars and property owned by
``yuppie'' newcomers to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to read these posters and not feel a little
threatened,'' Spivack said.
</P>
<P>
   And police were investigating the so-called Mission Yuppie
Eradication Project, which produced the flyers.
</P>
<P>
   One flyer read: ``This yuppie takeover can be stopped and turned
back. We can drive those cigar-bar clowns back to Orinda and Walnut
Creek where they belong,'' referring to two affluent Bay Area
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How: vandalize yuppie cars: Lexus- Porsches-Jaguars, sport
utility vehicles. Break the glass. Scratch the paint. Slash their
tires and upholstery. Trash them all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an isolated sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some very real resentment and real fear developing,''
said Christian Parenti, 30, a writer and teacher who has lived in
the Mission off and on for the past 10 years. Parenti is not a
member of the Yuppie Eradication Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood is increasingly the playground of really
wealthy young and middle-aged folks who live in Silicon Valley;
they come here because it's authentic and hip, and, not
intentionally, end up destroying those qualities and displacing
people in the process. People just cannot afford to live here
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent anti-yuppie poster, seen in both English and
Spanish around the Mission, calls for the destruction of four
specific bars and restaurants. It also names one new resident of
the neighborhood, a realtor, as ``a leading force behind Mission
gentrification.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are continuing their investigation of Kevin Keating, who
was arrested May 14 on suspicion of making terrorist threats and
malicious mischief in connection with the flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were subsequently dropped pending further
investigation, but police Capt. Kevin Dillon said investigators are
going through evidence seized at the Mission District apartment
Keating shares with his girlfriend, who is also under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, 38, said this week that police have targeted him for
political reasons. They took some 70 books from his apartment _
anything related to anarchism, communism or revolution, Keating
said.
</P>
<P>
   The search warrant lists among the items confiscated an acid
bomb recipe, books by Karl Marx, volumes on the Spanish and French
revolutions, copies of Keating's own fiction writing, boxes of
paste and a framed picture of Malcolm X. Keating's computer and
computer disks were also seized.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon denied any political motivation. ``We don't target
individuals because of their political beliefs,'' he said. ``People
in this community feel threatened by what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating said he has never advocated violence against individuals
and would never make a bomb. But the aspiring writer and filmmaker
believes that strong language is needed to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The posters have a provocative language, and if the message
weren't provocative, the underlying and more important issues would
never be acknowledged or addressed,'' Keating said. The main issue:
that real estate speculators ``are out to drive the working class
and poor people out of their homes because there's lots of money to
be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Buhrz, owner of the Beauty Bar, one of the establishments
targeted in the latest Yuppie Eradication flyer, was critical of
Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Keating is inciting other people to vandalize and damage
property, Buhrz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people in this town who are listening to him
and going nuts over it,'' Buhrz said. But he added that he has not
been the victim of any anti-yuppie vandalism because of the flyer.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against the flyers _ and the sentiment behind them _
appears to be growing.
</P>
<P>
   A group calling itself the Mission New Property Owners Action
Pact, among others, is sponsoring a ``Stop the Hate'' rally Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're tired of being insulted and terrorized just because
you own property and drive a nice car, then show your support for
building a stronger Mission by coming to our rally on Sunday . . .
'' was the message on an organizer's telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   One local business owner wrote to her neighborhood newsletter
that she was able to ignore the anti-yuppie campaign at the outset
but not any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest posters targeting specific businesses really
frightened me,'' she said. ``I am absolutely against people being
evicted from their homes . . . but do not feel that anyone who
somehow managed to start an independent business should be targeted
in such a violent manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivack says ``Everybody here is just trying to live their life.
Sorry that we came and bought a house here because it's the last
affordable place in the city. Sorry if that offends you.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper ad promoting Sunday's rally, organizers urged
residents to ``Stop the Hate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes against new residents of the Mission have
terrorized many of those of us who, having moved to this community
to empower ourselves as property owners, find that instead we are
treated with contempt and targeted by vandals,'' the notice reads.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to hate crimes is ``just asinine,'' said Heather
Rogers, a Mission District artist and member of MAGIC, the Mission
Artists Gentrification Insurrection Coalition. Her group opposes
gentrification and works to support low-income residents of the
Mission _ those who are the real victims of hate crimes, Rogers
said.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As soon as Russia came

DALE JR. PASSES WINSTON TEST WITH FLYING COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   c.1999 N.Y. Times
News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You would have thought this decision would have been made long
ago, because there has never been any indication that Dale
Earnhardt Jr. ever wanted to do anything but drive a race car.
</P>
<P>
   But after finishing 16th in his first Winston Cup race Sunday,
the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway outside Charlotte, N.C.,
Earnhardt admitted he went in with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for years and years that this was what I wanted to
do,'' said the 24-year-old son of Dale Earnhardt Sr. ``And
suddenly, I was getting ready to find out whether I was right or
not, whether this is really what I want to do or whether this ain't
what I expected it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., who is known to fans as ``Little E.,'' plans to
move full time to the Winston Cup next year, but he is back on the
Busch circuit this week where he will run in Saturday's MBNA
Platinum 200 at Dover Downs International Speedway in Delaware. He
set a race record average speed of 130.512 mph last year at Dover.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts about his Winston ambitions, they were
apparently resolved with his performance Sunday. Never in NASCAR
history has so much attention been riveted on a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, it would have been easy for a young driver
to try and charge to the front, to try and live up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Showing great maturity and common sense, Earnhardt resisted that
temptation. He quickly found out his car wasn't capable of staying
with the leaders, so he fell back to where he could run safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope all those drivers out there are a little more
comfortable with me and that's one thing I was trying to accomplish
_ not to tear up a race car and try and gain some respect from
these guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to learn as much as I could following them and
seeing how they were driving and seeing what happened to their cars
on long runs later in the race,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was very tentative in making passes and stuff,
especially being underneath guys going into three or going down
into one,'' he said. ``I didn't want to get loose in the center of
the corner and get up into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have got the experience to drive through there.
That's something we've got to learn over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised with some of the things they can do
with the cars and how they drive them,'' he said. ``You'll see some
drivers put their cars in positions you just don't see how they got
through there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such maneuvers are rare in the Busch Series, but he has
seen them from Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, 27, leads the Busch Series points standings and, as a
young driver, is as highly regarded as Earnhardt Jr. by some. Like
the younger Earnhardt, Kenseth will move full time to Winston Cup
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest worry was my endurance and my ability as a driver
to drive the car competitively for that length of time,'' Earnhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to pace myself as much as I could, and I'm real
happy with what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as this being what I want to do all my life?'' he said.
``I'm now satisfied it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever any doubt, really?

HOW DISNEYLAND KEEPS CUSTOMERS COOL

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The giant bottle of Coca-Cola looks like just
another prop at Disney-MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   But as guests walk by, the unmistakable sound of a pop bottle
being opened grabs their attention _ before the bottle releases a
cooling spray of watery mist.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, pop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to all four of Disney World's theme parks expect great
attractions, grandiose shows and characters in costume. But they
may not realize that Orlando's largest collection of parks also
takes great pains to keep them cool during Florida's sizzling
summers.
</P>
<P>
   At various and surprising locations in its parks, Disney has
installed misting stations and interactive fountains to ensure
guests sizzle more from Space Mountain than they do from Florida's
oppressive heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like it,'' says Disney spokesman Craig Dezern about the
misters. ``It's summer in Florida _ hot _ and people are ready to
cool off and get wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our imagineers have taken water and turned it into a
plaything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some recently opened attractions, including Animal Kingdom's new
Kali River Rapids, virtually drench visitors in water to cool them
off.
</P>
<P>
   But the parks also use hidden misters or themed sprays to
surprise guests with kinder, gentler means of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Easiest to spot are the Coke Cool Zones. The 20-foot-tall bottle
that sprays automatically as guests walk by is in Disney-MGM
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Near Epcot's new Test Track attraction is a Coke Cool Zone that
looks like a car wash _ except it's guests who walk through and
receive a cooling ``wash'' or mist.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Showcase, there is what looks like a collection of
vending machines. ``There's no signage to tell you to do this, but
if you go over to them and open them up, all of a sudden it sprays
you with water,'' Dezern says.
</P>
<P>
   Other misting stations are set up at such locations as Animal
Kingdom's Tamu Tamu ice cream shop _ where a giant fan has a hose
behind it to blow a cooling mist at guests walking by.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's first experiments in cooling visitors started about
five years ago with interactive fountains installed for kids. The
first fountains proved so popular that Disney decided to do
something for adults as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fountains, we discovered the interactivity that
people enjoy,'' Dezern says. ``Then we took it the next step and
came up with the misting stations for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of discover them as you walk by. And you don't even
feel like you're wet. You just feel cooled off.''

 &HT;    AN ANGRY CLINTON DEFENDS PACE OF GUN CONTROL EFFORT
 &HT;    370&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's famous temper flared on
national television Friday as he responded to a suggestion that his
gun control proposals ``are not going to make a damn bit of
difference'' in keeping guns out of the hands of children.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton acknowledged that enacting significantly stronger
measures could ``take years,'' because he was forced to ``take what
I can get'' from a reluctant Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became testy as ABC's Charles Gibson quoted an
unidentified friend of the president's who had suggested that after
the fatal school shootings in Colorado this April, Clinton ``had a
chance to roar on gun control and he meowed'' instead by proposing
modest measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, let's join the real world here,'' Clinton said, his eyes
narrowing and his finger wagging at Gibson during an interview on
``Good Morning America'' broadcast live from the White House. ``You
want to have an honest conversation? Let's have an honest
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For you to say that I shouldn't take what I can get,'' he
said, ``and instead I should ask for things that I am absolutely
positive will be defeated in the Congress is quite wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview preceded a portion of the program in which the
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton brainstormed with
40 teenagers on what should be done to curb violence in their
lives. Some of the teens came from schools in Littleton, Colo.;
Springfield, Ore.; West Paducah, Ky., and Conyers, Ga., that had
been the sites of shootings by students.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who participated was Trey Carver, 15, who attends
Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., where six students were
wounded by a classmate last month.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady sought to recruit the students into the
administration's anti-violence campaign, urging them to speak out
for tougher gun controls. ``There's no reason why a lot of you who
are about to be or are already 18 can't let your voices be heard,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even one of the students, Albert Smith, whose sister was
wounded in gunfire in Evanston, Ill., raised questions about the
president's handgun proposals. ``How spectacular is this
legislation and what makes it different?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with Clinton, Gibson said the pending gun
control measures would allow Democrats and Republicans to score
``political points,'' but that ``it's not going to make a damn bit
of difference _ only on the margins _ in the way kids get guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted, however, that the measures ``can save
children's lives,'' and explained in detail why he is pursuing gun
control legislation at a deliberate pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the first president who ever took on the (National Rifle
Association),'' Clinton said in recounting the seven-year
congressional battle that led to the 1993 enactment of the Brady
Bill, which requires background checks on handgun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ignore the fact that my administration and my party took on
this issue when no one else would and paid a huge price for it _
and lost control of the House of Representatives in all probability
because of it _ and to pretend that this is an easy thing now
because Littleton happened is wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Gibson was ``absolutely right'' in suggesting
that stronger measures could be taken, including registration of
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my best to advocate more, but ... I want to do this
in sequence,'' he said, beginning this month with an expected House
vote on Senate-approved legislation to require background checks on
gun show sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I want to us to come back with a second set of
recommendations,'' he added. ``I intend to keep working on this. I
think this is going to take years. We have _ the Congress is out of
touch with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that the Senate measures passed by only
one vote. Furthermore, he contended, Republican leaders delayed a
House vote on the Senate measures until after the holiday recess in
order to give the gun lobby more time to persuade members to water
down the legislation.

SCHOOL VOUCHERS LIKELY TO BE SUBJECT OF TEST FOR HIGH COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As conflicting court decisions on public vouchers
for private school tuition mount and more states explore the
controversial idea, the issue appears headed to the U.S. Supreme
Court for resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in the Midwest have upheld using taxpayer funds to
subsidize private and religious schools. But a federal appeals
court in Boston ruled unequivocally a few days ago that a Maine
voucher program violated the nation's historic separation of church
and state. That ruling _ by the highest court to review the issue
thus far _ came as a legal fight brewed over Florida's new voucher
plan and Louisiana legislators debated a voucher system there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pot is boiling to say the least,'' remarked Joseph Conn, a
spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
a group opposed to vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   He said it will be months before a voucher case reaches the high
court, where his group anticipates a ruling in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a huge step for the Supreme Court to allow
public money to be used to advance religious instruction,'' said
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But voucher advocates are putting their faith in the wisdom of
the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which found no Constitutional
objection to public subsidies of private schools and portrayed the
matter more as one of school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Florida will be the next battleground as opponents promise to
sue as soon as Gov. Jeb Bush signs his voucher plan into law. His
allies believe they will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the statute here in Florida has been crafted more
carefully than those elsewhere,'' said Patrick Heffernan, head of
Floridians for School Choice.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Several federal programs with deep roots in the South are under
attack by a government watchdog group as either wasteful, outdated
or ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers for Common Sense is taking aim at a boll weevil
eradication program, a loan program for providing electricity in
rural areas and the federal peanut program.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for the group, questioned the need
for the latter two efforts, noting that nearly 100 percent of the
United States has electricity compared to 11 percent when the
agency was created in 1935. And the peanut program, he said, means
that consumers pay more for peanut butter at the supermarket due to
production quotas and import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As for boll weevils, Ashdown acknowledged that the insect is
still a problem in the South, but he questioned the effectiveness
of the current program. President Clinton requested $3.3 million to
battle weevils next year, but House members want to increase that
amount to $16.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   All three programs are included in the agricultural spending
bill, which has already run into criticism from GOP conservatives
for its spending level.
</P>
<P>
   SUCCESS STORY?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill are crowing about a new report that
suggests welfare reform works and fewer families now depend on
government aid for help.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the General Accounting Office found that
employment rates ranged from 61 to 87 percent for adults in
families who left welfare.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina and Tennessee were two of seven states nationwide
that had compiled significant data on such families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lives indeed are changed for the better,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six percent of former welfare recipients surveyed in
South Carolina disagreed with the statement that ``life was better
when you were getting welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, congressional Republicans pushed through a welfare
reform package that placed restrictions on social service programs,
including a limit on the length of time a family could receive
government benefits. Many states had enacted their own reforms
before Congress acted.
</P>
<P>
   HARD LESSON
</P>
<P>
   After six months in office, Sen. John Edwards, a freshman
Democrat from North Carolina, is getting an education in how
lawmakers spend taxpayers' money. He's not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards bemoaned the recent $15 billion ``emergency'' spending
bill that paid for the military operation and humanitarian aid in

million to study a proposed wood veneer plant in Alaska and an
extra $500,000 for GOP leaders to run their offices in the House.

   ``This was my first real taste of Washington spending and I
didn't like it,'' said Edwards, who voted against the measure. ``In
fact, it was shameful.''

   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-LESSONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Was the NATO bombing campaign
in Yugoslavia a success? Technically, it apparently achieved its
goal. But the allied obsession to avoid casualties and maintain
consensus contributed to drawing out the bombing far longer than
anyone anticipated, and thereby to massive damage and significant
casualties in Yugoslavia and to strained relations with Russia and
Chinese. By Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   DAMAGE-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Across the country, accounts of
bizarre jury verdicts and huge damage awards (like the McDonald's
customer who spilled coffee on herself and collected $2.9 million)
have been used to prove that the courts are wacky or worse. But
increasingly, some political scientists, legal scholars and
consumer advocates are suggesting that accounts of outlandish
cases. By William Glaberson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL-HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shouldn't people with
mental illnesses, which can destroy lives and families, be entitled
to the same amount of insurance coverage as those with physical
illnesses? It sounds like a fairly simple question. But as in all
things having to do with health care, and especially the often
vaguely defined area of mental illness, the issue can be
maddeningly complicated. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-COACHES-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 29 head coaches in
the NBA are considered the best-dressed coaches in the world, as
these things go. While their counterparts in the NFL and Major
League Baseball wear warm-up jackets, baseball caps and, in the
case of baseball managers, team uniforms, the coaches in the
media-savvy NBA wear suits by some of the most stylish designers on
the market. By Chris Broussard.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-BLOCKBUSTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Summer is blockbuster
season, from the multiplex to the august halls of culture. Museums
may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too, strive for that
explosion of interest that by any name spells blockbuster, filling
the coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting admiration
and envy at fellow institutions. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the dramatic _ and
conflicting _ announcements on the age and nature of the universe
that have been made in the past couple of weeks. The area of
disagreement between cosmologists seems to be always increasing or
shrinking. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TRIVIA-QUIZ-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ On the last night of classes
at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., the student radio
station WCFM conducts a marathon trivia contest. Some questions and
answers.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-SAFRICA-REVIEW (Abuja, Nigeria) _ The different paths
taken by Nigeria and South Africa to democracy. Nigeria was once
the uncontested leader in Africa, the staunchest backer of
liberation movements in South Africa and other white-ruled
countries. Yet South Africa preceded Nigeria into democratic
government, holding its first all-race elections in 1994 even as
Nigeria slipped into a ruthless military dictatorship. By Norimitsu
Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ Since President Suharto was forced
to resign in May 1998, Indonesia has been learning fast, moving
from street demonstrations to party organizing, from utopian
philosophizing to the beginnings of coalition building. Still,
nobody knows what patterns voting will take, how the elections will
play out or how this nation of more than 200 million jostling and
often feuding people will manage the outcome. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-U.S.-REVIEW (Cairo) _ Teheran is abuzz again, divided now
over whether America really is still the Great Satan. And as usual,
the ferocity of Iran's internal power struggles make it hard to
know just what is going on. So here's a quick primer on the latest
in U.S.-Iranian relations _ a succession of winks, nods and
backhanded slaps that might amount to a lot or to absolutely
nothing at all. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-TERMS-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ Turkey's treatment of its more
than 10 million Kurds has been widely criticized abroad. The
Interior Ministry has declared that the government needs to adopt a
``unity of terminology'' in presenting its case to the world. A
look at the the unacceptable terms and what what the government
says are correct ones that should be used in their place. By Steven

CHINA SEEN LIKELY TO BACK KOSOVO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A day after Yugoslavia accepted an international peace
plan for Kosovo, China on Friday restated its demand that NATO halt
its bombing before discussions begin in the United Nations about a
peacekeeping force. But Chinese support for the peace plan seems
likely.
</P>
<P>
   In brief statements issued Friday, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and
the Foreign Ministry spokesman held back from openly endorsing the
peace plan, stressing the need for a bombing halt ``to create
necessary conditions for a peaceful settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the plan goes forward, the NATO attacks are likely to be
suspended in coming days in any case, to permit withdrawal of
Serbian troops from Kosovo. After a telephone conversation with Zhu
on Friday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said he was
confident that China as well as Russia would go along with a U.N.
Security Council resolution to carry out the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the main features of the settlement _ a U.N. mandate for
a peacekeeping force and formal preservation of the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia _ address major concerns that China has
angrily expressed since the start of the bombing campaign more than
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   China was outraged by NATO's decision to act without
authorization from the United Nations, where China could exercise a
veto. With a history of foreign invasions and fears about ethnic
unrest at home, China also felt deeply threatened by the principle
that Western powers could intervene in a sovereign country because
of ethnic disputes. Chinese leaders have railed against what they
call an act of illegal aggression by ``United States-led NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese television and the official New China News Agency both
reported Friday night on the telephone call Zhu received from
Schroeder, who appeared to be trying to assuage China's hurt pride
and insure its cooperation in the United Nations. In the call,
Schroeder described the peace plan and promised to send an emissary
to China to give a more detailed briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond reiterating that the bombing should stop, Zhu also said
that the Kosovo conflict should be solved ``on the principle of
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and protecting the rights and interests of the various
nationalities in the Kosovo region,'' according to the press
account. These conditions would be met under the proposed
settlement.

SIGNS IT'S TIME TO DITCH YOUR PC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My problem began when we lost the icon for File
Manager. I was told the only way to get it back was to restore my
system. I tried with both a recovery CD and a recovery diskette. I
kept getting a message ``a valid hard drive format number was not
found.'' The message goes on to say, ``If you push Enter, you will
exit the program.'' I have the feeling that I received the wrong
recovery disc, but when I try to ask the manufacturer, they won't
even talk to me unless I pay them $35. I feel this is unfair. Every
time I have had a problem with this unit, it has taken me weeks _
with their help _ to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had It up to Here
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAD IT: So, I guess you won't be a repeat customer. Your
experience with these clowns should have told you something. I
purposely omitted the manufacturer's name, as many of our fine
advertisers offer outstanding bargains on these inexpensive PCs.
They will be just as happy, though, to sell you much better-quality
merchandise at a slightly higher price.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason some brands are the lowest-priced on the
market. They stink. The component quality is marginal, the
workmanship is shoddy and the support is nonexistent, as you found
out. I'm as cheap as the next guy, but I'd rather pay a few extra
bucks upfront than spend it on migraine cures down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, let's try and make some lemonade. I'm guessing you had
Windows 3.x, since you said ``File Manager'' instead of ``Windows
Explorer.'' If the icon simply disappeared, that was no reason to
restore the system, no matter what anybody said. In Windows, just
go to the Program Manager's File menu and pick New. Fill in a
couple of blanks, and you get a new icon. In Win95/98, just
right-click on the desktop and pick New, then Shortcut from the
menu that pops up. Same general procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But it sounds like your problem was worse than that. Assuming
that trying to run a restore process didn't hammer things, it's
more likely your hard drive has started to flake out, which is
pretty common in low-end PCs. There. Give me 35 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I would probably just wipe the drive and start over if there's
no serious physical damage to the disk or no moving parts worn out.
Make yourself a boot floppy (the DOS command is FORMAT A: /s) with
Fdisk.exe and Format.com on it, then restart your system with it in
the drive. Fdisk will completely zap any data on your hard drive,
so go read the DOS manual first. Once you've used it to make a
nice, clean disk, do a format (FORMAT C: /s/v) and you'll be ready
to install Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Did I forget to mention you'll need to reinstall Windows? If
you don't have a fresh copy, you can still get Win95, generally for
about 70 bucks. You might even find a copy of Windows 3.1 in an
antique shop somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But, look, if you owned a toaster that burned everything you put
in it or a car that died every five blocks, I bet you wouldn't put
up with that. Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and invest in a
new PC instead of keeping your pile of junk on life support. Even
the best brands have models starting around a grand. And, no, I
don't get a kickback from the advertisers. At least, not a very big
one.

THOSE TONY TONYS GIVE UP THE HOST OF PAST AWARDS SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by TONY AWARDS-PICKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tonys might be onto something _ this year, there's no host.
For this, we could thank Rosie O'Donnell, who has hosted the past
few years and declined this year. Was she so good that no one could
follow her?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a host, the 1999 Antoinette Perry ``Tony'' Awards,
airing Sunday night, will use a ``paired host'' concept, in which
two actors will present an award and moderate a portion of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The pairings range from cool (Kevin Spacey and Jason Robards) to
interesting (Stockard Channing and Laurence Fishburne) to downright
scary (Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett). And we can't wait to see
who will outdiva the other in the Christine Baranski/David Hyde
Pierce duo.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, we'd love the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, Billboards, etc.
to latch onto this concept. Billy Crystal seems to be the only
awards-show host who hasn't been critically lambasted during the
'90s, and even he's getting tired.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tonys are different. This awards show is definitely more
esoteric, and considering that its honorees are readily accessible
only to folks in the Northeast _ and even then, scoring a Broadway
ticket isn't as easy as buying a CD or turning on the tube _ it's
no wonder that folks in the heartland often couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because the Tony Awards isn't watched by all of America,
it's a higher-quality awards show: It doesn't have to cater to the
masses. There are no inane tributes to people who have nothing to
do with the art form being honored; there's no overlong Debbie
Allen-choreographed interpretation of the nominated scores, no
Michael Flatley, no Stomp. Or at least not this time. Instead,
there will be numbers from the best play, musical and musical
revival nominees, including Bernadette Peters and Tom Wopat from
``Annie Get Your Gun.'' Yee-haw.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a theme on Broadway this year, it was the return of
great American playwrights. Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh''
and Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' _ both among the top
American plays of the century _ are nominated for best revival, and
the leading man in each is nominated for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee Williams' 1938 play ``Not About Nightingales'' is
nominated for best play, having been discovered only recently and
brought to the Great White Way this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable omission is British playwright David Hare,
who had three plays on Broadway _ ``Amy's View,'' ``The Blue Room''
and ``Via Dolorosa'' _ none of which was nominated for best play.
Dame Judi Dench was nominated (and will likely win) for ``Amy's
View,'' but it's no surprise that Nicole Kidman was looked over for
``The Blue Room.'' Maybe she would have been nominated if there had
there been a category for Most Hyped Five-Second Nude Scene.
</P>
<P>
   The show's highlight might be the Lifetime Achievement awards.
OK, so no big Elia Kazan-type controversy, but check these honorees
out. Actress Uta Hagen _ who has written books about acting and
this year starred opposite Fort Worth's Lorca Simons in ``Collected
Stories;'' Arthur Miller, whose works have become textbooks for
college theater classes (and some high schools that can tolerate
his crude language); and Isabelle Stevenson, chairman of the board
of the American Theatre Wing, the group behind the Tony Awards.
Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it doesn't look like a bad evening. But did you
expect anything less from the kings and queens of drama?

HANDICAPPING THE TONYS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TV-TONY AWARDS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are the major nominees and those our survey (read:
conventional wisdom) says will win:
</P>
<P>
   Best New Play:
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer'' by Patrick Marber
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonesome West'' by Martin McDonagh
</P>
<P>
   ``Not About Nightingales'' by Tennessee Williams
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' by Warren Leight
</P>
<P>
   Survey says: McDonagh's got buzz, and it was an upset when he
didn't win last year for ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' but no
one _ not the Emmys, Oscars or the Tonys _ can resist awarding
posthumously. Williams is the hot cat here.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Best New Musical:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't Nothing but the Blues''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade''
</P>
<P>
   Survey says: ``Parade'' is a strong contender, but it didn't
last on Broadway very long. Besides, what did we just say about
posthumous recognition? Look for the musical tribute to legendary
choreographer Bob Fosse to dance its way to the Tony.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Best Revival of a Play:
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' by Arthur Miller
</P>
<P>
   ``Electra'' by Euripides

REVISING CAPITALISM: COOPERATIVE INNOVATION STEALS COMPETITION'S
THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capitalism, every undergraduate student of economics learns,
thrives on competition. The brilliant virtue of the invisible hand
of competition is that it forces firms to reduce costs, cut prices
and thereby enrich consumers. This engaging tale has buttressed
every economics narrative since Adam Smith lucidly explained more
than 200 years ago how competition channels the natural greed of
individuals into serving the social good.
</P>
<P>
   Now William Baumol, an economics professor at New York
University, wants to rewrite the basic tale. Yes, competition
creates wealth. But in his new formulation, price cutting becomes a
sideshow. Innovation takes center stage as the ``primary weapon of
competition.'' And the key to innovation is a clever form of
collaboration among rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation, the process of translating inventions and new ideas
into commercial products, is largely responsible for the tenfold
rise in the living standards of American families over the last 100
years, he says in a new manuscript. Baumol's contribution is not to
emphasize the impact of innovation but to pinpoint how competition
forces companies to make innovation routine, much as marketing and
advertising are.
</P>
<P>
   In Baumol's analysis, capitalism emerges as a system that hums
because it has figured out how to make innovation humdrum.
</P>
<P>
   Baumol shows how companies pour money not only into their own
research and development but also into such operations by their
rivals. Yes, their rivals. Firms participate in joint ventures that
hire teams of researchers to develop technologies that the firms
will share. They also engage in the largely unrecognized practice
by which companies enter into technology-sharing compacts. Under
these compacts, a company like IBM writes contracts with
competitors, like Hitachi. The companies promise to license
 &UR; future &LR;  innovations to each other for a set fee. That way, if
Hitachi comes up with a spiffy next-generation disk drive, IBM is
guaranteed the right to incorporate Hitachi's new drive in its own
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem odd for an economist like Baumol to herald
collaboration among potential competitors. By jumping into the arms
of rivals, companies appear to dull their incentive to innovate on
their own. After all, if they can imitate rivals, why bother to
innovate on one's own?
</P>
<P>
   To understand Baumol's point, put yourself in the place of IBM.
You could try to piggyback off Hitachi's innovations, dismissing
your own engineers. But that strategy would collapse. At the very
least, you would be dishing out hundreds of millions of dollars
each year to rivals without getting anything in return. Worse,
Hitachi would soon drop the agreements, because they make sense
only if it expects to get about as many new products from IBM as it
provides to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it make economic sense to beef up your investment in
innovations without entering technology-sharing contracts. If four
or five of your major rivals share innovations among themselves,
then they will generate lots of ideas, drowning out the efforts of
your one research department. And anything you don't figure out on
your own will be offered to consumers by all your rivals. You
simply cannot afford to bear that risk. The compacts eliminate the
threat that a misstep in the technology race will drive you out of
business. Besides, Baumol says, the compacts generate licensing
fees that have become ``a substantial business activity in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumol's analysis makes a bigger point, far beyond the benefits
and costs to individual companies. Technology-sharing contracts
also help the economy _ that is to say consumers _ by spreading the
benefit of innovation far beyond the customers of any one company.
You don't have to buy Hitachi to get the benefit of its
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his career as a consultant as well as scholar, Baumol
says ``that of the 20 or so firms that engage in substantial
research and development for whom I have consulted over the past
few years, almost all had technology-sharing agreements of one sort
or another with other firms in their industries.'' The managers of
these companies, he says, often agreed to them reluctantly. But the
scientists, especially the engineers, often required them as a
condition of their employment: they simply refused to work for a
company that would not allow them to communicate with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a compact that Perkin-Elmer Corp., which sells
scientific instruments using precision optics, has had with Hitachi
for the right to license innovations that either company might
adopt. Under the compact, each company provides a menu of
innovations under development, any of which it promises to make
available for a fee that often ranges from 6 to 7.5 percent of the
price of the product that incorporates the innovation. Perkin-Elmer
has entered compacts with about 100 other companies. United
Technologies' Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a manufacturer of aircraft jet
engines, has technology-sharing agreements with a rival, General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry, Baumol says, is littered with
technology-sharing agreements. Baumol's point is that innovations
are no longer left to historical quirk or random feats of genius.
Rather competition has forced corporations to bring to market a
steady diet of innovative products from their own scientists or, if
not, from scientists working for their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Baumol's focus on innovation may not seem novel. Joseph
Schumpeter and others made it the core of their theories of
economic progress. But in fact, the Baumol formulation overturns
the thrust of modern textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The typical (dreary?) presentation starts with chapter after
chapter about how upward sloping supply curves and downward sloping
demand curves interact in idealized markets to determine prices.
When all goes well, market prices produce efficiency, a wondrous
social outcome whereby the economy churns out the most output
possible with its limited amounts of labor, land and machinery.
Nothing goes to waste.

 &HT;    ANTITRUST TRIAL TO FOCUS ON MICROSOFT-IBM RIFT
 &HT;    540 and insert. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The often troubled dealings between Microsoft and
IBM, two giant firms that together have done much to shape today's
computer world, will take center stage Monday at the Microsoft
antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors will seek to show that Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates orchestrated a vendetta against International Business
Machines Corp. when it refused to dump its rival operating system
in favor of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of specific illegal conduct on Microsoft's part
will be in counterpoint to the broader issues of purported monopoly
power that were raised by Franklin Fisher, the government's chief
economic witness, who ended four days on the witness stand Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's place will be taken by Garry Norris, the IBM executive
in charge of the firm's relationship with Microsoft from 1995 to
1997, a time when IBM sought in vain to achieve a marketing
breakthrough with its OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Norris's testimony, based on a handwritten diary, could ruffle
the current relationship between the two firms, which has warmed
since IBM stopped marketing OS/2 as a ``desktop solution'' and
decided to mount Windows silks as a Microsoft ``business partner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norris's allegations could also strengthen the case in a
critical sector. Even with his appearance, the government has
proved unable to convince any large computer manufacturer to
testify against Microsoft because, the prosecutors maintain, all
these companies fear Microsoft's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Microsoft lawyer Richard Pepperman will
elicit from Norris that he did not enter the federal courthouse as
a corporate representative of IBM, but rather as a private
individual whose testimony had been sought by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   At his May 28 deposition, Norris recalled that Gates had at one
point offered IBM major financial incentives if it would dump its
OS/2 software. The Microsoft co-founder, Norris said, raised the
prospect of close business ties, including deep pricing discounts,
preferential marketing programs and advanced technical support for
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM spurned the deal, Norris said, Microsoft retaliated by
raising prices, refusing to share advanced Windows code,
blacklisting IBM officials from attending Microsoft-sponsored
events, and failing to return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It was IBM's own prolonged antitrust woes in an earlier era that
prompted the company to look for an outside source when it needed
an operating system for its path-breaking personal computers in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, IBM gave the contract to Gates, at a time when
Microsoft was a 14-employee shop in Seattle. Gates bought the basic
code from another company, tweaked it a bit, and licensed it to IBM
as DOS 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear, however, that DOS would not be powerful
enough to run the next generation of Intel-based computers.
Microsoft and IBM thereupon entered into a new joint venture, which
produced OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the partners quarreled. IBM then took over OS/2
development, including full rights to Windows 3.1 code, while
Microsoft concentrated on what in time emerged as Windows 95 and
Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In his court appearance, Fisher, an economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, held that Microsoft
``probably had attained monopoly power'' when it was selling
Windows 3.1, but that it did not fully consolidate its commanding
position in the marketplace until the release of Windows 95 in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft made heavy use of newly disclosed
documents this week to argue that America Online Inc.'s recent
purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. illustrated how
competition in the high-tech industry is robust and further federal
intervention is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher said his own analysis showed that the merger would
have no bearing at all on Microsoft's monopoly stance _ a view also
held by executives of both AOL and Netscape, which survives as a
brand name but not as a company.

 UNDATED: to waste.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But market prices do not produce wondrous results in the
presence of imperfections like monopolies. One imperfection, called
an externality, is crucial to understanding the important message
of the Baumol manuscript. Markets go haywire when the impact of a
trade between buyer and seller extends beyond the two parties
directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   Take innovation. The profit from innovation routinely leaks to
third parties. A firm spends a lot of money bringing to market a
clever new electronic organizer or tennis racket. Ten nanoseconds
later, another firm tears the product apart and reverse engineers a
variation that gets around the patent. So the first firm winds up
making relatively little money, a heavy disincentive for would-be
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Edward Wolff, a colleague of Baumol at New York
University, estimates that innovators can expect to earn about 10
cents a year from each dollar they invest. But because the
innovation leaks to other companies and other sectors, the economy
as a whole reaps a benefit of about 50 cents. The implication,
according to the textbooks, is that capitalism provides
entrepreneurs too little of the profit that investments create for
the economy. So they invest too little in the development of
products. Consumers suffer from high prices, restricted choice and
delayed innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional analysis, then, says that capitalism blunders at
generating innovation over the long run. Baumol's manuscript
reverses this presumption. Competition forces firms to innovate,
engaging in what Baumol says ``is tantamount to a technological
arms race.'' The technology-sharing compacts, by generating a
steady flow of licensing fees for IBM, Perkin-Elmer and other
innovators, turn innovation into a routine profit-making activity.
The competitive system, he says, goes ``a long way, perhaps all the
way, toward generating the right amount of innovation.'' The
compacts overcome leakage by pouring more of the economy's gains
from innovation into the bank account of the innovator.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing the risk of innovation (a company that goes down the
wrong technological road can lease the innovations it did not come
up with) and increasing revenues, technology-sharing compacts make
innovation profitable, routine and plentiful. As proof, he points
to nonmarket societies that generated plenty of inventions but few
applications. Medieval China, for example, invented gunpowder,
paper, the printing press and probably the compass and the water
wheel. But these inventions failed to raise living standards until
adapted into consumer products by societies that were less hostile
to commerce. The genius of Western capitalism was to translate
invention into the goods and services that enrich everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Baumol tells a tale rich in details about the market's use of
collaboration to overcome problems of innovation. Along the way he
turns standard analysis upside down. Textbooks congratulate markets
for their short-run efficiency, even though the short run is
nothing spectacular. Entrenched monopolies, labor-market
rigidities, perverse management incentives and many other problems
are pervasive. The standard analysis goes on to criticize the
market for shortchanging innovation and growth, when in fact
``spectacular growth is the market's outstanding accomplishment.''

   In his court appearance, Fisher, an economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, held that Microsoft
``probably had attained monopoly power'' when it was selling
Windows 3.1, but that it did not fully consolidate its commanding
position in the marketplace until the release of Windows 95 in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft made heavy use of newly disclosed
documents this week to argue that America Online Inc.'s recent
purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. illustrated how
competition in the high-tech industry is robust and further federal
intervention is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher said his own analysis showed that the merger would
have no bearing at all on Microsoft's monopoly stance _ a view also
held by executives of both AOL and Netscape, which survives as a
brand name but not as a company.

COMPAQ CREATES NETWORKING NEWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few PC companies have been pushing home networking as
aggressively as Compaq Computer Corp. Rather than waiting for home
networks to become the next big thing, Compaq is trying to make it
happen faster.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Compaq has been selling Presario home PCs that
let you use your existing home phone wiring to create a network.
Just plug a pair of computers with the feature into your home's
phone jacks, and presto! _ instant network.
</P>
<P>
   This removes one of the big obstacles to setting up a network in
a house _ wiring. In most homes with more than one computer, the
machines are not in the same room. Those who want to have a
traditional, Ethernet network similar to those used in offices must
run cables through the walls, a daunting task even for the most
dexterous handyman.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has simplified what may be an even more intimidating
task _ configuring the software part of the network.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PITTING CHIP AGAINST CHIP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In order to test this feature, I tried out two high-end Presario
models in the 5600 line. These machines are available via Compaq's
online store, as well as through kiosks set up in stores such as
Best Buy and CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   This also gave me a chance to check something else. One of the
systems, a 5600i, had a 450-megahertz Pentium III chip from Intel
Corp. The other, a 5600S, had a 450-megahertz Advanced Micro
Devices K6III processor. This let me pit chip against chip, since
the basic configuration of both machines was similar.
</P>
<P>
   Both had 128 megabytes of memory, Diamond Multimedia Viper V550
video cards with 16 megabytes of video memory, DVD-ROM drives and
56K modems. Both also came with Compaq's new 15-inch, digital
flat-panel monitor, the FP700.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600i had a bigger hard drive at 22 gigabytes, compared to
the 5600S, with its 13.5-gigabyte drive. The 5600S used a Sonic
Impact audio card with Aureal 3D 2.0 chips; the 5600i had a Diamond
Monster Sound MX300 card, which also uses the Aureal chipset.
</P>
<P>
   And the 5600i came with a secondary network card, so you could
use it on a traditional network, or with a cable modem that
requires a network card.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600i costs about $1,845, as configured on Compaq's Web
site. The 5600S was about $1,575. You can add the flat-panel
monitor to either one for $645.
</P>
<P>
   Both computers were typical Compaq machines _ loaded down with
bells and whistles. Both were very fast in everyday tasks _ opening
applications, saving files, running entertainment and game
software. Compaq continues to improve the software used to run its
Internet Keyboard. It's now much easier to customize than it was in
previous incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   They also had excellent sound. The 5600i's Monster sound card
can be configured to run up to four speakers, for dramatic and
realistic surround-sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NOT EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both machines also had serious problems with the video card. The
Viper V550, which uses nVidia's Riva TNT chipset, is notorious for
its buggy drivers. On the 5600i and occasionally on the 5600S, the
system would lock up midway through the boot-up process and the
video would die. Compaq even supplied me with a second 5600i, and
it had the same behavior.
</P>
<P>
   I also was unable to run a very popular children's drawing
program, Broderbund's KidPix Studio Deluxe, on either machine. The
program generated the dreaded Blue Screen of Death, forcing a
system reboot.
</P>
<P>
   The boot-up problem was fixed in both machines by getting the
latest drivers from Diamond's Web site _ if you buy a 5600 series
machine with the Viper V550, that Web site should be your first
stop on the Net! _ but it did not cure the KidPix problem. My two
daughters were bummed.
</P>
<P>
   The home networking component worked as advertised. A setup
wizard instantly configured the machines for a network, rebooted
once, and the machines were immediately talking to each other. It
was similar to the setup process included in the upcoming Windows
98 Second Edition (see last week's review at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/05/28/compute.html).
Advanced users can use the Network module in the Windows Control
Panel to add other features and protocols.
</P>
<P>
   I was able to talk on the phone, with no noticeable loss of
volume or voice quality, while the two machines were using the
network.
</P>
<P>
   The connection, which operates at 1 megabit a second, is
considerably slower than Ethernet speeds of 10 or 100 megabits, but
still was fast enough for most uses. Games, printing and
modem-sharing were just fine. The only use that bogged the system
down was the copying of large files from one computer to the other.
That, which is almost instantaneous with 10- and 100-megabit
networks, seems interminable with a 1-megabit connection.
</P>
<P>
   In testing the K6III versus the Pentium III chips, I found that
the two were quite competitive so long as the applications involved
used AMD's 3D Now extensions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a 3D Now version of id Software's Quake
II. I ran it on the 5600S, and the game was just as fast as it was
on the Pentium III machine. But if I ran the regular version of
Quake II on the 5600S, it was noticeably slower than the Pentium
III-based 5600i.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I can heartily recommend the Compaq FP700 digital
flat-panel monitor. Its display is very bright and crisp, so long
as you use it in 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution. As is the case with
most flat-panel monitors, the image degrades when you switch to
what's called ``non-native'' resolutions, but the FP700 is better
than most. You'll need a graphics card that can accept the special
digital connection.

WHEN PORTAL DOWNLOAD LED TO PROBLEMS, READER WORKED OUT WAYS TO
RESOLVE THEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Two or three weeks ago, I downloaded a version of Internet
Explorer 5.0 from ZDNet. It was a fairly simple matter to delete
the bookmarks that were included in the ZDNet package and change
the ZDNet homepage to my preferred homepage, but I was left with
two other annoying remnants of the portal download: a hyperkinetic
ZDNet logo where the Microsoft spinning globe usually resides in
the upper right-hand corner of the browser, and a ``brought to you
by ZD University'' notation in the title bar.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, according to a CNet Web article, is to uninstall
the portal version and reinstall a clean version from Microsoft.
Fine, except that requires another long, quirky download from
Microsoft, which was the reason for downloading from ZDNet in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Through trial and error and reading the newsgroups, I worked out
some alternative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   First, the animated logo is a .bmp graphic stack. I did a ZD
file search and found it in the Signup folder inside the Microsoft
Internet folder. I modified the name of the file and opened the
browser to see if that worked. The ZDNet logo was gone and the MS
globe was back.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can safely delete the ZDNet .bmp stack. The title bar
notation problem involved an unguided excursion into the registry.
After opening the registry with regedit, I used the Find command on
the Edit menu and located the file with the offending phrase under
HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMain. I
right-clicked on the ``Window Title'' file icon, selected Modify,
and deleted the advertising notation.
</P>
<P>
   If I work up enough courage to go back, I may try adding a
phrase to personalize the title bar. I don't know if this will work
for anyone else, but I'm happy to be able to open Internet Explorer
without all the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's an excellent tip. Many people got IE5 from these
portal sites because the Microsoft download area was so sluggish
from overcrowding. But they were stuck with so-called ``branded''
versions of the browser. I suspect your note will draw a lot of
interest!
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I've heard from quite a few readers who have had
problems with the klunky IE5 setup process, in which users must
download a program that, in turn, downloads the rest of the
browser. The best solution is to order the CD from the Web site at
cdorder.one.microsoft.com/ie5/default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in copying the setup components of the
Windows 98 installation CD to my hard drive to make it simpler when
I install software that calls for the CD. However, there's a lot of
stuff on there, most of which I suspect I don't need. What folders
should I copy over?
</P>
<P>
   A: The primary folder for the Windows 98 setup is the Win98
folder. This includes the setup routine and all the .CAB files,
which contain the ``ingredients'' for building Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to copy over the Drivers folder, though this
is seldom used except for a full install of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you might browse through the ToolsReskit folder _ there
are some interesting Help files that might be worth having on your
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am thinking about building my next computer. I've bought a
recent book, and nothing looks too complicated. However, a friend
of mine mentioned that the different components that I'm
considering have not been tested for compatibility with each other,
and may cause frequent crashes. What's your take on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should be fairly safe if you choose name-brand
components, particularly for the video card, modem and motherboard.
Off-brands may not have been tested with each other, but the name
brands are your best bet for compatibility.

NO, IT'S NOT MTV. ANDREW COPELAND REALLY DID WIN ON THE `THE PRICE
IS RIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   The Gainesville Sun   c.1999 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ If you don't think the world turns in
mysterious ways, consider the case of Andrew Copeland, singer and
songwriter for Sister Hazel, the million-selling rock 'n' roll band
from Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland and the rest of the group are in Los Angeles recording
their second album for Universal Records. On Monday, Copeland took
the afternoon off and while visiting Mann's Chinese Theatre, he and
girlfriend, Cari Cascio, were given free passes to a nearby taping
of ``The Price is Right.'' With nothing else to do, they went to
the CBS-TV studio.
</P>
<P>
   Before you could say ``it's all for you,'' the announcer was
calling out ``Drew Copeland! Come on down!'' and the 31-year-old
pop star was a contestant on America's longest-running game show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I'm thinking, `This isn't really happening,' ''
said Copeland, who _ as is his custom _ took his shoes off before
walking onto the stage. ``It looks like you need to win some
shoes,'' Bob Barker joked, and then announced that Copeland would
be a contestant in a game for ``A Brand New Car!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, you pick these numbers and they flip them
over, and if you spell C-A-R, or if one card has a picture of a car
on it, you win the car,'' Copeland explained. He had to bid on
three items _ a pot-and-pan set, a water purifier and a pottery
wheel. To everyone's surprise, especially his, he got them all
correct and was handed the keys to a 2000 Ford Escort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell I wasn't even planning on being there,''
Copeland said. ``Bob asked me what I did for a living, and I said I
was in a band ...'' He never mentioned Sister Hazel, or the fact
that his group has a platinum album. ``I'm thinking, I'm here
cheesing out on `The Price is Right,' I don't need to be dragging
the band into it.' '' He did, however, admit to Barker that he
didn't know how to play the game. ``Bob whispered `Just pretend
that you do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland made it to the Showcase Showdown, but he doesn't
remember much about it (``I'm still trippin' because I just won a
car''). He didn't win the Fiji vacation or the year's supply of
Rice-a-Roni. He pledged to Barker that the Escort was to be a gift
for his father, Jack Copeland, back in Gainesville. Bob liked that.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, it was back to the studio, where Sister Hazel's
album is being produced by Mike Clink, who handled ``Appetite For
Destruction'' for Guns 'N Roses, way back when.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the group, Copeland says, believed that he was
actually a contestant on ``The Price is Right,'' much less that he
won A Brand New Car.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be singing a different song when the show airs on CBS at
11 a.m. Friday, June 11.

LESSONS LEARNED: ADVOCATES OF AIR POWER SAY KOSOVO WAS A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a peace agreement near in Kosovo, advocates of
military air power are triumphantly claiming that sustained allied
bombing for 10 weeks was the key factor in forcing Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept peace terms.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful air armada of 720 American aircraft and 348 allied
aircraft made more than 33,000 flights or sorties since the bombing
campaign began March 24; some 14,000 bombs and precision guided
weapons were dropped on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But the most notable statistic in the campaign was a zero: Not a
single NATO pilot was lost to enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, NATO officials estimate that the air attacks
inflicted more than 10,000 Yugoslav casualties and destroyed
hundreds of artillery pieces, armored personnel carriers and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign had to overcome bad weather, a cumbersome
political process to select targets and high-profile blunders such
as the accidental bombings of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by a
B-2 stealth bomber and of Kosovo Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But for boosters of air power, the bottom line added up to a
huge success.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Merrill McPeak, a former Air Force chief of staff,
boasted that ``a lot of the so-called expert projections didn't
turn out to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People said the B-2 would never be used in combat; it was used
over downtown Belgrade. Then there were people predicting
Yugoslavia had a very rugged air defense network and that we would
lose pilots; none of that happened,'' McPeak said.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``absolutely amazing'' that NATO suffered no casualties
to enemy fire, McPeak said. ``If any wild-eyed air power advocate
had made that prediction before the conflict, they would have been
laughed out of town,'' McPeak said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. planes were shot down, including a U.S. F-117A stealth
jet, but their pilots were rescued. Two Apache helicopter crewmen
died in a training accident.
</P>
<P>
   In six weeks of bombing during the Persian Gulf War, 19 U.S.
airmen were killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   McPeak said that the Kosovo operation validated the Air Force's
post-Gulf War emphasis on developing better precision-guided
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Buster Glosson, the architect of air
operations during the Persian Gulf War, said the Kosovo conflict
proved that air power could hasten victory on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict underscores that ``anytime air power can be
decisive and reach a political end, it should be the force of
choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major lesson is that you should have the patience to let
air power take the maximum toll it can before putting one Marine or
soldier on the ground,'' Glosson added.
</P>
<P>
   A big congressional booster of air power, Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., a senior member of the House defense appropriations
subcommittee, said Kosovo ``will vindicate'' air power advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who didn't buy the idea that we
could prevail in a conflict without putting ground forces in, and I
shared some of that skepticism,'' said Dicks, whose district
includes the Boeing Co., manufacturer of the B-2 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have air power and you don't lose any human lives but
you achieve your political objective _ it doesn't get much better
than that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of air power has been studied at the nation's
military academies for 50 years, and the conflict in Kosovo no
doubt will add more chapters to the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts contend that air attacks on Yugoslavia
weren't the only reason Milosevic backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a former Army intelligence
officer who has written widely on military matters, said that a
convergence of events forced Milosevic to accept peace terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question air power did the heavy lifting,'' Peters
said. But he argued that air power was helped by a little noticed
force of ground troops _ the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, consisting mainly of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo,
forced units of the Yugoslav army to come out of the hiding places
they had built to conceal themselves from the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn made the Yugoslav units vulnerable to NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't hitting them hard, but suddenly, when they had to
emerge from hiding, air power could do its job,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the KLA has become a viable fighting force
of nearly 15,000 troops that has made successful hit-and-run
attacks against Yugoslav forces operating in Kosovo over the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Peters also contended that the recent war crimes indictment of
Milosevic by a U.N. tribunal in The Netherlands was ``a lynch pin
move'' that added to Milosevic's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indictment personalized the conflict and probably really
spooked Milosevic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbruner, a military expert with the Brookings
Institution, a non-partisan think tank, argued that strong hints
from NATO of a possible ground attack played a central role in
forcing Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has produced the agreement was the unmistakable sign in
the last couple of weeks that NATO was moving towards a ground
operation. That was the threat that mattered,'' Steinbruner said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the success of air power, the conflict in Kosovo
provided other valuable ``lessons learned,'' military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McPeak said President Clinton's announced position
at the outset of the air war that the United States wasn't planning
for a ground invasion gave Milosevic reason to dig in his troops
for the long haul and wait out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never, ever give up options at the beginning of a
contest. All that did was raise the bar for air power and make a
self-inflicted strategic setback,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glosson said that the campaign was unnecessarily long because
military planners delayed bombing many key targets such as the
electrical grid and other infrastructure until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had paralyzed them in the first two weeks, this would
have been over in about five or six weeks,'' Glosson said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid allied casualties, most NATO pilots were ordered to
stay above 15,000 feet to avoid surface-to-air missiles. This made
accurate bombing more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The altitude limitations _ combined with Clinton's resistance to
plan for a ground war _ was a case study in how not to wage war,
said Maj. Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, a retired Canadian army officer who
has conducted peace keeping operations in Bosnia on behalf of the
United Nations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had come up with a solution like that at the U.S. Army
War college, I wouldn't have been failed, I would have been sent
home for incompetence,'' he said.

BOSNIAN CONFLICT SUGGESTS REFUGEES MAY NOT RETURN TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the allied onslaught against Yugoslavia
has cleared the way for an estimated 1.6 million displaced
residents of Kosovo to eventually return home, will they?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton remains convinced that almost all displaced
ethnic Albanians will return to their agrarian, mountainous
homeland, White House aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to the people, the refugees who the president spoke
to, and I think you get the very real sense that these people very
much want to go home,'' White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart
said Friday. ``And they want to go home as soon as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a radio message to the people of Kosovo last week,
emphasized steps being taken by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the United States to provide security and
humanitarian assistance once the Kosovars return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will return,'' Clinton vowed. ``Remember that no matter
what has happened to you, you are not alone. The United States and
NATO are with you, and we will stay with you long after you return
home.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials underscore that the NATO alliance waged the first
war in its 50-year history to enable uprooted Kosovars to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   But if history is any guide, the U.S.-led effort may face an
uphill struggle persuading refugees to return to Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, which is the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement
ended a four-year conflict in neighboring Bosnia that claimed
200,000 lives, barely 574,000 of the 1.8 million uprooted Bosnians
have returned to their homes, according to U.N. refugee officials.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Bosnian refugees have elected not to return to
their homes because ``their home villages are now controlled by an
ethnic group other than their own,'' according to refugee officials
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 700,000 Bosnian refugees who fled to Europe, for example,
nearly 400,000 are still living in their adoptive countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the return program hinges primarily upon the
removal of local obstructionism blocking the returns of
minorities,'' the U.N. says. Other impediments include destroyed
homes, devastated sewer, power and water facilities and the
residual threat of unexploded land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery efforts are lagging as well in Bosnia, where
international donations to a $5.1 billion recovery fund are falling
behind.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say they remain confident that the
experience in Bosnia will not afflict refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bosnia conflict stretched out over a much longer period
and people were out (of their homes) for a much longer time,''
Lockhart said. ``The vast majority of refugees from Kosovo remain
in the region nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says almost 850,000
predominantly Muslim Kosovars were driven out of the province by
the Yugoslav army and police forces, mostly after the NATO bombing
campaign began in March.
</P>
<P>
   Another 76,475 have found temporary refuge in 28 nations,
including the United States. An estimated 700,000 Kosovars remain
uprooted inside Kosovo, driven from their homes and too frightened
to return.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the way is cleared for repatriation, major obstacles
remain. Yugoslav forces have destroyed homes and villages abandoned
by the ethnic Albanians. In addition, the refugees say soldiers and
border guards confiscated their passports and other identity papers
in an effort to impede their return.

</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee specialists say they are gearing up to assist
refugees interested in leaving tent cities in Albania, Macedonia
and elsewhere and return home. But, adds the U.N. agency in a
statement: ``The return of refugees and the displaced will depend
on the security situation in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making preparations to help Kosovo refugees to
home, U.N. officials say they also are laying the groundwork for
Kosovo refugees who elect not to return.
</P>
<P>
   Uprooted Kosovars must have ``a free, voluntary and
well-informed decision regarding repatriation or return,'' with
assurances that Kosovars ``who are not willing or able to return to
Kosovo can continue to receive protection and necessary
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency vows that it will ``begin to facilitate
repatriation and return movements only after being satisfied that
all necessary preconditions have been met and that return can take
place in conditions of safety and dignity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last February, as Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pressed forward with his bloody assault on Kosovo,
President Clinton huddled with his national security team to review
the grim slate of options before him.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Clinton's deputy national security adviser James
Steinberg later recalled, a sober session with no good alternatives
and NATO air strikes appeared increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
   On the central point, though, Clinton seemed resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president himself said 'I don't think we should assume
that Milosevic is going to give in to the first wave of strikes,'''
Steinberg recalled. Said Clinton, ``We have to be prepared to
follow through on this.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, having led an international coalition through 2 1/2
months of high-stakes bombing, Clinton appeared headed for a
landmark victory in the Balkans, with Milosevic capitulating to a
set of demands Clinton has articulated without waiver through week
after week of an often difficult campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is a triumph tempered by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the world's mightiest alliance, it turned out, could
halt the bloodshed and terror that put more than one million ethnic
Albanians to flight.
</P>
<P>
   Most will have the chance to return to their land, however, just
as Clinton repeatedly promised they would. If their suffering
couldn't be prevented, he has said, at least there's the chance it
might be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   For an impeached and acquitted president who has struggled to
find the proper role for the last remaining superpower in the post
Cold War world, taking risks and standing firm to strike a blow
against ethnic repression in Europe seemed a fitting close to the
bloodiest century on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in Kosovo because we want to replace ethnic cleansing
with tolerance and decency,'' Clinton said in April, in a speech
here to open the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are fundamentally there because the alliance will not
have meaning in the 21st Century if it permits the slaughter of
innocents on its doorstep,'' Clinton said. ``This is not a question
of territorial conquest or political domination, but standing for
the values that made NATO possible in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Just six months after being impeached by the House for charges
stemming from his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's leadership stands to be vindicated by
victory in a stark and brutal land that was once as remote to U.S.
interests as it is forboding.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, Clinton knew or cared little about the
Balkans six years ago: he's since learned more than he ever wanted
to know.
</P>
<P>
   He began his education by reading Robert Kaplan's book ``Balkan
Ghosts,'' a tableau of centuries of ethnic violence in the tortured
region. For three years, Clinton assuaged his guilt over inaction
in Bosnia by telling himself there was little to be done to stop
the cycle of murder and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I regret it now more than I can say, for I have spent a
great deal of time in these last six years reading the real history
of the Balkans,'' Clinton confessed last month during a speech at
the National Defense University here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that a lot of what passes for common wisdom in
this area is a gross over-simplification and misreading of
history,'' Clinton said. ``The truth is that for centuries these
people have lived together in the Balkans in Southeastern Europe,
with greater or lesser degree of tensions, but often without
anything approaching the intolerable conditions and conflicts that
exist today.''
</P>
<P>
   After Serbs unleashed 3 1/2 years of atrocities on Bosnia,
leaving a quarter of a million people dead and some 3 million
homeless, Clinton led NATO to air strikes and peace talks that
ended that conflict in November, 1995. He was determined, aides
said, not to stand by and watch a similar tragedy unfold in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``His experience in Bosnia and seeing the ethnic cleansing there
has stiffened his resolve to stand against it here (in Kosovo),''
said Clinton's long-time political adviser, Paul Begala, who left
the White House earlier this year to teach government at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is like the welfare bill,'' said Begala,
referring to the split-the-difference instincts that have guided
much of Clinton's political career. ``I think he approaches this
with an extraordinary sense of resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Having looked on in frustration and even anger as Serbs violated
48 separate cease-fires in Bosnia before finally agreeing to the
Dayton peace accords, Clinton developed a deep and almost visceral
distrust of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serb leader agreed last October, under the threat of
NATO air strikes, to end his campaign of repression against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton was disappointed, but not surprised,
to see him renege on those commitments -- citing terrorist
activities by Kosovar rebels -- as he continued to do from December
until air strikes were launched March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, Clinton stood fast by his core
position: the air strikes would continue until Milosevic pulled his
troops out of Kosovo and agreed to turn over control of the
province to a NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   There were intense pressures on Clinton to ease up, particularly
after the first three weeks of the campaign, during which Serb
troops, police and paramilitary gangs went on a rampage of murder,
destruction, rape and pillage that ran an estimated 1.5 million
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, whose influence over black
voters has bought him remarkable cache with Clinton, urged him to
halt the bombing a month ago and try to negotiate a settlement with
Milosevic. While that surely lent succor to Milosevic, Clinton
didn't nibble.
</P>
<P>
   He stood his ground, also, against criticism from other
quarters, voices urging him to escalate the fighting by sending in
ground forces or Apache helicopters, either of which would have
guaranteed American casualties. Clinton stuck instead to his
conviction that Americans had a low threshold of pain for Kosovo,
and he refused to place the mission at risk by asking his country
to pay a cost few were willing to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed on through other trials as well, including a
Congress deeply divided over the air strikes and an excruciating
series of NATO errors that killed hundreds of civilians, many of
them the very ethnic Albanian refugees the alliance was trying to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton even rode out the mistaken bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, a grotesque blunder by the U.S. intelligence
community that set relations between the United States and the
world's most populous nation careening down a dangerous path at a
critical moment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warded off inner anxieties as well, and made no attempt
to conceal them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relish every night sending young Americans and our
NATO allies up in planes, flying very fast under very hazardous
circumstances in which their safety is at risk,'' Clinton said
during a May 3 press conference. ``I do not relish the thought
that, inevitably, some of those bombs will go astray and some
Serbian civilians or some Kosovar civilians could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He even felt compelled to explain himself to a group of
Democratic supporters in Austin, Texas, last month, saying the use
of military force runs counter to his nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that sort of person,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me tell you,'' he continued. ``Ethnic cleansing, and
killing people wholesale because of their race or religion, is
wrong. And the United States is in a position to stand against it,
and we ought to.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the air war staggered through week after inconclusive
week, Clinton's will to persist appeared to be strengthened by the
actions of Serb forces inside Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, Clinton spent several hours visiting in Ingelheim,
Germany with ethnic Albanians who had fled Kosovo. As he listened
to them, some sobbing as they recounted the horrors they had
witnessed _ a woman who had seen her brother shot to death; a
teacher forced to watch as Serbs beat his students; a mother who
had no idea what had become of her children _Clinton seemed to take
strength from their suffering, even as he sought to lend them
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let yourself be broken by this,'' Clinton implored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look for your students and we'll look for your family
members,'' he pledged. ``But remember, you cannot give a victory to
the kind of oppression you have been subject to. We cannot see
these children robbed of their childhood. And the adults, the older
among you, you must not let the younger people lose heart. And we
will stay at it until you can go home again.''

   NEW YORK _ The first and by no means only foul-up at the Council
of Fashion Designers of America's annual awards gala last Wednesday
was that hardly any of the guests at the Lexington Avenue armory
could see one another. This was crushing: 1,200 of New York's most
glamorous people poured into a kind of holding room for cocktails
and _ sink! _ it looked like a cave. Somebody had draped the room
in black and dimmed the lights. You had to be practically on top of
a person to see who it was.
</P>
<P>
   And pretty soon it could have been Calvin Klein or Donna Karan,
Michael Kors or Hugh Grant and his girlfriend, Liz Hurley _ all in
this madhouse, in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The awards evening has a reputation for being longer, duller and
ultimately less fun than almost any such event, and it surpassed
expectations this year as technical delays _ presumably caused by
the ceremony's being televised for the first time _ turned it into
a six-and-a-half-hour ordeal of dinner, speeches and wilting
hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand any of this,'' said a nonplused John
Fairchild, the former publisher of Women's Wear Daily, whose snowy
cap of hair made him more visible than others. He had flown in from
London, where he lives these days, to present a lifetime
achievement award to Yves Saint Laurent. ``I'm just here for Saint
Laurent,'' Fairchild said, shouting above a cocktail-lounge band
that was flailing away in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Kempner, a Saint Laurent stalwart, said, ``I was going to
wear long, but Yves told me to wear short, and I'm glad I did.''
She had given a lunch that day for the designer; about 20 people,
including Bill Blass, Pat Buckley and members of Saint Laurent's
entourage, had spinach souffle in her Park Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   It was 12:30 a.m. when the show at the armory finally ended,
though by then nearly half of the tables were empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excruciating,'' Mrs. Kempner said the next day. ``I thought if
I sat there any longer I could claim squatter's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Leeds, a former Seventh Avenue executive who now runs
his own capital management firm, bailed out around 11. ``The
evening just took too long,'' he said, ``considerably too long. You
can't expect people who work the next day to sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-and-a-half-hour show, to be broadcast on June 13 on the
E! cable channel, certainly had some captivating moments: the
tributes to Saint Laurent; the elation of young design winners like
Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley of Tuleh, who captured a Perry Ellis
award for new talent in women's wear, and the emotions expressed by
Andrew Tilberis, who accepted a humanitarian award for his wife,
Elizabeth Tilberis, the Harper's Bazaar editor in chief who died in
April. He made their life together vivid when he said: ``There was
a private Liz. Not your Liz. My Liz.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, said later, ``All
the good will just ran out because it was simply too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Length wasn't the only problem. From the outset, the show lacked
a sophistication worthy of the industry. Around 9:30, as guests
were still picking through their dinner and fanning themselves with
the menu cards, a voice announced in the soap-bubble tone of a
game-show host that the ``festivities'' were about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Festivities? It sounded as though the audience was expected to
rise up in couture silks and start bashing a pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was hard to deny that some of this nuttiness was
mesmerizing. It was like being in a giant massage parlor for the
demand-feeding ego, with design winners thanking fashion editors
and editors thanking designers, and celebrities doing their best to
make the event seem more important than it was. When the actress
Julianne Moore, the ceremony's hostess, got up to announce that
Sophia Loren wasn't there to accept her style award, she looked
ready to crumble with mortification. ``I'm so sorry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the show got under way, the first honoree, Yohji Yamamoto,
presented a synopsis of his spring collection. As the models came
out on a runway in the middle of the room and artfully began to
shed a layer of their outfits, young women dressed in black darted
onto the platform, like ball girls at Wimbledon, and retrieved
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's contributing editor at large,
strode out to present Yamamoto's award. He was dressed regally even
for Talley, who is known for his flamboyance: He wore a long black
coat, lace shirt, cummerbund and glimmering stole _ a potentate as
imagined by Shakespeare. He said a few words and Yamamoto clambered
onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A modest man, Yamamoto said that Talley had advised him that
saying only ``thank you'' might seem rude. So Yamamoto said,
``Thank you very much.'' This drew laughs. He added that he was
humbled to be in the presence of Laurent, whom he called a god, and
said, ``My feet are shaking, my heart is pumping and my brain is
screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   One would have thought the show's producers would have moved
Saint Laurent's acceptance speech, the evening's main draw, up in
the program _ what with all the gathering sentiment. The Tuleh
designers acknowledged Saint Laurent. So did Bette Midler, who, as
she gave an award to Simon Doonan, the Barneys New York window
dresser, joked that she was ``in front of God _ that's apparently
Yves Saint Laurent.'' And when Marc Jacobs' turn came to accept a
statuette for accessories, he was apparently so overawed that he
said of the award Saint Laurent was still waiting to get, ``It's
not a lifetime achievement, it's an achievement for a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent still had to wait until the bitter end, about
12:10 a.m.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the evening wore on, the gaps between segments seemed to
lengthen, with nothing to stop the audience from sinking into a
trough of boredom after the occasional big laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Chris Rock came out to give a menswear award to
Calvin Klein. Rock has been known to tomahawk many a person with
his wit, and he let Klein have it with a couple of jokes about
their imagined childhood together. But after Klein had graciously
accepted his award, the audience plunged back into boredom.
</P>
<P>
   On it went. One can only guess how people passed the lulls. At
Giorgio Armani's table, where the actress Claire Forlani sat with
members of the designer's publicity staff (he was in Italy), Robert
Triefus gamely held Ms. Forlani's cigarette while she powdered her
nose and recounted her exploits in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the stage, Matt Nye, wearing a tight French nautical
sweater that verged on an off-the-shoulder top, accepted the Perry
Ellis young designer's award for menswear. There was light
applause. It was nearly midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Then Saint Laurent stepped on stage and the audience rose. He
spoke in broken English, saying that fashion was ``a source of
immense joy and immense anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   But can anyone really understand what such passion means in a
soap-bubble era? Before Saint Laurent spoke, a video was shown of
last year's World Cup in France, when Saint Laurent models, maybe
500 in all, marched somberly around the stadium. How many other
designers can claim an allegiance on a par with that of a national
sport?
</P>
<P>
   It was the most powerful image of a thoroughly lopsided evening.

HILLARY'S CANDIDACY ISN'T ABOUT NEW YORK _ IT'S ABOUT HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In certain circles, it's called ``doing a
geographic.'' The idea is that if one moves to someplace new,
things will somehow change for the better and the pain will
magically disappear. It's delusional, but if the pain is deep
enough, belief in magic is sometimes all that remains.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy for the US Senate is a
geographic with a twist, since its unique selling principle is her
pain. It is why she imagines voters will root for her. It is how
she asks them to relate to her. She is one of them, she says in all
but words, because she too has suffered. New York voters are
supposed to care.
</P>
<P>
   They don't. The weirdest thing of all is that they're not even
that interested. The media are doing everything they can to hype
``the Senate Race of the Century'' between the First Lady and New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, but you'd be hard-pressed to find
six people outside of politics who have given it a second thought.
No one talks about the race, except maybe at a cocktail party and
even then it's a subject people want to get away from as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's all but official now. On Thursday Nita Lowey,
US representative from Westchester County who had been planning her
own Senate campaign, announced that she would seek reelection
instead, thus clearing the path for the First Lady's march to the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear she is running,'' Lowey told The New York Times.
``It's time for me to move.'' Shortly thereafter, former White
House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes announced that Mrs.
Clinton was ``pressing forward'' with her candidacy. Soon after
that, word spread across the state that Hillary's Senate campaign
was ``a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the race is a complete mismatch. Hillary Clinton has
no credentials for the job. She has never been elected to anything
by anyone and she has accomplished nothing of importance over the
course of her 25 years as a political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume is unimpressive. She was a partner at a second-tier
law firm in a third-rate state who couldn't meet her revenue
targets. She worked closely at that firm with two other partners;
one who committed suicide under mysterious cirumstances and the
other a convicted felon and thief. During that time she entered
into a corrupt real estate partnership that to this day she has
never adequeately explained. Also during that time, she made
$100,000 with a $1,000 stake in the commodities market by reading,
she said, The Wall Street Journal. Would that we were all so
literate.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband first ran for president, she engaged the
services of Betsy Wright, his former chief of staff, to set up a
vast statewide organization to suppress information about his
sexual adventurism. In this effort, she and Wright were quite
successful. When they were not, as in the case of Gennifer Flowers,
Hillary took to the airwaves to defend her husband's reputation,
knowing all the while that she was engaged in blatant deception.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband was elected president, she managed the debacle
that was national health insurance. It was roundly rejected in
large measure because of her strategy and tactics and led
inexorably to the wholesale dismissal of Democrats from both Houses
of Congress. What had seemed firmly under Democratic control was
suddenly lost, thanks largely to her incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   She was promptly deep-sixed by the president's handlers and
remade as his helpmate. After his reelection, there followed
humilation and degradation so complete it was a wonder she could
appear in public at all. When news of Monica first broke, she
blamed it all on a ``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' When every word
of it turned out to be true, she was left to wallow in the wake of
her husband's disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign for the US Senate is being positioned as
an existential mission, during which she will connect with voters
and in so doing find her voice. It is more likely a prelude to a
possible presidential candidacy in the year 2004 or 2008. She is
nothing if not power-hungry and has a zealot's certainty about the
righteousness of her stance.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it is a delusion. She will not win because her
candidacy isn't about New York, or the people who live here, or
what she might do for them. It's about her. It's her movie, which
she stars in and directs. The problems of others are important only
to the degree that they forward her plot.
</P>
<P>
   The moment New Yorkers collectively understand this _ that
they're being used _ will be the moment that her candidacy curdles.
What might have been ``you go girl,'' will become ``just go away.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's the modern way to buy a corporate jet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just click,'' said James Finkelstein, sitting at a mahogany
conference table in his midtown office, and casting the occasional
adoring look at his wife of 16 months, Pamela Gross. She returned
the affection, playing with his ear lobe.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the modern way to buy caviar from Le Cirque 2000? Or
diamond earrings in Asprey &AMP; Garrard's signature daisy shape?
</P>
<P>
   Click. Click.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes as planned, the above items and more will be
available on the Internet in August, as part of a plan by
Finkelstein and Ms. Gross to wire the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, as faithful readers of the party pages may recall,
were married in a 1998 ceremony at Le Cirque attended by a who's
who of the social Upper East Side, including Nina Griscom and Dan
Baker, Blaine and Robert Trump, Judy and Alfred Taubman, Vera Wang
and Arthur Becker, Leonard and Allison Stern, Allan and Deborah
Grubman, and Pauline and Dixon Boardman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gross was one of the founding editors of Manhattan File, the
trendy, young magazine distributed only to oh-so-social buildings
on Fifth Avenue and environs. Finkelstein, 50, is a son of
Manhattan File's original owner, Jerry Finkelstein, who made his
fortune investing in securities, real estate and publishing,
including owning The New York Law Journal and a string of weekly
papers. The younger Finkelstein, took over The New York Law
Journal, founded The National Law Journal and put them both on the
Internet. He eventually sold the company to the Wasserstein Perella
Group for $203 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a new project, the couple hit upon what came natural
_ amassing the accoutrements of a well-cushioned life in Park
Avenue duplexes, and intermingling business with social ties.
</P>
<P>
   They founded LuxuryFinder.com, an E-commerce site that will sell
high-end merchandise like Ghurka luggage, Brioni men's accessories
and hair-care products from John Barrett of Bergdorf Goodman. It
will offer online services like an ``electronic secretary'' to
alert subscribers when the latest handbag has arrived at Fendi, and
online chats with Ms. Wang, the designer, or Sirio Maccioni, owner
of Le Cirque, who will also sell his caviar and petit-fours.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the venture _ put at $15 to $20 million by one person
familiar with the deal _ Finkelstein tapped a network of ultra-rich
New Yorkers, many of whom were eager to participate in the Internet
gold rush they'd been reading about in the financial pages, and
knew the founders of LuxuryFinder.com socially (most of them were
at the wedding).
</P>
<P>
   The investors _ whose stakes amount to six-figure pocket change
for many _ include Leonard Stern, the chairman of the Hartz
Mountain pet food and real estate empire; Allen Grubman, the
entertainment lawyer whose clients include Madonna and Michael
Jackson; Leon Black, who heads Apollo Management, one of the
country's largest private investment companies; Dixon Boardman, the
managing director of the Optima Fund, and Terry Allen Kramer, a
Broadway producer whose father was a founder of the investment firm
Allen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to bump into him, probably at a dinner party in
Southampton,'' Stern said, recalling how he and Finkelstein first
got together on the Web deal. The exact date is hard to pinpoint,
he said, because ``we populate the same world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he broke his own rule of never investing in a
friend's business. ``I asked Jimmy what he was doing,'' he said.
``It sounded good and I said, `Come down to my office and we'll
talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another investor, Fred Seegal _ he's the man who recently sold
his East Hampton beach house to Helmut Lang for $15 million _
remembered, ``Jimmy called up and said, `Here's what I'm doing,'
and I said, `Great.''' Seegal, who is the president of Wasserstein
Perella, the boutique investment bank, added, ``Jimmy is a winner.
All he had to do was call.''
</P>
<P>
   For his first venture into E-commerce, Finkelstein looked to a
Lord _ Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a grandson of Winston
Churchill _ to conduct chat sessions on life at Blenheim Palace. An
online concierge will make those hard-to-get reservations at the
Ritz in Paris. A calendar will show all the right events _ Ascot,
the Hamptons Classic, Wimbledon, the Deauville season.
</P>
<P>
   And a taste council, including a former buyer from Bergdorf's
and two magazine editors, will provide online editorial features
and the answers to questions to help educate the newly wealthy on
what the moneyed class buys. ``There are all these people out there
who have made all this money and don't know what the best sheet is
or what the best cufflinks are,'' said Ms. Gross, who intends to
help them learn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gross, who is in her late 30s, is sometimes known to friends
as Glamala for her high-maintenance blonde hair, eye-popping
Verdura engagement ring and love of the latest designer must-haves.
</P>
<P>
   She and her taste council will decide which retailers have the
cachet to make it onto the Web site. ``Coach is too low-end,'' she
said, naming one example. ``We're more about Fendi.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Dannenberg, who worked with Ms. Gross at Manhattan File,
is running around with her to old retail contacts and designers to
get them to buy advertising or offer goods online.
</P>
<P>
   They've lined up Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia and Angela
Cummings, whose cufflinks and jewelry, respectively, are sold at
Bergdorf's. The Gym Source will sell home-exercise equipment
starting at $10,000, and the Web site has a warehouse of antique
furniture, valued from $5,000 to $100,000, that will be sold
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done business with Julie wherever she's been,'' said
Philip Warner, president of Asprey &AMP; Garrard of New York, the
American arm of the jewelers to the British royal family. The
company has agreed to sell its popular silver-topped vases ($150
and up) and daisy earrings ($3,000 to $4,900). Beyond that, it is
taking a wait-and-see attitude _ typical of how luxury retailers
have approached the gold-rush-fever of E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have purchased up to $100,000 sight unseen from our
catalog,'' said Warner, who is optimistic about selling on the
Internet. ``What concerns us is how our product appears and who it
sits next to. We need to be assured ourselves that it is presented
in the right way.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gross and her team have met resistance from some they've
approached, and they hired Peggy Siegal, the publicist known for
corralling a society crowd for movie premieres, to help with
introductions. ``I was brought in as a consultant to get Donna
Karan and Barry Kieselstein-Cord,'' Ms. Siegal said. ``They've got
Barry and they have a meeting with Donna.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth of online commerce _ a market projected to
grow to $41 billion in 2003 from $3 billion last year by Jupiter
Communications, an Internet researcher _ high-end retailers have
been slow to take the plunge. What is selling best on the Internet
are books, toys, airplane tickets and the bric-a-brac of E-bay.
Blue-chip brands have worried about cheapening their images and
undercutting their traditional retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, competition to bring luxury goods to the Web seems
to be brewing. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has made recent
investments in Boo.com, a sneaker and active wear source, and
Icollector, an online auctioneer, raising speculation that LVMH may
one day sell its own brands _ including Vuitton, Christian Dior and
Givenchy _ on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie is out of the bottle, the Internet is here and there
is a huge opportunity for those who can figure out selling
high-margin products,'' said Joshua Schroeter, director of
strategic planning and founder of the Center of New Media at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter figures, 65 percent of online households
earn more than $100,000 a year. ``Hence, that's why there's a
clamor to get into the luxury market,'' said Ford Cavallari, an
E-commerce specialist at Renaissance Worldwide, a Boston-based
management consulting firm. ``It's a wide-open field.''
</P>
<P>
   Next question: do people who buy private jets, like the new
10-seater that LuxuryFinder.com intends to sell for 14.5 million,
surf the Net?
</P>
<P>
   Stern, of Hartz Mountain, admitted, ``Men my age who run
businesses are in the Dark Ages, and they're proud of it. They say,
`I have my secretary print out my e-mail.' They are so rich they
can insulate themselves in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of a revolution,'' he added. Still, he
said, ``No one has been able to explain to my satisfaction where
the profit plan is.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Finkelstein and Ms. Gross' staff numbers 17,
projected to grow to 45 by they time they are up and running. In a
month, they will move into 16,000 square feet of office divided
between two sites, one on East 59th Street and the other on East
49th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have plenty of money invested and a call for more, as much
as I need,'' Finkelstein said, spreading his arms wide. ``I did
turn away a lot of people. I needed serious investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubman, the entertainment lawyer, said Finkelstein made his
pitch to him over dinner. ``I thought it was a fabulous idea and I
think he is very, very smart,'' Grubman said, admitting that he is
only just beginning to learn to use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the promotional parties will begin. They are being planned
for Los Angeles, Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y., where Finkelstein
and Ms. Gross have a new home that was just photographed for Elle
Decor.
</P>
<P>
   While Finkelstein tends to the business plan, Ms. Gross is busy
weighing the thread counts of Pratesi versus Ralph Lauren The
Estate Collection, to determine which should be approached to offer
its products on her site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first time there is an upside to my
shopping,'' she said. ``I can say, `I'm researching.' ''

UPS IS DELIVERING FOR LESS FORTUNATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's become popular for companies to put together teams of
employees to pick up trash along highways after work or build
houses for the poor over a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But not many send their managers hundreds of miles away to spend
a month at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The United Parcel Service has a community internship program
that sends about 50 managers each year to four cities so they can
get a first-hand view of the problems some of their customers and
employees face.
</P>
<P>
   They go to such places as New York, Chicago, Chattanooga, Tenn.,
and McAllen, Texas, and spend their days tutoring low-income
children, touring prisons and, in McAllen, riding with the border
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drive through every neighborhood in America,'' said Don
Wofford, community relations coordinator for UPS in Atlanta. ``We
often don't know what goes on behind the four walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which started in 1968, the year the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. was assassinated, began as the company's
contribution to the civil rights movement. Since then, 1,100
managers have gone through what for many has become a life-changing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Barker, the district plant engineering manager for UPS in
Houston, recently returned from a month at St. Margaret of
Scotland, a shelter and school for low-income children on the South
Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Living in the church rectory with six other interns, Barker
cooked and served food for the poor, helped paint a homeless men's
shelter, tutored 9-year-old twins in reading and math, toured a
house for people with AIDS, and toured a drug and alcohol abuse
treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   She also observed a juvenile court case, counseled inmates at
the Cook County Jail on basic skills they will need to get jobs and
took ``her twins'' to a White Sox baseball game, buying every kind
of junk food available.
</P>

SOME STAFF COMMITTED FOREVER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was an eye-opening experience, she said, recalling how she
watched from an upstairs window at the rectory as gang members
bought and sold weapons and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're losing a whole generation of children to drugs
and violence,'' she said. There seems to be a tremendous need to
mentor these kids, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said she is planning to become a volunteer at a school
close to the UPS facility in a low-income neighborhood in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wofford said UPS hopes managers get more involved with their own
communities after finishing their internships. He said one manager
who returned took a walk around his UPS neighborhood for the first
time and, from that, organized a big food drive during the
Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Barker also said that she became more sensitive to the problems
of employees living on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   If someone calls in because a car has broken down, they may be
unable to get a ride from a spouse or take a cab, she said. ``You
take a cab and that could be meals for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOUR OF AREA IN NEED LED TO IDEA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Mallette, pastor of St. Margaret of Scotland,
said the UPS interns ``just shoot so much life into this parish.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallette said the latest group installed a water heater for a
family whose six children had just buried their mother.
</P>
<P>
   The work the UPS managers do influences the lives of many people
in the community, he said, recalling Barker's work with a teen-age
boy who was shot while sitting on a porch in his neighborhood. She
really connected with the 14-year-old, who spends 18 hours a day on
intravenous feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Several PS volunteers return on their own to help out, he said,
and one invites a child he met during his internship to his ranch
in South Dakota each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mallette first encountered the UPS program in 1968. He was
working in New York for Fordham University trying to recruit and
raise money for black, Puerto Rican and poor white children to
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with Walter Hooke, then a vice president of UPS, led
to the company making a grant of stock that generated about $70,000
a year _ enough to send 70 students to college.
</P>
<P>
   Hooke was interested in civil rights so Mallette took him around
the community. From that, the internship program was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless UPS,'' Mallette said.

THE GREATEST OF UNEASE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCLEAN, Va. _ I'm not sure what I was thinking when I decided to
fly the trapeze. In retrospect, it seems, I wasn't thinking at all.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Circus Arts Workshop, an outdoor trapeze rig here,
to meet Sam Keen, the author of ``Learning to Fly: Trapeze _
Reflections on Fear, Trust and the Joy of Letting Go,'' (Broadway
Books, 1999; $23).
</P>
<P>
   Keen is based in Sonoma, Calif., where he runs a program called
Upward Bound, teaching people to use the trapeze experience as a
mechanism to examine their own fears about life. It has been
particularly successful with abused women and recovering drug
addicts, but garden variety neurotics like me have also been able
to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The act of climbing a 35-foot ladder, grabbing the trapeze,
swinging out and, ideally, being caught by someone swinging toward
you, seems to make sense as an exercise in fear and trust. And
unlike Outward Bound, it takes only a few hours and I could plug in
my hair dryer when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Keen is 67 _ another incentive, I felt, figuring that if he can
do it, I certainly could. He first discovered the joy of letting go
at 62. He discovered more joy when Broadway Books gave him a
$500,000 advance to write ``Learning to Fly,'' envisioning it as
the next ``Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,'' the Robert
Pirsig classic.
</P>
<P>
   Circus Arts is owned by Michel Bigotti and Laurent Givry, former
instructors for Club Med, and offers classes ($30 for one, less for
a series), birthday parties and corporate events. Though Bigotti
and Givry wore shorts and jeans, Keen arrived clad in tights and
slippers.
</P>
<P>
   He looked like a bony old bird, his frame lean and spare from
years of flying. He has bright, hard blue eyes and talks about the
trapeze with the passion of a preacher, which he is, having
graduated from the Harvard Divinity School and Princeton University
with a PhD in philosophy of religion.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years he was an editor at Psychology Today, and
``Learning to Fly'' is his 14th book. His previous one, ``Fire in
the Belly'' (1991), about male identity, was on the New York Times
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   As we talked, I looked dispassionately at the trapeze rig. I do
not fear heights or flying and had no butterflies at the prospect
of the first step, simply swinging out, letting go and falling into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trapeze is a natural for dealing with fear, self-image and
trust,'' Keen said. He told the story of a woman who took four days
just to climb the ladder, who kept saying she was afraid of being
dropped. Ultimately, he maintained, she recovered memories of her
father's sexual abuse. ``One experience is a template to begin to
learn, not an instant cure for everyone's problems,'' Keen said.
``It's a choice to look at fear, panic and trust _ what to do with
it and how it relates to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen admits to being afraid himself when he flies. ``The first
level is physical, the second is performance,'' he said. ``I'll
look stupid, you'll laugh at me. But trapeze will cure you of
perfectionism. We can't hide our mistakes because they happen in
midair. Trapeze is a brief but regularly scheduled vacation from
your ego.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded good to me. A few minutes later, though, I was
convinced that Keen takes regularly scheduled vacations from
reality. He had me swing on a practice trapeze first, which hurt my
hands terribly. He and the other two men had thickly calloused
palms from years of grabbing the thickly taped rung.
</P>
<P>
   They gave me hand guards, which helped somewhat. Once I was
hanging, Keen instructed me to draw my knees to my chest, hook them
over the trapeze and hang upside down. If his face had been
anywhere near mine, I would have laughed in it.
</P>
<P>
   I told him I couldn't do that because I had no upper body
strength. He told me I didn't need any, that it was all in the
swing. Finally, he and Givry helped me do it. Back on the ground, I
was thoroughly nauseated. This time when I looked up at the rig not
a phrase of Keen's prattle about trust was left in my head. I felt
pain in my hands and fear in my heart. And everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The more hesitant I became, the brisker Keen was. Time to climb
the ladder. He seemed convinced that the moment I was airborne all
would be well. Givry secured a safety harness around my waist (I
wore a T-shirt, leggings and a pair of socks) and it was so tight I
could barely breathe, but loosening it did not seem an option.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was 35 feet up, I was markedly queasy. Keen did
not seem interested. He had me curl my toes around the edge of the
platform and pulled the trapeze toward us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thrust your hips out,'' he said, and when I did the sky
started to spin. I was about to slip right off the platform. I
gripped the rigging desperately with my left hand. ``I'm having an
anxiety attack,'' I proclaimed, finally getting Keen's attention.
But not for long. He gave me a moment to breathe, then got behind
me and pressed his knees into mine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll just step off now,'' he said and I was awash in that
sickening inevitability you get as your car is about to crash and
there is nothing you can do to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The platform dropped away. I swung out and yelled louder than
Tarzan. All around me was open air, space, rushing wind, empty,
wide, vast areas where nothing could protect me. Everyone on the
ground, including Givry, who was controlling my safety harness,
laughed. Screaming is commonplace for first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lay back,'' Givry called, when he wanted me to fall. I tried,
but the brain knows better than to lay back flat in midair. My head
jerked forward. As I fell, whiplashing onto the net, everyone
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more,'' I declared, rolling off. If that's what the most
basic step felt like, then the next one _ flying through the air by
my knees and grabbing someone else's wrists _ was entirely out of
the question. I fell onto the grass, practically hugging it. Keen
settled his long, knobby frame beside me. ``The first time is for
fear,'' he preached. ``The second time is for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   I shook my head. I didn't want to hear it. He persisted. ``What
if you stopped sex after the first time?'' he asked. I stared. What
kind of sex was he having?
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Keen fixed his ball-bearing eyes on me and I knew
I had to try it one more time. Back on the platform, I started to
negotiate. ``I'll do this now if you promise you won't make me do
it again,'' I said, sounding like a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He was noncommittal. The hell with him, I thought. Once more and
that's it. I had sweat through my clothes and still felt as if I
couldn't breathe. I felt his knees behind mine again _ a gesture
far too intimate for a stranger, I decided _ and felt the hopeless
lurching in my stomach as I lost the ground beneath me. This time I
didn't scream. But when Givry called for me to lay back, I froze. I
didn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   It took three more calls before I released, bouncing awkwardly
onto the net. This time I lay there, spent. Givry walked over,
underneath me, and talked soothingly in my ear. I tried explaining
that my hands hurt, that the strain of supporting my body weight
with them seemed impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that,'' he said. ``You're tense, you're afraid.''
Suddenly his voice seemed the most lulling thing in the world. As I
lay there, a splayed lump, I had a revelation. He was the Horse
Whisperer. And I was the horse.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when Keen approached, I gave him a ball-bearing stare
of my own. He backed off, and used his time to play peacock,
luxuriating in his flying, basking in the compliments these
professionals threw his way. So much for abandoning ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're into perfectionism,'' he told me later. ``You have to
work on your tendency to say, `I failed.' You were a lot more
scared than you thought you could be, yet you went back up a second
time in the face of your fears. That's a success.'' He made a stab
at warmth, Father Hen style. ``You were spunky,'' he said. ``You
done good.''
</P>
<P>
   All I could think of was Lou Grant telling Mary Richards:
``You've got spunk. I hate spunk.''
</P>
<P>
   I went back to my hotel and curled up in a ball on the bed.
Twenty-four hours later, after Advil, bourbon, hot showers and
massage therapy, I felt better. And I got a chance to read the
previous day's papers. This was my horoscope: ``The only thing to
fear is fear itself. How many times have you heard that? And how
many times have you put your fears behind you and plunged headlong
into the unknown? Not nearly often enough if you are a typical
Virgo. Worry less and explore more today.''
</P>
<P>
   I put it in the trash. As far as I'm concerned, worry is a
completely underrated commodity. It's free and readily available.
And you don't need hand guards. &QL;

NATO CHIEF IS NAMED EUROPEAN UNION'S FOREIGN-POLICY AND SECURITY
CZAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Javier Solana, who as secretary-general of
NATO pressed strongly for the Yugoslavia bombing campaign, was
named Friday by European Union leaders as the first foreign policy
and security czar of the union.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, 56, a former foreign minister of Spain who is also a
trained theoretical physicist, later told allied ambassadors here
that he would stay in his NATO job until the Kosovo crisis was
under control.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a meeting in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of
the 15 European Union countries decided to create a military force
for the union. In the new position, Solana is generally expected to
create a framework that will give European leaders the same ability
that they now have only within the U.S.-dominated NATO to carry out
peacekeeping and other military operations like the one in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said that in a brief meeting in Brussels on
Thursday night with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
Solana was in tears at the prospect that the NATO operation in
Kosovo might finally be on the verge of success.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters Friday that the most important thing to him
personally about the operation was the refugees' safe return.
</P>
<P>
   As a student in the repressed Spain of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco in the 1950s and '60s, Solana, an underground member of the
illegal Socialist Party, opposed the dictator. Later, as a member
of the opposition in the nascent post-Franco democracy in Spain, he
was against Spain's joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own generation was often torn between the values we were
taught and the harsh reality _ a reality that did not always
correspond to those ideals,'' he said recently. ``Today, I am
heading this alliance, and many of our generation are in positions
of responsibility. Today, we all realize how difficult it is to
translate values into policy.''

 &HT;    HILLARY CLINTON TAKES MAJOR STEP TOWARD SENATE CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took one of the
final steps Friday toward becoming a candidate for the U.S. Senate
in New York, announcing that she would form an exploratory
committee to begin raising campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July. And then
I'll spend some time _ a lot of time _ in New York listening to
people, and I'm looking forward to that,'' she said, inching closer
to becoming the first first lady to seek public office for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its historical significance, a Clinton campaign would
shake up national politics in 2000. Her candidacy would prolong the
polarizing influence of the Clinton presidency, energizing both
voters and campaign donors across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A debate is already under way as to whether her candidacy would
help or hurt Vice President Al Gore's presidential hopes and those
of House Democrats to regain a majority.
</P>
<P>
   An exploratory committee, which can raise money for staff,
polling and travel, will help Clinton avoid a brewing controversy
about her frequent trips to New York at taxpayer expense. She has
made 10 trips to New York this year, purportedly on official White
House business.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that no determination had been made on whether or when to
formally announce her candidacy, Clinton's press secretary, Marsha
Berry, said, ``This is part of what she needs to do to make a final

   Clinton's chief political operative is former White House aide
Harold Ickes, who told the Associated Press the exploratory panel

   Her announcement Friday, which appeared to be an afterthought at
the conclusion of an ABC-TV ``Good Morning America'' broadcast on

conservatives that recalled the vehement opposition her husband has
encountered throughout his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a group called Conservatives for Effective
Leadership announced the formation of a new political action
committee that would conduct direct mail and advertisement
campaigns to oppose Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has she ever introduced a piece of legislation, run a business
or even served on her local school board? The answer is no,'' said
Gary Nolan, a radio talk show host who is president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Yale-trained lawyer, worked for one of the
congressional committees involved in the Watergate investigation of
Richard Nixon in the 1970s. Prior to her husband's election as
president, she served as president of the Children's Defense Fund.
And during the Clinton presidency, she spearheaded the
administration's ill-fated health care reform measures.
</P>
<P>
   But she has never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the National Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee sent the first lady a map of New York and a letter
suggesting that she take time to ``learn about'' the state. The
letter also suggested that Florida may be a more appropriate home
for the first couple, given the president's fondness for golf.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Such responses did not surprise political experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question on the minds of a lot of New Yorkers is what does
she need this aggravation for?'' said Lee Miringoff, director of
the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, whose latest polling shows
the first lady in a neck-and-neck race with her most likely
opponent, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for the U.S. Senate, ``she will become the new
devil figure for Republican fund-raisers nationally,' said Larry
Sabato, a University of Virginia professor and author of ``Dirty
Little Secrets,'' a 1996 book about political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the first lady manages to win the New York seat, she
may help the GOP pile up enough cash to secure a couple of dozen
other Senate and House seats in anti-Clinton territory in the South
and the West,'' Sabato added.
</P>
<P>
   But no one will need the money more than Clinton herself. Some
Democratic political advisers have estimated it may take as much as
$25 million to finance a Senate race in New York. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, whose retirement has created the open seat Clinton is
pursuing, spent nearly $7 million in 1994 against token opposition.

   The New York Times plans four pages of stories on Kosovo for
Saturday, June 5.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-REAX (Washington) _ President Clinton declared
Friday that he was ``anxious to end the bombing'' in Yugoslavia,
and the Pentagon said that the 10 week air war could end as early
as Sunday if Serb military authorities begin their troop withdrawal
from Kosovo. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ After a faxed request from the
chief of Yugoslavia's armed forces for a meeting to discuss
arrangements for a pullout of all Serb forces from Kosovo, NATO on
Friday told the designated commander of its 45,000 peacekeepers to
find a place near the Serbian border for a field conference
Saturday morning on withdrawal terms. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-RECOVERY-ASSESS (Washington) _ The war in Kosovo appears to
be ending with many major issues unresolved, not least the future
of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and what the United
States and its allies ought to do about him. By R.W. Apple.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ As soon as Russia came
to agreement with NATO on the principles for a peace settlement for
Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic understood that he
had no choice but to accept the terms put in front of him, senior
Yugoslav officials said Friday. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CASUALTIES (Washington) _ By one set of casualty figures,
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia has been a extraordinary
victory for the Western alliance: No pilots were killed in combat
during more than 31,000 sorties over the past 10 weeks. But another
set of casualty figures - for Yugoslav civilians - is a reminder
that the type of high-altitude air war that the United States
prefers to fight has deadly consequences for those on the ground.
By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ How/why the military campaign is
coming to its end. By Eric Schmitt and Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA (Beijing) _ A day after Yugoslavia accepted an
international peace plan for Kosovo, China on Friday restated its
demand that NATO halt its bombing before discussions begin in the
United Nations about a peacekeeping force. But Chinese support for
the peace plan seems likely. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Washington) _ Through the war, NATO has only
warily dealt with the Kosovo Liberation Army, the only fighters on
the ground in Yugoslavia. Now with a settlement at hand, NATO is
even more wary of the emboldened rebels, who see themselves as the
emerging political and military power in a liberated Kosovo. By
Steven Lee Myers and Ian Fisher.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ Refugees try to make up their minds on what to
do. Dateline and byline to be determined.

 &HT;    HILLARY CLINTON TAKES MAJOR STEP TOWARD SENATE CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took one of the
final steps Friday toward becoming a candidate for the U.S. Senate
in New York, announcing that she would form an exploratory
committee to begin raising campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July. And then
I'll spend some time _ a lot of time _ in New York listening to
people, and I'm looking forward to that,'' she said, inching closer
to becoming the first first lady to seek public office for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its historical significance, a Clinton campaign would
shake up national politics in 2000. Her candidacy would prolong the
polarizing influence of the Clinton presidency, energizing both
voters and campaign donors across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A debate is already under way as to whether her candidacy would
help or hurt Vice President Al Gore's presidential hopes and those
of House Democrats to regain a majority.
</P>
<P>
   An exploratory committee, which can raise money for staff,
polling and travel, will help Clinton avoid a brewing controversy
about her frequent trips to New York at taxpayer expense. She has
made 10 trips to New York this year, purportedly on official White
House business.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that no determination had been made on whether or when to
formally announce her candidacy, Clinton's press secretary, Marsha
Berry, said, ``This is part of what she needs to do to make a final
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief political operative is former White House aide
Harold Ickes, who told the Associated Press the exploratory panel
was needed because ``You can't be sort of a wandering minstrel. She
herself likes structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also receiving informal advice from James Carville,
the political mastermind of her husband's 1992 presidential victory
and the president's staunchest defender during his impeachment and
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Her announcement Friday, which appeared to be an afterthought at
the conclusion of an ABC-TV ``Good Morning America'' broadcast on
youth violence, immediately triggered a response from political
conservatives that recalled the vehement opposition her husband has
encountered throughout his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, a group called Conservatives for Effective
Leadership announced the formation of a new political action
committee that would conduct direct mail and advertisement
campaigns to oppose Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has she ever introduced a piece of legislation, run a business
or even served on her local school board? The answer is no,'' said
Gary Nolan, a radio talk show host who is president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Yale-trained lawyer, worked for one of the
congressional committees involved in the Watergate investigation of
Richard Nixon in the 1970s. Prior to her husband's election as
president, she served as president of the Children's Defense Fund.

SPEEDING UP A PASSPORT (BEFORE PANIC SETS IN)

graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Schwarz, a New York real estate executive, was at a
meeting in Atlantic City last month when he got the call. His
office wanted him in Tokyo that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwarz had a problem. On his last trip to Japan,
immigration officials there had told him that his passport, with
his picture about to fall off, was too badly damaged for them to
honor again. Now he needed a replacement. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   For help, he did what many others in similar circumstances do _
he turned to an expediter, one of a handful of companies in New
York and other big cities that make a business of quickly getting
passports and visas for their clients. With global business
booming, many corporations rely on these firms, but so do a good
many people traveling on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're paying for somebody to walk your documents through the
system,'' said John M. Pile, an executive for a private
international health organization in New York who lost his passport
just before a trip to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says its passport offices in New York and a
dozen other cities can often deliver a new passport or a renewal
within a day, given proof of urgency like an airline ticket or
printed itinerary showing an immediate departure.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of work load,'' said Maria Rudensky, a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, people who need passports in a day or so are often
more willing to spend extra money than to wait long hours at the
passport office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It chews up your day,'' said George Brokaw, a New York
investment banker. ``If six hours of your time is worth more than
$150, you're going to be prepared to use one of these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, facing the order to get to Japan, decided to take no
chances. He went directly to one of the expediters. They usually
charge about $150 for guaranteed same-day delivery of a new
passport or renewal. That's on top of the passport agency's $35 for
rush service, along with $60 for a new passport or $40 for a
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are at the passport offices every day, the
professional bureaucracy-busters know the procedures cold. And they
become friendly faces to agency clerks, who usually deal with
harried, sometimes demanding, strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people walk in with an attitude that they're entitled
to a passport,'' said Mark Schimel of It's Easy, an expediting
service in Manhattan with 20 years' experience in speeding along
passports. ``But if they can't prove their citizenship and identity
to the agent's satisfaction, they just don't get the passport. It
happens every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The expediters rely on attention to detail and, often, on the
ability to jump to the head of the line. At many passport offices
around the country, local directors give the expediters regular
daily appointments at which the agency can process 15 percent or 20
passports at a crack. The applications are usually flawless. ``They
help us to be more efficient,'' Ms. Rudensky said.
</P>
<P>
   At the passport office in lower Manhattan, Schwarz, with Schimel
at his side, stepped up to a bulletproof window and handed over his
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk took one look at Schwarz's passport and asked to see
his birth certificate, which, as usual, he was not carrying. For a
moment, the Japan trip hung in suspension. Then Schimel said, ``We
want to do a PFM.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk smiled. She slid a form toward Schwarz, asked to see
his driver's license and disappeared into another room, where she
punched his name into the Passport Files Miniaturization system.
</P>
<P>
   The system confirmed that Schwarz held a valid passport. He paid
$15 more for the extra steps, and that afternoon a messenger sent
by It's Easy delivered the passport to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw travels so much that he carries his passport every day.
Yet he failed to notice until the day before he was scheduled to
fly to London this spring that it had expired. He had two new
photographs taken that afternoon and went the next morning to the
passport agency with Schimel to sign his application. He picked up
his new passport at It's Easy on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Christman, 17, a model, was recently offered his first
overseas photo shoot, from Elle magazine, on the Spanish island of
Ibiza. But he had never been out of the country. His agency, Next
Models, called It's Easy on a Thursday, and his passport arrived
the next day at his home in Pelham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers say bureaucratic confusion and rudeness drive
them to the expediters. A New Jersey writer, headed for Brazil,
said someone in the New York passport office hung up on her when
she called for an appointment. The writer, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, then called an automated number and found the tape
inaudible. The expediters got the job done in a day.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan leather distributor discovered when he tried to
board a flight to Italy that his passport had expired. When he went
to the passport agency, he said, there was no record of the
appointment he had made and the clerks were ``very unfriendly and
very rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rudensky acknowledged that service is sometimes less than
perfect, but, she said, ``That's certainly not our aim, and we
would expect that those incidents are very few.''
</P>
<P>
   Many expediters also deal with driver's licenses or other
documents. But their passport clients are among the most grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, the investment banker, put the expediting business into
Wall Street terms. ``What you're paying for,'' he said, ``is the
elimination of uncertainty.''

MORE WEALTH, MORE STATELY MANSIONS

 (Attn: Tenn., Calif., N.Y.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of percentage of homes over $1 million is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The beige, three-story mansion fills a one-acre lot on Clover
Street in Memphis. Roof turrets, tall windows, columns that frame
the front door at the head of a majestic, sloping driveway all
heighten the impression of a palace incongruously placed in an
ordinary suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch house next door seems, by comparison, like a shack. It
is empty, however, soon to be torn down so that another mansion can
rise. And a neighborhood of small homes on large leafy lots
gradually becomes a neighborhood of million-dollar mansions cheek
by jowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such houses are conspicuous proof that a family has achieved a
level of wealth way beyond its physical needs,'' says Kenneth
Rosen, chairman of the Fischer Center for Real Estate at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``A mansion, more than luxury
cars or anything else, shows everyone in the community that you are
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy doctor and his family recently moved into this
particular six-bedroom brick mansion, with its cathedral ceilings,
balconies, stately fireplaces and elegant rooms. But there are many
Clover Streets springing up in the United States today, in new
suburbs as well as in older ones where the demand for trophy
mansions not too far from downtown has made the land more valuable
without a home than with one.
</P>
<P>
   So the homes are bought for the land by America's growing
population of multimillionaires, who replace the existing houses
with mansions. ``In-fill,'' it is called in Memphis, and
``teardown'' in the Northeast. In the San Francisco area, it is
known as the ``scraper'' phenomenon _ you buy a house, scrape it
off the lot and build a bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   The million-dollar mansion _ or multimillion-dollar mansion, in
some cities _is emerging as a high-profile badge of the gilded late
1990s, not just in the traditional pockets of wealth, but also in
Middle American cities like Memphis where such homes had been rare.
</P>
<P>
   They are emblematic of an economic divide: The wealth generated
in the boom that began in late 1995, while touching many people,
has gone disproportionately and in huge quantities to the richest 5
percent of the nation's households. They have pocketed most of the
gain from the stock market run-up, wich has created thousands of
multimillionaires overnight. And they have conspicuously channeled
a big chunk of their gains into mansions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been stock market run-ups in the past, of course, and
mansions to show for it. But not since the 1920s, Rosen said, has
mansion-building been as widespread as it is today. So much so that
in some suburbs _ Scarsdale, N.Y., and Westport, Conn., for example
_ restrictions have been placed on the teardown phenomenon, or are
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   One survey of large metropolitan areas turned up 9,257 new and
existing homes that were sold for $1 million or more last year, up
from 3,427 in 1996. And that did not count all the mansions
custom-built by the families that occupy them.
</P>
<P>
   Just how skewed is wealth creation in the late 1990s? And how
many rich people have emerged to create such a historic surge in
mansions?
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist
who tracks the distribution of wealth in the United States, found
that 4.1 million of the nation's 102 million households had a net
worth of $1 million or more last year. That compares with 3 million
such households out of 99 million in 1995, when the stock market
really began to gain steam.
</P>
<P>
   (Net worth is calculated by first totaling a household's cash
savings, the market value of its stocks and bonds and the value of
a house and other holdings _ then subtracting all the debt,
including mortgage debt.)
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in history has there been such a rapid minting of rich
people, Wolff said. While the number of American households rose by
3 percent over the three-year period, the number of million-dollar
households jumped 36.6 percent. Make the wealth cutoff $10 million
or more, and 275,000 households qualified in 1998, up from 190,000
in 1995, a 44.7 percent increase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From his analysis of Federal Reserve data, Wolff gleans another
insight: While net worth grew rapidly for the richest 10 percent of
the nation's households in recent years, the remaining 90 percent
lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is debt,'' he explained, referring to the source of
so much consumer spending and home buying in recent years. ``The
middle class in particular has mortgaged itself to death,
basically.''
</P>
<P>
   What if wealth had somehow been distributed more evenly _ and
income, too, for that matter? Would there have been so many
mansions? Probably not. A mansion that simulates a palace, in which
a few family members rattle around in too many rooms, makes an
unequivocal statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said Richard Sennett, a New York University
sociologist, ``understands this prize that only a few can afford.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other day at Mud Honey, a hair salon on Sullivan
Street that caters to a rock 'n' roll clientele, the five members
of the Toilet Boys, whom their manager likes to call ``gorgeous
East Village gutter trash,'' were getting their hair trimmed and
touched up.
</P>
<P>
   After touring in Canada to promote an upcoming CD, ``Sinners and
Saints'' (Cold Front), the long nights in smoky clubs had taken
their toll on Miss Guy, the cross-dressing lead singer. His hair
was an insipid shade of tobacco yellow instead of his signature
platinum blond.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Matula, Mud Honey's owner and chief stylist, applied
a toner to Miss Guy's hair, the band's 6-foot-6 guitarist, Sean _
who recently stripped naked on the Howard Stern show and whose
stage act includes fire breathing _ explained why the Toilet Boys,
a glam-rock outfit, are regulars at the salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate people that cut hair uptight, and here they don't give
uptight hair,'' Sean (please, no last name) said, patting the
matted orange-y tufts sprouting from the top of his head and
stroking the stringy, brunette wisps framing his face, a hairdo
that looked more animal than human.
</P>
<P>
   Matula, 37, who favors an Elvis-style pompadour himself, agreed:
``We're not from the Vidal Sassoon school of styling,'' he said,
adding that at a certain kind of uptown salon, ``you get attitude
from the receptionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mud Honey is full of attitude, too. But instead of
snootiness and pampering _ there are no glasses of chilled
sparkling water with lemon wedges _ the salon proudly offers
service with a snarl.
</P>
<P>
   ```You get what you get and you get out'' is our motto,'' Matula
said with a grin. ``If you're needy and demanding, it's not about a
haircut, it's about a psychiatrist. If you don't shut your trap,
we'll throw you out onto the sidewalk with wet hair and half a
haircut, and your bags will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   At $50 to $60 a haircut, and $60 to $120 for hair color, Mud
Honey doesn't charge uptown prices. The decor, which is enlivened
by black rubber flooring, S &AMP; M devices dangling from the ceiling
and hair dryers meant to resemble electric chairs, has more in
common with a dominatrix's chamber than a flower-filled beauty
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Matula and the other staff members are indistinguishable from
their clientele, favoring tattoos, piercings and cigarettes. ``I
wanted the image of the salon to be Frankenstein meets the Barber
of Seville,'' Matula said, pointing out a tray of surgical
instruments lying side by side with hair scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike publicity-minded hairdressers who name-drop at every
opportunity, Matula is tight-lipped about his clientele. ``I don't
ever try to profit off their names,'' he said. ``I think it's tacky
that salons do that to further their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might mean that Mud Honey has no celebrity clients to
speak of. It does, however, have a following among downtown
musicians and artists, developed over 11 years. This month, Matula
plans to open another branch on Bond Street, which, at 1,200 square
feet, is double the size. The new space will have a Fu Manchu vibe,
inspired by 1970s Bruce Lee films, he promised.
</P>
<P>
   As Matula was adding some last-minute bleach to Miss Guy's dark
roots, I impulsively asked for a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you look too newscaster-y,'' he replied, frowning at my
chin-length bob. ``You need some edge.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sliced jagged chunks out of my wet hair and fringed the
ends with his scissors, Mr. Matula kept up a steady patter of
hairdresser chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are you into?'' he asked, and without waiting for an
answer added: ``My hobby is serial killers. I have John Wayne
Gacy's painting of Elvis and the receipt from the freezer Jeffrey
Dahmer bought at Sears. I have every book ever written about serial
killers. Do you want to borrow any?''
</P>
<P>
   I politely declined. He moved on to another favorite topic,
Jocelyne Wildenstein, whom he admired despite her multiple plastic
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't she a plastic-surgery candidate's nightmare? I asked,
growing alarmed at my reflection. I was calculating the weeks it
would take for my hacked-up coiffure to grow out.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Jocelyne Wildenstein is eccentric,'' Matula said. ``That's
what's cool about her. She's rock 'n' roll without even knowing
it.''

SENATE TO TACKLE SOCIAL SECURITY LOCK BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they return this week from a 10-day recess,
Senate Republican leaders are preparing to take up a bill creating
a Social Security ``lockbox'' _ a procedure to make it difficult
for lawmakers to spend the Social Security surplus funded by
payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House passed lockbox legislation by an
overwhelming bipartisan vote of 416-12. The House version would
block any bill that draws money from the surplus unless at least
218 House members or 60 senators vote for a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to protect the surplus, projected at $1.8 trillion over
the next decade, is proving to be the Republicans' main calling
card in their battle with Democrats to seize the high ground on
preserving Social Security for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have charged that the lockbox
is a gimmick with too many loopholes to be effective. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin has vowed to recommend a presidential veto,
saying the lockbox could leave policymakers unable to combat a
recession by refinancing debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security surplus represents the accumulated excess
amount of payroll-tax revenue funneled into the U.S. treasury and
not paid out in benefits. It represents a big chunk of the current
total budget surplus. This year's payroll-tax surplus, including
interest, is pegged at $886.8 billion, according to Social Security
Administration figures.
</P>
<P>
   As the Social Security tax money accumulates, the government
issues U.S. treasury bonds and uses the cash to pay its bills.
Thus, the Social Security surplus is an integral part of the
congressional budgeting process.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate lockbox proposal _ written by GOP Sens. Spencer
Abraham, of Michigan, John Ashcroft of Missouri and Pete Domenici
of New Mexico _ parallels the House version passed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other Republican
leaders consider the lockbox a priority as the Memorial Day recess
ends, an aide to Lott said Friday. Other top issues include the Y2K
computer problem and a measure authorizing funds for the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who is seeking reelection in 2000 and faces a challenge
for Rep. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said Michigan voters ``have made
it very clear to me that they expect us to take those Social
Security dollars and use them exclusively to fix the broken Social
Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the lockbox may far outweigh any practical
effect it would have on Social Security. Dire predictions of
bankruptcy and prescriptions for fixing the 64-year-old federal
old-age pension benefit have been a fixture on the campaign circuit
in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With the 77-million-member baby boom generation born between
1946 and 1964 set to begin retiring in 2011, the Social Security
trust fund will not be able to pay full benefits starting in 2034,
according to current estimates.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed spending 62 percent of the total
surplus to bolster Social Security and having the government invest
15 percent of the surplus in the stock market. Congressional
Republicans agree in principle on the 62-percent plan but, for the
remainder of the surplus, prefer to rely heavily on private
investment accounts, giving beneficiaries maximum control over
them.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides so far apart, substantial Social Security reform
appears dead at least for this year. But the lockbox plan has
surfaced as an alternative stop-gap measure enabling Republicans to
tell voters that saving Social Security is not just a Democratic
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Republicans hope the lockbox inoculates them against
Democratic charges that the GOP favors tax cuts for the wealthy at
the expense of Social Security's future soundness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lockbox proposal in the House drew 198 Democratic votes
out of a possible 211 _ a measure of Democratic wariness over the
prospect of appearing opposed to any Social Security measure in GOP
campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who voted for the lockbox was Abraham's challenger,
Stabenow. But she voiced strong reservations about the measure.
``It's not a box and it's not locked,'' Stabenow said after the
House vote.
</P>
<P>
   She echoed Clinton and other Democrats in calling for a
moratorium on spending any of the entire surplus _ estimated at
$4.4 trillion over the next 15 years _ until lawmakers agree to a
permanent fix for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic critics of the lockbox point to such loopholes
as one that allows an exemption for any legislation that deals with
``Social Security reform'' or ``Medicare reform.'' That, the
critics say, would allow creative legislation writers to claim
their funding proposals come under those headings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they say, Senate rules already on the books set up many of
the same procedural hurdles against domestic ``emergency'' spending
that would dip into the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, the House Rules Committee routinely ignores
objections from lawmakers that the House has not obeyed its own
rules. It could do the same when confronted with an objection that
a spending bill would eat up part of the surplus, they add.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, called the lockbox ``the No. 1
legislative fraud of the year.'' Yet Obey voted for the measure in
the House last month.
</P>
<P>
   One critic quipped that instead of ``putting the Social Security
surplus into a lockbox, we should remove politicians' political
courage from it.'' The critic, Richard Thau, executive director of
Third Millennium, said, ``This way we can get started with real
Social Security reform.'' Third Millennium is a group lobbying on
behalf of ``Generation X,'' those born between 1964 and 1980 who
will be in their prime working years as the baby boom generation
retires.

COMMANDER OF PEACEKEEPERS TO MEET WITH LEADER OF YUGOSLAVIA'S
FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ After a faxed request from the chief of
Yugoslavia's armed forces to discuss arrangements for a pullout of
all Serbian forces from Kosovo, NATO said Friday that the
designated commander of its 45,000 peacekeepers would meet the
Yugoslavs Saturday morning on the border of Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, officials said, the allied officer, Lt. Gen.
Michael Jackson of Britain, who commands 16,000 British, French and
German troops already in Macedonia, planned to work out
arrangements with Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav chief of
staff, which would permit the 40,000 Serbian army, police and
paramilitary troops in Kosovo to start leaving by designated routes
on the weekend, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson and Ojdanic agree on a schedule and ways to verify
the pullout, allied diplomats said, NATO ambassadors in Brussels
could order a temporary halt in the bombing as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are not there yet,'' warned NATO's spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea. ``Until such time as we see concrete implementation, facts on
the ground, the air operations will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the allied military command, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz
said allied planes had flown 610 missions overnight and were
continuing to bomb targets Friday all over Yugoslavia, but
noticeably not in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no signs of preparation for withdrawal up to now,''
Jertz said, citing Serbian operations against ethnic Albanian
rebels near Mount Pastrik, on the Albanian border. ``However
movement of Serb forces has generally diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Yugoslav forces also launched three surface-to-air
missiles at allied planes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the alliance was at pains to give the impression that the
bombing would continue with undiminished intensity until the Serbs
began pulling out, some diplomats said Gen. Wesley Clark, the
American supreme allied commander, was now under instructions to
avoid targets with a high risk of causing civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint of this sort would deprive President Slobodan
Milosevic of a pretext to renege on commitments he gave European
and Russian mediators in Belgrade on Thursday. Milosevic promised
to stop his attacks in Kosovo, pull out, let nearly a 1.5 million
refugees return to their shattered homes and allow an international
force, made up substantially of NATO troops, into the province.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the foreign ministers
of Russia, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan are to
meet in Germany on Sunday and could approve wording of a U.N.
Security Council resolution authorizing the allied force and a
temporary international civil administration for Kosovo, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to ministers of the European members of the group worked
on the wording overnight at a European Union summit meeting in
Cologne, and German officials said Gunter Pleuger of the Foreign
Ministry took the draft to Moscow Friday and would take it to China
on Sunday. China, like Russia, Britain, the United States and
France, is a permanent member of the Security Council and has veto
power over its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials hope that Beijing is no longer so rankled over
the mistaken bombing of its embassy in Belgrade that it would block
such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the allied force would be expected to disarm the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, which agreed to demobilize if there was an
internationally supervised peace agreement. The rebels signed one
such agreement in Paris on March 14, but that agreement, negotiated
last winter at Rambouillet castle outside Paris, collapsed when
Milosevic refused to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader bowed to NATO's demands on Thursday after
the Russian mediator, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
and the European Union's negotiator, President Martti Ahtisaari of
Finland, made clear that the allies would keep bombing until he
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Jackson's headquarters in Skopje, the Macedonian
capital, was now on 24 hours' alert to be ready to move its 50
officers and supporting staff members into Kosovo if the Serbs
started to withdraw. NATO troops could start moving in within 72
hours of the beginning of the withdrawal, other officials said, and
so could any refugees who wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has received pledges from more than 30 countries for a
total of 47,868 troops for the Kosovo force, but that number does
not include any Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the allies hoped to begin discussions with Russian
officials soon on arrangements that would let Russian troops join
the mission, perhaps under command arrangements like the ones they
have with the NATO-led force in Bosnia, where their commander works
under an American officer and has direct links with Clark's staff
in Belgium.

CITIZEN SUITS, ONCE A WEAPON AGAINST POLLUTERS, ARE LOSING THEIR
POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROEBUCK, S.C. _ A quarter century after Congress gave citizens
broad powers to enforce environmental laws through private
lawsuits, judges across the country are cutting back so sharply on
those suits that environmental groups have lost much of their power
in court, legal experts on both sides of the issue say.
</P>
<P>
   Rulings from the Supreme Court and judges across the country in
recent years have limited when citizens and environmental
organizations can sue to punish violators of pollution laws. The
trend, some legal experts say, represents one of the least noted
but most profound setbacks for the environmental movement in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Americans could enforce environmental laws through
``citizen suits'' was one of the bedrock principles of the sweeping
antipollution laws that were passed in the heyday of the
environmental movement. Congressional sponsors in the early 1970s
said regulators often became too close to the industries they
regulated, and lacked the aggressiveness that concerned individuals
would bring to the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Since the laws were passed, hundreds of citizen suits have been
filed by environmental groups across the country, bringing millions
of dollars in penalties to the government and scores of court
orders to stop pollution. Environmentalists credit the suits with
helping limit air pollution in the Tennessee Valley and cleaning up
waterways from Santa Monica Bay on the West Coast to Chesapeake Bay
on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, 25 years later, it is harder and harder for those citizen
suits to get into court,'' said John D. Echeverria, director of the
Environmental Policy Project at Georgetown University Law Center in
Washington. ``In effect, the courts are invalidating congressional
provisions granting citizens the right to enforce the environmental
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional civil suits by people seeking damages to be
paid to them personally, the citizen suit provisions of the Clean
Water Act, the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws
authorized people to be ``private attorneys general'' to protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The laws permit citizens to, in essence, stand in for the
Environmental Protection Agency seeking injunctions to stop
pollution and penalties from polluters to be paid to the U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Under these laws, it did not matter whether the plaintiff was
physically harmed. For years, courts said it was enough, for
instance, for a bird watcher to complain that pollution would
damage wetlands he used recreationally. But in recent years
conservative judges have been saying that, even though the laws
gave citizens the power to sue, many of the citizens who actually
filed suits did not have enough of a stake in particular
controversies to satisfy the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have gradually increased the legal tests for when
such suits are permitted, often relying on a requirement in the
Constitution that courts should resolve suits only when there are
``cases'' and ``controversies.'' That requirement has long been
interpreted as giving people legal standing to bring suits only
when a plaintiff has a stake in a real dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for many businesses say the suits have given
environmentalists the power to harass industry with the threat of
large penalty assessments for highly technical violations of the
environmental laws when the citizens had no real interest. Critics
say environmentalists have used the suits to push the courts toward
what they see as unwarranted activism.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of course has drawn little public notice. It has
occurred gradually, but has been accelerating lately and influenced
by a series of Supreme Court decisions since 1990 written by
Justice Antonin Scalia. Some environmentalists now say a law review
article he wrote before he was appointed to the court was a
blueprint for erosion of the environmental laws. It called for
limitations on when citizen suits would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The latest case on the issue, which began here in the Piedmont
section of South Carolina, will be considered by the justices this
fall. Some experts say the case could bring the most far reaching
test of the citizen suits yet.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a hazardous waste incinerator that released
mercury into the North Tyger River here. The incinerator was
assessed a penalty of $405,800 by a federal district judge in
Columbia, Joseph F. Anderson, Jr., who found that Laidlaw had
violated its permit limiting the amount of mercury it could release
489 times. Anderson found that the permit limits on Laidlaw's
release of mercury were low and concluded there had been no harm to
the environment, but he assessed the fine because the company had
released mercury in excess of the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned
the ruling, noting that the incinerator owner had stopped releasing
excess mercury after the suit was filed. The court said the fact
that any pollution had ceased meant the citizens had no injury that
should be redressed by the courts. Penalties paid to the
government, the appeals decision said, ``cannot redress any injury
suffered by a citizen plaintiff.'' Environmentalists say such
decisions give industry a ``license to pollute'' because all
managers must do to avoid paying penalties is stop polluting after
they have been caught. But the company involved, Laidlaw
Environmental Services, says the decision exposed the absurdity of
companies spending years in court battles over technical violations
that have long since ended. The incinerator here is no longer
operating.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these lawsuits are brought without ascertaining
whether there's a serious environmental problem, and this is a
classic case,'' said Donald A. Cockrill, a Greenville, S.C. lawyer
for Laidlaw.
</P>
<P>
   But people who live here say they worried for years about acrid
or supersweet odors from the site, and chemicals in the North
Tyger. Some of them say the appeals court ruling meant that
ordinary Americans lost their voice in environmental battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people who live in these places cannot have a say in what's
going on, then everything and everybody in this country is in
trouble,'' said Judy Pruitt, a resident here who fought the
incinerator for years.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives say the trend of limiting environmental suits
is a needed correction after years of what they say amounted to
blackmail in suits against businesses. M. Reed Hopper, an
environmental law specialist at the conservative Pacific Legal
Foundation, said, courts have grown hostile to what he called legal
``terrorism'' in the citizen suits. ``In some cases the citizen
suits are putting a small business at risk of a multimillion dollar
judgment for a technical violation,'' Hopper said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1990, the Supreme Court has restricted the
environmental suits. Federal trial and appeals courts across the
country have extended those decisions. Rulings in Texas,
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, California and other states have
imposed various limits on the suits and, in some cases, dismissed
them entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges have said the citizen suit provisions improperly
expand the role of the courts. ``The federal judiciary is not a
back-seat Congress nor some sort of super-agency,'' David B.
Sentelle, a conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, said in a majority opinion in a suit
involving wetlands pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming academic article on the increasing hurdles to
citizen suits, Professor Echeverria and a colleague, Jon T.
Zeidler, say the erosion of the citizen suits has occurred in such
``small, almost imperceptible increments'' that even many
environmentalists have not noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   The article, in The Environmental Law Forum this summer, argues,
however, that Justice Scalia laid down what amounted to a plan for
the change in a law review article he wrote in 1983, three years
before he was appointed to the Supreme Court. In the article in the
Suffolk University Law Review, Scalia described ``the judiciary's
long love affair with environmental litigation.'' He suggested that
the constitutional cases-and-controversies requirement meant courts
should screen out more citizen suits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the article, he talked about one of the first modern
environmental suits, in 1971, in which a liberal Judge, Skelly
Wright, had said that the goal of the new pollution suits was to
assure that important congressional intentions to reduce pollution
not be ``lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his article a dozen years later, Judge Scalia asked whether
his proposal meant that such goals ``can be lost or misdirected'' ?
He answered his own question: ``Of  &UR; course &LR;  it does,'' he wrote,
``and a good thing too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in the case here, the appeals court reversed the
penalty saying that, since the mercury discharges had ended,
penalties ``cannot redress any injury suffered by a citizen
plaintiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what environmental lawyers say was a special blow to
citizen suits, the court said that the law firm representing the
plaintiffs could not recover any attorneys fees. Lawyers' fees,
environmental activists say, have been a powerful weapon against
polluters. Environmental law firms have used assessments paid by
polluters to finance later suits against other polluters, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys fees are permitted to the winners of some suits under
the environmental laws. In the case here involving the incinerator,
the appeals judges said, the lawyers were entitled to nothing
because they had not won their case.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Smith Pravlik, a Washington lawyer for the citizens'
groups here, said the ruling was part of the trend undermining the
power of citizens in environmental suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to close the courthouse doors,'' she said.
``It means fewer and fewer cases will be brought and you will have
more and more environmental problems because the government cannot
_ and in some instances will not _ pick up the slack.''

`CITY' RETURNS WITH ITS SMART, SEXY ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were ever a series I expected to be about as
emotionally deep as something plucked from an adult video-store
shelf, it's ``Sex and the City.'' Airing on HBO, rated for ``mature
audiences'' and offering the premise that good men and good sex
aren't hard to find but a combination of the two is darn near
impossible, this overheated little series is hilarious AND
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is surprising, because when ``Sex and the City''
quietly debuted last June, the most interesting thing to flow out
of pre-series interviews with marquee star Sarah Jessica Parker and
producer/writer Darren Star was Parker's refusal to bare her
breasts and utter certain four-letter obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   No-nudity and -profanity clauses aside, Star managed to heat up
this talky series over its run of a dozen episodes; he was rewarded
with a second season of 18 more episodes that gets under way at 8
p.m. CDT Sunday. And he did it without ``Sex and the City'' turning
into soft porn.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Star has already shown an uncanny ability to
create television that makes you reach for a smoke afterward. The
key to his successes with ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills,
90210'' was their increasing procession of back-stabbing acts
generated by sex and greed _ shrewdly combined with the gorgeous
landscape offered by perfectly chiseled stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' offers its share of pretty faces (and as a
bonus, bare breasts and male biceps from time to time), but by
focusing tightly on four thirtysomething women performing the
dating ritual in Manhattan, the series has become adventurous,
vulnerable, smart, and, due to its spicy, frank talk, disarmingly
honest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the series' most noteworthy accomplishment is its
ability to remain a social satire while offering a perversely
poignant world inhabited by professional but cynical women who've
reached the conclusion that if you can't get married, at least have
fun. (Read: Have sex and don't care whether he calls later.)
</P>
<P>
   The women chatter constantly and candidly about sex,
relationships (''Relationships are built on the foundation of lies
and mutually acceptable illusions'') and more sex (''Talking dirty?
Sex is not the time to chat!'') while prowling the modish clubs,
party circuit and weekend getaways of the rich and pampered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' should be praised for its idiosyncratic yet
canny casting. Parker, 33, is splendid as Carrie Bradshaw, a
columnist who chronicles the mating habits of single New Yorkers,
sharing her column prose via voice-over narration. She portrays
Bradshaw with, alternately, warmth and iciness _ like a real person
who has good days and bad-hair days. (Bradshaw's adventures are
based on New York columnist Candace Bushnell's cynical tales of
lust and dating games.)
</P>
<P>
   The others, also in their 30s, are just as fitting. Cynthia
Nixon, the terrific Broadway actress, is Miranda, a corporate
lawyer who is no-nonsense, sexually astute and perhaps the group's
biggest cynic. Kim Cattrall is public relations executive Samantha,
a lusty socialite wannabe unable to commit. Kristin Davis, lifted
from ``Melrose Place'' just in time, is art dealer Charlotte, the
virginal optimist who replaces her latest with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   When I talk to female friends who consider ``Sex and the City''
water-cooler TV, what they most appreciate is how the gender roles
have been transformed. The women are in control, and every scene is
about what they want and need. Men are objectified, their
significance downplayed. The guys don't even have names _ only
clues for quick and easy reference. ``Mr. Marvelous,'' ``Groovy
Guy,'' ``Artist Guy,'' ``New Yankee'' and ``Spring Roll Guy,'' whom
Miranda so names because she meets him at a Vietnamese food stand
in front of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The most defined male character goes by simply ``Mr. Big,'' a
rich power broker played by Chris Noth. The sexual relationship
between the too-smooth Mr. Big and Bradshaw has had a grounding
effect on the series, and it manifests nicely in the first two
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's installment explores break-up rules, which to
Charlotte are quite simple: ``It takes half the total time you went
out with someone to get over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I side with the lovesick Bradshaw, who has severed
ties with Mr. Big and feels miserable. Emotions don't come with
timers. Episode writer Michael Patrick King, who is also one of the
executive producers, agrees; Bradshaw has a tough time even when
dating the latest addition to the New York Yankees. (Thus, ``The
New Yankee.'')
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has experienced lost love will connect with
Bradshaw's narration that the place where the two of you spent time
becomes ``a deserted battlefield loaded with emotional land
mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants, streets, your own bedroom. ``Be careful where you
step,'' Bradshaw warns, ``you can be blown to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say that ``Sex and the City'' is vindication for Star,
whose prime-time soap ``Central Park West'' died a painful death on
CBS after the network brought him in to attract a younger
demographic. He says CBS changed its mind (CBS simply says the
viewers never showed) and asked him to retool the series, adding
older characters and shifting dialogue to sound more like
``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of Bushnell's book will notice that Star doesn't stray
much from it, lifting specific character names and lines of
dialogue. Still, it's ironic that Star is being credited for a
series that captures the inner emotions and girlspeak of women,
independent and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   To ``Sex and the City,'' two things are clear:
</P>
<P>
   One should never compromise one's heart.
</P>
<P>
   And men come and go, but you always have your girlfriends.
</P>

MAZDA PICKUP IS REALLY A FORD UNDERNEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Mazda's strengths in the U.S. market has long been its
well-built, long-lasting, B-series pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But because of its alliance with Ford Motor Co., which owns
controlling interest in the Japanese automaker, Mazda no longer
builds pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, today's line of Mazda B-series pickups are Ford Rangers
underneath. Mazda gets to put its signature on the vehicles by
making cosmetic changes in the exterior and interior designs, and
offer special option packages not available in the Ranger lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda truck fans _ which include me _ bemoan the fact that these
new B-series pickups aren't Mazdas, and we miss the quality and
durability that were hallmarks of the true Mazda products.
</P>
<P>
   Ford makes a good compact truck, too. So it's not necessarily a
bad thing that Mazda chose to exit the truck manufacturing
business.
</P>
<P>
   And this week's test drive _ the Mazda B-4000 Troy Lee Designs
four-door, extended-cab, four-wheel-drive pickup (base price
$23,485 plus $510 transportation) _ is different enough from a
Ranger that many people might not
</P>
<P>
   realize that it is a Ford underneath.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that until Mazda brought me this truck to drive,
I had never heard of Troy Lee or his designs. I thought perhaps he
was that kung fu guy, but then I realized that was Bruce Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Lee, according to the Mazda press information, designs
custom-painted helmets for motocross racers, and someone at Mazda
decided that it might be a good idea to allow him to jazz up a
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda put the original Troy Lee design on a Ranger-clone pickup
for the 1997-98 auto show circuit, then decided to produce three
production models with his signature for the 1999 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the B-4000 model, the Troy Lee design also is used for a
B-3000 two-wheel-drive four-door model, and a B-2500
two-wheel-drive with a regular-size cab.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in the model designations differentiate the vehicles
by engine size. The B-4000 comes with a 4.0-liter V-6 rated at 158
horsepower; the B-3000 has a 3.0-liter V-6 with 145 horsepower; and
the B-2500 is equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that cranks
out 117 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   All three get the Troy Lee special package, which includes a
two-tone gray and beige upholstery with the Troy Lee Designs
monogram in the door panels. Only the B-4000 comes with leather
interior. The rest get cloth seats and door panels.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Troy Lee touch includes flame-colored trim tape
down both sides. It has the boy-racer look of some of those
aftermarket striping kits that Kmart used to sell in its automotive
department back in the '70s. I'm sure some people might like it.
The first thing I would do is peel it off if one of these trucks
were mine.
</P>
<P>
   Except for that and the abysmal fuel-economy, I enjoyed driving
the Troy Lee B-4000. The EPA ratings _ 16 miles per gallon in the
city and 20 mpg on the highway _ are considerably lower than the
30-plus mpg that earlier Mazda trucks provided. Midway through my
weeklong test drive, I had to refill the 15.9-gallon fuel tank.
There is plenty of power. That's what you get in trade for poor gas
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   This is a truck that can go just about anywhere. It comes with a
raised suspension for serious off-roading, and has front and rear
skid plates to protect the underside of the vehicle on rough
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Other B-4000 features include custom 16-inch wheels (the others
have 15-inch wheels), fog lights, an optional five-speed automatic
transmission (packaged with air-conditioning on our vehicle for
$1,130), and a trailer hitch with towing capacity of up to 5,600
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel-drive system is the same used on the Ford
Explorer, which is essentially a version of the Ranger pickup. This
system has true shift-on-the-fly capability, with automatic locking
front hubs. You can shift into four-wheel drive at any legal speed,
and you don't have to stop and get out of the vehicle to lock the
hubs. You don't even have to back up the vehicle to unlock the hubs
as you do with some shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drives.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first import-branded pickup with four doors _ a
nice feature for loading and unloading kids, groceries or other
stuff in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The B-4000 uses unleaded regular gas, but the B-3000 comes with
a so-called flexible-fuel engine. It will run on gasoline or
clean-burning E85, a mixture of 85 percent ethanol (a type of
alcohol) and 15 percent gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   These vehicles are produced in limited numbers. Just 4,000 of
all three models will be available for the 1999 model year, Mazda
says.
</P>
<P>
   Total price on our test model was $25,125, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Mazda Troy Lee Designs B-4000 pickup
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Compact, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 powered,
four-wheel-drive pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: This special-edition truck comes with leather
interior and the design signature of Troy Lee, who makes fancy
helmets for motorcross racers. It's the first of the import brand
compact pickups with four doors. It's essentially a Ford Ranger.
There is lots of power, and off-road capabilities are awesome.

WELL-OFF CHILDREN MAY BE JUST AS PRONE TO VIOLENCE, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA CISNEROS-LUNSFORD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Children who are handed everything without having
to earn it often feel as deprived as those who have nothing, and
those feelings can sometimes erupt in violence, a leading
psychologist said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Upper-middle-class teens who get everything they want, from
designer clothes to cars, have no experience with ``pulling the
lever of life to produce results,'' Dennis Embry, a child
psychologist from Tucson, Ariz., told a Koch Crime Institute
seminar here.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers, judicial representatives and school
administrators attended the one-day session on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists like Embry and Dave Grossman, a retired Army
psychologist and former West Point professor, discussed the mass
killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., a
comfortable suburb of Denver; the schoolyard bloodshed in
Jonesboro, Ark.; and the effects of negative reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Children need to feel rewarded but only when they have
accomplished something, said Embry, the founder of PeaceBuilders, a
nationally recognized violence-prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have the BMW and everything they've ever wanted, but
they will act like deprived children,'' he said. ``(Children) are
just given stuff, but they don't feel fed because (they) didn't
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for social acceptance, Embry said, creates a bath of
negative brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balanced brain is filled with action. There is a belief that
good things happen. It enjoys novelty but has a tolerance for
order. It doesn't overreact (to commands) and is not constantly mad
at the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a skit, Embry compared two extreme environments at the
fictional Terminator High and Positive High.
</P>
<P>
   At the first campus, a tardy student was punished in a hostile
environment. At Positive High, the student was treated nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Majni, a counselor at El Dorado Elementary School in San
Antonio's North East School District, said consequences and zero
tolerance of bad behavior must be balanced within a positive
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Embry said, law enforcement officers and educators are
too busy trying to predict which child will be violent, instead of
improving the environment in which they learn.
</P>
<P>
   He likened it to seeing a peaceful pond filled with frogs
perched on lilypads and worrying about which one would jump first
into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how quiet is the pond. We're looking, however,
for which frog is going to jump first,'' Embry said. ``That will
drive you crazy. Instead, we're creating an agitated pond of
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas-based Koch Crime Institute, founded by philanthropist
Bill Koch, is a crime and justice research center that studies
juvenile crime prevention.

RUSSIAN SUPPORT FOR NATO PLAN DOOMED FURTHER RESISTANCE FROM
MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As soon as Russia agreed with NATO on the
principles for a peace settlement for Kosovo, President Slobodan
Milosevic understood that he had no choice but to accept the terms
put in front of him, senior Yugoslav officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But they expressed deep concern that the international force
being assembled by NATO would not move into Kosovo quickly enough
to protect the Serbs there from separatist Albanian guerrillas. And
they worry about Belgrade's enormous task of reconstruction, for
which it expects little Western help.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the officials added, Milosevic will
retain his grip on power, and the ultranationalist leader of the
Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj, has agreed not to vote against the
government even if he quits as deputy prime minister of Serbia to
protest the Kosovo deal. Seselj has also promised not to lead
demonstrations against the pact.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians won some important concessions for Milosevic, the
officials said, which made the final offer better for Belgrade than
the earlier Western plan presented to the Serbs and the Albanians
at Rambouillet, France. The Albanians accepted that plan; Milosevic
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we knew that when the Russians came in with this plan,
that was it,'' said one official close to Milosevic and his
influential wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``We knew it from the
beginning. We knew that the carpet bombing of Belgrade would start
the next day after we refused, so what was the choice?''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO alliance had threatened to take out the rest of
Serbia's bridges, electricity supply and telephones, and the
Yugoslav officials said there was no longer any reason to wait for
such destruction. Continuing the unequal war was pointless, the
official said, and it obviously posed greater risks to Milosevic's
own hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative to acceptance was not a humane one,'' the
official said. ``We couldn't be reckless and risk elimination of
the state, the army and the people for the sake of rhetoric, and
without any substantial support in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The key part of the proposal that made it acceptable for
Belgrade, the officials said, was the limitation on the movement of
the international forces, mostly NATO and Russian troops under a
United Nations flag, to Kosovo itself.
</P>
<P>
   Under an annex of the Rambouillet accords, a purely NATO force
was to be given full permission to go anywhere in Yugoslavia, and
be immune from any legal process. ``NATO personnel shall enjoy,
together with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft and equipment, free
and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including associated airspace and
territorial waters,'' the annex read.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also noted that the new proposals did not
recommend a re-examination of Kosovo's sovereignty after three
years, or any referendum on that topic, as the Rambouillet
agreement did.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials also said their resistance had forced NATO to
find a solution within the United Nations and with the
participation of the Russians. And they emphasized the
international guarantees of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo,
unlike the temporary sovereignty proposed at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, the officials expressed deep concern
that up to 200,000 Serbs and Gypsies now living in Kosovo would
flee the province rather than ``wait for the KLA,'' as one official
put it, referring to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that Serbs won't be in Kosovo anymore,'' the official
said. ``How many international troops are ready and how quickly can
they deploy over this burned land? We pretend that NATO controls
the terrorists of the KLA, but truthfully no one really controls
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he predicted that the large numbers of poor ethnic Albanians
from Albania and Macedonia who had never lived in Kosovo would try
to move into the province as refugees, attracted by the large
Western presence and promises of aid.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the officials was resigned and at moments even
bleak. They understood that the West was unlikely to provide
reconstruction aid so long as Milosevic remained in power, but they
expressed few doubts that he would remain firmly entrenched as head
of state.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They offered few clear ideas for coping with Yugoslavia's dire
economic problems, other than motivating Serbian self-reliance and
ingenuity. Already weakened by eight years of international
sanctions, Yugoslavia's economy has been blasted by NATO's war
against bridges, highways, factories and refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian help would be required, they said, to get enough natural
gas for the winter and the gasoline and fuel needed to complete
this year's harvest. And they said they expected Yugoslavia to
continue to have to pay well over market price for the goods it was
able to import or smuggle past the sanction monitors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now happy with the simple fact that the bombing
will stop,'' said another senior official. ``And the day after that
no one knows. People have responded to the war in a remarkable
fashion, and now we must organize people to act in a positive
way.''

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: positive way.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yugoslav United Left party, which is led by Ms. Markovic,
has spoken of the post-war period as a time of renewal, but it will
most likely be a period of lower living standards, increased
poverty and a slow rebuilding of damaged infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most analysts here _ including the former editor of the
Belgrade magazine Vreme, Zoran Jelicic _ say that while the
domestic political situation will become more tense, the
difficulties of everyday life will make popular political unrest
less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very hard time ahead,'' said Jelicic, who lost his
top editing job when he opposed Milosevic. ``We will have
inflation, shortages and severe unemployment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors, said Jelicic, who is also an economist, will
force the government either to open up the economy to the world
market, despite international sanctions, or to turn to a
socialist-style economy to get through the most difficult periods.
``But hard times will just strengthen the authorities,'' he said.
``In our experiences, there are no protests during the worst
times.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the West's effort to ``bribe the population into
overthrowing Milosevic,'' he said, ``it even makes me resentful,
and I've tried to bring him down from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   If the senior officials have concerns about the post-war
economy, they add that Milosevic faces little internal political
threat. Seselj has a history of being the government's in-house
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, when he met with party leaders to tell
them he would accept the Russian-NATO proposal and urged them to
vote for it in parliament that day, Milosevic asked Seselj to at
least abstain in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   But Seselj, meeting with his party just before the vote, ended
up opposing the pact. Afterward, he said he would quit the Serbian
government once Western troops arrive in Kosovo. ``Certainly we
won't stay in the Serbian government to see a possible entrance of
troops from aggressor countries into Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seselj also promised Milosevic that he would support the
government in parliament or not vote against it, and that he would
not organize any demonstrations against the Kosovo deal in the
streets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Seselj has few firm supporters of his own, but
tends to draw defectors from Milosevic or from Vuk Draskovic, a
former leader of the democratic opposition and now the head of the
Serbian Renewal Movement. &QL;

WILL PIXAR BE THE HERO OF HOLLYWOOD ANIMATION?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A thinking person's cult stock: That may seem an odd
characterization for Pixar, the maker of ``A Bug's Life,'' the 1998
animated children's film that featured 750 computer-generated ants.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who are bullish on the company say its technical
and creative prowess makes it one of the few pure high-technology
media plays, as well as a favorite to win the Hollywood animation
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company knows ``how to create profitable
franchises based on their movie characters,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon,
an analyst with the Seidler Companies, a brokerage firm in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Toy Story,'' Pixar's first feature film, released in
1995. It generated $354 million in ticket sales worldwide. But
profits on the $500 million _ in part through successful video
sales and merchandising royalties as the film's animated characters
were plastered on everything from toothbrushes to greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts figure that Pixar, of Richmond, Calif., kept just
$50 million of that profit, with the remainder going to the film's
distributor, the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   So Pixar's chief executive, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple
Computer, negotiated what analysts say was a much more favorable
deal with Disney in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under that pact, the two companies will split evenly Pixar's
production costs and the profits from Pixar films, video, and
merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon expects ``A Bug's Life,'' which has had ticket sales of
$358 million so far, to earn Pixar $200 million in profits in its
first 30 months.
</P>
<P>
   Pixar's stock has been notoriously volatile since its initial
offering in November 1995. In the last 52 weeks, the shares have
bounced between $27.50 and $66, and closed on Friday at $39.625.
But bulls say investors who can stand the volatility may be in for
a terrific ride.
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon expects earnings to double this year, to $1.39 a share,
and to double again in 2000. That, he says, would justify a
price-to-earnings multiple in the mid-40s, versus just TK today,
and give the stock a share price of $60 in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each film, they're building their library of long-lived,
extremely lucrative assets,'' said Stewart Halpern, an analyst with
Furman Selz. Halpern said Pixar's expertise would become more
valuable as digital processes became more important in the
entertainment industry. He thinks the stock will hit $60 in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Pixar's success is the company's technical leadership in
computer-generated animation. It's technology is 20 percent to 40
percent cheaper than conventional hand-drawn animation and produces
more lifelike textures and movements than those of rival studios,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   One pitfall for Pixar, Halpern said, is that investors treat the
opening of one of its films like the expiration of a stock option:
Shares are bid up on heavy volume beforehand and sold afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Even investors who are bullish on Pixar may trade in and out of
the stock. Susan Hirsch, manager of the Prudential Emerging Growth
fund, who now owns Pixar shares, says there is a buying window from
now until the release of ``Toy Story 2'' at Thanksgiving. But she
thinks Pixar's unique animated products and access to the deep
pockets of Disney's marketing machine hold longer-term promise.
</P>
<P>
   Short-sellers love Pixar, too: As of May 15, there was a
three-million-share, or 6 percent, short position in the stock. But
bulls that that Jobs is a better barometer _ and he has never sold
any stock.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will dominate the Northeast this weekend as an
expansive area of high pressure near the New England coast protects
the region from clouds. Sunshine will be ample, nearly 15 hours, in
the Northeast and afternoon readings will rise as much as 40
degrees from morning minimums. A light flow from the southeast will
encourage active afternoon sea breezes from Cape Cod to Cape Henry,
especially as the interior becomes quite warm around midday.
</P>
<P>
   Less humid air will filter into North and South Carolina, but
along the periphery of a sultry air mass over the South, a few
thunderstorms will develop. Scattered afternoon thunder is likely
in sections of Florida as well as Alabama and Tennessee. High
pressure in northern Louisiana will limit clouds over the lower
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will erupt in the Plains from Texas to
the western Great Lakes as a corridor of steamy air streams toward
Canada. The largest and perhaps most potent storms will be over
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and western Michigan. A cold front
drifting east from the Rockies will be the mechanism to trigger the
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool, moist air over Wyoming and parts of Utah will be
accompanied by thick clouds and showers. After record chill in
parts of the Southwest, sunny skies will boost temperatures back to
seasonal levels. Low clouds will cling to the West Coast and the
Pacific Northwest will become windy and cooler with showers near
the coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Thunderstorm Complex
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday evening, a few strong thunderstorms erupted in
the northern Plains. Within a few hours, the thunderstorms, drawing
energy from moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Mexico, had
organized themselves into a large cluster of storms called a
mesoscale convective complex. By early Friday, the cloud shield
from the expanding system engulfed much of the Missouri Valley.
These thunderstorm complexes, which are common from May through
July, cover hundreds of square miles and provide more than half the
rainfall during the growing season for the nation's central farm
lands.

   The Daily Cost of Saving On Other People's Taxes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does that special tax break that Archer Daniels Midland gets for
making alcohol fuel for cars burn you up? Well, it's not worth the
postage stamp it takes to complain to your senator.
</P>
<P>
   The break costs each of the 94 million couples or individuals
who file federal income tax returns about 16 cents, says Martin A.
Sullivan, who writes for the magazine Tax Notes.
</P>
<P>
   But the research and development credit that is dear to the high
technology industries, and that President Clinton wants to extend
for another year, is pricier. It will cost $2.3 billion, or $24 per
taxpayer, Sullivan wrote in the June 1 issue of Tax Notes. And the
rule that lets timber companies write off expenses immediately
rather than over the lives of their trees costs $5.30 per taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   Total up all the 140 special breaks in the official list of what
the government calls ``tax expenditures,'' and they add about $200
to the average federal income tax bill this year. That's just
$23.45 more than the cost of stamps for complaint letters to all
535 members of the House and Senate. David Cay Johnston &QL;

   Interest Rebate Card Dies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Mellon Bank's Cornerstone Mastercard program comes to an end,
customers are being freed from a dubious, though superficially
attractive, bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, begun by the Pittsburgh bank in 1993, was that
consumers would get all their interest payments back in a rebate &UR;  &LR; _
after 20 years. In return, they had to pay a high interest rate on
unpaid balances _ the prime rate plus 11.9 percentage points, or,
currently, 19.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp, which bought Mellon's credit-card business this year,
is ending the program. Cornerstone customers will get money back
much sooner, though not all they have paid.
</P>
<P>
   In October, card holders will get one-twentieth of the interest
paid for each year they were in the program, bringing them out
roughly even, since the bank will no longer hold their money for
the remainder of the planned 20-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp would not discuss customer reaction to the plan or say
how many cards are involved.

</P>
<P>
   Some People who claim that they do not have to pay income taxes
are being hit with tough penalties by United States Tax Court
judges.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 penalty was imposed recently on Kermit W. Kinkade, a
jewelry maker in Jeffersonville, Ind., who claimed he had no duty
to file tax returns for 1992 through 1994, when he earned an
average of about $37,300 a year. Mr. Kinkade argued that he would
owe tax only if he were causing harm or had a government license.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Tax Court judges have imposed big fines and
expressed weariness at ridiculous claims, such as that the income
tax is unconstitutional or that it does not apply to wages. A small
industry peddles seminars, books and videos purporting to show that
the tax is a hoax and that payment is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voluntary compliance means that taxpayers willingly fulfill
their responsibilities under the tax law,'' said Steve Pyrek, an
Internal Revenue Service spokesman. ``It doesn't mean that paying
taxes is optional any more than stopping at a red light is
optional.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade, who could not be located, now owes more than $46,500 in
tax, penalties and fines, court records show, plus interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UGLICH, Russia _ In a large second-floor room of the Rossiya
movie theater in this shabbily genteel town, Vladimir Shabalin
teaches people how to drink vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell it first,'' he tells visitors clasping murky antique
shot glasses. They do. ``Take a sip, and hold it in your mouth for
just a bit. Swallow, and then have a mild snack.''
</P>
<P>
   The chilled vodka, Shuiskaya Classic, is sold only in a region
near Moscow and is considered among the best in Russia. It goes
down as smoothly as Shabalin promised. His visitors then dutifully
begin munching pickles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you equate vodka with drunkenness,'' Shabalin says, ``it's
like saying love is the same as venereal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Such distinctions may be lost on most Russians, who are living
through a time of catastrophically widespread alcoholism. But as
director of a new vodka library in Uglich, 200 miles north of
Moscow, Shabalin and his partners are part of a scattered effort to
create a new, upscale culture of drinking the ancient spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, for instance, the Russian distiller Smirnov is
fighting to protect its image as a brand to be savored rather than
guzzled. The Kristall distillery, one of Russia's largest vodka
companies and maker of its most renowned exported brand,
Stolichnaya, has begun producing upscale vodkas for domestic
consumption. Not far from the Kremlin, Mikhail Kozhukov, a
journalist, has opened a vodka restaurant with 40 different brands
of the drink to ``show regard for elite vodka and to push out the
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   These businesses are banking on the growing worldliness of the
Russian middle class, which has begun to appreciate the nuances of
liquors. At the same time, they worry that many successful Russians
are moving away from vodka to what are viewed as more refined
drinks, including gin, whisky and expensive wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If before, people drank to get drunk, now they drink as social
drinking,'' says Natalya Karchazhkina, senior analyst with Qualitel
Data Services, a Moscow market research firm. ``These people are
afraid of alcoholism, and vodka is strongly associated in their
minds with alcoholism.''
</P>
<P>
   The vanguard of the new drinking culture hopes to refurbish
vodka's reputation by teaching people to drink it for its taste
rather than its punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ban vodka, so you have to teach people how to drink
it properly,'' says Viktor Minayev, a folklorist and partner in the
Uglich vodka library. ``What's a culture of drinking? It's placing
limits on yourself and determining the norms in any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is the lubricant for most serious discussion in Russia and
often, its controversial subject. There is little agreement about
when it was introduced, where or by whom, though most broadly agree
that mass production of the grain-based spirit began in the 15th
century in northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the resplendent and crumbling churches of 1062-year-old
Uglich is the Aleksandrovsky monastery where the friars began
making vodka in the late 16th century. Mainly, the bread wine was
used to pay people, and until the end of the Soviet era, vodka was
arguably the only hard currency in Russia, viable in most
transactions and necessary in others. Gravediggers, for instance,
are still paid in bottles so they can toast the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been part of our history, though it may be
something we should be ashamed of,'' Kozhukov said over lunch at
his restaurant, Petrov Vodkin, as he fingers a list of medieval
battles Russia lost because of mass drunkenness. ``In the late 18th
century, if your guests were able to leave on their own two feet,
then the evening wasn't a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on Russian alcohol consumption are unreliable, though
one fact is clear: Russians drink vast quantities of hard liquor,
mainly in the form of vodka. Per capita consumption of hard liquor
amounted to 2.2 gallons a year in 1997, compared with 1.2 gallons
in the United States, based on tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers understate Russian consumption because they fail
to capture the enormous black market. The Russian Health Ministry
estimates that domestic hard-liquor consumption is much higher _
3.7 gallons per capita. The World Health Organization considers 2.1
gallons per capita as highly dangerous, which is reflected in the
declining average life expectancy of Russian men, which is now
about 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev contends that Russia was not always like this. He sits
in a corner of the library decorated to look vaguely like a
19th-century Russian tavern, where visitors can sample any four of
the collection of 400 Russian vodkas. The bottles themselves are on
brightly lit shelves like something out of a trade fair.
</P>
<P>
   Russian men did not always drain every 100 gram toast of vodka
down to the very bottom, Minayev says. There was a time when
drinking vodka meant reconciliation rather than murderous fights in
urban kitchens late at night. Russian cadets used to drink their
third toast to women, always gallantly standing up. Women were
advised to drink 25 grams a day for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Minayev points out the taste of vodka varies mainly because of
the water used to make the alcohol. In the fall, the library will
hold a vodka festival featuring old, arcane regional recipes for
everything ranging from garlic to gooseberry vodka. People will be
taught to drink vodka in contemplative sips.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to earn money, too. Minayev and his partner, Artur
Sazonov, a teetotaler Moscow businessman, opened the vodka library
in March to reap revenue for the town, which is visited by about
80,000 tourists annually. The businessmen plan to expand the
collection to at least 800 different brands by the end of the year.
Entrance to the library costs $1, and the vodkas, many of them
local specialties, can be bought for $7 to $14. ``We'll even have a
machine that will take your picture and make it into a label for a
bottle of vodka,'' Minayev said, proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Most czars placed vodka production under state control to bring
the huge revenue directly into their coffers. The Russian
government has not been so adept at regulating the now-private
liquor industry. Sales revenues of individual producers are not
available, but the overall market amounts to hundreds of millions
of gallons a year.
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeiting is rampant. At least half of the Russian vodka
market is made up of counterfeits, and dozens of people die
annually from drinking lethal fakes. Smirnov has had its factory
outside Moscow turn rotgut into windshield cleaner just to stress
how undrinkable counterfeits are. (Smirnov differs from the
Smirnoff brand of vodka sold by Heublein, and both have been
litigating over Smirnov's desire to sell its brand outside Russia.)
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the company tries through advertising to position its
vodka as an elite brand to appeal to the middle class. ``Drinking
has become very fussy and discriminating,'' Aleksandr Drozdov, a
Smirnov vice president, said about middle-class tastes. ``The
political and economic changes have brought new values. Now people
are too busy to drink as much as before.''
</P>
<P>
   But the purveyors of the vodka culture believe that most
Russians, after drinking vodka to celebrate births and mourn
deaths, will return to the tastes of their forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be drinking French wines now,'' Kozhukov says, ``but
in their heart, there is still a place for vodka. The smell of it
is still in some small corner.''

 A SPURNED SUITOR WHO WON'T JUST GO AWAY

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6)

<P>
   PARIS _ What the Gucci Group really wanted was to get clean away
from the dreaded embrace of Bernard Arnault. What it got was the
uncomfortable prospect of a future with his company, its biggest
rival, as its biggest minority shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   A takeover battle over Gucci was decided a bit ambiguously on
May 27, when a Dutch court approved the sale of a $3 billion
controlling stake in Gucci to the Pinault group of France. Gucci,
which is based in the Netherlands for tax reasons but has most of
its operations in Italy, had agreed to the deal with Francois
Pinault, the billionaire owner of French department stores and the
Christie's auction house, to thwart the hostile bid by Arnault,
chairman of the luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis
Vuitton. But the decision did not affect the 20 percent stake in
Gucci that LVMH has amassed.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is a hot property, and buying it would have given a needed
jolt to Arnault's empire, which was hard hit by the economic crises
in Asia. But Gucci's management thought being sucked into the
corporate culture of LVMH would be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, has ambitions far
above being a satrap of Arnault: He wants to create a powerful
multibrand luxury group big enough to challenge LVMH, whose
portfolio includes Louis Vuitton luggage, Christian Dior fashions
and Guerlain perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   To advance De Sole's plans, Pinault intends to sell to Gucci the
Yves Saint Laurent couture and perfume business, which he had just
acquired for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pinault, controlled bhy Francois Pinault, is also the owner of
French department stores and Christie's auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault, who has not conceded defeat, is threatening to appeal
the court's ruling and ask that the Pinault deal be declared
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Gucci may be red-hot, its stock price has been
cold lately, falling 6 percent the day of the court decision and
then drifting downward. (It closed on Friday at $62.45.) That is
partly because speculators who had bet that Arnault would raise his
bid for Gucci after the decision have sold in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects investor hesitance about Gucci's ability to
digest a mouthful the size of Yves Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Nathalie Saleur of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,
estimated that the Yves Saint Laurent takeover could dilute Gucci's
profits by 10 percent to 15 percent. Gucci lacks a track record in
integrating big acquisitions, she said, and ``the market prefers to
wait for evidence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Sole is in a hurry to supply it. He flew to Paris last week
to discuss with Pinault getting the legal groundwork underway for
the Gucci-Yves Saint Laurent combination. Barring surprises, that
agreement could be signed by the end of July. De Sole, meanwhile,
is arranging a trip to the United States to explain his plans to
institutional investors who are among Gucci's most fervent backers.
</P>
<P>
   Such quick acceleration is in line with De Sole's record. Since
he took Gucci public in 1995, sales have exploded _ to $1 billion
in 1998, from $264 million. Crises in Asian economies caused luxury
goods sales to crumble last year, but Gucci used a timely expansion
in the United States and a shift from accessories to ready-to-wear
garments to maintain growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent weakness, Gucci's stock price has grown more
than fourfold since it went public in 1995. De Sole, together with
Tom Ford, the designer of the hour, have built Gucci into a
fast-growing fashion darling.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, profits at LVMH, the luxury market leader, sank 29
percent last year, dragged down mostly by weakness in Asia, though
its recovery in the first months of this year has been remarkably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the gap between Gucci and LVMH is largely a
question of fashion leadership, with Italian houses like Gucci,
Prada and Armani rivaling the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy has a tremendous degree of creativity and resources,''
said Henry Welt, an expert on luxury goods at the New York law firm
of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner &AMP; Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, LVMH shares leapt on a report, denied by the compony,
that it was in talks to acquire a stake in Armani. The stock closed
at 276 euros, just off its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   To revive LVFMH's ateliers, Arnault turned to Britain, he said,
hiring young designers like John Galliano at Christian Dior and
Alexander McQueen at Givenchy. But Italy, he said, ``brings to the
table a number of things the French don't have,'' like related
technologies in fabric and leather finishing. That, in part, was
why Arnault wanted Gucci in the first place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole says that, though integrating Yves Saint Laurent will be
a challenge, his plans for Gucci are far from exhausted. Last year,
Gucci paid $150 million to acquire the Swiss company that supplies
its watches.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci has already introduced a line of jewelry in its own
stores, and next year will begin selling it in 300 top-of-the-line
jewelry stores worldwide. And it continues to open new stores in
Japan, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ALL that expansion should please shareholders, making it
relatively unlikely that Arnault would be able to make much trouble
from his 20-percent shareholding stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole categorically rules out a board seat for LVMH, and while
Gucci bylaws permit shareholders with more than 10 percent of the
company to convene an extraordinary shareholder meeting, it is
unclear what such a gathering could accomplish for Arnault as long
as Gucci is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   According to Welt of Kronish, Lieb, LVMH could make a nuisance
of itself by requesting privileged financial data, but De Sole said
no single shareholder would be favored. ``We're an incredibly
transparent company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Welt said, the effect of Arnault's restive presence
will be to keep Gucci management from becoming complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the biggest challenge for Gucci, awash with so
much acquisition cash, may be finding suitable brands to swallow.
``Italian families seem quite content,'' said John Wakely of Lehman
Brothers. ``What is Gucci going to do with the cash?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, De Sole says he will begin massaging prospective takeover
targets right away, given the slowness with which Italian
family-run companies with prestigious names tend to make decisions.
John Grace, executive director of Interbrand, a New York brand
consulting company, said that, at any rate, Gucci was on the right
track, adding that ``as Cecil B. DeMille said, everything's
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gucci's doing the absolutely right thing,'' Grace said.
``They're building a portfolio.''

3 DAYS BEFORE INDONESIAN VOTE, POLICE CLASH WITH VIOLENT
PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a reminder of the dangers that surround
Indonesia's parliamentary election, a whiff of violence came to the
capital Friday as police fired warning shots to halt an attack on
supporters of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came on the final day of a largely peaceful and
festive three-week campaign before a parliamentary election Monday
that will be Indonesia's first free ballot since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are to choose 462 representatives who will make up the
bulk of a 700-member electoral assembly that is to pick Indonesia's
next president before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party, Golkar, is one of the leading contenders, with
the advantages of incumbency, wealth and a nationwide organization.
But it is also the common opponent of a welter of opposition
parties that demand its ouster as the capstone to President
Suharto's forced resignation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign that mostly saw mutual tolerance among jostling
crowds whose allegiance ranged among 48 parties, mobs turned on
Golkar campaigners Friday in at least three places here in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   They threw rocks, set a motorcycle on fire, stripped some Golkar
campaigners of their yellow T-shirts and burned some Golkar
banners, and the police fired what officers said were blanks as a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Though the election campaign has been far less violent than was
widely predicted, there has been bloodshed in several remote areas
that are the scenes of separatist rebellions or other local
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   These include the northern Sumatran province of Aceh, the far
eastern province of Irian Jaya, the Maluku islands and South
Sulawesi. Continuing violence in the disputed territory of East
Timor has been due less to the national election campaign than to a
referendum on independence that is scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
   Violence lies just beneath the surface of society throughout
this nation of 200 million _ the fourth most populous in the world.
Some political analysts warn that the country has been enjoying
only a brief holiday from bloodshed as people pour their emotions
into sometimes overwrought campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the animosity against the party associated with
Suharto _ whose presidential candidate is his interim successor,
B.J. Habibie _ there are fears that a victory by Golkar could lead
to more widespread violence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who attacked Golkar supporters Friday shouted
their support of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's
founding president, Sukarno. She is the most popular of the
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live Mega!'' one man shouted, using her nickname. ``We
hate Golkar!''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, when Indonesia held its last
election, that would have been a brave thing to shout. Golkar,
backed by the full weight of Suharto's government and his
politically powerful military, won every election in his 32 years
in power.
</P>
<P>
   The thugs and enforcers of the past have not disappeared and
could still be used to help Golkar muscle its way to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, indeed, were evident on the streets Friday as
Golkar campaigned in several locations. They included well-drilled
squads of unsmiling young men known as Pancasila Youth, who wore
orange and black camouflage outfits and looked at strangers with
fixed stares.
</P>
<P>
   Golkar's chairman, Akbar Tandjung, on the other hand, offered a
friendlier face to reporters at a forum Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall be grateful if Golkar is given the trust to be the
winner in the upcoming elections,'' he said. ``However, should we
lose, we are ready to be outside the circle of government and
become a power to balance the government as an opposition.''

RON SEXSMITH: NOT REALLY A WALLFLOWER, BUT QUIET AND TENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Ron Sexsmith sings, he rarely places a note
squarely on the beat. He eases into it a little ahead of time, or
hesitates and lets it drift in late. Then he holds it with a
slow-quivering vibrato that wobbles around the pitch as if he's not
quite ready to commit himself. The tone is hesitant, uncertain,
like a wallflower trying to slip into a party unnoticed. That
self-effacement carried into Sexsmith's deadpan patter when he
performed on Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom. Mentioning his
new album, ``Whereabouts'' (Interscope), he asked: ``Do you like
it? Is it all right? It's all right if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show of modesty was subterfuge. Behind it, Sexsmith is a
completely assured and stubborn songwriter, doing only what he
wants. He never rushes his music or raises his voice, and his songs
take their time as they calmly unveil their finely wrought
melodies. Their quiet tenderness is a matter of determined choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sexsmith's band _ with his producer, Mitchell Froom, sitting in
on keyboards _ kept the music lean and understated, a discreet
backdrop for guitar hooks and Sexsmith's diffident voice. He harks
back to 1960s rock songwriting: the harmonic twists of the Beatles,
the gleaming guitar lines of the Byrds, the introspection of Brian
Wilson, the stolidity of the Band and the vocal turns of Tim
Hardin. He also hints at a fondness for old-time country music,
both for its irregular line lengths and its willingness to be
unabashedly sincere. While he puts clever twists into his melodies,
he works to make his lyrics direct and concise.
</P>
<P>
   Sexsmith writes, as an observant wallflower might, about
loneliness and inevitable despair. He started his Bowery Ballroom
set with ``Doomed,'' which muses, ``Sometimes it seems as though we
were doomed from the start,'' one of his many songs that seeks
serenity after love has faded. He lends hymnlike melodies to songs
like ``Doomed'' and ``Seem to Recall,'' or he brings a music-hall
oompah to songs like ``One Gray Morning,'' which begins, ``You can
count on many things/to let you down.'' Sometimes he becomes an
observer, as in ``Nothing Good,'' which watches a man start an
affair he'll regret while the folk-rock melody rises
optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, he tries to will himself toward positive thinking:
``Still Time'' urged, ``Where there's still hope, there's still
time.'' Yet even his downhearted songs are more contemplative than
gloomy; the melodies let the singer stand outside his troubles and
promise consolation even when everything's gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Payne, the 19-year-old songwriter who opened the show,
could be a one-woman Lilith Fair. She uses Sarah McLachlan's
tremulous vibrato, Natalie Merchant's touches of smoke and Jewel's
coffeehouse guitar-strumming. She also has Jewel's earnestness and
adolescent self-regard, unabashedly singing lines like ``I need to
know who and what I am.'' Yet she already knows how to build a
song, from confession of vulnerability to life lesson. One song,
``Honest,'' urges, ``If you can be honest, I can be too,'' with an
inspirational melody that could make it a sensitive teen-ager's
anthem.

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are 27 years old, grew up in Virginia and are
both Libras.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, they take turns reciting aloud their horoscope in The
New York Post. Between them, they have read ``Divine Secrets of the
Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' six times.
</P>
<P>
   Epitomizing downtown chic in their Tracey Feith slip dresses,
jean jackets and pashmina shawls, Sarah Hailes and Beth Shepherd
are so alike they not only complete each other's sentences, but
also could be sisters. In fact, they were sorority sisters at the
University of Virginia, where the two women met as roommates a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Hailes and Ms. Shepherd are still best friends, as
well as business partners. Next month, they plan to open Kirna
Zabete, a two-level clothing store at 96 Greene St. that will marry
NoLiTa and Neiman Marcus. It will sell cutting-edge European
designers like Josephus Thimister alongside funkier, lower-priced
designs by unknown labels like Double Happiness. It is a formula
the partners are betting is fresh and appealing enough to succeed
in a highly competitive retail climate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hailes is a former manager of Christian Lacroix boutiques at
three Saks Fifth Avenue stores, and Ms. Shepherd is a former
fashion editor at New York magazine. Over a series of lunches at
Burger Heaven on 54th Street last summer, they hatched their idea
for a dream shop. ``It would be everything we wanted to buy for
ourselves but couldn't find in one store in New York,'' Ms.
Shepherd said at her Greenwich Village apartment, which doubles as
an office while the 5,000-square-foot SoHo store is being finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hailes piped in. ``Kirna Zabete reflects our different
personalities _ Goth, glamorous and girlie,'' she said. ``We made a
no-gray policy right from the start because gray is tired. Color is
fresh and modern. And absolutely no designers who advertise on the
side of a bus. We're all about mixing. We believe in rubber
flip-flops with a silk dress and a red velvet handbag in summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The store will carry some 60 labels, from high-fashion Europeans
like Olivier Theyskens and Balenciaga to American hipsters like
Daryl K and Susan Cianciolo, to new names like Andrew Gn and Jenny
Udale, designers that Ms. Hailes and Ms. Shephard discovered while
scavenging the cobblestone alleys of London and Paris. The name
Kirna Zabete (pronounced KEAR-nah ZAH-bet) refers to nicknames Ms.
Hailes (Kirna) and Ms. Shepherd (Zabete) acquired in college.
</P>
<P>
   The store is inspired by Colette, the Paris shop with a
following among fashionistas that presents a hyper-edited selection
of clothes and accessories, from Nike sneakers to Gucci bikinis,
all displayed like reliquaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hailes and Ms. Shepherd call Kirna Zabete a ``lifestyle
store'' and contend it is a new concept for SoHo, now dominated by
single-designer boutiques or chains like J. Crew. Besides clothes,
their store will have fresh flowers for sale by the door (``just in
case a customer is going to a dinner party after she's bought an
evening dress,'' Ms. Hailes explained), art shows and computer
terminals, to give idle boyfriends something to do. There will also
be candy sold in bulk. ``But no candy with wrappers,'' Ms. Shepherd
said. ``They're not pretty. We're only selling pretty candy like
Good &AMP; Plenty, Swedish Fish and Mike &AMP; Ikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inacio Ribeiro, one half of the Clements Ribeiro label, which is
supplying cashmere baby clothes and dog accessories to Kirna
Zabete, thinks the store represents a breath of fresh air. ``SoHo
needs an injection of life in terms of multi-label shops,'' he
said. ``It's gotten very dated. SoHo was an '80s phenomenon _
label- or designer-driven. The '90s are much more subtle. It's more
lifestyle-oriented. The idea that fashion is one amongst many other
elements is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Bagutta, the owner of Bagutta, a 12-year-old designer
clothing store in SoHo, is skeptical. ``They're a straight copy of
Colette,'' he said of Kirna Zabete. ``But there is only one
Colette, and it is in Paris. Those girls said they'll show a $1,000
Theyskens jacket with a T-shirt. Well, what's so different about
that? I question selling high fashion with bubble gum. When someone
drops $5,000 in a store, they want service. Barneys was pretty good
at what they did, and even they couldn't sustain the pressure of
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Barneys from Seventh Avenue created a void
downtown, which Kirna Zabete is not alone in trying to fill. In
August, Jeffrey Kalinsky, a former Barneys shoe buyer, plans to
open Jeffrey New York on West 14th Street in the meatpacking
district _ an enormous 18,000-square-foot store with more
established designers, including Helmut Lang and Dries van Noten,
just like Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the downtown Barneys closed, it made a huge hole in
shopping,'' said Alix Brown, an editor at Visionaire, the
avant-garde fashion magazine, who bumped into Ms. Shepherd and Ms.
Hailes at European showrooms this spring. She predicted that Kirna
Zabete will be ``a mecca for the fashion-hungry who could care less
about big labels like Gucci and Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finding all the new great people who journalistically
I've been trying to find,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Occupying the space once rented by Architektura, Kirna Zabete is
being designed by Nick Dine, a son of the artist Jim Dine.
Featuring a lavender vinyl floor, red fixtures and a central glass
tower from which the owners will be able to oversee the fashion
show below, it will look ``clean and happy,'' Nick Dine said,
adding, ``It's in keeping with Beth and Sarah's bubbly
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Being entrepreneurs hasn't interfered with the traditions of
sorority solidarity between the two women. Since moving to New York
in 1993, they have been the hosts for Monday Assembly Night, as
they call it, when eight girlfriends get together to gab about
guys, breakups, careers and clothes. The group is so close-knit
that when one member confessed she was seeing a psychiatrist, the
others felt betrayed. ``But what about us?'' Ms. Shepherd remembers
thinking. ``In the South, you talk about your problems with your
girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in New York where neuroses, therapy and crass
commercialism prevail is another matter. ``We come from a place
where women are nice and well behaved,'' Ms. Shepherd said. ``But
here if you don't stick up for yourself, no one else will. That's
been the greatest challenge. Especially when it comes to
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thanksgiving, both women quit their jobs to put together a
business plan. Without any income, they got by eating Campbell's
soup, Lean Cuisine and cereal. They were late paying their rent and
used their credit cards to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks and 60 pages later, they had drawn up maps of
SoHo, spread sheets, sales projections and every detail of their
store's operation. The plan was so thorough that their accountant
asked who did it.
</P>
<P>
   The two women came up with a list of 10 potential investors, and
at the Mercer Kitchen in January, they presented their plan to one
of them. To their surprise, he immediately agreed to finance the
entire project. (Although the women confirmed that their backer is
involved in the entertainment and Internet industries, they signed
a confidentiality agreement and would not name him.)
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of the high-profile retail failures in New York of the
last decade, including the downtown Barneys, the Charivari chain
and Galleries Lafayette, Ms. Hailes and Ms. Shepherd, who seem
congenitally optimistic, smiled politely, then recounted a
conversation they had last summer. While lunching on cheeseburgers
and imagining themselves as shop owners, they turned to their
horoscope in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   `` `At this time, the expression, `Rome was not built in a day,'
affords you wonderful insight,''' Ms. Hailes repeated from memory.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Think of potential, not limits,''' Ms. Shepherd added, right
on cue.

BIG JAPANESE INSURANCE FIRM FOLDS, HIGHLIGHTING INDUSTRY'S WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Financial authorities on Friday suspended operations at
Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., only the second major insurer in
Japan to go out of business since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Toho's trouble underscores problems facing the entire industry.
And because Toho has a tie-up with GE Capital Corp. of the United
States, the suspension will be watched closely by the foreign
financial community as a test of whether foreign concerns can
withstand possible spillover effects from weak or ailing Japanese
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Japan's insurers have been staggering under the weight
of billions of dollars in property losses and bad debts. Like the
nation's big banks, Japan's life insurance companies went on buying
sprees during the economic go-go years at the end of the last
decade, and they are now stinging from losses as property prices
have in some cases plunged 90 percent from their peak values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life insurance industry in Japan has problems which could
be equally as serious as those in the banking industry,'' said
Andrew Smithers, president of Smithers &AMP; Co., a financial
consultancy based in London.
</P>
<P>
   Smithers said Toho was probably the most vulnerable of the
insurers, but that there were a couple of other insurers that were
also bleeding. Partly because Toho's demise had been anticipated,
financial experts say that there is unlikely to be any backlash
effect on other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The government has established a new protection fund for
insurance policyholders, but analysts say the fund has very little
money and that it is possible that the Bank of Japan may have to
extend loans to the fund to cover payments to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co. collapsed,
leaving many policyholders nearly empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, GE Capital, a unit of General Electric,
negotiated its way into Japan's closed and clubby insurance
industry by striking a deal with Toho and setting up a joint
venture, GE Edison Life Insurance Co. Analysts said the deal looked
good because the new venture would start afresh with only Toho's
new business, while the old, more risky policies remained with Toho
Mutual. GE thus seemed to isolate itself from the fallout from a
collapse of Toho.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspension order by the Financial Supervisory Agency
appears to affect at least a small part of GE Edison's operations.
It is not clear whether negative publicity over the collapse of
Toho may also have any impact in the minds of policyholders on the
reputation of GE Edison. GE Edison issued a statement Friday saying
that its operations would be ``secure and unaffected'' by Toho's
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Toho officials told a news conference Friday evening that its
accountants refused to attach their blessing to the financial
statements for the year ending March 31. Accountants in Japan have
a reputation for being generally lenient in their audits, and their
refusal suggests that Toho was in severe financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   Toho officials said that its auditors figured that the company
had to dispose of 230 billion yen, or about $2 billion, in bad
assets arising from potential losses on securities, foreign
exchange deals and bad loans. If the company had done so, then it
would have had a capital deficit of about 200 billion yen, or about
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese life insurers, like Toho, have been squeezed by
plummeting interest rates in Japan. For years, government rules had
forced them to pay out high, fixed returns on insurance policies.
But with interest rates falling to nearly zero, the money that life
insurance companies received from policyholders was invested in
stocks and bonds offering increasingly lower returns so that they
often ended up paying more out to policyholders than they received
from their investments, which are their major source of income.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of financial health at life insurers is called the
solvency ratio, and the government has said that a ratio below 200
percent is a severe warning sign. A year ago, Toho reported a
solvency ratio of 154 percent, and that ratio probably tumbled in
the year ending March 31, analysts said.

RUSSIANS GRIPPED BY PUSHKINMANIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ To Russians, Alexander Pushkin is the heart and soul of
their literature. ``Pushkin is our everything,'' said a fellow
Russian poet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the 200th anniversary of Pushkin's birth, and not only
are Russians in the grip of Pushkinmania, but they also insist they
are the only ones who could be.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him best in Russia say that is because he is
quite simply untranslatable. Valentin Nepomnyaschy, a leading
Pushkin scholar, wrote recently: ``Of the world's geniuses, he is
least translated into other languages and the hardest to grasp in
translation: in cultures with other languages, he seizes the soul
only of those who know and love our language, our culture, those to
whom Russia is not spiritually alien.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Pushkin's quintessential Russianness hasn't
prevented others from laying claim to him as well.
</P>
<P>
   The British actor Ralph Fiennes, who stars in a new movie
version of ``Yevgeny Onegin,'' which had its premiere in St.
Petersburg and Moscow this week, does not know Russian. Still,
Fiennes, who is appearing in a salute to Pushkin at Carnegie Hall
next Saturday night, said he was immediately struck by Pushkin's
work when he first read ``Onegin'' while he was a drama school
student.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes told the Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda: ``I am
English and I have heard of such a phenomenon as the mysterious
Russian soul, but apparently we foreigners must spend an entire
lifetime in order to understand what this is. On the other hand,
being English, I ask myself, what is the English soul? We took into
account that our film is for an international audience and strove
to make it understandable to absolutely everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The $14 million film is directed by Fiennes' sister Marta and
also stars Liv Tyler as the innocent Tatyana Larina, who is
rejected by the aristocratic Onegin only to reject him years later,
after she has married and moved up the social ladder. Komsomolskaya
Pravda notes with amusement that at least two of the melodies used
in the movie, which is set in the early 19th century, are quite
jarring for a Russian audience: a waltz from the time of the
Russo-Japanese war in 1905 and a Stalin-era song.
</P>
<P>
   Another non-Russian who has tackled Pushkin is Kama Ginkas, a
Lithuanian who is one of the most respected theater directors in
Moscow. In his play, ``Pushkin. Duel. Death.,'' a gathering of
Pushkin's friends, acquaintances and hangers-on grasp in vain at
explanations for the duel that led to his death as they sit around
a table with the poet's death mask as centerpiece. At the end of
the play, the table rises up to the ceiling and, struggling to
cling to it, they fall off one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushkin slips away, he dissolves into the air, because he
himself is like air,'' Ginkas told Literaturnaya Gazeta, referring
to the difficulty of capturing Pushkin both in another language or
another form. ``Maybe this is precisely the uniqueness of Pushkin
himself, and of this poetry. He is formless, immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a Pushkin-Goethe Festival held recently in Moscow
to observe the poets' birthdays (this year is Goethe's 250th),
Dmitri Prigov, a post-modernist poet and conceptual artist, took
the first line from ``Onegin'' (``My uncle _ high ideals inspire
him'') and set it to Buddhist and Muslim mantras and Russian
Orthodox and Gregorian chants.
</P>
<P>
   The festival ended in a ``Walpurgian Night,'' a Night of the
Witches celebration featuring hard-core German pornography, a disco
and verses by Pushkin and Goethe set to rap and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the notion of a multicultural and multifacted Pushkin
is not entirely new. Regarded as the founder of the modern Russian
language, Pushkin also spoke French, as was common among
aristocrats of his time. His great-grandfather was from Africa, a
source of exotic fascination both to himself and to his readers.
</P>
<P>
   His identity was constantly remolded to fit the needs of various
groups. Pushkin was banished from St. Petersburg to the south in
1820 for writing political poems while participating in a
discussion group that later developed into the Decembrist movement
that sought to overthrow Nicholas I in 1825. Although he had
friends among the Decembrists, he did not participate in their plot
and in the end remained a monarchist, which is what the czarist
regime chose to emphasize during his anniversary in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Soviet rulers from portraying him as a
revolutionary, interpreting a line from one of his poems, ``October
has come,'' as presaging the revolution. His relationship with
religion is also complicated. He studied the Scriptures and was
reared in the Russian Orthodox Church, which he never renounced.
But the Czar exiled him to his family estate, Mikhailovskoye, from
1824 to 1826, after the police intercepted a letter in which he
wrote that he was taking ``lessons in pure atheism.'' The Soviets
portrayed him as an atheist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in honor of this latest anniversary, one overeager regional
governor, a former Communist functionary, has called for Pushkin to
be canonized as a saint, an offer the Russian Orthodox Church has
politely declined. But Patriarch Aleksy II will be present at
birthday festivities. Scholars are sponsoring conferences and
writing books analyzing the scriptural influences in Pushkin's
works and the power of his verse as a path to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians also want a piece of him, with anticipated
presidential contenders falling all over themselves to show their
knowledge of Pushkin. One of the latest editions of the poet's
complete works has an introduction by former Prime Minister Viktor
S. Chernomyrdin, something like having former President George Bush
write a foreword to Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to impose an official Pushkin, however, are what created
the phenomenon of the personal Pushkin, or ``my Pushkin,'' as
Russians call him. ``Nowhere else do you find my Byron or my
Dostoyevsky,'' said Sergei Fomichev, the chief Pushkin scholar at
the Pushkinsky Dom in St. Petersburg. ``Smart people each had their
own Pushkin, to counteract the pressure of the state's version of
Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fomichev's thought might apply to all Pushkin lovers,
Russian and non-Russian alike: ``Everyone sees Pushkin in their own
way.''

STORM ODDS STACK UP AGAINST TEXAS GULF COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT LAVACA, Texas _ Since the early 1800s, there has never been
a 10-year period when the Gulf Coast of Texas has gone without a
hurricane coming ashore. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to hurricanes, being a perfect 10 is not
considered a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1900, Texas has suffered through 10 of the 30 worst
hurricanes to make landfall in the United States. Near the top rank
as the deadliest storm was the Sept. 8, 1900, hurricane that killed
as many as 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 10 years, the rapid growth along the Gulf Coast
has resulted in only about 10 percent of the population having had
any close experience with a major storm. And forecasters fear many
current residents of coastal areas may not fully appreciate the
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a matter of if, but when,'' Terry Huber, a
National Weather Service meteorologist in Corpus Christi, said of a
hurricane hitting the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work together to get out the message to the
community,'' he told about 400 officials at the 7th annual Calhoun
County Emergency Management Conference here last week. They
represented coastal counties.
</P>
<P>
   Being prepared and stressing the potential life-threatening
impact of hurricanes were the themes of the conference, held at the
start of the 1999 hurricane season. The Atlantic and Gulf season
runs through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should know what you're going to do before we issue a
hurricane watch. High winds, heavy rain and tornadoes can hit long
before the eye makes landfall,'' said Huber, who added that the
watch is issued about 36 hours in advance of projected strike.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that planning sessions are a must for officials if
they are to use all their resources in reducing the potential death
toll.
</P>
<P>
   The word hurricane is derived from Spanish and Caribbean Indian
terms for evil spirits and big winds.

<P>
   William Gray and his research team at Colorado State University,
who provides hurricane predictions to weather watchers throughout
the world, have said they believe there will be 14 named storms,
nine hurricanes and four intense hurricanes this year.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate is about 160 percent of the normal rate of
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no one can predict where any of the storms may come
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Gray is also suffering through a storm of his own, with much of
his research funding being cut by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he believes funding reductions are the reaction to
his public questioning of sophisticated computer programs _ called
numeric models _ that are becoming the dominant method of hurricane
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The programs use mathematics to forecast the weather, while Gray
and his team combine computer programs and a study of past storm
activity in their predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's predictions were still the major focus at the Port Lavaca
conference, where representatives of numerous agencies discussed
storm preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we seem to fall into is we don't want to
evacuate people until the last minute, but you have to make the
decision to have enough time to evacuate,'' Ken Baxter, hurricane
program manager for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told
the county officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate we evacuate (storm-prone areas) seven times for
every one time you truly have to,'' Baxter said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schumann, senior research associate at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said evacuation models for the coastal area have
examined a number of issues to give officials a better
understanding of when to make their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the items that have to be considered are traffic load
capacity; routes; congestion in getting ready to evacuate;
evacuation times; the lowest elevation of roadways; and other
information,'' Schumann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no way we're ever going to replace your
experience. You know your areas better than anyone,'' he said.

   Vanguard's Windsor Is Shaking the Blues &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard
Group, has inveighed against market-timing _ switching in and out
of the market in hopes of catching rallies and avoiding drops. A
``fruitless pursuit,'' he has called it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rebound in Vanguard's $17 billion Windsor fund
suggests that timing a change in fund managers isn't a particularly
easy hobby to master, either.
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-month spell when the fund _ under the guidance of
Charles T. Freeman _ lagged behind its peers, Vanguard announced in
late March that it had signed Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. to take
over management of part of the fund; the move took effect last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, since March 25, the day Vanguard announced
the change, Windsor has trounced most of the nation's other big
funds as well as Vanguard's most popular offerings. For example, as
Windsor soared 13.2 percent through Friday, the Vanguard 500 Index
fund rose just 3.2 percent while Janus 20, the hottest big fund
during the first quarter, fell 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who took the reins of the Windsor in 1996 from John
Neff, was helped by the strengthening economy and weakening
concerns about global economic problems, which prompted investors
to pour money into the deep-value companies Windsor owns.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman says energy stocks like Burlington Resources, Anadarko
Petroleum and Union Pacific Resources and cyclical issues like
Alcoa and Caterpillar contributed most to Windsor's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid a price in 1998 by staying true to our style,''
Freeman said. But, he added, ``we were confident we had a lot of
unrecognized value in our portfolio. It's been validating to see
that recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The move by Vanguard came after a long period of
underperformance: Windsor had a total return of about 20 percent
during the previous two years, compared with about 70 percent for
the 500 Index fund. Investors withdrew $1.2 billion from Windsor in
just the first three months of this year. The fund, which was
closed to new investors 10 years ago, reopened last week.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard officials noted that when they announced the change,
they emphasized their full confidence in Freeman and his firm,
Wellington Management, and that he would remain the lead manager,
responsible for overseeing the majority of the fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they had discussed assigning some portion of the
portfolio to other managers long before Windsor's problems, to
increase its diversification _ an action taken previously at other
Vanguard funds despite their good performance.

   Calpers Will Start to Invest in Money Managers It Hires &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the giant
pension fund, will invest in some small money management companies
it hires to manage its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the move by Sacramento, California-based
Calpers is the first time a pension fund has sought to take equity
interests in the managers it hires to invest its money.
</P>
<P>
   Calpers, which has more than $150 billion in assets, said it
will commit $4 billion to the program, spreading the money among 10
to 30 managers over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good situation,'' said Edd Fong, a Calpers
spokesman, adding that the fund will benefit from the managers'
ideas and by ``generating earnings from growth of the equity
position.''

   Not everyone is upset by the recent volatility in Internet

</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want,'' said Michael Braude, president of the
board, best known for its wheat futures trading. As for volume on
the Internet futures, the first such contracts available, Braude
said he was pleased. ``It's about exactly where I predicted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 ISDEX contracts were traded daily last week, about the
same volume as for the exchange's Value Line stock index and
natural-gas futures.

`ANASTASIA': MEMORIES OF A (PERHAPS) PRINCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If only Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia'' were a
novel. Then one could skim over its loquacious bits and finally be
gripped by a thrilling conclusion. But ``Anastasia'' is not a
novel. It's a three-act ballet that entered American Ballet
Theater's repertory Thursday night at the Metropolitan Opera House.
And it cannot be skimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The production is marvelously danced, but the choreography is
uneven. Telling the story of Anastasia, a daughter of Czar Nicholas
II and Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna, the Russian emperor and
empress, the ballet begins with its heroine as a girl enjoying a
picnic aboard a yacht in 1914. This idyll is interrupted by news of
war. In the second act, set in 1917, Anastasia is now a young woman
at a palace ball. Her happiness is again shattered, this time by
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The third act takes place in a hospital many years later. A
woman who purports to be Anastasia relives memories of the Russian
Revolution, and past and present mingle in hallucinatory episodes,
some of them blending action onstage with old newsreels. This act
displays MacMillan's ability to devise powerful and almost
Expressionistically dramatic choreography. But one has to wait a
long time for it.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan based the act on the actual case of a woman known as
Anna Anderson who did indeed insist she was Anastasia, although her
claims have been seriously questioned. But in the ballet, Anna and
Anastasia are presumably the same person. In any case, they are
portrayed by the same dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Durante was the heroine Thursday. A ballerina from
Britain's Royal Ballet who is a principal dancer with Ballet
Theater this season, Ms. Durante understands MacMillan's style, and
her lurchings, staggerings and moments of stony immobility in the
last act convincingly suggested that this hospital patient was
trapped in a nightmare from which she could not wake. Before that,
in the first act, Ms. Durante was appealingly girlish as she made
an entrance on roller skates, and she was a charming princess in
the second act.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third act that one remembers. Dramatically
self-contained, it can serve as an independent ballet in its own
right. In fact, MacMillan originally choreographed it in 1967 as a
one-act work for the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin.
Then he created his three-act production for the Royal Ballet 1971.
Yet the one-act version has also been performed by companies,
including Ballet Theater in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   What do the other acts add? Dramatically, not much.
Nevertheless, the first act had technically spectacular dancing by
Maxim Belotserkovsky, Marcelo Gomes, Keith Roberts and Ethan
Stiefel, as officers. Victor Barbee and Christine Dunham were
dignified as the czar and czarina and Ethan Brown was a sullen
Rasputin. In the second act, Ashley Tuttle and Gomes were imposing
in a pas de deux supposedly performed by stars of the Imperial
Ballet. Yet MacMillan stretches his story very thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anastasia'' is musically unusual. Whereas the first act is set
to Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 1, Opus 13 (``Winter Dreams'') and
the second is to Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 3, Opus 29 (``The
Polish''), the third combines electronic sounds with Bohuslav
Martinu's ``Fantasies Symphoniques.''
</P>
<P>
   New York balletgoers will find some of this music familiar.
George Balanchine chose the Third Symphony, shorn of its first
movement, for the ``Diamonds'' episode of ``Jewels,'' which the New
York City Ballet produced in 1967. And Antony Tudor used the
Martinu for ``Echoing of Trumpets,'' the harrowing anti-war ballet
that he staged for the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1962 and that has
gone in and out of Ballet Theater's repertory since 1967. Musically
as well as choreographically, the third act stands on its own.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan died in 1992, and this complete ``Anastasia'' has been
staged from Benesh Notation by Monica Parker, a notation
specialist. Each act in the production designed by Bob Crowley
begins by showing a curtain with a portrait of the Russian imperial
family on it. The simple settings suggest a deck, a palace with
fantastically tilted chandeliers and a bleak hospital room. In
contrast, the costumes, in period style, are elaborate.

SO THAT'S WHY WALLS CONCEAL HEATING VENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the hollow walls of buildings, electrical wires do
their work unsung and hidden from view. A few months ago Sheila
Kennedy, an architect, gave wires their due. She delivered a
lecture at Radcliffe's Bunting Institute in Cambridge, Mass.,
called ``Electricity, the Fairy and the Hollow Wall: Rethinking the
Spaces of Infrastructure in Architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure of buildings, crammed into chimneys,
stairways, hallways and hollow walls, she said, has been
``feminized'' and ``repressed'' for too long.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk _ animating architectural objects and, more
importantly, assigning them a gender and a status _ is not at all
strange these days. Feminist critics of architecture, exasperated
with the maleness of their profession, are waging a battle of
metaphors. Every architectural term _ from walls to plumbing,
windows to cities _ has been sexed. Which is feminine, inside or
outside? Which is masculine, form or function? What about the walls
themselves? And whose side are you on?
</P>
<P>
   Take electricity. Traditionally it has been imagined as an
``unreliable fairy'' dealing out help and trouble, Ms. Kennedy
said. The electrical cord, the carrier of electricity, is rarely
represented in advertisements, while the light bulb has become a
glamorous star.
</P>
<P>
   Heating vents have also been repressed, Ms. Kennedy suggested.
If you imagine the house as a body, then heating vents are its
respiratory system. It is no accident that the French word for air
vent is ``soupirail,'' a thing that breathes or sighs. The vent
brings in good air and bad. In the movie ``Outbreak,'' Ms. Kennedy
said, ``the contaminating virus comes through the vents.'' The vent
is an ``illicit communication system.''
</P>
<P>
   Metaphors have not always been a preoccupation of feminist
architecture. In ``The Grand Domestic Revolution'' (MIT Press)
Dolores Hayden writes about a time, a century ago, when feminists
pushed for buildings that would actually thwart ``the economic
exploitation of women's domestic labor.'' To insure that cooking
and child care would be labor that was recognized and paid, they
advocated houses without kitchens, neighborhoods built around
cooperative child care and towns without the usual separation of
private and public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   These early architectural feminists, including Charlotte Perkins
Gilman, Melusina Fay Peirce, Mary Livermore and Ethel Puffer Howes,
believed that buildings could transform society. Their movement,
which Ms. Hayden calls ``material feminism,'' was defeated in 1931,
when the Hoover Commission Report on home building and home
ownership came out. It led to the building of 50 million
traditional single-family homes, Ms. Hayden writes. The revolution
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some women battled on. From 1920 until 1960, a handful of
wealthy, powerful, educated women changed the shape of domesticity.
These women were, as Alice T. Friedman writes in ``Women and the
Making of the Modern House'' (Abrams), the patrons of famous
architects.
</P>
<P>
   Aline Barnsdall had Frank Lloyd Wright design a semipublic
residence, theater and garden for her. Truus Schroeder helped
Gerrit Rietveld design a place to live in which the ``spatial
divisions between mothers and children were broken down.'' Sarah
and Michael Stein commissioned Le Corbusier to design a house with
two equal bedroom suites for a non-nuclear family: a couple, and
the couple's friend and her daughter. And it was for Edith
Farnsworth, a single doctor, that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed
the first glass house, testing the limits of privacy. They proved
that even if society could not be changed altogether, it could be
changed one house at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But now feminists seem to have largely given up on buildings.
Two recent books of essays, ``The Architect: Reconstructing Her
Practice'' (MIT Press), edited by Francesca Hughes, and ``The Sex
of Architecture'' (Abrams), edited by Diana Agrest, Patricia Conway
and Leslie Kanes Weisman, suggest that for many feminist architects
and critics, making metaphors comes before making buildings. Even
architects who design real buildings often let their metaphors
determine their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Ms. Hughes suggests that women are obsessed with the terms
of architecture because they have been excluded from building
buildings. Subverting language, as Catherine Ingraham writes, may
be a stereotypically feminine gambit (think of Scheherazade), but
it is the only recourse.
</P>
<P>
   So the metaphors proliferate. In the land of architecture
everything belongs to one sex or the other. Who decided the sex of
these things? Some terms have been handed down from the Greeks and
others have a more recent origin, but all have been taken up with a
vengeance, literally.
</P>
<P>
   Culture is masculine, nature is feminine. And space, as M.
Christine Boyer writes, has had the ``so-called feminized
characteristics of passivity, inertness'' ever since Plato.
</P>
<P>
   If space is feminine, then the buildings that inhabit space must
be masculine. A house may be masculine, but a home is certainly
feminine. According to Esther Da Costa Meyer, ``The equation of
home and womb'' is ``profoundly engrained.''
</P>
<P>
   And on it goes. Form ``has always been a male preserve,''
Martine De Maeseneer writes, and so ``we are bound to place
function as conceptive and female territory.'' And since function
is feminine, naturally it is repressed. Remember the poor
electrical wire and the sighing air vent, hidden from view.
</P>
<P>
   Of all architectural terms the wall is the most provocative and,
appropriately, the most divisive. As Francoise-Helene Jourda
writes, the wall is a divider. People ``are always trying to have
the best conditions in their buildings,'' while ignoring ``what
goes on outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls are erected to keep nature (feminine) and culture
(masculine) separate. So what about the walls of a building
designed by a woman? The walls that Eileen Gray put up in E. 1027,
the house she built at Cap Martin, France, are less divisive,
Sylvia Lavin suggests, because Gray included ``escape hatches'' and
``leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately her wall also suffered a peculiarly feminine
fate. In 1938 Le Corbusier took over Gray's house and painted his
own murals all over her walls. ``It was a rape,'' Gray's
biographer, Peter Adam, declared. And today many people assume Le
Corbusier designed the house. As Beatriz Colomina writes, the
``defacement of the house went hand in hand with the effacement of
Gray as an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the metaphors are flying. Like Joshua, the
architectural feminists are hoping against hope that if they blow
their trumpets loudly enough, all the walls _ professional,
metaphorical and actual _ will come tumbling down.

RELIGION: FOR THE BUDDHIST CALENDAR, A BUSY FEW WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the number of Americans practicing or at least
interested in Buddhism grows, so, not surprisingly, do the number
of public events associated with Buddhism, and the attention paid
it by the news media and book publishers.
</P>
<P>
   This may well become evident in events the next couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably the 14th Dalai Lama, exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet, is scheduled to give a public lecture in New York's Central
Park on the morning of Sunday, Aug. 15. He will speak about the
essentials of having a life of compassion and happiness, say the
event's organizers, one of which is the Tibet Center, a Tibetan
Buddhist organization in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has been in the city before. But this time one
might say the ground for the visit will be prepared spiritually by
another event in Central Park, Change Your Mind Day, a free program
being offered Saturday to introduce people to Buddhist meditation,
sponsored every year by Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, a magazine
published in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And in something of a coincidence, the public television program
``Religion and Ethics Newsweekly'' will broadcast a two-part report
on the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan exile community, the first
installment being shown in New York Saturday at 10:30 a.m. (and
again Sunday at 6 p.m.) on WNET, Channel 13. (It will be televised
at other times over the weekend in other cities.)
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of the report, the Dalai Lama
discusses his staunch commitment to nonviolence, a topic both
timeless and, in a season scarred by school shootings and the
Balkan war, timely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need human values,'' he tells his interviewer. ``The
troubled family can be a peaceful family, not through money, not
through other means, but through transformation within ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan Buddhists view the Dalai Lama as a reincarnation of his
predecessor. He was born Tenzin Gyatso in 1935, two years after the
13th Dalai Lama died, and has lived outside Tibet, in Dharamsala,
India, since he and many thousands of Tibetans fled a Chinese
military invasion of their homeland 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of Tibet's monasteries that followed has been
well documented. The report broadcast by ``Religion and Ethics
Newsweekly'' says the assault on Tibet's religious life continues,
albeit more subtly. One Tibetan scholar says China is creating a
thoroughly materialistic culture in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama elaborates on his broad vision in a forthcoming
book, ``Ethics for a New Millennium,'' to be published by Riverhead
Books in August. According to a galley copy, he describes his hope
for a spiritual transformation in the world, a movement he says
need not be linked to dogmatic religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a call to turn toward the wider community of beings with
whom we are connected,'' he writes, ``and for conduct that
recognizes others' interests alongside our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has written other books as well, an
autobiography, ``Freedom in Exile'' (HarperCollins, 1990), and
``The Art of Happiness'' (Riverhead, 1999), with Howard Cutler.
</P>
<P>
   The attention given him and his teachings points to the growth
in public interest in Buddhism, said Rande Brown, a member of
Tricycle's board. The magazine's event, Change Your Mind Day, will
take place on Central Park's Great Hill, near West 98th Street,
beginning at 12:30 p.m. Nine teachers, from varying Buddhist
traditions, will offer instruction in silent meditation and
chanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an introduction to meditation itself, and it's also an
introduction to the variety of Buddhist practice,'' Ms. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The first year it was held, in 1994, about 300 people attended.
Ms. Brown estimated that 10 times that number came last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough people wander by and are serendipitously drawn into the
silence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of interest by Buddhist groups elsewhere, similar events
under the same name will be held today in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park and in Williamsport, Pa. And on July 10, in another
example of Buddhism's reach, Buddhists in Alaska will hold an event
of their own at a park in Anchorage.

AT THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, A DRUMMER GETS LUCKY WITH WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The violinists have it easy. When other members of an
orchestra step forward to play solos, as several did Thursday at
the New York Philharmonic, they face harder choices.
</P>
<P>
   Some may get lucky, with the occasional ready-made masterpiece,
as Joseph Robinson did in Richard Strauss' Oboe Concerto. Others
may dig up oddities that are generally neglected, often justly, as
Joseph Alessi did in William Grant Still's Romance for Trombone and
Orchestra. And the truly adventurous may offer pieces newly written
for them, as Christopher Lamb did in Tan Dun's ``Concerto for Water
Percussion and Orchestra in Memory of Toru Takemitsu.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``adventurous'' hardly begins to cover the ground in
this case. In a grand and entertaining circus of a piece, Lamb,
aided by fellow percussionists, was asked to fill some 25 minutes
by audibly manipulating water (patting, pounding, dribbling,
swirling, pouring and splashing) as well as instruments in water,
holding water or evoking water (including a Slinky).
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the orchestra spared adventures of its own, in imitation
or contrast, with ripping or percussive strings and whining or
blaring winds. (The blaring was often done by bare reeds or
mouthpieces: what would so much water be without duck calls?) Here
was a notion worthy of P.D.Q. Bach, though to judge from the
dedication to the Japanese composer Takemitsu, Tan intended it in
all seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   There may indeed have been trenchant comment here on the notion
of virtuoso performance as the very circus act the pianist Glenn
Gould suggested it was when he gave up public performance decades
before he died. But was it music?
</P>
<P>
   Not as we have come to think of music, able to make a coherent
effect through sheer sound. It is hard, for example, to imagine an
audio recording of the work; the effect would be lost on New
Yorkers who already hear gurgles and whooshes coming from the pipes
between the walls of their apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its episodic nature, the work, experienced live,
held at least one semi-jaded audience spellbound and received a
semi-standing ovation. The Chinese-born Tan, coming from a culture
in which the indigenous form of opera is an all-encompassing art
including even acrobatics and slapstick, knows spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he made a listener ponder the nature of music and
its materials, a line of thought that continued as Robinson busily
set about a comparable manipulation of air, transforming flowing,
endless streams of breath into limpid, seamless melody with
masterly ease.
</P>
<P>
   Alessi made much of little in the Still, which backed his fluent
melodism with insipid strains, and Kurt Masur conducted this, like
the rest, with beaming pride in his troops. But the third good
reason to catch this program (which is repeated tonight and on
Tuesday) was something else: a performance of Strauss' ``Till
Eulenspiegel,'' big, boisterous and sly, in which Masur proved
utterly in his element.

   SEMA, Albania _ The sun rises fierce and hot at Camp Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The women are the first out of the olive green tents. They want
water from the new spigots set in fresh concrete squares. The water
trickles, so they wait their turns, hands on hips, talking. Most
are tanned, but a few of the fair-skinned women are burned red. It
is not so sunny in Kosovo, which must seem a sweet, cool dream.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians love conversation. It is perhaps their defining
cultural quality.
</P>
<P>
   For those in Camp Hope, that's a good thing because there are
precious few other ways to pass the time. Each day seems much like
the other, except for the evolving conversation topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the tents, the women make breakfasts of jam and bread and
powerful Turkish coffee. It seems that each family has brought a
set of fine small coffee cups and saucers and can entertain guests
at a moment's notice. You would have to be cold-blooded to be
untouched by this small civility in the most barbaric of
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, there were 3,412 refugees in the U.S. built camp
that eventually will shelter 20,000 and have the distinction of
being Albania's largest shelter. Even if the peace plan holds, camp
planners believe most of these people will spend the winter away
from their homes, either at Camp Hope or someplace like it to be
erected in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Life here revolves around the sun. The kind of sun you find in
south Georgia or central Texas or anywhere in Florida in August. So
blinding in its brightness that you can almost hear it. There is no
wind.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough, the cracked earth is covered with rocks
and gravel, which are light gray and powdery like the surface of
the moon. The heat is reflected up, creating the effect of an oven.
</P>
<P>
   The only shade comes from a concrete water tower, which is used
as a watch tower by U.S. Marines, who provide security.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m. it is already uncomfortably warm. The young children
squint when they emerge from their tents to head to school in a
military tent.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Naim Crchugju. He's 11 and speaks some English, as do his
five brothers who live with him in tent A2-10. There is something
unmistakably American in a refugee camp in which all the residents
have short and simple addresses and wear nametags.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Naim,'' he says with a smile. ``Get it? It sounds
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines call Naim ``Flounder,'' because he reminds them of
the character from the movie ``Animal House.'' It is hard to
overstate the importance of the 150 Marines to the refugees. After
Kosovo, it must be comforting to see such polite, well-trained and
heavily armed men who are duty-bound to protect you. They are
leaving next week, leaving a void that cannot be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Naim is fair-skinned and sunburned. With little inducement, he
will give you a tour of the camp, and try to hold your hand.
``You're my No. 1 friend,'' he says, asking a visitor for access to
a computer. ``The Americans gave my school in Kosovo a computer.
No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   He hates the food, an agonizingly common complaint. In Kosovo,
they ate fresh food from the farm and plenty of milk and cheese.
Here they get beans and bread and whatever else the aid workers can
scrape together. These days they get a lot of what the refugees
call ``Fish in a Prison'' (canned fish).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the teenagers say the sun saps their appetites anyway.
They spend their time smoking and walking up and down the long wide
gravel promenade that runs between the rows of dark green tents.
Every 100 feet or so, they walk past the wooden latrines, which
emit an unspeakable stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so sorry, so sorry,'' says Naim, truly ashamed for the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the heat, the camp seems nearly empty _ except
for poor Marines in bulletproof vests and full battle gear. The
women have taken their small children inside, where the men sit on
their haunches and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The heat begins to break as the sun sets behind a horizon, which
is so flat that the sun lingers as a dull yellow disk before
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening cools, the camp again comes to life. The
promenade is filled with people chattering. The children say
``Hello'' to every adult who isn't obviously Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   It is social hour. People gather in small masses, squatting,
sitting, leaning, full of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about the day, the politics, things like this,''
Naim volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   There are camp lights, which provide the effect of street
lights. It is pitch black outside the camp boundaries, which is
surrounded by miles of plain. Not too far away, you can see lights
coming from the Marines' camp. From time to time, they ride through
on patrols in their jeeps and Humvees.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, the camp is a pleasant place with a clear starry
sky and the strangely familiar feel that you find in camp grounds,
the warm sounds of people taking the night air before readying
their chidden for bed. For a brief period, it is easy to imagine
that the horrors they have seen and the miseries they endure here
are lifted from them.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 p.m., the small children have disappeared again.
Families have lit candles inside their tents, casting warm yellow
glows. Still they talk, but now the conversation is among the 12 or
15 people inside each tent. The talk is muffled and more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Naim must go in. He's greeted by some Marines who have shed
their armament to stroll the promenade. They kid with the boys who
huddle around them.
</P>
<P>
   As it gets later, even the number of teens on the promenade
shrinks to the few smoking cigarettes. The camp begins to be quiet,
except for the roar of the power generator and endless sound of the
heavy trucks and machinery working through the night to ready the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, the tents fall silent, except for a few baby cries
and the distinct voices of men sharing their last thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The moon is full, shining on a lone heavily armed Marine making
his late rounds down the promenade.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the tents are silent. Most, for at least a time,
are in Kosovo once more.

 OOH LA LA, THAT ARCH OF TRIUMPH 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paris Las Vegas will open in September, and the Wall Street
Journal provides a list of Parisianities  &LR; being provided by the
thoughtful planners:
</P>
<P>
   _ A former French waiter who has agreed to grow a mustache
``into a handlebar style'' (apparently deemed French by somebody)
will ride a large tricycle periodically through the lobby. His
vehicle will carry a basket containing fresh bread baked by French
bakers (whose mustaches should be contained in nets).
</P>
<P>
   _ The carpets in the casinos will be patterned on a floral
painting by  &UR; Claude Monet &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _ Housekeepers are being taught to say ``bonjour'' to guests;
valets are instructed to say ``allez, allez'' to each other; and
bartenders are studying history, in particular why the Arc de
Triomphe was built. (It's difficult to know whether this is
forecast as the question customers are most likely to ask the
bartenders, or that the bartenders are expected to make small talk
by bringing this up.)
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Two thousand items from the archives of  &UR; Elvis Presley &LR;  at
Graceland will be auctioned in Las Vegas in September by Guernsey's
auction house. Among the artifacts is a letter from Buckingham
Palace inviting Presley to perform for  &UR; Queen &LR; 
 &UR; Elizabeth &LR; . He said no.

   _ Time magazine completes its list of the 100 Persons of the
Century with this week's ``Heroes and Inspirations'' installment,
which includes  &UR; Harvey Milk &LR; , who is described as a ``gay rights
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Personals found only two other Bay Area figures on the complete
list of 100: BofA founder  &UR; A.P. Giannini &LR; , ``architect of
nationwide banking,'' is included in ``Builders &AMP; Titans''; and
``solid-state physicist''  &UR; William Shockley  &LR; (whose views on race
made him infamous well after the man in the street had forgotten
his Nobel Prize), &LR;  was included in ``Scientists &AMP; Thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ John Munch, the ``Homicide'' character played by  &UR; Richard &LR; 
 &UR; Belzer &LR; , is in negotiations to move from Baltimore to New York and
join ``Special Victims Unit,'' a spin-off of ``Law &AMP; Order'' to
debut this fall. Munch will  &LR; also  &LR; appear from time to time on
``Law &AMP; Order,'' reports the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide'' executive producer  &UR; Tom Fontana &LR;  told the Daily
News that he wished the series had ended less abruptly. `` `St.
Elsewhere' ended,'' he said, `` `Gunsmoke' ended. I wish we could
have written a final episode of `Homicide.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ The San Francisco Zoo wished to tell  &UR; Sophia Loren &LR;  last week
about its own Sophia Loren, a beautiful year-old Magellanic penguin
named after the actress.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ken Maley &LR;  points out that among the four auto license plates
pictured on Subaru ads currently emblazoned on the sides of buses
is one from Colorado, decorated with a rainbow. It was Colorado
that passed anti-gay-rights legislation in 1992 (struck down by the
Supreme Court the following year); the rainbow is a gay and lesbian
icon. The words on the license plate: ``CAMP OUT.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Congratulations from  &UR; Fran Johns &LR;  to the Nob Hill Gazette for
winning the Journalistic Achievement Award bestowed by the American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking at commencement exercises at Duke University's Fuqua
School of Business,  &UR; Ted Turner &LR;  made mention of another celebrity

</P>
<P>
   _ Examining the State Department's on- &LR; line travel advisories in
preparation for a trip she's making this summer,  &UR; Dede Tisone &LR;  came

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6)  
 (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's this for a strategy? Spot some societal or business
problem, and set your scientists to inventing a solution. Buy a
company with marketing expertise in the field, and merge it with
the nascent technology.
</P>
<P>
   Give the scientists-turned-entrepreneurs options on the combined
company's stock and sell, or ``spin out,'' a chunk to the public,
but hold onto as much as 80 percent yourself. Then use the proceeds
to do it again and again.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has been behind both the meteoric rise and the
humiliating fall of the Thermo Electron Corp., the Waltham, Mass.,
conglomerate that spawned 23 fledgling businesses, in areas as
disparate as measurement devices and hair removal, in the last 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   For most of that time, Thermo Electron, which started out as a
diversified technology company, grew briskly and its profits and
share price seemed headed ever upward. But lately, earnings have
tumbled and the stock has tanked, undone by problems at some of the
offspring and by a corporate management stretched too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron's stock, which entered 1998 hovering above $40,
had slipped below $13 by the middle of the year. It has inched back
since then but has yet to reach $20.
</P>
<P>
   Did the fault lie in iffy execution or in a fundamentally flawed
strategy? Or, to ask the question in another way, should anyone
else consider giving the concept a try?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not, said Jack L. Kelly, a conglomerate analyst at
Goldman Sachs. ``Too many public subsidiaries are confusing for
investors, less flexible to manage and unworkable for anyone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely yes, countered Rita McGrath, an associate professor
at the Columbia Business School. ``Having lots of public spinoffs
lets you apply assets and knowledge to many marketplaces and
applies public-market disciplines to inventors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, others chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works only if the parent company's management isn't
psychologically overinvested in the spinout,'' said Steven N.
Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago's
Graduate School of Business, who said the best way to deter
management from pouring more cash into floundering subsidiaries is
to retain only a minority share.
</P>
<P>
   Companies should limit themselves to spinouts in one industry
that they know well and that investors smile upon, added Robert S.
Sullivan, dean of the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler
Business School. ``The strategy is only dangerous if the parent has
majority equity in too many unrelated companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the idea of hatching new businesses out of corporate
behemoths is not unique to Thermo Electron. Numerous companies have
departments that nurture promising technologies. But those
companies generally fold the resulting ventures into their core
businesses, set them up as wholly owned subsidiaries or bring in
partners. Taking the new ventures public is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``An IPO is our least likely exit strategy,'' said Thomas M.
Uhlman, president of the New Ventures Group of Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox Corp., which has taken two small ventures public, is
in no hurry to kick others out of the corporate nest. ``It's easy
to say, `This product is great, let's spin it out,''' said Brian E.
Stern, senior vice president of Xerox Technology Enterprises.
``Well, success takes a strategy and a huge amount of marketing
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron learned that the hard way. Although many of the
subsidiaries remain successful, a bomb-detection spinout, for
example, languished because it had few sales except after terrorist
attacks. And Thermolase, a chain of laser hair-removal salons, is
losing money, in part because its process turned out to have only a
temporary effect.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We got carried away with our own success,'' said George
Hatsopoulos, Thermo Electron's chairman, who voluntarily ceded the
title of chief executive last week to Richard Syron, the former
head of the American Stock Exchange. ``We spun out businesses that
weren't solid and did not meet our criteria for growth potential
and management depth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thermo Electron model has advantages. Stock options in their
own companies can attract and motivate entrepreneurial people,
while the continued involvement of a well-known parent can reassure
investors. The parent can provide legal help and other support at
low cost.
</P>
<P>
   It can give heads of subsidiaries stock options in one another's
companies and in the parent as an inducement to share ideas and
customers. And, by retaining 80 percent stakes in its subsidiaries,
it can consolidate results, avoiding some taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But for each plus there is a minus. Control by the parent
company complicates any business that the spinout may try to do
with its parent's or siblings' competitors. Stocks of newly public
companies often drop when the new company hits any snag, sending
the stock options under water. And there is a temptation to try to
bolster the share price by rushing a product to market too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some analyst writes a bullish report, the stock can soar
beyond the company's reality, and plummet just as quickly when
reality sets in,'' said Howard H. Stevenson, a professor of
business administration at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting burden can be daunting, too. Having 23 public
subsidiaries means producing 23 annual reports, filing 92 quarterly
earnings statements a year, and enduring countless interactions
with analysts and other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Thermo Electron's method is to put the Thermo prefix on
the names of all its subsidiaries, a tactic that lends the new
companies instant credibility but increases the odds that problems
at any one of them will tar the whole group.
</P>
<P>
   ``One subsidiary reports a bad quarter, and investors get the
sense that things aren't right in Thermo-land,'' said Kelly, the
analyst. ``The company's almost too transparent for its own good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatsopoulos himself conceded that ``putting the Thermo name on
everything has been a double-edged sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with hindsight, what will Thermo Electron do now?
</P>
<P>
   First, slim down. It plans to sell some units entirely and buy
others back in _ some to shut down, some to reabsorb. Eventually,
it hopes to whittle down to 11 subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let a part of the company, no matter how small, into the
public eye, you must be sure of what you're doing, and that means
putting an upper limit on the number of spinouts,'' Hatsopoulos
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, the new chief, concurred. ``This isn't a mutual fund with
limited liabilities,'' he said. ``This is a company with
subsidiaries,'' he added, and ``management must be able to oversee
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   From now on, the two men agreed, Thermo Electron will spin out
only companies that have the potential to grow huge and will
probably buy them back when they are mature enough to need
professional management more than entrepreneurial flair. And it
will use them in instrumentation, medical devices and other areas
that Thermo Electron considers its strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we made mistakes,'' Hatsopoulos said. ``But this is
still a business model that will be used widely in the 21st
century.''

bartenders are studying history, in particular why the Arc de
Triomphe was built. (It's difficult to know whether this is
forecast as the question customers are most likely to ask the
bartenders, or that the bartenders are expected to make small talk
by bringing this up.)

   P.S. Two thousand items from the archives of  &UR; Elvis Presley &LR;  at

LAWMAKERS URGE BUSH TO SIGN LEGAL DEFENSE BILL TO HELP POOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A delegation of lawmakers and legal and civil
rights advocates Friday urged Gov. George W. Bush to sign into law
a bill they say will strengthen the way attorneys are appointed to
represent poor people charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (legislation) did not come out of thin air,'' said Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and chief sponsor of Senate Bill 247. ``It
did not come from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed without objection in both houses and is on
the governor's desk awaiting his decision on whether to sign it, to
let it become law without his signature or to veto it. He has until
June 20 to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office, however, has been swamped in recent days with
protests from Harris and other counties asking the governor to veto
the measure. Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.1
million people and is the largest county in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal district judges in Harris County voted unanimously
earlier this week to authorize administrative Judge George Godwin
to urge Bush to veto the measure. They contend it would shift the
power to appoint defense attorneys from trial judges to county
commissioners court. If Bush does not veto it by June 20, it will
become law Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and other supporters of the measure said the legislation
would not require commissioners court to make any changes other
than to hold a public hearing to set a formal policy on appointment
of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Most counties in Texas will likely continue to use the system
they have now, said Jim Allison, general counsel for the &UR;  &LR; County
Judges and Commissioners Association, a group that is supporting
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who ask Gov. Bush to veto it are asking him to defy the
unanimous will of the Legislature,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the current system of allowing the more than 500
district judges in the state to appoint defense attorneys for the
poor has resulted in a ``hodgepodge'' of policies. The legislation
grew out of a State Bar of Texas study of the issue; similar bills
were proposed in 1995 but did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sharlot, dean of the University of Texas School of Law,
said some counties might be concerned that the new system would be
more costly. ``That may be true,'' he said, but the additional
costs might be offset by speedier resolution of legal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Senate Bill 247 would require:
</P>
<P>
   _ Commissioners courts to set a formal policy on the appointment
of defense attorneys for those too poor to hire their own,
including fees to be paid. Counties could elect to have
commissioners make the appointments, allow judges to continue doing
so or hire an outside agency to handle the legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defendants to be provided an attorney within 20 days of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Counties to report annually information on the court
appointments; a new office of court administration would review
counties' compliance with state law and the constitutional
requirements that indigent defendants be provided a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he sponsored the legislation because abuses in the
current system, which allows judges to appoint defense attorneys
and decide how much to pay them, is flawed. There is ample
evidence, he said, for why the system of defense attorney
appointments should be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a court-appointed attorney in a capital
murder trial several years ago slept through portions of the trial,
which resulted in a death sentence. He also cited an instance in
which two disabled defendants were jailed four years awaiting trial
on minor charges because court-appointed counsel did not know the
procedures for getting the men transferred to a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he expects the governor will withhold a decision on
whether to sign the bill until close to the June 20 deadline so the
he can study the measure.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Ellis said, he will be on a business trip in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to be over there in South Africa celebrating
democracy in South Africa and find out that things got pretty
undemocratic over here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he added, ``It could get ugly. If it is vetoed
there is another side to my personality.''

COUNTRY SINGER LEAVES THE SONGWRITING TO OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tim McGraw is known in Nashville as a singer with
a strong song sense. That's why he and his producers plowed through
a couple thousand tunes before deciding on the right material for
his current best seller, ``A Place in the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncomposer himself, McGraw knows right off the bat if a song
is right for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've turned down songs that have been big hits for other
people, but I've never regretted it,'' he said. ``I look for stuff
that puts things in a way I would put it in that situation. It's a
gut instinct. It's about finding things I like that affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw is clearly affecting lots of other people, too. ``A Place
in the Sun'' (Curb), McGraw's fifth long-player, soared to the top
of both the pop and country albums charts upon release. The
haunting power ballad, ``Please Remember Me,'' has been glued to
the top of the country singles list for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That song, penned by Will Jennings (``My Heart Will Go On'') and
Rodney Crowell, was cut twice previously _ by Crowell for a solo
album and as a duet by Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both versions stiffed,'' Jennings said. ``Then Rodney took
some songs over to (McGraw's co-producers) Byron Gallimore and his
wife, Missi, and they picked it out of the pile. Tim's a powerful
singer. He's got this interesting voice that delivers with a lot of
passion. And they did a great job producing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallimores are the clearinghouse for most of McGraw's songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team that really works,'' McGraw, 32, offered. ``We
know each other so well, personally and professionally. They work
really hard with all the publishers and writers to find what's
right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw _ who appears July 3 at the Blockbuster Pavilion with the
Dixie Chicks _ recently won two Academy of Country Music awards for
male vocalist and vocal collaboration (for his duet with wife Faith
Hill on ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me'').
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accolades, McGraw calls himself a fan above all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate songwriters,'' he says. ``I look for
things I'd want to hear on the radio that I'd like to sing.
Hopefully, all these elements combine in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   With album sales topping 13 million and single sales to 4
million since the release of his self-titled debut in 1992, McGraw
knows his fan base reaches beyond country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cut records, I know I'm a country singer, but I also
like all kinds of music, and that reflects in the tracks and
melodies,'' he said last week. ``It allows people who may not be
country fans to hear my music. You can get criticized for having
pop success, but the good thing is, it turns more people on to
country music. When pop fans get into something like the Dixie
Chicks or Shania Twain, they start listening to country radio and
hearing other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw is having a busy year. In addition to playing 18 stadium
dates with George Strait, he kicks off his ``A Place in the Sun
Tour'' with the Dixie Chicks early next month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he hopes to play some clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to where I started,'' he explained. ``We're
definitely going to play some clubs. I don't know where or when,
but we are going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's McGraw's annual New Year's Eve bash at the
Nashville Arena: ``It's going to be the biggest and best show we've
ever done. We're pulling out all the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all though, the Louisiana-bred country star is hoping
for a little downtime with the wife and kids. He and Hill live in
Nashville with their two toddler daughters, Grace and Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is some time off to be at home, take a vacation
and be with the family,'' McGraw declared. ``I'd also like to do a
live album at some point. And I want to coach my girls' Little
League team.'' &QL;

AOL QUICKENS THE TEMPO OF INTERNET MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last fall and winter, we ran a series of stories
about what the Internet was doing to the music business, as bands
and labels started using it to sell their music, college kids used
it to pirate their favorite tunes, and fans of radio used it to
bypass that medium's limits of time, distance, money and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, things have gotten crazy. Both the recording
industry and major players such as IBM and Microsoft have joined
the fray, facing a slew of new and established smaller Net-only
companies, all trying to get a piece of the business of moving
music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The latest gorilla to jump into this jungle was AOL, which
announced this week that it is buying both Spinner.com and
Nullsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner, one of the more interesting Internet ``radio'' sites
(at www.spinner.com), uses streaming audio to let you custom create
playlists from the kinds of music you want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft mostly works the other side of the online music, with
its Winamp program, which lets you download and listen to music
encoded in MP-3, the Internet's favorite audio compression format.
</P>
<P>
   The interest and cold cash of the Net's biggest real-estate
owner should further accelerate music's move online. It also has
interesting implications for one of those small, established
companies mentioned earlier, like MusicMatch Inc. in San Diego,
whose top officials stopped by for a visit just as the AOL
purchases were being announced.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes the MusicMatch Jukebox, which strives to be
the MP-3 Swiss Army knife, and competes partially with Winamp. So
far theirs has been a friendly enough competition.
</P>
<P>
   MusicMatch bills the jukebox as the best-selling MP-3 software
in the world (though its basic version is now given away), and it
is bundled with two of the first portable MP-3 players, Diamond's
Rio and Creative Technology's Nomad.
</P>
<P>
   Jukebox will play CDs in your computer, create MP-3 files from
those discs or many other audio sources, organize the files with a
sophisticated array of filters, and put them into playlists that
you can invoke for different situations and moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to turn the PC into the coolest part of a stereo
system,'' said CEO Dennis Mudd, a Wharton grad who spent a dozen
years with Hewlett-Packard before starting MusicMatch.
</P>
<P>
   Mudd's not doing too badly: 1 million copies of Jukebox are
downloaded each month, with an estimated 3.5 million ``active''
users. The company brings in nearly $1 million a month and is
making a profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers looked good enough that yet another kiloton-sized
gorilla, German electronics giant Thomson Electronics, recently
bought 20 percent of the company for undisclosed terms. Thomson is
best-known in this country for owning RCA, but not incidentally, it
is co-holder of the patent for MP-3 compression.
</P>
<P>
   The beta version of Jukebox 4.0 has been available (at
www.musicmatch.comjukebox) for about a month and is about to reach
its final release version.
</P>
<P>
   It allows you to radically customize your player's look;make
good-quality recordings (you can upgrade to a ``gold version'' that
allows CD-quality recordings at sampling rates that are three times
higher); and recording tools such as fade control and 12-channel
recording. Expect a Macintosh version of the software this summer,
Mudd said.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated recording tools are there, in part, because
Mudd believes that in three years, we'll have a very different
array of stereo equipment than now, and at its center will be a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the computer will become a key tool to find and play
music,'' Mudd said. ``It probably won't look a lot like a PC, it'll
probably be part of a stereo rack.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting he's right. Here's a scenario to ponder in coming
months and years: Take those snazzy programmable remote-control
devices coming out now to run your home theater and stereo system.
Cross that with whatever they'll call the Palm Pilot in a couple of
generations (the Palm VII already has limited wireless Web
connectivity).
</P>
<P>
   The result? A handheld machine that runs everything at the touch
of a virtual button, and finds the music on the Net you want,
whether it's digital ``radio'' or downloads that you can store on
that massive next-generation Tivo media player. And when you leave
the house, the handheld will take the tunes with you. There's a
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of MP-3, the site that has championed the format
most loudly will be holding a big confab June 14-15 in San Diego on
the future of music on the Internet. Go to MP3.com at www.mp3.com
for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Michael Robertson, MP3.com's brash and pugnacious CEO,
the conference should have some substantial entertainment value, if
nothing else. Despite MP-3's copyright protection problems, it's
starting to stick in a lot of places, so this conference should be
a good place to get a sense of what's going on. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DVD `Dreams'
</P>
<P>
   Polygram Video's new DVD release of ``What Dreams May Come,''
the sumptuous effects-laden romance of last year, comes with some
nifty extras for folks with the right equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a film that won an Oscar for best visual effects, the
DVD includes commentary from both the director and the
visual-effects supervisor on how they created the Boschian images
of heaven and hell that comprise so much of the film, and a
``making of'' documentary on the film's production challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes an alternate ending to the film, something you
may see in more and more films on DVD (see if those marketing
mavens and test audiences were right the first time). And for
people with DVD-ROM players on their computer, the disc includes
desktop images or wallpaper for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD also comes with many of the standard extras, such as
cast and crew information, production notes, the theatrical
trailers and a photo gallery of set designs and behind-the-scenes
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Another welcome addition to the DVD world is Columbia's
collector's edition of ``Taxi Driver,'' the great 1976 Martin
Scorsese film featuring Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd and an
adolescent Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The dual-layer disc comes with remastered audio and video, the
celebrated screenplay by Paul Schrader, storyboards, a photo
gallery and all the usual other odds and ends. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kickin' it
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation is trying to boost television
viewership through the Web, particularly in this year where the
American team is a favorite to win the women's World Cup
competition. Register at the USSF's Web site (www.us-soccer.com)
and the federation will send e-mail reminders of upcoming televised
matches of the U.S. men's and women's national teams, and inside
info on the players and coaches involved. This sort of approach
will soon be common, I'm betting, for lots of entertainment
organizations trying to build close relationships with fans of
their teams, bands and other kinds of performers.

HASTERT WILL REWRITE SPENDING BILLS TO SHIFT EASE CUTS IN SOCIAL
PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
(rm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, his bills stymied and
his control of the House insecure, has decided to rewrite
Republican spending plans and shift some money from increased
military spending to ease cuts in social programs like health and
education, key aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert will tell the House Republican caucus on Monday that
``we're going to trim off some of the allocations for defense,
treasury, the legislative branch, and feed some of that back'' into
bills financing programs for labor, health and human services,
education, housing and veterans' affairs, a senior Republican aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a work in progress,'' said John Feehery,
spokesman for Hastert. ``We are going to have to fight each bill.''
So far, the House has failed to pass a single one of the 13
separate appropriations measures that finance the government for
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, five months into his tenure, is having a hard time
carrying out the Republican strategy: to be the party of national
defense and fiscal discipline, pour billions into new Pentagon
spending, freeze or cut everything else, and pass the spending
bills on time and in good order. Now, only the Pentagon's windfall
seems assured.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original plan for the coming year, the Defense
Department received $19 billion more than this year; domestic
programs received $26 billion less. Under the evolving plan,
several billion dollars would be transferred from the military
ledger into domestic programs. Military spending would still rise
and domestic spending would still fall, but by less than first
planned. No final figures are set.
</P>
<P>
   The new goal is to restore cuts in domestic spending that
moderate Republicans find intolerable, keep at least some
conservatives happy, and win over enough moderate Democrats to pass
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The shift would bring the House spending plan closer to the
Senate's. But with a perilously slim 223-212 majority in the House,
Hastert needs Republican unity to pass anything. He lacks it. And
House Democrats will do little to help him.
</P>
<P>
   When he became speaker, Hastert vowed to pass the spending bills
on time.
</P>
<P>
   The year's first major spending measure, a $60.8 billion
agriculture bill, was derailed last week by fiscal conservatives
who wanted to block all such bills until there was a plan for
protecting the Social Security surplus. Then Hastert could not
summon the votes to bring a $289 billion defense authorization bill
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans' conservatives are in revolt, their
moderates frustrated and their leadership red-faced. They recall
the 1998 budget breakdown and the 1995 government shutdown and
worry that their slim majority may be threatened if they appear
inept.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders ``can't communicate a strategy to their
members, they can't communicate a strategy to the American people,
and if they can't do that, they are going to be in a world of hurt
when they go up against the Democrats in 2000'' said Peter Sperry,
a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where spending bills traditionally originate,
Republicans have allocated $270 million for the Pentagon and $268
billion for every other arm of the government in fiscal 2000. That
latter sum, expressed as a percentage of the American economy, is
the lowest allocation for domestic spending since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   And the way that sum was divided among the 13 House
appropriations subcommittees set moderate Republican chairmen
howling that the wealth was spread too thin. To Hastert's left,
liberals warned that the Republican plan starved needy people and
worthy programs. To his right, conservatives promised to hew to the
cuts, stop dipping into surplus Social Security revenues, and keep
the spending caps enacted by Congress and the White House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The caps held the budget down and helped create the surplus, but
both Republicans and Democrats are asking if they still make sense
in an era of economic prosperity. Hastert says the caps were a
solemn promise to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hastert, prodded by his two Texas colleagues, the
majority leader, Dick Armey, and the Majority Whip, Tom DeLay, came
up with two new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One aims to shift responsibility, or blame, for increased
spending to individual members. A key Republican aide said the idea
would ``keep the caps but insert a trigger'' to blow them away.
``If members want to, they could vote on cap-busting amendments,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other idea ``was changing the allocations, working with
chairmen to take a whole new approach,'' another senior Republican
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   That would redistribute billions from the bills financing the
Department of Defense, Congress, the Treasury Department and the
Postal Service. The money would be shifted to two other bills. One
finances the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education, which took a $10.7 billion cut in this year's plan, from
$88.8 billion to $78.1 billion. The other, for housing, urban
development, veterans and several independent agencies, took a $5.7
billion cut, from $71.9 billion to $66.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce, Justice and State Departments, which face a $3
billion cut, and the Interior Department, cut by $2.6 billion, also
might also see some money restored.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans have promised to stop the spending
bills in their tracks unless each one is cut or frozen at last
year's level. That forces Hastert find 13 magic numbers: sums that
will allow the 13 bills to win 218 votes in in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot, he will face a reprise of last year's last-minute
free-for-all spending bill, loaded with $21 billion of extras
financed from the Social Security surplus, or a repeat of the 1995
government shutdown. In each event, House Republicans lost face,
President Clinton gained political capital, and programs the
Republicans wanted to cut or kill won new life.

PLANTS CAN GROW IN ALMOST ANYTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some things just aren't meant to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Container gardens are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But they're great to add color to an empty corner of a patio, a
bare balcony, a table at an outdoor wedding reception or theme
barbecue. Their life span can range from a few weeks to several
months, but _ even with the heartiest, longest-lived plants _ fans
of container gardening will find themselves replanting next spring
or sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For permanence, plants are happiest in the ground,'' said
Teddy Howell, horticulture chairwoman for the West Valley Garden
Club in the San Fernando Valley and a fan of things growing in
pots. ``A color bowl isn't intended to last for 50 years like a
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The gardener, who grows herbs, succulents and orchids in pots on
her patio, likens a miniature garden in a pot to cut flowers: They
last a bit, then it's time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty for effect,'' she said. ``If you want something to
dress up your back yard for an event, color bowls with summer
flowers are great. You can plant them in any color you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you'll see when there are too many plants: You'll notice
that they'll begin to wither and die. In others, some plants will
just take over, and you'll end up with just one plant. In the end,
there just won't be enough room for the roots to grow, and that's
when you have to take them out and plant them in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In assembling a container garden _ perhaps an herb garden for
the summer, or a pot of colorful annuals to brighten up a porch or
a windowsill _ the container can be just about anything that will
hold soil and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Got an old shoe with a hole in it? Maybe a pretty ceramic bowl
you accidentally cracked? Even a deflated basketball will do if
you're creative enough to see the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, fourth-graders at West Hollywood Elementary School
planted a garden of strawberries and marigolds and learned as much
about what to plant a garden in as they did what to plant. They
experimented with plants grown in everything from cardboard boxes
(not a success) to straw hats (fine when lined with plastic with
drainage holes punched in it).
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardboard's not good, 'cause it gets soggy when you water it,
and it falls apart,'' said Jonathan Dean, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's not enough oxygen for the roots, so they get root
rot and die,'' added Jasmine Bailey, 10.
</P>
<P>
   A tennis shoe's too small for anything to grow in, and so is a
paper cup, unless you're just starting a seed you plan to
transplant, they said. Kevin Alveres, 10, had better luck planting
his garden in a football helmet, and others coddled plants along in
tin cans, quart-sized yogurt containers, plastic bottles with the
tops cut off, and even a hollowed-out watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The watermelon won't last long,'' said Amber Ahmed, 10. ``But
it'd be good for a party, for a few days, maybe a week. Then, the
melon will go bad and you have to put the plants in something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   To plant in a container, gently remove a seedling or small plant
from its pot, shake a bit of the dirt off the roots, and gently
cover them with potting soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to spread the roots out like a dress,'' explained
Sabrina Dragan, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Plants just dumped out of their tiny pots and jammed into a
larger container of soil tend to die because their roots never
spread to take in water and fertilizer and help the plant grow
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Both the West Hollywood kids and Howell warned against frequent
but light watering, saying that forces the plant's roots upward and
exposes them to the air, which dries them out and kills the plant.
Deep watering less frequently _ although more often when the summer
grows hot and dry _ is better, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to tell when your container garden needs watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just put your finger in the dirt, and if it feels dry, you
put more water in,'' advised Sonia Cano, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Howell also fertilizes her container gardens every two weeks
with high-nitrogen fertilizer from January until August, then
switches to a high-phosphorus and high-potassium fertilizer once a
month until after New Year's Day to encourage blooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fertilize because when you're growing things in
pots, there's no way that nature can create all these nutrients,
like it would if they were in the ground,'' Howell said. ``You have
to be the caretaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Careless gardeners can kill even a successful plant, cautioned
the young gardeners. When a flower wilts, clip it off rather than
break it off, or you might yank the whole plant right out of the
soil, they warned. The same goes for herbs, which can grow unruly
if not trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbs growing too big in a container generally aren't a
problem,'' Howell said. ``You're going to keep clipping off the top
and using it to cook. That's the best kind of container garden.'' &QL;

CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF A MODEL PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most things don't work out as planned, some things go roughly as
planned, and a few things work out much better than planned.
</P>
<P>
   In that third category we place City Year, the Boston-based
national volunteer youth service corps that became the model for
AmeriCorps, the Clinton administration's domestic version of the
Peace Corps. City Year is 10 years old, and the
volunteer-for-a-year service corps is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   It's biggest boosters? Clinton &AMP; Clinton. The First Mom &AMP; Pop
latched onto the City Year idea initially when they were running
around the country in campaign mode in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw City Year I knew that I had found the concrete,
living, breathing embodiment of what I thought politics ought to be
about,'' Clinton told 1,000 City Year volunteers two weeks ago in
Washington. On Friday it was Hillary's turn, showing up at Faneuil
Hall for the 10th anniversary of the enterprise that is a model,
wedding entrepreneurial and non-profit traits with corporate and
government backing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you call it ``the New Covenant,'' as he did in his first
campaign, or ``the so-called Third Way,'' as liberal political
parties that move to the center are labelled, said Clinton, ``It
simply means that government can't solve all our problems, but it
can't leave people to sink or swim on their own, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``It means that we have an obligation, all of us,
to give every single person the tools to make the most of his or
her life. It means that we have an obligation, together, to create
opportunity for those who have been forgotten, to take
responsibility for the welfare of not only ourselves and our
families, but of our whole community.''
</P>
<P>
   For both Clintons, celebrating City Year in two different cities
two weeks apart was a welcome change from the visit the couple made
recently to Littleton, Colo., and the Columbine high school
students whose high school year collapsed in gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that community service can have a profound impact on
diminishing, even erasing, the sense of alienation and isolation so
many of our young people feel,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, ``We talked to the young people still in their
wheelchairs from their grievous wounds.'' The president said ``one
of the things that struck me so strongly, in following all the
accounts of what happened, and what could have motivated those two
young men to descend into darkness, and take the actions they did,
was the repeated description of the sense of alienation they felt
-- that they and their group were somehow looked down on by others
in their school, and that in reaction, they not only felt
bitterness against those who were looking down on them, they turned
around and looked for someone else to look down on.''
</P>
<P>
   Using language very similar to the words he used in urging
Kosova refugees to forgive their Serb oppressors, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an endless cycle, Everybody has a beef in life,
Everybody! Everybody has resentments because of slights or
mistreatment, whether imagined or real. A big part of living is
finding ways to overcome your own smallness, to get out of your own
skin -- to let go of all the things not only tghat you have
imagined have happened to you, but things that have really happened
to you, that should not have.''
</P>
<P>
   The two shooters at Columbine became ''trapped in their own
fears and resentments and hatreds,'' and ``they must have drifted
to get to the point where they could literally dehumanize the other
children. ...''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he hailed the assembled thousand volunteers, as ``the
America we have, the America we're going to be; we're growing more
and more diverse.'' You're the future, Clinton said. ``I'm telling
you, you can reach the poor in spirit amoung our youngf. You can
tell them that no matter what has happened, no matter what's
bugging them, no matter who is dissing them, no matter what they
have a beef about, real or imagined, what you're doing is a better
way to live, and they ought to join you and live that way too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill's a believer.
</P>
<P>
   City Year started with a Boston pilot project ten years ago,
enlisting 50 young people, public school kids and prepsters, black
and white, Hispanic and Asian, from city and suburb.
</P>
<P>
   That summer-long commitment began with a three-day outing on
Thompson's Island in Boston Harbor, utilizing techniques from
retreats and encounter groups that welded the disparate individuals
into a team that assembled weekday mornings on Boston Common to do
calesthenics in their trademark chinos-and-T-shirt work duds.
</P>
<P>
   The early money came from BankBoston and four other corporate
sponsors, and the enterprise has expanded every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Mike Brown and Alan Khazei in Boston as a framework
to harness the energy and idealism of young people who wanted to
improve society, City Year caught a break when candidate Clinton in
1991 was casting about for ways to plug young people into grass
roots community work. ''And when I went to City Year in Boston, the
lights came on and I said 'this is what I want to do'.''
</P>
<P>
   With the founding AmeriCorps in 1994, the City Year model became
the blueprint for a national service corps that has given America
the fruits of a year of organized effort by 100,000 young
Americans. City Year has prospered as well. From Boston it expanded
to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, San Antoni, San Jose,
Seattle, Columbia, SC., Columbus, OH, and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers between 17 and 24 give up a year for a weekly stipend
and a college scholarship grant upon completion. There are nearly
1,000 current City Year volunteers, and 3,981 alumni. The computer
geeks calculate these kids contributed over 5.8 million hours of
community service in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   So there was lots to celebrate Friday at Faneuil Hall with
Hillary Clinton leading the cheers. The First Lady was in town for
a Boston Medical Center speech and her 30th Wellesley College
reunion, and generating buzz about her announcement of an
exploratory committee to plan for a potential race for a US Senate
seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bain Capital, BankBoston and Timberland Co. each kicked in $1
million Friday to endow corporate-sponsored City Year teams for the
next 50 years. On top of that, Holly Davidson, Sidney and Judy
Swartz, and Paul and Phyllis Fireman each committed another $1
million each towards endowment projects. Compaq Computer also
donated a $1 million gift.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brown and Alan Khazei had the idea, and the knack for
persuading businessmen and politicians that the idea was solid, and
the proof was on display Friday afternoon at Faneuil Hall.

 &HT;    Freedom is sought for CARE employees
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Saying that a new wave of international humanitarian
aid workers will be needed to rebuild Yugoslavia now that peace is
near, the Rev. Jesse Jackson came to Atlanta on Friday to urge
Yugoslav authorities authorities to release three CARE workers he
said were convicted and imprisoned on false charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rest until all the captives have been set free, and
leaders on all sides have made a decision to study war no more,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights activist and former presidential candidate
succeeded in May in securing the release from Yugoslavia of three
American soldiers. He said he is prepared to return to Belgrade, if
necessary, to try to negotiate the release of the CARE workers.
</P>
<P>
   The three men _ two Australians and a Yugoslav _ work for CARE
Australia. The two Australians, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace,
stayed in Belgrade after other workers were evacuated. They were
detained March 31, a week after NATO forces began bombing
Yugoslavia, as they tried to cross into Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav staff member, was arrested about a week
later in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was shown April 11 on Serbian TV, confessing to having
used his position with CARE to perform covert intelligence
activities. Peter Bell, the president of CARE USA, which is based
in Atlanta, said he believes the confession was coerced and false.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of spying against the three were dropped. Instead, they
were convicted May 29 at a closed military trial of passing secret
information to a foreign organization _ namely CARE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three CARE captives are innocent,'' Bell said. ``They have
committed no crime. They are being held prisoner essentially for
having done their humanitarian jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, CARE rendered assistance not only to ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, but also to Serbian refugees from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Bell were joined at a news conference by Malcolm
Fraser, a former prime minister of Australia who is chairman of
CARE Australia's Board of Directors, and former Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young, a member of CARE USA's Board of Overseers. The
meeting was held at National Park Service Visitor's Center across
Auburn Avenue from the Martin Luther King Center, and afterward the
four men laid a wreath on King's tomb, held hands and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said he had been assured by senior officials of the U.S.
State Department that the fate of the three will not be forgotten
in negotiations with Yugoslav authorities over implementation of
the peace agreement. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and outgoing
South African President Nelson Mandela have also intervened on the
workers' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that, with refugees returning and winter not far off,
humanitarian workers will be needed to provide food and shelter _
and the safety of humanitarian workers must be assured.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser agreed. ``If, as seems likely, this wretched war is
coming to an end, the humanitarian need in Yugoslavia is going to
be massive,'' he said.

 KAREN E. McGRATH: STRONG BLUE CHIP 100 FUND  
 (ART ADV: Graphic of Strong Blue Chip 100 fund is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karen E. McGrath, manager of the Strong Blue Chip 100 fund, grew
up on a farm, where her family's philosophy was not to put too many
eggs in one basket. So it is a comfort to her that the fund's $425
million in assets are divided between two portfolio strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Blue Chip 100 is invested in 20 to 25 companies from
among the 100 American stocks with the largest market
capitalizations _ those that she judges as having the best
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The other half is an index portfolio of those 100 large-cap
stocks, aimed at keeping the total portfolio from withering if her
stock picks hit a dry spell. ``It's there to reduce the volatility
of the concentrated portion,'' Ms. McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, she uses cash flows and reserve cash to maintain the
balance between the concentrated and indexed halves of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Chip 100 is not diversified in the conventional
sense. In some ways, its investors are buying a large-cap index
fund with booster rockets. (Strong Funds, the fund's adviser,
declined to break out the performance of the two halves of the
portfolio.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, large-cap growth stocks have yielded bumper returns
recently. Since its inception in July 1997, the Blue Chip 100 has
returned 30.3 percent, annualized, through May 28, versus 23.8
percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and 25 percent
for the average large-cap growth fund, according to Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. ``I have to admit, I didn't
anticipate this kind of extraordinary performance,'' Ms. McGrath
said. ``I had the wind at my back.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the fund's lead has narrowed as large-cap growth
stocks have lost their luster. Through May 28, the fund was up 5.9
percent, compared with 6.3 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 and 5.2 percent
for large-cap growth funds over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be moments when you need to rest,'' Ms. McGrath
said. ``I think with these companies, as they rest, the earnings
catch up and interest returns to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath, 61, also manages portfolios for retirement plans
and wealthy families. Composite returns for her growth-stock
accounts averaged 31.2 percent annually over the three years ended
March 31, according to Strong, compared with 28 percent for the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   She calls herself a long-term investor and likes companies with
projected earnings growth rates that are greater than the market's
over the next three years. And while she is willing to pay more for
shares of companies with superior earnings estimates, she shies
away from those with what she considers ``inflated''
price-to-earnings ratios _ too far above the market average to be
justified by future earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the first of the year, I've sort of taken my foot off
the accelerator,'' she said. For example, she has stopped adding to
her positions in some high-P/E, high-growth stocks, like Microsoft.
``There are many of them that I like,'' she said, ``but I have been
waiting to buy them at somewhat better prices.'' And she is quick
to sell if a company's earnings fail to fulfill expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fund's inception, Ms. McGrath has kept a position in
Worldcom, now MCI Worldcom, in the concentrated, actively managed
portion of the fund. ``This is among the best-positioned companies
in the telecommunication services industry,'' she said. ``They have
put together their own network for full service of voice, data and
Internet, and on a worldwide basis.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she expects continuing revenue growth of about 18
percent a year for the company, with net profit margins, which are
currently negative, improving. She estimated annual earnings growth
of 35 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Her first purchase of Worldcom was at $31 a share in July 1997.
MCI Worldcom closed at $89.75 on Friday, and she thinks it could
hit $115 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath bought Chase Manhattan shares for the actively
managed portion of the fund in October 1997 at $60. Chase now
trades at $74.3125, ``and I would think a target of around $100
would be reasonable over the next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She expects annual earnings growth of about 13 percent over the
next three to five years for Chase, which she praises for
concentrating on its core financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strong and conservative management that I like,''
she said. ``They'll be careful and not pay too much for an
acquisition, and they'll be sure that they have completed the
integration of what they have done in the past, not overwhelm
themselves with too many acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath is bullish on technology, too. She bought Texas
Instruments, the semiconductor giant, at $64 a share in November.
It is now at $118.875; her target is $130 in a year.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ms. McGrath is happy that Texas Instruments is
not a major competitor in the hotly contested computer chip market
and is instead focused on ``digital signal processors,'' chips used
widely in wireless telephones, disk drives and communication
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath says the slump in the semiconductor industry is
ending. ``We're coming out of that cycle,'' she said. She estimates
earnings growth of 20 percent a year for Texas Instruments in the
next two years.

WHAT IS THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things made a huge difference in Peter Senge's life. His
father, an Eastman Kodak executive, was transferred to California
when he was a boy. So he grew up as a witness to profound and
unanticipated change _ social, cultural, economic, environmental.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Senge came from Stanford to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology as a graduate student, he met Jay
Forrester. Forrester, a computer pioneer who left engineering to
develop what he called ``systems dynamics,'' was a commanding
presence at MIT _ but a fringe figure in its intellectual life, an
autodidact who had set out to reinvent economics.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost ten years now since Senge distilled Forrester's
views on the counterintuitive behavior of social systems in ``The
Fifth Discipline.' A couple of workbooks have followed, including
recently ``The Dance of Change: The Challenges to Sustaining
Momentum in a Learning Organization.''' Senge's book has acvhieved
the status of a management classic.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is the Fifth Discipline?
</P>
<P>
   The first four disciplines in Senge's schema _ make that
``component technologies'' of corporate cultures, if you like _ are
familiar enough to those of us who think about our lives in
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Personal mastery has to do with individual vision and
dedication. Whatever it is that makes a master craftsman, this is
it: a private, passionate commitment to lifelong acquisition of new
skills and improvement of old ones through learning.
</P>
<P>
   Mental models are the assumptions, myths, stereotypes, pictures,
and images that inform personal understanding. These mostly
unconscious ``scenarios,'' in the parlance made familiar by the
planners at Royal Dutch Shell, have great power to guide workers to
opportunities _ or blind them.
</P>
<P>
   Shared visions are like mental models, except that they are
blunt and widely held. They are the stories that bind individuals
to a common purpose in an organization. They may be extrinsic (``I
was taught to hate the Russians, Yale and the Brigham and Women's
Hospital,'' says the Massachusetts General Hospital surgeon) or
intrinsic (ordinary people empowered by computers was the shared
vision of the founders of Apple Computer; people want styling was
for many years the shared vision of General Motors.)
</P>
<P>
   Team learning, the fourth discipline, builds on personal mastery
and shared vision but goes beyond it into the realm of
improvisation, says Senge. ``The great jazz ensemble has talent and
a shared vision (even if they don't discuss it), but what really
matters is that the musicians know how to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Discipline, says Senge, is systems thinking, the habit
of seeing interdependent wholes and fathoming their logic. Among
the ``laws'' of the Fifth Discipline identified by thinkers as
various as Garrett Hardin, Indries Shah, Jay Forrester, Donella
Meadows, and Kahlil Gibran:
</P>
<P>
   Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior grows better before it grows worse.
</P>
<P>
   The easy way out usually leads back in.
</P>
<P>
   The cure can be worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Faster is slower.
</P>
<P>
   Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space.
</P>
<P>
   The areas of the highest leverage are often least obvious.
</P>
<P>
   You can have your cake and eat it to _ but not at once.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing an elephant in half does nor produce two small
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   There is no blame for failure _ the ``cure'' lies in your
relationship with your ``enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fifth Dimension'' has sold more than 600,000 copies, and
catapulted Senge into the front ranks of management gurus, along
with Tom Peters, Michael Porter, Henry Mintzberg, John Kotter,
Rosabeth Moss Kanter and a handful of others. For a time in the
1990s, enthusiasm for the ``learning organization'' was rivaled
only by the ``re-engineering'' craze. That in turn brought about
Senge's separation from MIT (he remains a senior lecturer at the
school's Sloan School of Management.)
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, Senge worried about what would happen
when the fad began to fade. After all, Total Quality Management
(TQM), among the most widespread movements of the 1980s, petered
out in two thirds of the organizations in which it was tried for
lack of hoped-for results. Re-engineering didn't do much better.
</P>
<P>
   So Senge now pins his hopes now on a pair of unusual
institutions. His Society for Organizational Learning, spun out of
MIT into an East Cambridge office park, welds together employees at
all levels in a couple of dozen organizations and corporations _
the American Medical Association, the World Bank, AT&AMP;T, Chrysler
Corp., Federal Express and Pratt and Whitney _ in an ongoing
experiment in ``capacity building'' that is overseen by a small
staff, 56 academic research fellows and 106 consultant members.
</P>
<P>
   Senge also has assembled and maintained a small team of writers
who have produced two attractive workbooks designed to help
managers implement his ideas, ``The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook''
and now ``The Dance of Change.'' These include Charlotte Roberts
and Richard Ross, a pair of consultants; Bryan Smith, an
international vice president of Arthur D. Little; George Roth,
director of the Ford-MIT Research and Development Project; and Art
Kleiner, author of ``The Age of Heretics,'' a lively study of
management practices.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the Fifth Disciple really? It is a ``community of
inquiry and experimentation'' of some tens of thoudand of disciples
distributed about equally among big US corporations and the
education establishment. The editorial dogma resembles in style and
content the Whole Earth Catalog of a few years back. It is not for
everybody. But it is good stuff.

HANDICAPPING WALL STREET AS OLD LINE GOES ON LINE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In hindsight, rather than extolling the Internet, maybe
securities firms should have advised customers to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Now the retail brokerage business, which generated about $12.8
billion in commissions in 1997, is getting a comeuppance because of
low-cost, on-line trading.
</P>
<P>
   The latest _ and biggest _ blow to the primacy of
flesh-and-blood brokers came last week, when Merrill Lynch said
that by December it would offer on-line trading for as little as
$29.95 a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could generate huge savings for its five million
customers. Less obvious, however, is how Merrill will recoup the
big chunk of change it will lose.
</P>
<P>
   The market has apparently decided that there is no positive
answer to that question, and most brokerage stocks have moved
sharply lower since Merrill made its move.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst who follows Wall Street firms for
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., talked last week about Merrill's
announcement. Here are some excerpts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Just how big a deal is Merrill's move?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is hard to overstate the significance of this. It is a sea
change in the retail brokerage business. Managements at all of
these firms are going to have to craft responses to what Merrill
has just announced in very short order.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional businesses of firms like Merrill, Dean Witter
and Smith Barney have never experienced pricing pressure, and now
they are. And we are not talking about taking prices down by 20
percent, but by 90 percent. For some time, we had been forecasting
that the retail business would contract by 5 percent a year going
forward, as the traditional business became outdated. This is like
death by fire. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Aside from the cost issue, why have so many people
apparently turned away from full-service brokers?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Retail brokers have done a poor job of attracting the next
generation of investors. If full-service retail brokers don't get
clients early, they generally don't get them at all, because those
who need brokers have not gone to full-service brokers, but a whole
set of different financial intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   The typical client of a retail broker is in his or her mid-60s.
So the image of a traditional broker in the industry has evolved to
something like a Cadillac, or the last car you drive before you
die. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A number of on-line trading firms have run
advertisements belittling the advice retail brokers offer. Is it
realistic to think that investors can do everything on their
own?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the last few years, there has been a lot of bickering
between brokers and the Internet. But all of these things can
co-exist. There is no reason advice can't be delivered
electronically. And the value of advice, given the massive amount
of information available to everyone now, is, if anything, even
greater than previously. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Based on the recent movement in the stocks,
investors seem to agree with you that the Merrill announcement is a
seismic event. But is it fair to assume that retail is equally
important to all these firms?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The market does an extremely poor job in discriminating among
the companies. Momentum is the biggest driver for the group.
</P>
<P>
   We estimate that for Merrill, retail brokerage accounts for
about 25 percent of its quarterly earnings. The stock has fallen
about 14 percent in a week.
</P>
<P>
   At Paine Webber, the same number is about 50 percent. Its stock
is down by about 11 percent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The threat of on-line trading isn't the only reason
these stocks are down, is it?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In addition to the Internet fears, we have fears of Fed
tightening and concerns about Y2K. Of the three, the Fed will
probably impact the group the least. When the Fed fine-tuned
monetary policy in 1997, it was a tremendous opportunity to buy the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these worries, right now the businesses for these firms
are in good shape. All of the stocks are telling us earnings are
not going to be good, but equity underwriting is on a path to be up
25 percent over the first quarter. Trading volumes remain robust,
both in fixed income and, to a lesser extent, in equity. And Asia
and Europe are real bright spots for these firms. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So which stocks do you like?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is down 22 percent from its highs
and has taken a greater hit relative to its retail earnings than
Merrill has. It appears the market has again forgotten the real
underlying earnings power this company has displayed. For clients
who want exposure to financial service stocks, we think this is a
real core holding.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns is also off 27 percent, but should it be taking a
hit? They are primarily a clearinghouse, and the stock is
perennially cheap. At the moment, it is trading at less than nine
times next year's earnings. It just doesn't get any respect.
</P>
<P>
   For long-term investors with a bullish long-term view on the
international aspects of the business, we like Goldman Sachs,
though the stock appears fairly valued.

   MS-PATIENT (Seattle) _ James ``Jay'' Ellison goes home Sunday
possibly cured of the disease, MS, that had been short-circuiting
his nervous system and rapidly robbing him of a future. Ellison had
to fight for the stem cell transplant after his insurance company
denied payment. He went public, aided by consumer advocates and
state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn.It's such an amazing
success, so far anyway, that the docs at Fred Hutch can hardly
maintain their neutrality. With sidebar slugged TRANSPLANT.

   CIGARETTES-EXPORT (OLYMPIA, Wash.) _ The calls started coming
just a few months ago, wholesalers offering name brand cigarettes
at deep discounts. What's the catch, asked Matt Yorkston, who, with
his family, owns six convenience stores in Whatcom County. The
catch was this: The cigarettes were manufactured for sale only in
foreign countries, but somehow found their way back into the U.S.
market. Yorkston was getting a glimpse of the ``gray market,'' a
netherworld of trade and commerce that skirts illegality, but
manages to stay within the law.

to load up on rice and medical supplies before sailing with doctors
and nurses urgently needed in North Korea, is part of its legacy.
The ship, fully equipped with things like a high-tech eye surgery
clinic, has been here since May 29, leaves June 6, and its stay
coincides with a diplomatic mission to N. Korea being led by former
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.

2 MINOR TIANANMEN PROTESTS IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also HONGKONG-TIANANMEN) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Two one-man protests near Tiananmen Square,
immediately snuffed out by police, were the only brief
interruptions in a normal workday here Friday as the 10th
anniversary of the violent crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrations passed without official notice.
</P>
<P>
   The square itself is fenced off for resurfacing. Directly across
the street Friday morning, under a large portrait of Mao Tse-tung,
a middle-aged man opened an umbrella marked with political slogans
including ``Remember the student movement!'' He was quickly led
away by police.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon at the same spot, a young man suddenly
threw flyers into the air bearing a fervent message against
corruption and the growing divisions in society. He ran into the
street, where eight policemen tackled him and bundled him off by
car.
</P>
<P>
   Police scrambled to pick up the flyers, which mentioned the need
for democracy but not the student movement of 10 years ago, and
ended with the slogans ``Long Live Chairman Mao'' and ``Down with
American Imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   After the incidents, a few foreign camera operators and
photographers were briefly accosted by police and forced to hand
over their exposed film.

IN HONG KONG, 70,000 COMMEMORATE TIANANMEN SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CHINA-TIANANMEN) 
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ More than 70,000 people turned out here Friday night
on a balmy evening to hold candles, sing songs and pay respects to
those who lost their lives a decade ago in the bloodshed at
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only major public commemoration of the crackdown held
on Chinese soil. And for the people who gathered here to demand
that the Chinese government make amends, it was a powerful reminder
that Hong Kong remains an island of free expression amid the
government-imposed silence in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling out to all the heroes who died 10 years ago,''
said Szeto Wah, a pro-democracy leader, in a speech that mixed
poetry and politics. ``I hope you will come to our little island of
China. Your anger is our anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Szeto called on the Chinese government to reassess its actions
on the night of June 3-4, 1989, when it sent tanks and troops into
Tiananmen Square, crushing the student-led democracy movement and
killing hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has stopped remembering this part of history,'' he
said. ``We are ready, generation after generation, to fight until
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Silently, the crowd stood and held candles aloft, turning
Victoria Park into a sea of softly flickering lights. Around the
crowd, a wall of twinkling skyscrapers rose up into the cloudless
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' said Betty Li, 60, a retired engineer from
Beijing who marched in the pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 and
traveled from the mainland city of Zhuhai to mark the anniversary.
``In China, they're still not giving people these kinds of
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vigil's organizers expressed fears this week that 10
years after the crackdown and nearly two years after Hong Kong
reverted to Chinese rule, people's emotions would have cooled.
Judging from the crowd Friday, though, feelings here remain
fervent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a massacre,'' said a 40-year-old dentist who
identified himself as Alan. ``It is a terrible memory. Time can't
wash out the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers, who had expected that the 10th anniversary would
draw a larger crowd than past anniversaries did, were delighted
with the turnout, which was the largest in several years. The
weather played a role. Last year, fewer than 20,000 gathered in a
torrential downpour.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the turnout was nothing like the 1 million people
who jammed a racecourse here in 1989 to protest the crackdown. But
then, Hong Kong's relationship to Beijing was entirely different _
it was a British colony still eight years away from reverting to
Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Beijing traumatized people in Hong Kong because
they seemed to foretell a grim future for this capitalist enclave.
People here were terrified by the prospect of being taken over by a
government willing to cut down its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1989 rally, hundreds of thousands of protestors chanted,
``We now stand side by side with the Chinese people and we declare
war on the government of Li Peng,'' referring to the former Chinese
prime minister who orchestrated the crackdown on the students in
Beijing and is now the No. 2 official in the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, even critics of Beijing acknowledge that Hong Kong is
outwardly the same. Officials in Beijing have not suppressed civil
liberties, including the right of pro-democracy groups to hold
protests. But some people here say that what they see as pernicious
trends in Hong Kong _ like the weakening of the rule of law _ have
their roots in the crackdown and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``By expressing such support for pro-democracy forces in
Beijing, Hong Kong spooked the Chinese leadership into hardening
its attitude toward the handover,'' said Yeung Wai Hong, the
publisher of Next magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong was granted a degree of autonomy after the
handover, Chinese officials were determined that it not become a
staging area for subversive activities. Among other things, Beijing
retained the right to countermand rulings by Hong Kong's courts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this annual vigil has become a way for Hong Kong
to reaffirm its differences from mainland China. In contrast to
Beijing, where nervous officials have sealed off Tiananmen Square
for renovation, the police presence here was light and officials
treated the vigil as a routine event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a showcase for the international community that people
can still demonstrate in Hong Kong,'' said Albert Cheng, a radio
talk-show host. ``On the other hand, the government certainly
wouldn't want it to attract 100,000 or 200,000 people. Then Beijing
would think that it was spinning out of control.''

STEVE COLEMAN: A BEAT THAT LINGERS IN THE MIND AFTER A TRIPLE
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most of Steve Coleman's music sounds as if it begins
life as drum patterns. He is an alto saxophonist whose connection
to Charlie Parker is always clear in darting movements and clear
articulation, and his greatest departure from the main line of jazz
esthetics currently is in the hard, slapping Afro-Cuban drumming
that lies behind his work. It's partly an interpretation of Yoruban
religious music, the kind that accompanies Candomble and Santeria
ceremonies, and it replaces the airy netting of swing and bop
rhythm with a kind of beautifully detailed concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Sean Rickman on a normal drum kit (no congas, no
unusual percussion), those layered drumbeats _ at times machinelike
and done at brutally fast tempos _ were the sounds that lingered in
the mind after leaving the Knitting Factory on Thursday, the first
night of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival.
</P>
<P>
   First on the triple bill came Ravi Coltrane, whose music is more
flexible. The tenor saxophonist played tunes built on small
syncopated rhythmic motifs that informally wound their way into the
music; each written nugget triggered a few arrangement ideas for
his quartet, including pianist Andy Milne, bassist Daryl Hall and
drummer Steve Hass, so the structure of the piece sprang into being
by sudden decision. When Coltrane's band is at its best, you never
quite know where the music is going. His saxophone style is a bit
mumbling and consciously leached of stylization. But this, of
course, its a style in itself. (The pianist Paul Bley has a
similarly mysterious touch.) Little by little, Coltrane is
constructing one of the more compelling musical personalities in
jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, on the other hand, has a drive that doesn't let up, nor
does it change much over the course of an evening. His group, Five
Elements, around for nearly 20 years now, has moved into a hard,
brash and exact realm; there's little emotional comfort in it or
range of mood. Instead the music approximates a dangerous sport
like bronco-busting or fire-juggling; the trick was for the
musicians to hang on to the polyrhythms without hurting themselves.
The enterprise was fascinating in its single-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians ( Coleman, the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist
Anthony Tidd, and Rickman) each performed their small rhythmic
cycles, forming a great wheel of rhythm that eventually spun so
fast that it sounded like the new skittering styles of English
dance-club music. A recent piece, ``Pi,'' contained a long written
melody that was picked up in part and then set aside for rounds of
soloing; at the end, the band converged on the melody, playing it
fast in lock step. Even Rickman rattled out the tune on his drums.
</P>
<P>
   The third group of the night, Renegade Way, isn't Coleman's his
band per se, but it used his rhythm section and his methods. If
Five Elements plays insistent music, this group hammered away with
four times the force. There was a curtain of saxophonists in the
front line: Coleman, Coltrane, the alto saxophonist Greg Osby and
the tenor saxophonist Gary Thomas. Without creating particularly
compelling harmonies, they teased counterpoint out of several long
pieces by Coleman; they took turns at being the central soloist,
then came together in unison on long, knotty melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Coltrane, these players have a lot in common; they
used short, pinpointed notes in their improvisations. Coltrane, on
the other hand, generally expresses himself with longer, smoky,
smeared sounds. So there was a moment of tension on the fastest
tune of the night, when Coltrane soloed last after three
improvisations that sounded like Charlie Parker played at triple
speed. What would he do? He played fast phrases but left gaps in
his discourse; even traveling at superspeed, he deliberated. Taken
as a whole, the performance felt like a study in different kinds of
coolness, of grace under pressure.

 &HT;    Coke says talk OK if silent on lawsuit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. told an Atlanta federal court judge
Friday that the company should be allowed to freely communicate
with its U.S. employees about workplace diversity if it does not
express its views about a recently filed racial discrimination
suit.
</P>
<P>
   If the plaintiffs succeed in restricting such communication,
``every business decision Coca-Cola makes concerning diversity
among its employees will be misinterpreted as primarily about this
lawsuit merely because it is made while the lawsuit is pending,''
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was responding to a plaintiffs' motion asking the
judge to order the company to send out a special notice advising
black salaried employees that they can participate in the suit
without fear of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' request came after Coca-Cola Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester sent a May 26 e-mail to U.S. employees
telling them he was forming a Diversity Action Council and that
there was ``no room'' and ``no tolerance'' for discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, four current and former employees filed suit
against the beverage giant, alleging that it has a companywide
practice of discriminating against African-Americans in pay,
promotions, performance evaluations and terminations. The
plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they can include
another 1,500 black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story already has ordered the
company to put two disclaimer sentences on the e-mail messages it
sends to employees about the lawsuit, telling those workers it is
illegal for Coca-Cola to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola did not include the disclaimer sentences in
Ivester's May 26 memo, which the plaintiffs contend was an ``end
run'' around the order.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, said the plaintiffs' attorneys have a
``tortured and expansive reading'' of that order.
</P>
<P>
   Story must decide the issue, as well as whether Ivester can hold
small group meetings about diversity with employees who could
become plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys said such meetings could be coercive
and intimidating for black employees. But the company said these
are business-related meetings that will not address the substance
of the suit.

 &HT;    Cousins Properties adds Dallas unit to the family
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cousins Properties Inc., which has been expanding into
key development markets by buying local real estate firms, has
acquired a foothold in Dallas through a 50 percent stake in a real
estate service company there.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based real estate investment trust did not disclose
the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins' acquisition of a half interest in Faison-Stone, which
manages 7 million square feet of office space, does not include any
properties.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deal is expected to yield development opportunities
for Cousins, a major developer of office buildings and retail
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is significant to us is the potential for the long-term
development of office space in Texas,'' said Cousins President
Daniel M. DuPree.
</P>
<P>
   Dary Stone, founder and president of 8-year-old Faison-Stone,
will be Cousins' 50 percent partner.
</P>
<P>
   He will oversee the Texas operations and seek development
opportunities for Cousins. Clients of Faison-Stone, which is a fee
developer, include Motorola, Lincoln National Life and Taylor
Simpson Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past couple of years, we have expanded into the San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Birmingham and Alexandria, Va.,
office markets through successful partnerships with strong local
companies,'' DuPree said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Tully, securities analyst at Wachovia Securities, called
the acquisition ``a logical way to enter a good market. Real estate
is still very much a local business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins has developed major Atlanta complexes in both downtown
and suburban locations.

AIR FORCE FALLS SHORT OF RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force has pummeled Yugoslavia without
losing a single pilot, but hasn't yet turned the tide in its war to
win recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, the service was 2,578 recruits short of where
it should have been in its drive for 33,800 personnel by the end of
the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, the San Antonio-based Air
Force Recruiting Service reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, too, was struggling, but the Navy and Marine Corps
exceeded their goals, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anytime there is a shortfall in recruiting there is
cause for concern,'' said Lt. Col. Tom Begines, a Defense
Department spokesman. ``More importantly, all of the services have
renewed and re-energized their recruiting efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the possibility of not achieving its recruiting goal for
the first time since 1979, the Air Force plans to spend $54 million
on advertising through the end of September 2000, said Tim Talbert,
the Air Force's chief of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Master Sgt. Tom Clements blamed the lackluster recruiting
numbers on a slow period that is now ending. He expressed optimism
that the Air Force would get back on track as the new TV spots air.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's top civilian leader shared that view, but
cautioned that ads aren't a cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``All advertising can do for you, really, is to get somebody to
call you,'' Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said.
``Whether you can actually get the recruit in depends on a lot of
other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with a shortage of pilots and enlistees in a variety
of critical career fields, Peters and other top Air Force leaders
last week issued a ``stop-loss'' order that will keep 6,000
personnel from leaving the service as previously planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, meanwhile, has seen its recruiting shortfall rise
from 696 in February to 2,039 in April. The Army fell short by
6,791 recruits in April, while the Navy and Marines exceeded their
quota by 288 and 299, respectively, the Defense Department
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time that happened,'' Sara Lister,
former assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve
affairs, said of the Air Force's shortfall. ``They have very little
trouble, usually, getting recruits because airplanes are still
viewed as the most interesting, and they also teach good, useful
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's robust economy often is seen as a chief culprit
behind recruiting shortfalls that last year rocked the Army and
Navy.

COMFORT PLAYING A BIGGER ROLE IN SWIMWEAR FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Swimwear shopping is getting easier.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean stores have installed dim lighting and tinted
mirrors in dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dream on!
</P>
<P>
   It means swimwear manufacturers are making more suits with
built-in support for an aging population who needs them. And
they're marketing a wider range of styles so customers have a
greater chance of finding a suit that fits and flatters.
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers are even grouping all swimwear together so a
shopper can select without having to move to another department or
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some suits hang with little tags attached to show shoppers the
body shapes they're meant to enhance.
</P>
<P>
   Even catalogs are making swimwear shopping easier, grouping
suits on their pages by styles _ suits for full hips on one page,
for example, skimpy bikinis on another.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End puts a small symbol _ a triangle, rectangle, circle,
hourglass or inverted triangle _ with each suit description so
readers can see immediately if the suit they admire is suitable to
their body shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business this year is being driven by newness and the tankini
is the No. 1 new silhouette,'' says Candace Bergstrom, divisional
manager for swimwear at The Bon Marche.
</P>
<P>
   A tankini, the most sought-after style of the season, is a
design that flatters many and gets high marks for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   It's a two-piece with a tanklike top made of conventional
swimwear fabric, with either a brief or bikini bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The tank top can be pushed or rolled up for more exposure. It
also provides coverage for those with long or out-of-shape torsos.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Chan, brand manager for women's swimwear at Jantzen, a
Portland manufacturer, says baby boomers are affecting the swimwear
market. ``They have a youthful attitude. They want more color.
Brighter, younger styling. But their figures are changing,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers may opt for built-in support, but the look is more
natural. Prints that draw the eyes upward, ``floating underwires''
attached to suit straps, and narrow straps are just a few of the
details appealing to boomers who don't want swimwear that resembles
something their mothers or grandmothers wore.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Phillips, a trend manager for Mervyn's, says boomers want
style, fit and coverage. Today, about 25 percent of all swimwear
carried in Mervyn's stores has some kind of hidden support. That's
up about 10 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Chan says every swimwear company is offering a variety of styles
in today's collections. ``That's one thing that's changed in the
last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Suit pieces sold separately were once rare. The Bon now carries
separate suit pieces from three different companies. Some tops have
a bralike construction, perfect for large-busted women. But those
who need small tops and larger bottoms can also be fitted. Mervyn's
has a ``Suit Yourself'' line with tops sold by cup size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swimwear is often more difficult than lingerie to buy,'' Chan
says. But the bottom line is comfort. ``Skimpy isn't really in.
Comfort is.''

 &HT;    Yugoslavia agrees to more coverage
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Yugoslav government's war with CNN may be over,
after five days of secret negotiations in Belgrade between Yugoslav
officials and CNN International President Eason Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said Friday that Yugoslavia, which had accused CNN of war
crimes because of its reporting, will allow more CNN reporters and
equipment into the country starting today. CNN has been pretty much
limited to reporting from Belgrade; the new agreement allows them
to report live from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of CNN had to stop. We achieved everything we
hoped to achieve and more,'' Jordan said in a cell phone call from
the Yugoslav-Hungarian border.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and two CNN International employees, Steve Cassidy and
translator Mena Ivanovich, met with several top Yugoslav officials.
Although they did not meet with President Slobodan Milosevic, he
was aware of the negotiations, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, CNN will double its staff in Yugoslavia from
five to 10 and will bring in an extra satellite uplink unit to
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. ``These are major breakthroughs
for us,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the meetings were sometimes frightening and included
discussions with officials who have been indicted by the United
Nations for alleged war crimes. He said he was told by independent
Serbian journalists that some people in the Yugoslav government
considered CNN a greater enemy than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement between Yugoslavia and CNN comes just as peace
between Yugoslavia and NATO seems to be on track, but Jordan
wouldn't speculate on why Yugoslavia suddenly changed its position
on CNN. ``They were impressed that leaders from CNN would make the
trip in the midst of war to explain CNN's efforts and to defend
CNN's reporting,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began, the government was
strongly anti-CNN. Early in the bombing, the government briefly
arrested many Western journalists, and Serbian paramilitary units
attacked and confiscated CNN trucks and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's most honored international correspondent, Christiane
Amanpour, has not been in the country since she left early in the
bombing campaign because CNN executives in Atlanta were fearful for
her life. Her plans are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said CNN International's signal may be made available to
all Yugoslav homes starting this summer as part of the new deal.

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS EXPRESS ANGER AT KOSOVO PEACE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Kosovo peace agreement that was struck on Thursday
with the consent of President Boris Yeltsin and his special envoy
got a scalding reception in its first review here Friday, not
merely from politicians, but from some of Yeltsin's own officials.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators who attended a closed meeting in the lower house of
parliament said officials of the defense and foreign ministries who
had been sent there to explain the agreement actually attacked it
more than they supported it.
</P>
<P>
   The city's premier news radio station reported that Yeltsin's
deputy foreign minister had said his ministry had disassociated
itself from the settlement, a report his subsequent public remarks
did nothing to dispel.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist and nationalist members of parliament condemned it as a
Kremlin sellout of Yugoslavia and a betrayal of Russia's strategic
interests. One of Moscow's more substantial newspapers,
Nezavisimaya Gazeta, wrote that Russia had succumbed to NATO
pressure and that its role in the peace talks had been ``whittled
down to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a less than auspicious welcome for Yeltsin's envoy to the
talks, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who announced Friday that he is a
candidate for the same legislative body that was so
enthusiastically flaying him.
</P>
<P>
   But the outbursts almost certainly will have no impact on the
Kosovo accord, and it is not even clear that the broad political
center from which Chernomyrdin sprang, and which was mostly silent
Friday, shares the rage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Russian legislators who openly supports NATO's
role in Yugoslavia, Konstantin Borovoi, suggested in an interview
that many of Friday's critics were as much outraged at losing a
political issue as they were by any details of the accord itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost the adventure that they had created,'' he said.
``The feeling of loss _ that there was not going to be a third
world war started _ was quite strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear that ordinary Russians will share the critics'
sentiments, despite the wide streak of anti-Americanism that many
have lately shown. Although many Russians see the Kosovo conflict
as a bald act of American expansionism, they also want the war to
end without deeper Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Springing to his own defense, Chernomyrdin said Friday that he
had achieved both. ``There were two options: either to stop the war
by political methods or to fight, to put on our greatcoats and
march ahead,'' he said. ``I don't think that this way suits the
Russian people today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said through a spokesman that he thought Chernomyrdin
had performed his job well.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Thursday night, Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin offered this: ``At least one serious result has been
achieved. We've moved from the dead point.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's hottest rhetoric came from the left. Gennady Zyuganov,
the Communist Party leader and almost certainly a candidate in the
2000 presidential election, said Russia's parliament ``must sort
out the situation and answer the question of why the person who was
named special envoy pushes through the main ideas which NATO
dictates in the form of an ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov called the agreement ``a Balkan Khasavyurt,'' a clear
jab at Yeltsin. Khasavyurt was the scene of the 1996 cease-fire
accord in which Yeltsin gave Russia's Chechen republic considerable
autonomy in order to end a disastrous war.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kharitonov, the Agrarian leader, outdid Zyuganov. ``It's
1938; Munich plot,'' he said hours after the agreement was
announced on Thursday.'' Even the generals who are also present
around Chernomyrdin at the talks are puzzled, because all his
initiatives are in NATO's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Borovoi, the legislator who is supportive of NATO, said the same
themes were echoed when officials of the defense and foreign
ministries briefed legislators in Friday's closed session. Asked
whether anyone rose to defend Chernomyrdin or Yeltsin, he replied,
``I wasn't given the microphone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Legislators said later that the presentation by Yeltsin's
ostensible representatives in the session was more critical than
supportive. Sergei Ivanenko, a top official in the centrist Yabloko
faction, said the representatives' remarks suggested that ``the
special envoy conducted the negotiations not very successfully and
made a number of concessions'' which were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Echo Moskvy quoted unnamed sources as saying that Deputy
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Avdeyev disassociated his ministry from
the accord during the session.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Avdeyev complained to reporters that the agreement
contained ``a vague formulation'' that has allowed NATO forces to
continue bombing Yugoslavia over Russian objections. He left
hanging the question of whether their was a split in Yeltsin's
delegation to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a delegation,'' he said. ``We have a special
envoy who has done his job and who will report to the country's
leadership.'' For its part, he added , the Foreign Ministry is
trying to represent Russia's interests in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Borovoi said the reaction of military leaders who also attended
the session was especially striking. ``Their feelings were,
basically, full despair,'' he said. ``The disappointment was pretty
strong and they didn't conceal it. I'm afraid that they will try to
spoil this process of the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The hawkish head of the defense ministry's department for
international military assistance, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, made
little effort to conceal his contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Ivashov, who has dispatched some of the military's more ominous
warnings about the consequences of continued war over Kosovo, said
the peace plan could leave Kosovo's 250,000 Serbs helpless at the
hands of Albanian rebels in the Kosovo Liberation Army. Meanwhile,
he said, Russia's role in peacekeeping and Yugoslavia's territorial
integrity depend entirely on NATO's whims.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether all that amounts to a betrayal of Russia by
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, Ivashov replied simply, ``Everyone should
decide that with his own heart.''

STOCKS RALLY AS INVESTORS SEEM PREPARED FOR RATE INCREASE

   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rallied Friday and bond prices moved
slightly lower as investors signaled that many expected a rate
increase when Federal Reserve policy-makers meet at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The selloffs in stocks since May 18, when the Fed first
indicated it was leaning toward a rate increase, have been enough
to compensate for higher interest rates, in the view of many
investors. Sectors that had been hit particularly hard, including
drugs, banks and technology stocks, helped lead the rally Friday.

its recent high, jumped 75.02 points, or 3.12 percent, to 2,478.34,
lead by Microsoft, up 3 3/16, to 79 9/16; Cisco Systems, up 6 1/16,
to 114 7/8, and Intel, up 2 11/16, to 53 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   There was little change in the bond market, where yields had
shot sharply higher in the last two months as the economy refused
to slow down. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond inched up to
5.96 percent from 5.95 on Thursday. The price, which moves in the
opposite direction, slipped 3/32, to 90 5/32. The yield on the
two-year Treasury note, which is very sensitive to fears of Fed
rate increases, rose to 5.53 percent from 5.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This performance came after the Labor Department said that only
11,000 new jobs were created in May, an increase that was sharply
lower than Wall Street forecasts of a gain of nearly 220,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such an unexpectedly weak report would have sent bond
prices higher as investors figured that a slowing economy would
lessen the risk of a Fed rate increase. Stock prices, in such a
situation, could go either way, with some investors buying because
of the reduced risk of a rate increase while others sold on worries
that slower growth would curb corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, investors decided that despite the weakness of
the jobs data, the outlook for the economy had not really changed.
This means that growth has not slowed enough for the Fed to ignore
the jump in consumer prices that was reported for April and is
likely to be seen again in the May data due out in a week and a
half. Next week's retail sales data could also show that consumers,
who have been the driving force behind the economy's rapid growth,
have not cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you thought about the labor market before this
number, you still think about the labor market,'' Donald Fine,
chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said. Other data
released earlier this week, including automobile and light truck
sales and a key manufacturing index, all showed that the economy
was still surprisingly strong last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the run-up in interest rates already, which has seen the
yield on the two-year note jump two-thirds of a percentage point in
two months, has given the Fed a green light to raise interest
rates, he said. The yield on the two-year note is nearly a half of
a percentage point higher than it would be if no rate increase were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist for Gruntal &AMP;
Co., agreed. ``Nothing much will happen,'' he said, after a quarter
of a percentage move up in the Fed interest rate target, which is
now 4.75 percent. But he said that if there were indications that
the Fed would move interest rates still higher, there might be more
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Battipaglia also said stocks were likely to get support from
what he expects to be very positive earnings news for the second
quarter, which would begin to be reported in July, just after the
next meeting of Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   First Call Corp., which tabulates corporate earnings estimates,
says Wall Street analysts currently expect second-quarter earnings
for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 index to rise by 12.8 percent,
compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Battipaglia said, the global financial crisis that
shook the financial markets last summer is gone. ``The landscape
for this summer looks dramatically different than last summer,'' he
said, ``and that has to be good for stocks.''

 &HT;    Monster Mile's now a fast, smooth ride
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ The white patches on the surface of Dover Downs
International Speedway make the one-mile concrete track look like
it's drying after a rain, or as though someone has whitewashed the
place.
</P>
<P>
   It may as well be a smiley face: A grinder has smoothed out the
one-time Monster Mile. Monster? The top 32 cars in Friday's
qualifying for the MBNA Winston Cup Platinum 400 on Sunday broke
the track record, led by pole-winner Bobby Labonte's 159.320 mph
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty hair-raising,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   But his was the only testimony to a track that usually devours
stock cars and is hard on drivers. Earlier Friday, all 36 cars that
qualified for today's Busch series race also bettered the track
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious it was going to be fast,'' said Mark Martin,
who qualified third at 158.325 mph, right behind Dale Jarrett
(158.576). ``Everywhere it's white, there's a lot less bumps,''
Martin said. ``That's everywhere they've ground the bumps off.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin held the old track qualifying record, 155.966 mph, set
last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lap times will be faster (Sunday) than they were the last
time we raced here,'' Martin said. ``Maybe we can be less cautious.
It's smoother, it may be easier to race on. We'll find out a lot
more (in practice today).''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's effort continued a strong qualifying run in 1999. It's
his fourth pole of the season, tops in Winston Cup, and second in
two weeks. But he is still winless in 12 races.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the smoothed out Dover surface is less than a
Monster this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here before and we'll wreck six or seven cars in
practice,'' Labonte said. ``Today there wasn't an incident that I
know of in Winston Cup practice. It's tamed down but the speed is
... one slip and it's over. But I think the air dam, the spoilers
and the tires help the cars stick better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon's problems continued. He qualified 14th, his worst
qualifying effort of the season. His bad luck Friday was drawing
the second qualifying spot and was on the track too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the second car out, I'm pretty disappointed because I
went quite a bit faster in practice,'' Gordon said. ``The car
tightened up a bunch on me. I didn't really expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, the winner last week at Charlotte, didn't bring any
momentum into qualifying. He was only 40th fastest in the No. 99
Pontiac. He was so bad in practice, he had teammate Mark Martin hop
in to drive the car before qualifying. ``He couldn't pinpoint it
either,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Other surprisingly poor qualifying efforts included Tony Stewart
(24th), Dale Earnhardt (31st) and Terry Labonte (37th).

SOME IN ISRAELI PROXY MILITIA FACE DIFFICULT DECISION AFTER
PULLOUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 6) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEZZINE, Lebanon _ As his Lebanese comrades in Israel's proxy
militia retreated south last week, Manuel Nistirof, a baby-faced
18-year-old, was faced with an unsavory choice:
</P>
<P>
   Stay with his beleaguered Israeli-paid militia, known as the
South Lebanon Army, or SLA, and continue to be demoralized by
relentless attacks from guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Or, surrender now and hope the Lebanese authorities would offer
amnesty and the Hezbollah would spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 83 of his SLA comrades chose to turn in their
weapons. They told their commanders they wanted to stay in this
mountain town in southern Lebanon rather than withdraw with the
militia to a 9-mile-wide border ``security zone'' set up by Israel
years ago to protect its northern communities from attack. They
brought the number of militia members who want to quit to 203.
</P>
<P>
   Nistirof, standing guard in a wrinkled Israeli army uniform at
the entrance to Jezzine, said he would wait to see how those men
were treated before deciding what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see them get amnesty,'' he said, ``I'll surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of more SLA desertions adds urgency to Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's promise to withdraw Israeli
troops from Lebanon within a year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, SLA militiamen have been on the front lines of
Hezbollah's war of attrition to oust Israel from the occupied zone.
Culled from the impoverished villages of Lebanon's south and from
the ranks of Christian militias defeated in Lebanon's civil war,
the SLA has been the key to Israel's continuing presence in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   If the SLA unravels, Israel will lose an ally that until now has
helped provide a foothold in strategic places like Jezzine, a
Marionite Christian town just north of the Israeli-occupied zone.
The SLA abandoned the town in the wee hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also will lose a force that has helped provide its 1,500
soldiers, whose positions are farther south, with a buffer against
increasingly deadly Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario is what Hezbollah hopes to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (SLA) are serving as sandbags to the Israelis, as a
barrier, a shield`` said Ibrahim Moussawy, Hezbollah's spokesman in
Beirut. ``We want to drop this shield in order to target the
Israelis so they will feel the necessity to leave south Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Many SLA members say there is a feeling that the militia is
crumbling. Fighters are quitting. Their commander, Gen. Antoine
Lahd, it is whispered, is planning to quit, and those still in the
force know that their patron, Israel, wants to pull out soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in this area, Hezbollah won,'' said the 18-year-old
Nistirof, who is a Christian. ``Hezbollah is winning everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But with parents living in the Christian town of Marj Ayyoun,
further inside the Israeli-occupied zone, and a father wanted by
the Lebanese government for crimes committed during the civil war,
Nistirof said he had no choice but to stick with the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joining them was a mistake, but I was young and I didn't know
what I was getting into,'' he said. ``I could be a normal citizen
going to Beirut, but instead I'm going further into the occupied
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who've cast their lot with the retreating militia say
sticking with the side most admit is losing is preferable to
chancing their fate with the Lebanese government or the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this talk of amnesty is just a mirage,'' said a
28-year-old major, who refused to give his name, as he also guarded
the entrance to Jezzine. ``I don't trust my government. I'm waiting
for a real solution for the region.''
</P>
<P>
   He says those members who surrendered made a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hezbollah will come inside Jezzine one by one and
kill them,'' said the militiaman.
</P>
<P>
   Moussawy, the Hezbollah press attache, blamed Israel for
increasing anxiety among militiamen and their families by
exaggerating the Hezbollah threat to discourage the men from
deserting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hezbollah has sacrificed a lot of lives and shed the blood
of its young men just to help liberate Jezzine and the people
there,'' Moussawy said. ``So it's no way in favor of harming any
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A politically savvy Hezbollah seems to realize what Lebanese
observers in Beirut have been saying all along: that the quickest
way to bring about the demise of the SLA would be for Hezbollah and
the Lebanese government to treat those who defected with kid
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would encourage more surrenders,'' said Farid el-Khazen, a
political scientist at the American University of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the SLA checkpoint that had been on the terraced
slopes leading to Jezzine had disappeared. Nistirof was gone,
presumably somewhere in the hills to the south with his automatic
rifle slung over his back.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Jezzine, young men and women gathered in a grassy park,
waving Lebanese flags not far from a giant statue of the Virgin
Mary. Some of the 203 SLA defectors walked freely through the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of the government or the Hezbollah,'' said a
33-year-old defector with a thick beard and pock-marked face. He
also refused to give his name, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government has something against me, I'm ready for
trial,'' said the man, who also said that he had tried to leave the
militia several times but was always caught and coerced to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows we were forced to join,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a grocery store, another, younger defector, said he had
no qualms about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no guarantees if I followed them south,'' said the
former militiaman, who gave his name only as Sharbel. He said
Israel earlier had told men who wanted to quit that they would get
guarantees from the Lebanese government that they wouldn't be
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who stayed with (the militia) went south because they
were officers,`` Sharbel added. ``Most of them are from the
(Christian militias who fought in the civil war) and the government
is looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Khawand, a Maronite monk from the nearby community of
Siddoun, met with Hezbollah general-secretary Hassan Nasrallah last
week to discuss the fate of the defectors. Khawand said the
defectors had trickled north to surrender at a checkpoint
controlled by the regular Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   Khawand is part of a committee of lawyers and prominent leaders
who are putting together a compensation package for the departing
militiamen. Lahd has reportedly agreed to pay the defectors $1
million in what Khawand described as ``severance pay.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Khawand said, he had offered his monastery, Our
Lady of Mashmoushe, as a sanctuary to militiamen or their families
who feared reprisals from the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, no one had come.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Khawand said, he has pleaded with SLA fighters to
quit the militia. Many were once his students at the monastery,
which also has a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Why should you die?''' recalled Khawand, who
stood under a pine tree a few miles from Jezzine. ``There is no
cause. It's better to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they understand after so many years that they are
alone,'' he added. ``They are making this war all alone.''

STORM ODDS STACK UP AGAINST TEXAS GULF COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (EDs: Adds 1graf after 6thgraf, ``We have, to add last hurricane to
hit coast. Pickup: Being prepared)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT LAVACA, Texas _ Since the early 1800s, there has never been
a 10-year period when the Gulf Coast of Texas has gone without a
hurricane coming ashore. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to hurricanes, being a perfect 10 is not
considered a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1900, Texas has suffered through 10 of the 30 worst
hurricanes to make landfall in the United States. Near the top rank
as the deadliest storm was the Sept. 8, 1900, hurricane that killed
as many as 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 10 years, the rapid growth along the Gulf Coast
has resulted in only about 10 percent of the population having had
any close experience with a major storm. And forecasters fear many
current residents of coastal areas may not fully appreciate the
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a matter of if, but when,'' Terry Huber, a
National Weather Service meteorologist in Corpus Christi, said of a
hurricane hitting the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work together to get out the message to the
community,'' he told about 400 officials at the 7th annual Calhoun
County Emergency Management Conference here last week. They
represented coastal counties.
</P>
<P>
   The last hurricane to strike the Texas Gulf Coast was in 1989,
when Jerry, a Category 1 storm, hit Galveston Island.
</P>
<P>
   Being prepared and stressing the potential life-threatening
impact of hurricanes were the themes of the conference, held at the
start of the 1999 hurricane season. The Atlantic and Gulf season
runs through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should know what you're going to do before we issue a
hurricane watch. High winds, heavy rain and tornadoes can hit long
before the eye makes landfall,'' said Huber, who added that the
watch is issued about 36 hours in advance of projected strike.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that planning sessions are a must for officials if
they are to use all their resources in reducing the potential death
toll.
</P>
<P>
   The word hurricane is derived from Spanish and Caribbean Indian
terms for evil spirits and big winds.
</P>
<P>
   William Gray and his research team at Colorado State University,
who provides hurricane predictions to weather watchers throughout
the world, have said they believe there will be 14 named storms,
nine hurricanes and four intense hurricanes this year.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate is about 160 percent of the normal rate of
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, no one can predict where any of the storms may come
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Gray is also suffering through a storm of his own, with much of
his research funding being cut by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he believes funding reductions are the reaction to
his public questioning of sophisticated computer programs _ called
numeric models _ that are becoming the dominant method of hurricane
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The programs use mathematics to forecast the weather, while Gray
and his team combine computer programs and a study of past storm
activity in their predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's predictions were still the major focus at the Port Lavaca
conference, where representatives of numerous agencies discussed
storm preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we seem to fall into is we don't want to
evacuate people until the last minute, but you have to make the
decision to have enough time to evacuate,'' Ken Baxter, hurricane
program manager for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told
the county officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate we evacuate (storm-prone areas) seven times for
every one time you truly have to,'' Baxter said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schumann, senior research associate at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said evacuation models for the coastal area have
examined a number of issues to give officials a better
understanding of when to make their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the items that have to be considered are traffic load
capacity; routes; congestion in getting ready to evacuate;
evacuation times; the lowest elevation of roadways; and other
information,'' Schumann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no way we're ever going to replace your
experience. You know your areas better than anyone,'' he said.

<P>
   America's unemployment rate dropped to 4.2 percent in May, the
Labor Department reported Friday. That matches the 29-year low
first reached in March and is just the latest sign that the
nation's labor market remains remarkably robust.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a strong hint in Friday's report that the
jobs boom may be moderating. While employers actually added 841,000
workers to their payrolls in May, the increase was rather paltry
given it is usually the peak time of year for seasonal hiring.
After the Labor Department took account of the usual spring hiring
surge, the seasonally adjusted gain in payroll employment turned
out to be virtually nil _ a net gain of a mere 11,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the increase for April was a whopping 343,000 when
adjusted for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some signs of slowing,'' said Richard Rippe, chief
economist at Prudential Securities, ``but at the same time the
labor market is very tight and there's some upward pressure on
wages.''
</P>
<P>
   As seen through the corrective lens of seasonal adjustment, the
weakness in May hiring was widespread. Manufacturers, who have been
buffeted by the economic slowdown in the rest of the world, trimmed
45,000 workers from their payrolls, bringing the total reduction
since March 1998 to nearly half a million. Construction payrolls,
which had been climbing, on average, by 28,000 workers a month,
fell by 40,000. And services _ the main engine of job growth _
added far fewer workers than usual, just offsetting the losses
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back a bit, it turns out that the economy has added an
average of 196,000 jobs a month on a seasonally adjusted basis in
the first five months of 1999, significantly fewer than the average
of 243,000 a month in the second half of 1998. What is more, total
hours worked are growing more slowly, at an annual rate of less
than 1 percent in the second quarter versus 2 percent in the first.
</P>
<P>
   May's mixture of strength and weakness gave investors no clear
idea of whether the Federal Reserve, whose monetary policy
committee meets at the end of the month, is likely to raise
interest rates or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a `wait and see what happens next' report,''
said Katherine Abraham, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. ``It's too soon to draw any conclusions about this
being a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, agreed.
``It leaves the Fed where they were,'' he said, ``looking for a
sign that inflation is dangerous enough to be worth stomping on or
just a phantom menace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, one strong report after another on
everything from car sales to house purchases to factory output has
fanned fears that the Federal Reserve is about to raise rates. Last
month, the Fed's monetary policy-making committee, citing an
``already tight labor market'' and strong domestic spending, voted
to adopt a ``bias'' toward raising rates _ though it did not
actually raise them.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has been on the alert for signs that the good
times are pushing wages up faster. Hourly pay did jump a bit,
rising 5 cents to $13.19 in May.
</P>
<P>
   But pay increases have been exhibiting a seesaw pattern over the
last few months, up one month, fairly flat the next, rather than a
clear acceleration. The increase from a year ago is 3.6 percent,
the same as last month. Last year, wages rose 4.4 percent. ``You
still see a deceleration,'' Rippe said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who typically pay more attention to payrolls than to
the unemployment rate, reacted to the report with a collective sigh
of relief. Bond prices inched lower, while several stock indexes
rallied.
</P>
<P>
   American workers, of course, have been celebrating the current
state of the job market at shopping malls, car dealers' lots and
new housing subdivisions. It is easy to see why. Last month, the
unemployment rate for college graduates dipped to 1.9 percent. Over
the last year, while the number of college graduates in the work
force rose by 1.7 million, the number of managerial, professional
and technical jobs rose by an even larger number.
</P>
<P>
   Even the youngest, least educated, least experienced workers are
doing nicely. Unemployment among teenagers dropped to 12.6 percent
in May from nearly 15 percent at the beginning of the year. And the
unemployment rates among African-American and Hispanic workers
remain at historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a very strong economy,'' said Wyss of Standard &AMP;
Poor's. ``The problem is much more that people can't find workers
than that people can't find jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of job growth may be shifting a bit along with the
pace. Hiring by service firms, whose appetite for more workers has
seemed to have no bounds, turned sluggish in May for the first time
since 1996. Hotels and landscaping services hired fewer workers
than earlier in the year, but even industries less prone to
seasonal ups and downs _ financial services and management
consulting, for example _ pulled back. Employment in health care
services leveled off after months of rapid growth. Retailers, which
added sales clerks like mad during the past year, hardly hired any
in May. Exceptions included car dealers and furniture stores, a
reflection of the hot market for cars and houses. Business services
_ mainly computer services and data processing _ continued to pull
in workers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom in all kinds of construction, which has been
adding an average of 28,000 jobs a month since last fall, payrolls
actually shrank in May. The decline mostly reflects what the Labor
Department referred to as ``erratic'' weather, which has caused
this year's seasonal hiring to begin earlier than usual. But higher
interest rates, falling housing starts and a shrinking backlog of
new commercial construction contracts suggests that hiring may stay
weak in months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Industries that have been shedding jobs continued to do so.
Despite the recent rebound in oil prices, mining outfits cut 7,000
jobs, mostly in oil and gas extraction. Declines in factory
employment were widespread, encompassing heavy machinery, aircraft,
clothing and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that this may change, said Robert Barbera, chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. Workers who are on the assembly lines are
busier than ever. The average factory workweek, nearly 42 hours,
and the average overtime, 4.6 hours, are high by historical
standards. Together with fatter order books, higher production and
shrinking inventories, this suggests that manufacturers may soon be
running help wanted ads.
</P>
<P>
   The May jobs report reflects an annual benchmark revision in the
Labor Department's payroll survey. As usual, the department found
that more jobs had been created than originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abraham said this year's upward revision of 44,000 jobs
was smaller than usual.

   $50 Million Farewell For Employees &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CMP Media, whose trade publications include Computer Reseller
News, Information Week and Windows magazine, has long had a
reputation for generosity toward its employees. It was one of the
first companies on Long Island to set up day care and fitness
programs; Working Woman magazine has called it one of the best
companies to work for.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who feared that the coddling had ended in April, when
CMP agreed to be acquired for $920 million by Miller Freeman, a
unit of United News and Media of Britain, need not have worried.
</P>
<P>
   The Leeds family, which founded the company and still controlled
a 70 percent stake at the time of the sale, is giving CMP's 18,000
employees $50 million from the proceeds. Michael Leeds, president
of CMP, said the family ``felt very strongly that these people had
committed themselves to building the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to share in its success,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will get $4,000 for each year at CMP, plus one-fifth
of their 1998 compensation. The Leeds family, for its part, will
reap $663 million from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds said the employee windfall was in keeping with the outlook
of his parents, Gerard and Lilo Leeds, who founded the company in
1971. German immigrants, they ``wanted to prove that you could run
a company that was profitable and good for the employees,'' Leeds
said. &QL;

<P>
   Here are two safe predictions: The pace of business and of life
will keep accelerating, and a keyboard will figure in an ever
larger share of the communicating we do, commercial and personal
alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the intersection of those two trends is a species of
virtuosity that is master of both. And for a change, the virtuosos
in question are not 20-something geek-savants, but rather more
mature figures imbued with something of a nostalgic air: speed
typists.
</P>
<P>
   The OPAC unit of Biddle &AMP; Associates, a company that sells
skills-testing software, sponsors an annual competition for the
fastest professional typist in America (measured by its software,
of course), with accuracy taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The three 1999 winners all run secretarial services businesses,
and none is under 40: Karen Schouest of New Orleans, Kathy Jerome
of Phoenix and Barbie Dallmann of Charleston, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   How fast is fast? At the rate she was clocked in the contest,
Ms. Schouest could reproduce this item flawlessly in 88 seconds.
(The winner of a parallel contest for students, Keith Wilson of
Virginia Beach, Va., would need 89.)

STARR PROBE OF CLINTON MAY PLAY ROLE IN CISNEROS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel investigation of President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern is expected to become an
issue when jurors are chosen for the conspiracy trial of former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the Cisneros case have told U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin they want to quiz prospective jurors on whether
they agree with the widespread feeling that Congress should let the
law that authorizes the appointment of independent prosecutors
expire later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackowski, a prosecutor for Independent Counsel David
Barrett, and Barry Simon, a lawyer for Cisneros, will submit those
questions to Sporkin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's investigation led to the indictment of Cisneros on
charges that he lied to the FBI about payments made to a former
mistress. The issue arose during a background check into Cisneros'
appointment to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development
in Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection will begin later this month in preparation for
the July 6 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski told Sporkin he wants to poll prospective jurors about
``the debate in Congress on the independent counsel law.'' The law
dates to the years after the Watergate affair when Congress sought
to allow attorneys general to name a special investigator who was
sheltered from political influence.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing sentiment in Congress not to renew the statute,
saying it is too narrow in its application and that the duty of
investigating executive branch officials could be better performed
by career lawyers in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kenneth Starr, whose investigation of Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky led to the impeachment of the president, has called
for a repeal of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the Cisneros case are eager to determine the
impact of the Starr investigation on the 200 people who have been
summoned for possible jury duty in the Cisneros trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation was widely criticized by Democrats as a
Republican-led effort to embarrass the president and force him from
office. Although Clinton was impeached by the House for lying about
his affair in sworn testimony, the Senate could not muster the
votes to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The pool from which jurors in the Cisneros case will be selected
is heavily Democratic. Of the 316,000 voters eligible for jury duty
in the District of Columbia as of May 31, 248,040 were registered
Democrats, 41,204 were independents and 22,606 were Republican,
according to the city's Board of Elections and Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Questions posed by prosecutors and defense lawyers will be
submitted to Sporkin for approval, with a final questionnaire going
to possible jurors when selection begins June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Larger issues still unresolved will be taken up at a June 21
motions hearing where Cisneros' lawyers are expected to fight the
government's efforts to submit taped telephone conversations that
Cisneros' former lover, Linda Jones, had with him as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers argue that Jones' wiretapping was illegal, and
therefore the tapes are inadmissible as evidence. They also plan to
call the government's tape recording expert to testify that the
tapes were altered.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are considered a crucial part of the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI claims Cisneros told investigators that he paid Jones
about $60,000. The indictment charges that Cisneros paid her
$250,000, including $73,000 he paid Jones after he became a member
of Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Cisneros and two aides, John Rosales and Sylvia Arce, are
charged with conspiracy to conceal the financial arrangement from
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, once considered a rising political star in the
Democratic Party, was HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former San Antonio political fund-raiser known by her
married name, Linda Medlar, is currently serving time in a federal
prison for pleading guilty to bank fraud, obstruction of justice
and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were part of a 28-count indictment returned by a
federal grand jury in Texas as part of Barrett's $7 million
investigation into Cisneros' affair with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros never denied the extramarital affair, which he publicly
disclosed in 1988 while mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the payments to Jones began shortly after
he took office as HUD secretary, when an unemployed Jones went on
national television and claimed Cisneros had reneged on a pledge to
provide for her.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' paid television interview included tape-recorded
conversations of her and a man she said was Cisneros scheming to
mislead the FBI about the financial arrangement.

ALLIES WARY OF EMBOLDENED KOSOVO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once Yugoslavia withdraws its forces from Kosovo,
NATO envisions disbanding the Kosovo Liberation Army and
transforming its fighters into civilians, many as police officers.
Western officials are already scouring refugees camps in Albania
and Macedonia in search of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   But emboldened by NATO's wearing down of Yugoslavia's army and
police forces, the rebels may not share NATO's vision of a return
to civilian life. And with their fractious, opaque command
structure, the rebels may complicate NATO's plans for establishing
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Europe said Friday that they expected that
the ethnic Albanian rebels would abide by the broad terms of the
agreement reached with President Slobodan Milosevic. Although many
details of their interaction with NATO's peacekeeping force must
still be worked out, the officials appealed for the rebels'
cooperation and demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
   But in Albania's capital, Tirana, a senior official of the
Kosovo Liberation Army refused Friday to explicitly endorse the
agreement with Milosevic, saying the rebels had strong misgivings
about it, especially the requirement that they lay down their arms
and the extent of the role Russians will play in the peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Jakup Krasniqi, one of the rebels' leaders, said he welcomed any
agreement that would call for withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo, clearing the way for the return of hundreds of thousands of
refugees, but he expressed distrust of Milosevic and his
willingness to honor the deal, the details of which were still
being decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will carry on with our resistance because we do not believe
in the maneuvers of Milosevic, who has been massacring civilians
for years,'' Krasniqi said in a news conference at the Hotel
Europapark in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' reticence underscored the fact that when it comes to
the mechanics of peace, the Serbs are not the only complicating
factor facing the NATO allies as they move into Kosovo. Having
forced Milosevic to accept a complete withdrawal of Serb forces,
NATO does not now want to see a new armed force taking their place.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been clear from statements by the rebels, who only a
year ago were even a more loosely organized and poorly trained
force, the group's ambitions have grown along with its size. And
their aims in Kosovo _ namely independence _ go beyond well beyond
NATO's.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi said that he envisioned the rebels _ also known as the
UCK, its acronym in Albanian _ being transformed into what his
interpreter called an ``army,'' though the word could also mean a
force, more generically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UCK is the only force that really defended, with all the
means they had for the last year or so, the Albanians living in
Kosovo,'' he said. ``They would like to have their own army, which
would give them security in Kosovo in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced on Thursday, calls for the disbanding
of the rebels, but myriad details must still be worked out between
the NATO peacekeepers and the rebels. The Pentagon's spokesman,
Kenneth H. Bacon, said Friday that it was premature to concentrate
on the rebels' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first task is to get the Serbs out, and that hasn't
happened yet,'' he said. ``After that, we will concentrate on how
to manage the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the air war, NATO dealt warily with the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the only fighters on the ground attacking
Yugoslavia's Army and police units. Militarily, officials insisted
they did not coordinate strikes with the rebels, though one senior
officer described ``a flow of information'' from the rebels that
NATO warplanes used, and diplomats from the State Department kept
in regular contact with the rebels' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With a settlement apparently at hand, allied officials are even
more wary of the emboldened rebels, who now see themselves as the
emerging political and military power in a liberated Kosovo. Within
the Pentagon, especially, the rebels and their intentions remain a
deep concern and, with the group's uncertain commitment to
democracy and unsavory ties to drug dealers and arms merchants, a
potential threat to the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, the rebels numbered no more than 2,000, but
they are now estimated to have as many as 17,000 fighters, many of
them revenge-minded young men recruited from the hordes of refugees
driven from Kosovo by Serb forces after NATO's bombing began on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, Milosevic declared he had eradicated the
U.C.K.,'' a senior defense official said. ``That was like us with
the Vietcong in Vietnam. They're still there in strong numbers.
They're still capable of creating a lot of headaches and trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agreement negotiated at Rambouillet, France, earlier this
year, which representatives of the rebels signed but the Serbs did
not, laid out in detail the ``demilitarization'' of their army.
They would have been required to give up most of their weapons, but
not hunting rifles and other smaller arms. Within a month, they
would have had to stop wearing uniforms and military insignia; by
four months, there would be no force at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet agreement also envisioned giving the insurgents
new roles as police officers _ as individuals, though, not
collectively. The senior defense official said that the allies had
been aggressively recruiting the rebels in the hopes of using them
in the political and civil administration that emerges in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very hard to try to co-opt them into legitimate
institutions, like the police,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said that the
allies still hoped that the rebels would disband along the
timetables laid out in the Rambouillet talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as were concerned that aspect of the Rambouillet
agreement is valid and were hoping the U.C.K. sees it the same
way,'' he said. He added that the NATO forces takes away ``the
rationale for that kind of armed struggle which, in the eyes of
U.C.K. leaders, may have had its meaning when they were being
repressed by Yugoslav forces but which will not have its raison
d'etre once the international security presence is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, rebel leaders said that events inside
Kosovo had clearly overtaken the agreement at Rambouillet. They
have also made it clear they have not yet accepted the latest
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, which the ethnic Albanian rebels have used as a base
of operations, Krasniqi refused even to describe the agreement to
end the conflict as an agreement, calling it only a ``document.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to President Clinton's remarks on the agreement on
Thursday, he added, ``He never mentioned they were going to make us
accept this agreement.''

   Aircraft emissions alter the atmosphere and contribute to
climate change, a trend likely to accelerate as global air travel
increases, according to a study by two scientific groups. As a

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
(af) 
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors, it seemed, were ready to concede that the Federal
Reserve would have to raise interest rates to slow growth and curb
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But when the May employment report was released on Friday
morning, there was a surprise. Job growth was unexpectedly weak.
Instead of an increase approaching 220,000 new nonfarm jobs, as
Wall Street had forecast, there were only 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't give you closure,'' lamented Robert J. Barbera,
chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. ``We can't say we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this surprising report should not change the outlook for the
economy. (It is still strong.) Or interest rates. (They should move
higher.) Or the intent of the Fed. (It should raise rates soon.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one could conclude otherwise by focusing on the
nonfarm jobs data, which were weak in May and have not been
disturbingly strong for the year, increasing at a monthly average
of 197,800. But that focus would be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the rest of the economic data released last week,
although with much less fanfare than the jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   _ The factory index of the National Association of Purchasing
Management jumped to 55.2 in May, its highest level since October
1997. Prices paid to producers also rose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Car and truck sales are soaring, with the annual rate in May
hitting 17.1 million, a May record and the fifth highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales of new homes in April jumped 9.2 percent, to an annual
rate of 978,000, the second-strongest month on record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales in stores open at least a year rose 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this indicates that consumers are still spending while the
nation's weakest sector, manufacturing, appears to be rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, the underlying data in the May jobs report were
stronger than indicated by the meager nonfarm jobs increase.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that surprisingly small overall gain was a
decline of 40,000 in construction jobs and a plunge of 45,000 in
manufacturing. In addition, the service sector created just 71,000
jobs, well below its average of 125,000 over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Construction jobs have been rising and falling with the weather,
jumping 44,000 in April before last month's decline, on a
seasonally adjusted basis. Since March of last year, 453,000
manufacturing jobs have been lost as recessions in Asia and Latin
America slashed demand for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   But while jobs have been declining, the growth rate of average
hourly earnings in manufacturing is rising again. For all of last
year, average hourly earnings for manufacturing were up just 1.6
percent. So far this year, they are up 4.3 percent at an annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown of wage increases in manufacturing had helped
restrain overall wage increases, allowing the growth rate to
decline while the economy was booming. That mitigating factor now
appears to be gone.
</P>
<P>
   The closure sought by Barbera must wait for the release of other
key data ahead of the Fed's policy-making meeting on June 29 and
30. Those include the government's formal tabulation of retail
sales for May, to be released on Friday, and the Labor Department's
measure of consumer prices for last month, due on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   If they are strong, retail sales will serve to prove that the
consumer has bounced back after a weak March and April. The
Consumer Price Index for May will show whether the April gain of
0.7 percent, the largest monthly jump in eight and a half years,
was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   And if it is possible to scrutinize Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve, any more closely, investors will do so on
June 17, when he is scheduled to testify before Congress's Joint
Economic Committee on monetary and economic policy. Many expect him
to use the occasion to signal that a rate increase is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the data, there is another reason the Fed should move
rates higher. Based on the movement of the many market barometers
of investor sentiment, a quarter-percentage-point increase in the
Fed's short-term interest rate target, to 5 percent, is already
expected.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Fed could raise the rate on overnight loans
between banks _ the Federal Funds rate _ without too much
disruption, argued Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States
economist at Salomon Smith Barney. In fact, he added, ``the Fed
might cause more questions if they do not.''

FINAL TOTALS IN SOUTH AFRICA ELECTION STILL IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ Votes came on to the huge digital board
here, and then they came off. One million of them, at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The final outcome of this week's election was still in limbo
late Friday evening as the ballot-counting continued slowly, with
about half the votes either unverified or plagued with errors.
</P>
<P>
   Though figures bounced up and down, the African National
Congress clearly beat the opposition. But its chances of winning
the two-thirds majority it hoped for looked less certain than on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The million-vote mistake _ a typing error from one district _
pushed the ANC's national vote tally above the two-thirds mark, but
when the number was corrected, the party fell back below it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party also
surged ahead, to be the leading opposition party. But that lead
also turned out to be a mistake, and by 8 p.m. it had fallen back
to third place behind the liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the seven leading opposition parties
banded together to challenge the way in which the votes were being
verified. The parties requested copies of the result sheets filed
from all 14,650 polling stations in order to have the count
independently checked.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Independent Electoral Commission, the seven
parties said that some results sheets were hard to read and that
some stations reported more votes than the number of eligible
voters on their rolls. ``Our beautiful ideal of a free and fair
election may be harmed by unnecessary suspicion and uncertainty
about the correctness of the results,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system developed by the Independent Electoral
Commission, votes counts are to be checked in several ways. The
commission had to receive the vote in two different ways, like
telephone and fax, and the tallies had to match. In addition, the
vote counts had to be in line with the number of ballots issued to
the polling station.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the votes are coming in far slower than expected, in
part because some stations stayed open for 24 hours to accommodate
long lines of voters, and presiding officers were too exhausted to
count immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's director of operations, Norman du Plessis,
dismissed mounting concerns over the fluctuating numbers, saying
they in fact proved the commission was doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Final official results are not expected until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of South Africa's newspapers have assumed that the ANC will
get a two-thirds majority and editorials Friday, including those in
the influential daily The Sowetan, urged the party not take
advantage of such power. Such a majority would give the party the
votes to change some aspects of the constitution, like curtailing
the powers of watchdog agencies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The country's next president, Thabo Mbeki, has said that he had
no intention of making such changes.  &QL;

POLITICAL DEBATE RAGES ON AS END OF WAR IN KOSOVO APPEARS
IMMINENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Friday that he was
``anxious to end the bombing'' in Yugoslavia, and the Pentagon said
the 10-week-old air war could end as early as Sunday if Serbia
begins a troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington became more optimistic that peace in the Balkans
was in fact at hand, Clinton also sought to assure the American
public that the nation had pursued a ``goal that has been worth
fighting for'' _ stability in Europe and the return of more than
800,000 ethnic Albanians to their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous opportunity to be seized here,'' the
president said in the ornate East Room of the White House, ``a
chance to shift our focus from defeating something evil to building
something good, a chance to work with our allies to bring a stable
and prosperous and democratic southeastern Europe in which people
are never again singled out for destruction simply because of their
religious faith or their ethnic origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a NATO commander is to meet his counterparts from
Yugoslavia and Russia on Saturday to establish a timetable for
withdrawal and verification procedures, NATO kept up its bombing
campaign for a 73rd day _ hitting 51 targets in 24 hours, according
to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes avoided Belgrade, hitting ammunition depots in Novi
Pazar, Boljevac and Kursumlija and oil or gas installations in
Sombor and Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials emphasized that most of the latest bombing was
focused on forces in the field in Kosovo, and they said they had
yet to see any evidence of Serbian withdrawals. Serbian army units
clashed Friday with rebels trying to hold a strategic mountain
called Pastrik. The Pentagon reported Serbian counterinsurgency
operations against Kosovo separatist guerrillas but said the
fighting seemed to have eased. But there were also reports that the
Serbs were still forcing people from villages, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we continue the military action
against the military targets until we have some evidence that there
are more than words here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were clear signs that NATO was wrapping up its war
effort and preparing to send a peacekeeping force into Kosovo. For
instance, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said Friday
that the United States had suspended the deployment of 36 F-15
fighters to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   If the end of the air war looked imminent, the political debate
raged on over just what NATO and Clinton had accomplished with a
military campaign that was limited to an air war that would carry
little risk of allied casualties. More than 800,000 ethnic
Albanians were expelled from Kosovo by Serbian forces and now need
to be returned to a devastated land requiring a vast reconstruction
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said this week's diplomatic breakthrough was a
vindication of the president's policy and persistence with the air
strikes. ``It's clear the air campaign has been effective,'' said
Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. ``It has
forced Milosevic to acknowledge that his options are running out.''
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary of the accord was Vice President Al Gore. If all
goes as planned, he will be able to seek the Democratic
presidential nomination free of the shadow of the air war, or of
the possibility that American ground forces would invade Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, were critical of the accord, emphasizing
that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, indicted on
charges of war crimes, had not been toppled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is right and proper that all parties work to find
peace and justice in the troubled Kosovo region,'' said the Speaker
of the House, J. Dennis Hastert. ``However, we should not let
exuberance get in the way of the hard reality that Slobodan
Milosevic is still in control of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Republican presidential
contender, pointed to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as the model
for the problems caused by leaving a dictator in power after a war.
``The fact that it was an air campaign virtually guaranteed that he
would remain in power,'' he said of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said:
``It seems to me that the practical effect of this being a U.N.
mission is that it would seem to guarantee Milosevic's continuation
in power. Is that a good outcome, given the fact that we have
labeled him a modern day Hitler and he has been indicted in The
Hague?''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade agreement says an international force in Kosovo
would have ``fundamental'' NATO participation but be authorized by
the United Nations. Senator McConnell and Senator Chuck Hagel, a
Nebraska Republican, both warned that could mean that Russia and
China could have too much control over the force.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted that the force would have NATO
troops at its core, with a NATO general in charge and a unified
command structure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee, demanded that the president
seek formal approval from Congress before sending any troops into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He also served notice that he would use confirmation hearings,
now planned for this month, on the nomination of Richard C.
Holbrooke as chief American diplomat at the United Nations to
scrutinize American policy in the Balkans. He said the committee
would explore Holbrooke's ``role and responsibility for this
administration's misguided policy of appeasing Slobodan
Milosevic.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Dayton peace accord that
halted the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Clinton did not need
Congressional approval for troops and estimated that the Kosovo
force could be deployed in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department the spokesman, Jamie P. Rubin, argued
that the 10 weeks of NATO air strikes had dealt a great deal of
damage to Milosevic. ``Clearly he is weaker,'' he said. ``He is
indicted. His country has been set back decades economically. His
military has been largely broken through the air campaign. The
reputation of Serbia has suffered mightily around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there would be no Western
assistance to rebuild Serbia until it became more democratic, and
strongly suggested that Milosevic would have to be turned over in
The Hague for prosecution before Serbia would be allowed access to
international financial institutions like the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we cannot imagine a situation in which
President Milosevic remains in Serbia and all of the different
pieces of the puzzle get put together,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the vanguard of American troops for the Kosovo
operation was aboard a three-ship Marine amphibious group en route
to Salonika, Greece. About 2,000 marines would be the first
American troops to move into Kosovo, as part of an international
force that is to grow to 50,000. The United States has pledged to
send a total of 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reach Greece, the marines will travel by road to
Skopje, Macedonia, and wait for NATO to order them into Kosovo
after the alliance can verify that a significant Serbian withdrawal
is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Serbian forces would pull out of Kosovo from west to
east. A 15-mile buffer zone will separate Kosovo from the rest of
Serbia, and will help insure that remnants of the Serbian forces
cannot re-enter Kosovo or fire at NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the marines would patrol a section of eastern
Kosovo assigned to the United States. They would then yield to Army
troops and heavy armor from bases in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was instrumental in brokering the peace deal, but
American officials are still uncertain what role Russia will play
in the international force. Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary, said Russia's role remained an ``open question.'' But he
said, ``We are confident that we can work with them constructively
and they can participate.''

NATO, YUGOSLAV OFFICERS PLAN TALKS ON KOSOVO WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN

<P>
   BELGRADE _ The commander of NATO forces in Macedonia is expected
to meet Saturday with Yugoslav Army officers to arrange for the
withdrawal of some 40,000 Serb troops from Kosovo, a move that
would end NATO airstrikes and begin the war-torn Serbian province's
status as an international protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. General Mike Jackson, a British officer, was to lead the
NATO delegation that will meet his Serb counterparts near the
border checkpoint where more than a quarter of the 800,000 ethnic
Albanians who have been forced out of Kosovo have crossed into
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   They will map out agreed timetables and routes so that the Serb
forces will not be bombed as they withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes as NATO scaled back its bombing of Yugoslavia
in response to the Yugoslav government's acceptance of an
international peace plan aimed at ending hostilities over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, there were no bombing raids here
in the Yugoslav capital, and French President Jacques Chirac
confirmed Friday that NATO had decided to confine its bombing to
``strictly military objectives.'' That means so-called ``dual use''
targets that are used both by the military and civilians, such as
power plants and bridges, would not be hit.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers and their Yugoslav counterparts have been in
telephone contact since Thursday afternoon, when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbian parliament accepted the terms of
a cease-fire devised by the so-called Group of Eight industrialized
nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's meeting on the Serbia-Macedonia border would mark
the first face-to-face meeting of the opposing military camps since
NATO began bombing Yugoslavia March 24. Russian military officials
and an aide to Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who with the
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin persuaded Milosevic to take the
deal, were also expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Russia, who together will make up the bulk of the
50,000 peacekeeping troops expected to replace Serb forces in
Kosovo, have still not agreed on the breakdown of personnel, where
they will be stationed, and under whose command they will be
placed. After meeting in Helsinki Friday with Ahtisaari, US Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said he believed those
differences could be worked out soon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insists it must see evidence of a Serb withdrawal before it
calls a suspension and eventual halt to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there yet,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in
Brussels. ``The promise of peace is not yet the reality of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recognition of the Yugoslav gesture, NATO appeared to be
confining its raids to Kosovo. Shea said that in the 24-hour period
that had passed since Yugoslav officials said they accepted the
peace plan, NATO pilots had struck 21 artillery pieces, 30 mortar
positions, four tanks, 10 armored personnel carriers and eight
anti-aircraft pieces, all in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO intended to monitor the Serb withdrawal closely
to guard against atrocities by the retreating forces. But he said
NATO would not escort the Serbs out, saying, ``They know the way
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to have any clashes of forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has still not made a public comment or gone on state
television to explain why he sued for peace, accepting virtually
the same terms that were on offer before his country was bombed for
72 days.
</P>
<P>
   In several areas, the plan Milosevic accepted is worse than what
he could have had without his country's infrastructure being laid
to waste. Under the Rambouillet agreement which he rejected because
it called for the presence in Kosovo of foreign troops that he now
accepts, Yugoslav soldiers had 180 days and Serb police up to a
year before pulling out of Kosovo. Some 2,500 border guards would
have been allowed to stay to police the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But now the army and police have only seven days to pull out
before they are replaced by the same foreign troops that Milosevic
was willing to go to war over. In addition, the peace plan allows
for only a token presence of ``hundreds, not thousands'' of Serb
forces to clear mines, man border checkpoints and guard Serb
monasteries and heritage sites in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Official statements from the Yugoslav government have sought to
portray the deal as a victory for the country because the post-war
administration of Kosovo will be overseen by the United Nations,
not NATO. But the end result _ Serb forces out, international
forces in, and autonomy for the ethnic Albanians who make up 90
percent of population _ is the same.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, meanwhile, declared there
was no way Milosevic's acceptance of the peace plan would deter his
indictment by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Cook said there
would be no immunity or amnesty for Milosevic, who was charged with
war crimes for orchestrating the forced expulsion of some 800,000
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 16,000 NATO troops already in Macedonia, and the
government there Friday said it has authorized NATO to deploy
another 14,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit of European Union leaders in Cologne, Germany,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed that the western allies
would not help rebuild Serbia unless Milosevic was removed from
power.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac echoed that sentiment, saying that while the western
allies should refrain from humiliating Serbia, reconstruction help
from the west would be authorized only when the country was ruled
by ``a regime which respects democracy and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Yugoslav pledges to end the fighting, Hashim Thaci, the
political leader of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, said that
Serb forces had launched a new offensive against the separatist
group. The peace plan calls for the disarming of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   It was the attempts by Serb forces to crush the rebel group that
led to the conflict with NATO. After the KLA attacked Serb police
in Kosovo, the Serbs launched a scorched earth policy, shelling and
torching villages where the KLA drew support, killing scores of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The US and European Union demanded that Milosevic end his
offensive, and threatened to bomb when he didn't. Attempts to hash
out a compromise in France ended in March when Milosevic refused to
allow foreign troops in as peacekeepers. NATO began bombing, and
Serb forces drove hundreds of thousands of refugees out of Kosovo.

IRKED CLINTON DEFENDS EFFORT ON GUN BILLS DURING TELEVISION
INTERVIEW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his commitment to gun control challenged
Friday on national television, President Clinton delivered a
stinging lecture on achieving the politically possible in a
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The president erupted after Charles Gibson of ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' suggested in an interview broadcast live from the
White House that Clinton ``had a chance to roar'' on gun control in
the aftermath of the shootings in Littleton, Colo., but instead
``meowed'' by gaining Senate passage of a modest set of gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   In a monologue of 2 1/2 minutes, Clinton turned aside repeated
efforts by Gibson to get a word in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, let's join the real world here,'' Clinton said, stabbing
the air with an index finger. ``You want to have an honest
conversation? Let's have an honest conversation. I am the first
president who ever took on the NRA, he said referring to the
national Rifle Association. ``I got my party in Congress to stand
with me on the Brady Bill, which has made a difference, on the
assault weapons ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, used the program
to highlight their campaign against youth violence, and were joined
in the Roosevelt Room of the White House by a group of teen-agers
who asked them questions about restrictions on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But the segment was dominated by the heated exchange between the
president and Gibson, who quoted someone he described as ``a
friend'' of Clinton's as saying the President had missed an
opportunity to be tough with the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp rejoinder, Clinton spoke of the political price the
Democrats had paid in his first term for passing gun-control
measures, including a ban on some assault weapons and the so-called
Brady law, which included a mandatory waiting period for handgun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we lost between 12 and 20 members of the House of
Representatives because they were targeted by the NRA for standing
up for the lives of children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings that left 15 people dead at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Clinton did propose a package of far-reaching
gun-control measures, including raising the minimum age for all
handgun purchases to 21 from 18 and limiting gun buyers to the
purchase of one a month.
</P>
<P>
   But to gain Senate passage of the bill, the White House agreed
to drop such contentious items and pressed for the enactment of
more modest changes, like requiring background checks of
individuals who buy firearms at gun shows and including child
safety devices with new guns.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those scaled-back goals, the White House needed the
vote of Vice President Al Gore to break a deadlock on the measure _
a fact that the president obviously believed Gibson failed to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now wait a minute,'' a visibly angry Clinton said at one point
when Gibson sought to interject. ``You talk about roaring and
meowing _ then I came forward with this legislation. Did it roar
through the Senate? No. We passed a bill closing the gun show
loophole by 51-50 because of the vice president of the United
States. Did the House of Representatives make a priority out of
what was passed in the Senate and pass it right through? No. They
went home before taking action. Why? To give the NRA time to lobby
them to water down what was passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy back-and-forth pleased the producers of ``Good Morning
America,'' if not Clinton. They saw it as great television, full of
passion and fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Gibson is a phenomenal interviewer,'' said Shelley
Ross, the program's executive producer. ``He didn't want to go over
the same old gun-control debate. The intention was to be
provocative, insightful and in-depth. He opened things up and we
could see how deeply the president feels on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But at times, Clinton appeared to be treating the interviewer as
naive about the hardball world of Washington politics. He declared
that it would be ``wrong'' for the White House to pass up the
opportunity to achieve some success on gun control to press for
measures that stood little chance of enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say there are stronger measures that could be taken,''
Clinton said. ``You are absolutely right. You have no evidence that
they could pass the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson retorted that polls indicated the American public would
accept registration of firearms. Yet, Gibson said, ``we don't do
that, and we're not fighting about the regulation of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   This served only to prompt another lecture from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is, this Congress came to power after the 1994
elections because in critical races the people who voted for more
modest things, like the Brady Bill, which the polls showed the
voters support, got beat. They got beat, Charlie.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT UNDERCUT IN EFFORT TO DEPICT RIVAL AS THRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to defang the government's antitrust charges
against it, Microsoft Corp. introduced a host of evidence this week
to show that the Netscape browser was still healthy and thriving,
despite Microsoft's all-out assault on the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But in a single stroke Friday afternoon, a government lawyer
undercut Microsoft's strategy by producing a Microsoft e-mail
written in January suggesting that the company had cynically and
selectively produced data to support this point of view.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail, Microsoft public relations executive Greg Shaw
asked others at the company: ``What data can we find right away,
showing that the Netscape browser is still healthy? The government
is introducing a bunch of data showing Netscape headed down big
time and Microsoft way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp.'s browser held a commanding lead
until Microsoft entered the market with a browser, Internet
Explorer, that was tied to the Windows operating system and set out
on a campaign to dissuade other companies to work with Netscape.
The government's antitrust case is built on the contention that
Microsoft used its dominance in operating systems to bolster its
share of the browser market illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help if you could send me some reports showing their
market share healthy and holding,'' Shaw added.
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, Robert Bennett, group product manager for
Windows, wrote back, saying: ``All the analyses have pretty much
come to the same conclusion, which is that Netscape is declining
and Internet Explorer is gaining.''
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, Yusef Mehdi, director of Windows marketing,
weighed in, saying that he had found one survey showing ``us very
close on Internet Explorer share'' and another that ``has Netscape
even or even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the trial,'' Mehdi added, ``so let's provide the
more negative analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   As David Boies, the lead government lawyer, read that aloud,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the case without a
jury, chuckled and shook his head, while Microsoft's lawyers looked
grim.
</P>
<P>
   And when Boies asked the witness, Franklin Fisher, an economist
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, what he thought this
said about his analysis of Microsoft's take on the browser war,
Fisher said only: ``This document speaks for itself rather louder
than most.''
</P>
<P>
   In questioning the witness again a short time later, a Microsoft
lawyer, Michael Lacovara, heatedly asserted that all the Microsoft
executives involved in the e-mail exchange were ``marketing and
public relations personnel'' and that the exchange was ``a
discussion of trial public relations,'' not of legal issues. In
fact, at one point, Shaw wrote that the request for market data
``is for press purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the first time Microsoft had been shown to gin up
surveys or statistics that would indicate support for the company's
view.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Boies offered as evidence an e-mail message in which
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates wrote, ``It would help me immensely
to have a survey showing that 90 percent of developers believe that
putting the browser into the operating system makes sense.'' Later,
he added, ``Ideally we would have a survey before I appear at the
Senate on March 3d.''
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent e-mail messages, Microsoft employees laid out how
they would phrase the survey questions to be sure they elicited the
responses Gates wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Boies also seemed to take some of the sting out
of Microsoft's attack Thursday evening on a previous government
witness, James Barksdale, who was chairman of Netscape. In court
last October, Barksdale asserted that because of what he described
as Microsoft's predatory conduct, Netscape could no longer get
computer makers to provide the Netscape browser with their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over half the distribution channel, and we're basically
out of it,'' he said. But an internal document prepared for America
Online at the same time, as part of that company's research for its
purchase of Netscape, showed that just over one-fifth of the
nation's computer manufacturers were shipping Netscape at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lacovara asserted that Barksdale's credibility had
been thrown into question, and Judge Jackson expressed interest in
that.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Boies pointed to several passages in Barksdale's direct
written testimony in which he listed all the companies that were
shipping Netscape on at least some of their computers and explained
precisely what the arrangements allowed. All this detailed
information, Boies and Fisher both said, showed that Barksdale was
not trying to overstate the depth of Netscape's problem. Jackson
did not remark on this development.

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDENT WILL STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Chicago president Hugo Sonnenschein, whose moves
to expand and modernize one of the nation's most revered
universities became controversial, announced Friday that he would
step down next year and return to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein, a 58-year-old economist, came to Chicago in 1993
from Princeton University, where he had been provost. He soon began
updating the University of Chicago, which has long nurtured a
reputation for intellectual rigor.
</P>
<P>
   He won acclaim for improving finances and modernizing the campus
and the university's management, but some of his efforts to
increase the size of the student body, trim the core curriculum and
make the institution's image less severe met with the indignation
of some students, professors and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   The plans even led to the formation of an ad hoc group of
nationally known conservative intellectuals called Scholars for the
University of Chicago that sought to block the changes. Among those
involved were author Saul Bellow, sociologist David Riesman and
educator Mortimer Adler.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein's opponents expressed satisfaction Friday and said
the board of trustees had urged him to step down because it had
grown weary of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But board chairman Howard Krane praised Sonnenschein and said it
was going ahead with his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board was fully informed about all of the issues involved
in these initiatives, and our goal in approving them was to
preserve and enhance our university well into the future,'' Krane
said in a statement that was also signed by his designated
successor as chairman, Edgar Jannotta. ``Our resolve remains
unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein issued a separate statement saying he had
accomplished what he had set out to do, and adding, ``I have come
to feel that it is time for another president, one who is less a
symbol of change and who has less reason to initiate change, to
carry the momentum forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sonnenschein acknowledged the
existence of what he called ``noisy minorities,'' but he said they
had nothing to do with his decision to step down as president in
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun a collection of initiatives that couldn't be
going better,'' he said. ``The selectivity of the college is up, we
have strong building programs and in 13 months I'll be nearing my
60th birthday and will go back to the best economics department in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleem Hossain, 21, of Bolton, Conn., who is finishing his third
year at the university and has helped lead a student movement
opposed to the changes, said he found it hard to believe that
Sonnenschein's decision to leave had nothing to do with the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see his stepping down as a concession that our points were
serious,'' he said. ``I think that the expansion he started will go
ahead but more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   The university said the trustees would establish a search
committee to find a new president.
</P>
<P>
   Since early winter, when Sonnenschein's plans gained attention,
small groups of students and faculty members have agitated against
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, Hossain and others organized a day of protest,
called a ``fun-in'' to satirize the administration's emphasis on
lightening the college's image. It drew 1,700 people. The
university has 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   Undergraduates at Chicago take what is one of the most demanding
core curriculums in the United States. Some say that is what drew
them to the university, so that the plan to reduce the number of
courses, even by a small margin, was unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are taught by professors in a small seminar style,
and Sonnenschein's plan to increase the number of undergraduate
students from 3,500 to 4,500 over 10 years without clear plans to
increase the size of the faculty caused some to worry that in
future such courses would be in danger of growing unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sonnenschein's administration said the increase was
manageable and necessary to insure the long-term economic health of
the university. While the university's faculty is regarded as being
among the nation's best, Chicago's endowment and applicant pool are
much lower than those of the top Ivy League institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein also believed that the university needed to attract
a broader range of applicants, and thus had to make clear to high
school students that life at Chicago was neither dreary nor a
grind. To that end, colorful marketing brochures were drawn up;
applications rose 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many faculty members said, Sonnenschein did much
that was good but had failed to maintain their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been tremendous attacks on Hugo from faculty and
students,'' said Bertram Cohler, a professor of psychology and
education. ``He just didn't have the confidence of the faculty.''

   But even as opposition leaders have been handed a strong case to
argue for the Serb leader's ouster, there is growing concern that
the propensity of pro-democracy forces here to engage in petty
squabbling could squander what may be the best opportunity yet to
end Milosevic's malevolent use of power in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Huge chunks of Yugoslavia's infrastructure _ roads, bridges, oil
refineries, and factories _ have been destroyed by NATO bombs. And
while the Western allies have said they will rebuild Yugoslavia,
they say they will do so only if Milosevic, who has been indicted
on war crimes charges, is removed from power and Yugoslavia becomes
a Western-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say they will try to convince most Serbs that
Milosevic foolishly provoked a war with NATO and needlessly wrecked
the country by subjecting it to more than 70 days of bombing before
accepting a deal he could have got without going to war. More than
just blame Milosevic for provoking a fight he could not win, the
opposition says it will stress that the country will remain an
international pariah, and an economic wasteland, unless and until
Milosevic goes.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Veselinov, a member of the Serbian Parliament who voted
for the peace plan approved Thursday, accused Milosevic of making
``the entire nation paupers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't get a cent of international aid as long as this
government keeps running the country, because it would be nothing
short of madness to invest a single dollar in this country with the
present government in charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Zivkovic, vice president of the Democratic Party, one of
the main opposition groups, predicted elections within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have destroyed the country for the last 10 years
must leave office. The democratization of Serbia is impossible with
this regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the opposition has its best opportunity in years to
oust Milosevic, there is already a growing rift within Serbia's
notoriously fractured opposition. Opposition leaders and dissidents
who left the country during the bombing are being dismissed as
cowards by those who stayed.
</P>
<P>
   There are two competing schools of thought. One holds that it is
imperative to stay in Serbia while NATO bombs, so that when the
bombing stops the opposition will be insulated from criticism that
it ``ran away.'' The other holds that, given the extent of
censorship here, and the personal risks faced by anyone considered
a dissident, riding out the war in exile gives the opposition a
platform it would never have in Serbia and offers protection from
harassment, arrest, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonja Biserko, president of the Belgrade chapter of the
Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, left Serbia and began issuing
statements from Budapest, some of the most bitter attacks on her
came not from the government but from her colleagues in the
pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonja accused those of us who stayed here of being
collaborators,'' said Vojin Dimitrijevic, director of the Belgrade
Center for Human Rights. ``It did not go over very well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such animosity is more than just a falling out between friends
and like-minded dissidents. Milosevic has remained in power, in
large part, due to a fractured opposition. The infighting over
where dissidents should ride out the war does not augur well,
according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Democratic Party, and as mayor of Belgrade,
Zoran Djindjic was well positioned to lead the campaign to
challenge Milosevic when the war ended. And though conventional
wisdom here was that it would be political suicide to attack
Milosevic while NATO was bombing, especially from outside Serbia,
that is just what Djindjic did after fleeing to Montenegro last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djindjic ran away, he does not matter anymore,'' said Vuk
Draskovic, who was fired as a deputy prime minister in April after
suggesting that Milosevic cut a deal with NATO. He is now
considered a serious rival to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rejoice at their leader's high international
profile, which was guaranteed by his pointed criticism of
Milosevic, Djindjic's colleagues worry that his decision to go into
exile obscured their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why he left for personal reasons, for his family,
but politically it is a disaster,'' said one high-ranking
Democratic Party member. ``People aren't thinking about politics
now. They don't think about Milosevic. They think about their kids,
electricity, bread, money, water. They think about surviving this
war. We need an end to the war first, then we go after Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanimir Miljkovic, 26, one of the leaders of the student
movement that staged massive street demonstrations against the
Milosevic regime two years ago, said those who want a new
government have to be pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war stops, it will be easier. Right now, you can
dismiss the opposition as traitors, and most people will listen to
that because NATO is bombing and killing our people,'' he said.
``It is a mistake to leave the country. I'm not judging people
individually, but anyone who leaves is politically dead.
Politically, I think Djindjic is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that the country will be rebuilt only if Milosevic
quits, or is voted out, is not dead. Even if most Serbs blame NATO,
not Milosevic, for wrecking their country, they also know that it
is the United States and the European Union, not Milosevic's
cronies and their impoverished allies in Moscow, who have the money
needed for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Korac, leader of the small opposition Social Democratic
Union, said Milosevic will survive only if the state-controlled
media are able to persuade most Serbs ``that they won'' by standing
up to the world's most powerful military alliance for more than 70
days of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's propaganda machine has a tough job, convincing
Serbs that they have won a great victory. That will be hard to do
when the Americans come in,'' said Korac.

<P>
   MANAKAMANA, Nepal _ Since the 17th century, Hindus in search of
their heart's desire have ascended a steep and rocky mountain to
the temple of Manakamana, the wish-fulfilling goddess.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a hike, actually, four to eight hours depending on
the strength of the climber and whether he or she is bringing along
sacrificial goats or chickens.
</P>
<P>
   But the word of mouth about Manakamana has always been quite
good, and, as one might expect of a deity who makes dreams come
true, she is a big draw. Despite the temple's location in the
remote Himalayas 70 miles west of Katmandu, some 350,000 of the
pious have been making the arduous up-and-down trek every year.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, 20th-century entrepreneurs would take note of such
heavy attendance. After doing the requisite market research, a
Nepalese corporation, Chitawon Construction and Engineering Co.,
last year built a modern sky ride with 31 cable cars to do the
climbing up the 4,000-foot-high mountainside. It has cut the time
of the once-strenuous pilgrimage to a fleet 8 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, when the $6.4 million ride made its debut,
traffic to the temple has nearly doubled and the wish of its
builders is coming true with windfall profits. Annual per capita
income in Nepal is only $210, but people have been willing to pay
$4 for the round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sacrificial goats require only a one-way fare, of course. That
charge is $2. Chickens ride free.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people means more prayers and devotion, and that is a
very good thing,'' said Insan Bahadur Thapa Magar, the high priest
of the shrine, which is a small, pagoda-style structure with two
roofs and an overhang of finely crafted wooden filigree.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one generations ago, Magar's ancestor, Lakhan Thapa, was
the only mortal who knew of the goddess' divine presence. So the
story goes, Manakamana had taken the human form of the queen of
Ghorka. When the king died, she did her wifely duty and threw
herself on his funeral pyre according to the Hindu tradition of
suttee.
</P>
<P>
   With the body of his goddess consumed by fire, Lakhan Thapa
became inconsolable. To end his grief, Manakamana promised to
reappear in another form one day.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later a local farmer plowing his field cleaved a
stone and watched in awe as blood and milk poured out onto the
ground. When Lakhan Thapa heard of it, he immediately presumed that
Manakamana had come back in the mundane guise of a rock. He built a
shrine on the site so that others could also have their wishes come
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goddess has saved me from trouble time and again,'' said
Mahesh Mittal, 32, a prosperous businessman who has been going to
the temple for five years. ``I told Manakamana that if my wish was
fulfilled, I would keep returning, and she has never failed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinduism is so elastic a religion that the beliefs of one Hindu
may be unrecognizable to another. In Nepal, which is officially a
Hindu kingdom, people frequently say they have 33 million gods and
goddesses, which is an ample supply for 23 million people. Of these
divinities, some, like Manakamana, are regarded with special
affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a very poor farmer from a very poor village,'' said Lok
Nath Bhusal, 32, who had made a long journey to visit the goddess
for the first time. ``My family lives hand to mouth, and maybe
Manakamana will give us better crops. If she does this, I have
promised her that I will sacrifice two chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a common pattern _ waiting for the wish to come true
before investing in the animal sacrifice. Practicality governs this
spiritual transaction. Faith is not in short supply, but achieved
results are what matters most.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cable cars have speeded up travel to the temple,
there is little to be done about the sluggish line to enter the
door. Worshipers go inside one at a time, kneel before an icon and
respond to the priest who asks, ``What are your special wishes?''
</P>
<P>
   They leave with a handful of flowers and coconut held on a plate
made from the leaf of a sal tree. Donations are expected.
</P>
<P>
   With all this wishing done on a one-on-one basis, there is often
a 90-minute wait. The people in line, like the goddess herself,
seem to span the oceans of time. Some are peasants whose threadbare
clothing could have come out of a 17th-century laundry basket.
Others sport Tommy Hilfiger jackets and DKNY handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers are understandably timid to discuss what they want
from Manakamana, fretting that this might interfere with a wish's
fulfillment. Supplicants who are less shy speak of exams that must
be passed, better jobs that would bring better pay, reluctant
lovers whose hearts need the nudge of further enchantment. Others
favor the full coverage of a more omnibus request, flat out asking
for the gift of total happiness.
</P>
<P>
   As they await their turn to enter the temple, the worshipers
stand in a courtyard that overloads the senses. Bells are festively
clanging. Flames are fluttering atop hundreds of candles. Incense
seasons the breezes. Flags are flapping. Vendors hawk trinkets and
freshly fried bread. Flocks of pigeons peck at the ground. Packs of
dogs chase one another.
</P>
<P>
   At the temple itself, one man with a huge knife is doing the
sacrifices. Small pools of blood accumulate beside the front porch.
Newly beheaded chickens are carried away, their twitching bodies
yet to fully comprehend the deadly news. Bleating goats, their
horns consecrated with vermilion, are led to a chopping block.
Their slit throats erupt with a sudden spray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a sight, isn't it?'' said K.P. Shrestha, an
electrical engineer who professed to have ``too scientific a mind''
to believe in the powers of Manakamana.
</P>
<P>
   He did arrive from Katmandu with a dear wish, however. And he
was extremely pleased at its fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to go up the mountain in the marvelous new cable
car.

MERRILL LYNCH MOVES TO SETTLE SOME GENDER BIAS SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind.)   (bl)  
 By ANN WOZENCRAFT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said Friday that it would begin
settlement discussions or seek additional information on about
one-third of the 904 sexual discrimination claims filed against it
by current or former employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, where it is clear that co-workers or
managers did not treat women properly, Merrill Lynch will take
appropriate actions against those responsible,'' said John
Steffens, vice chairman of Merrill and head of its retail brokerage
division, in a memo to the firm's 14,800 retail brokers, about 16
percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
   About 31 percent of the 2,900 women eligible to file claims did
so by March 2, the deadline set by a federal judge in Chicago when
he gave final approval to the settlement on Sept. 2, 1998. The
class-action suit was filed in February 1997 by one current and
seven former Merrill brokers who accused the firm, the nation's
largest retail brokerage house, of discriminating against women in
wages, promotions, account distributions, maternity leaves and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill made its announcement after delivering letters to the
plaintiffs' lawyers, Stowell &AMP; Friedman, in Chicago. All eight
women who originally filed claims are included in the 300 claims
being discussed. Merrill did not identify the others and did not
say how many of the 300 would receive a settlement offer.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Friedman, a partner with Stowell &AMP; Friedman, said: ``When
300 women in offices all over the country complain of sexual
discrimination, these are clearly not isolated instances. It's a
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffens contended that information available in the remaining
600 cases ``does not support the allegations made in the claims.''
But he said those cases would be reviewed ``if new information is
provided.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers said they planned to seek mediation of
all claims for which settlements are not offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously positive that we're moving forward,'' said
Linda Conti, one of the original plaintiffs and a former broker in
Merrill's Indianapolis office.
</P>
<P>
   Marybeth Cremin, who first sued Merrill in June 1996 before
joining the class-action suit the following year, said, ``They're
the biggest firm on the street, so anything they can do to effect
change will have big impact.''

2 ASIAN AIRLINES SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN LABOR AND FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The skies may soon become smoother for two Asian
airlines buffeted by labor disputes and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines said Friday that it had raised $200 million
in fresh capital to resuscitate its debt-ridden operations. Cathay
Pacific Airways is preparing for talks with its pilots to resolve a
dispute that has grounded between a third and half of its daily
flights since May 28.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, analysts cautioned that the good news should be
tempered by caution.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cathay Pacific made a significant concession when it
agreed on Thursday to reopen negotiations with its pilots, it is
not clear that more talking can close the wide gap between the
carrier and its pilots over salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay's senior pilots called in sick in record numbers Friday
to protest a deadline that the airline had given them to accept a
new pay package. That forced the carrier, which is based in Hong
Kong, to cancel 59 of its 117 scheduled flights. Cathay made up
some of the flights with 26 chartered planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very positive step that they're talking,'' said Peter
Negline, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. ``But
both parties have gone over this ground at length. I don't have
reason to believe that either side has moved its stance enough to
reach an immediate resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathay has threatened that if the senior pilots do not accept
its salary offer by June 11, it will lay them off. The airline had
earlier said that it would not reopen talks unless the pilots made
concessions, but now it has agreed to meet with their union, the
Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Philippine Airlines, the carrier met a Friday
deadline to raise $200 million or face liquidation. The trouble is,
most of the money is being contributed by the company's largest
shareholder, Lucio C. Tan, and investors close to him. Tan himself
has put up $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the creditors of Philippine Airlines, who
have been increasingly hostile toward Tan, will support his bid to
stay in control of the carrier. Tan, a big player in tobacco and
beer, is one of the richest men in the Philippines. He has relied
on his close ties to President Joseph P. Estrada of the Philippines
to keep the airline operating, despite its $2.2 billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tan clearly has an understanding with Estrada,'' said Jim
Eckes, a consultant at Indoswiss Aviation Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``But
does he have an understanding with the creditors? I don't see the
creditors, who haven't been paid for a year, being in a position to
accept him in top management.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest creditors of Philippine Airlines is the
Export-Import Bank of the United States, which announced plans in
May to seize four planes. The bank had earlier endorsed a plan to
rehabilitate the airline _ after Tan ceded day-to-day management to
a team of executives from Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But Tan took back the chief executive title in late April,
consigning the team from Cathay to a marginal role.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific and Philippine Airlines have more differences
than similarities. Cathay's investors include Swire Pacific, a
leading Hong Kong business empire, as well as the China
International Trust and Investment Corp., China's big state-run
investment banking concern, and is regarded as one of Asia's
best-run airlines. Philippine Airlines, which was once owned by the
Philippine government, is a virtual catalog of airline maladies _
with unprofitable routes, a costly and oversized fleet and a
bloated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both carriers have suffered during the Asian crisis, which
has sapped tourism and business travel throughout the region.
Cathay recorded its first loss in 35 years in 1998, $542 million
(Hong Kong), or $69.9 million (United States). Philippine Airlines
has lost more than $330 million the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Negline estimated that Cathay could lose $38 million because of
the canceled flights. But given its underlying strengths, he and
other analysts are sanguine about its prospects. Salaries of
Cathay's top pilots are among the highest in the industry. Hong
Kong's laws favor employers over employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cathay will start firing people at some point,'' Eckes said.
``I just don't think the pilots can afford to go on strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Hong Kong are praying for a quick end to the
dispute. The territory's tourism industry was just starting to perk
up after a long drought. By disrupting the travel plans of 40,000
passengers and counting, Cathay's dispute could hampering Hong
Kong's recovery from the recession.  &QL;

SOME SAY IT'S TOO EARLY FOR CLINTON CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They said it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was too diverse. President Clinton was too poll-driven. And
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had no foreign policy
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it would seem, those critics of the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia could be eating their words _ just as Clinton
administration officials are beginning to quietly celebrate their
vindication. And yet among many policy analysts as well as many
officials on Capitol Hill, including some Democrats, there are
still questions about whether the end of the war would really mean
the beginning of the Clinton foreign policy victory party.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many argue, there is virtually no guarantee
Slobodan Milosevic will keep his word _ or that NATO has a plan to
combat him if he does not. And even if the Yugoslav president is
sincere, there are many who believe the costs of the bombing
campaign outweighed the benefits, and that the NATO action
effectively caused the crisis it now purports to have fixed. Still
others, like Senator John F. Kerry, say the administration did not
make the right moves ``every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they did the right thing,'' Kerry said. ``I do not
think their choice of force buildup or deployment were an
appropriate way to go about it, and I think it may have complicated
their capacity to get this done as rapidly as they might have . . .
And there are still some serious dangers in the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry added, ``It's much too early to be anything but cautiously
optimistic. ... It's way too early to be crowing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would oppose a swift end to the war. And the current
peace plan, if implemented exactly as NATO desires, has almost
universal support. Advocates of the administration policy argue
this is just how things were supposed to go: airstrikes until
Milosevic capitulated, without a single US combat casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conducted approximately 30,000 sorties and lost not a
soldier in the whole conflict. It worked,'' said Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat and member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly appears the administration has been successful,''
said Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking
Democrat on the House International Relations Committee. ``I think
they deserve great credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism of the operation could be dismissed as
politically motivated, particularly since so many detractors are
Republicans who voted in April against the NATO airstrikes.
Representative Bill Goodling, a Pennsylvania Republican who helped
lead the opposition to US involvement and had warned there was a
``real possibility the conflict will escalate,'' expressed hope
this week that ``the president saves face and gets us out of this
mess. Though I shouldn't hope that, because we know he'll find
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Republicans in Congress, Goodling's chief complaint is
cost _ ``billions of dollars on a civil war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others question what those billions paid for. Although NATO may
have prevailed and Milosevic may have been stopped, some wonder
whether the Kosovar refugees are truly better off than they were
before the NATO air campaign, which is widely believed to have
provoked Serb troops into at least expanding the expulsion of
ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be that this is a victory for those who
advocated the use of force, but you still have to set up some
metrics by which to measure this,'' said Representative Tom
Campbell, Republican of California. ``How many people died during
the operation? What is the condition of the homes they're returning
to? Are the Kosovars better off?''
</P>
<P>
   If a successful peace process, assuming there is one, is not
enough to change the minds of Clinton's political opponents, it
also may not be enough to persuade outside policy analysts,
military experts, and even some Democrats that this administration
is a diplomatic force.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, some Democratic aides say they are relieved by the
agreement with Milosevic, if only because they were so convinced in
recent months that the United States was headed into a quagmire. As
a staff member for one senior Democrat said: ``We never really
thought we ought to be doing this in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some military officials are still reluctant to applaud the
airstrikes-only strategy they had criticized, especially since the
NATO bombing has not stopped. And observers of the State Department
insist Albright is still lacking a comprehensive foreign policy.
The real test, some say, will be in future dealings with places
vital to US interests _ China, North Korea, the Middle East, and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Eland, the director of defense policy studies at the Cato
Institute, a conservative think tank, said he was ``not sure we can
take this as a vindication of air power or the Clinton
administration's foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got lucky, frankly,'' he said. ``The air war
didn't stop the atrocities. In fact, the Clinton policy caused
instability throughout the region, and the airstrikes accelerated
the ethnic cleansing. We destroyed Kosovo to save it.''

DEUTSCHE BANK COMPLETES PURCHASE OF BANKERS TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank AG, sealing its position as the world's largest
bank, completed its acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. on Friday
and effectively put an end to the Bankers Trust brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche said it planned to stop using or gradually phase out
that name in almost all businesses except private banking. Deutsche
will temporarily maintain the name of the Bankers Trust investment
banking unit, BT Alex. Brown, as Alex. Brown for some of the merged
company's investment banking activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A round of layoffs also began at Bankers Trust on Friday, with
the announcement of large job cuts in the bank's fixed-income
business. Though some were concerned that a disproportionate share
of the layoffs would fall on Bankers Trust employees in the United
States, Deutsche said that its previously announced plan to lay off
5,500 people from both companies over a three-year period remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   A Deutsche spokeswoman said those layoffs, which represent
nearly 6 percent of the combined company's work force, would
reflect the strengths and weaknesses of Deutsche's and Bankers
Trust's various units and were agreed upon by management teams from
both companies.
</P>
<P>
   With $817 billion in assets, Deutsche is a legendary powerhouse
in European banking but has had less success making inroads into
the highly competitive and highly entrepreneurial world of
investment banking. In addition, Deutsche has been regarded by many
analysts as somewhat lumbering in a world in which financial
services are rapidly changing.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche chief executive Rolf Breuer said in an interview that
he believed the $9 billion takeover of Bankers Trust would give
Deutsche a ``shot in the arm'' and make it a more competitive
player in European mergers and acquisitions _ a market that is
expected to heat up in the next few years as the European economy
and European companies consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Breuer said he was ``interested in advising on
megadeals'' in the United States, he also said he had no intention
of competing head on with the firms that already have a lock on
that business _ Goldman, Sachs, for example, and Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer reiterated the bank's intention to centralize control of
the investment banking operation in Frankfurt, Germany, the
Deutsche home base. But he said he did not believe that a culture
clash would emerge as Deutsche digested Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Americans would be running the investment banking
business and that compensation within that unit would reflect the
lush salaries that typify the investment banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pay market rates,'' Breuer said. ``Otherwise people
will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Though any merger often involves thorny challenges in getting
former competitors to cooperate, Breuer said Deutsche planned to
move swiftly to integrate the operations of both banks.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank was still negotiating a settlement regarding
questions about its handling of bank accounts owned by victims of
the Holocaust. He said Deutsche would participate in a restitution
fund that should be in place by Sept. 1, but he declined to
estimate how large the fund would be.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer also said Deutsche did not expect any further legal or
financial problems stemming from Bankers Trust's recent guilty plea
to federal charges that it had misappropriated unclaimed customer
funds. He said United States regulators had immunized Deutsche from
any further claims as part of its takeover of Bankers Trust.

GERMAN FOUNDATION AGREES TO RETURN A VAN GOGH TO FAMILY OF
HOLOCAUST VICTIM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain )   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a decision that should open the way for returning
other artworks seized by the Nazis, the German foundation that runs
many of Berlin's most prominent museums agreed Friday to return a
van Gogh drawing to the heir of a German-Jewish collector who was
forced to auction off the work shortly before the outbreak of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation said
it was convinced that the collector, Max Silberberg, had sold the
drawing, called ``L'Olivette,'' or ``The Olive-Grove,'' under
duress. He said it would be returned shortly to Silberberg's
daughter-in-law, Gerta, 83, who lives in Britain. Silberberg died
in a Nazi death camp.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Berlin Friday, the foundation's 20-member board
of trustees also authorized the foundation's president,
Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, to decide any future claims to artworks
belonging to German Jews that may have been illegally seized or
forcibly sold by the Nazis and are now in the collections of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation operates 17 museums, including the National
Gallery and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and the Gemaeldegalerie
in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said no other claims were outstanding but that the
foundation was in contact with the German bureau of the Jewish
Claims Conference. He said that it was the bureau that drew the
foundation's attention to the van Gogh drawing in the National
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't realize this drawing came from a former Jewish
collector because in our catalog it was always mentioned as a gift
from the Club of Friends of the National Gallery,'' he said. ``When
we received the documentation, it was clear that the drawing had
been sold under Nazi pressure.''

   INTERNET-INDULGENCE (New York) _ A Park Avenue couple has
created LuxuryFinder.Com, an E-commercie web site that will sell
high-end merchandise like Ghurka luggage, Brioni men's accessories
and hair-care products from John Barrett of Bergdorf Goodman. It

   NY-KIRNA-BOUTIQUE (New York) _ They are 27 years old, grew up in
Virginia and are both Libras. Each day, they take turns reciting
aloud their horoscope in The New York Post. Epitomizing downtown
chic in their Tracey Feith slip dresses, jean jackets and pashmina
shawls, Sarah Hailes and Beth Shepherd are so alike they not only
complete each other's sentences, but also could be sisters. In
fact, they were sorority sisters at the University of Virginia,
where the two women met as roommates a decade ago. Today, Ms.
Hailes and Ms. Shepherd are still best friends, as well as business
partners. Next month, they plan to open Kirna Zabete, a two-level
clothing store in Manhattan that will marry NoLiTa and Neiman
Marcus. By Elizabeth Hayt. Photo. &QL;

   FASHION-AWARDS (New York) _ The first and by no means only
foul-up at the Council of Fashion Designers of America's annual
awards gala last Wednesday was that hardly any of the guests at the
Lexington Avenue armory could see one another. Somebody had draped
the room in black and dimmed the lights. You had to be practically
on top of a person to see who it was. The awards evening has a
reputation for being longer, duller and ultimately less fun than
almost any such event, and it surpassed expectations this year as
technical delays _ presumably caused by the ceremony's being
televised for the first time _ turned it into a six-and-a-half-hour
ordeal of dinner, speeches and wilting hairdos. By Cathy Horyn.

   TRAPEZE-THERAPY (McLEAN, Va.) _ I'm not sure what I was thinking
when I decided to fly the trapeze. In retrospect, it seems, I
wasn't thinking at all. I arrived at Circus Arts Workshop, an
outdoor trapeze rig here, to meet Sam Keen, the author of
``Learning to Fly: Trapeze _ Reflections on Fear, Trust and the Joy
of Letting Go,'' (Broadway Books, 1999; $23). Keen is based in
Sonoma, Calif., where he runs a program called Upward Bound,
teaching people to use the trapeze experience as a mechanism to
examine their own fears about life. It has been particularly
successful with abused women and recovering drug addicts, but
garden variety neurotics like me have also been able to benefit. By

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Cosmos, a reliable summer bloomer, is
usually available in garden centers. The plants are often part of
the dwarf Sonata series in shades of pink, lilac, rose, white or
mixed. This is unfortunate, because one of the splendid
characteristics of cosmos is the extraordinary height and mass of
bright green, lacy foliage; waxy buds, and broad blooms that a
single tiny seed can produce. The dwarf varieties grow only 20 to
30 inches tall, but the standard varieties reach four feet and
more. By Georgeanne Brennan. &QL;

JERRY SPRINGER JOUSTS WITH CHICAGO CITY COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jerry Springer, the TV talk-show host whose guests
have a penchant for punching, kicking and hurling chairs at one
another, appeared before the City Council here Friday to speak on
the issue of whether actual assaults and other criminal offenses
are committed on his program.
</P>
<P>
   That was the ostensible subject, anyway. What actually took
place was an often snide, sometimes heated discussion about the
merits of the daytime talk show, which, with an average of more
than 6 million viewers daily, is the nation's most popular. Over
the course of the three-hour meeting of the council's Police and
Fire committee, city aldermen decried what they called the show's
sanctioning of violence as a response to personal insult, and
Springer reiterated his often-voiced position that the show, which
is filmed here, portrays violent acts in an unattractive light and
therefore sends the message that violence is, well, bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my death I will tell you that the fighting you see on our
show never, ever, ever glamorizes violence,'' Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing _ the council's second on the subject, though the
first with Springer in attendance _ was attended by several dozen
of Springer's hooting supporters, though they were outnumbered by
the news media, which included a film crew from ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' (Asked by an alderman, Dorothy Tillman, whether
footage of the meeting would end up on his show, Springer shrugged
and said: ``Maybe. If it's good.'')
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took place just 10 days after Studios USA, the
production and distribution company that owns the show, issued a
statement saying the program would no longer present fights on the
air, though the company has made a similar statement in the past
and did not live up to it.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, though the Springer show has been airing benign
episodes _ like an interview with a man with an 8-foot moustache _
since then, it seemed that even after Friday's hearing, the issue
was far from settled. No one could get Springer to say,
unequivocally, that there would be no more violence on his show.
The closest he came was in an exchange with the committee chairman,
William Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there going to be any more?'' Beavers asked, meaning any
more violence. Springer, referring to Studios USA, replied: ``They
say no.'' Beavers: ``They're the boss, right?'' Springer: ``They're
the boss.'' Beavers: ``If they say no, that means no, right?''
Springer: ``Sounds like it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the level of discourse, which was a response to a
letter sent to Terry Hillard, the superintendent of the Chicago
Police Department, by the Rev. Michael Pfleger, a local clergyman
who has long crusaded against the content of Springer's show. The
letter, which asked that arrests be made when people on the show
are attacked, was reported in a local newspaper column, and the
issue was subsequently brought to the council by an alderman,
Edward Burke, who was Springer's chief questioner Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burke tried to get Springer to admit either that the violence on
the show was staged, in which case viewers and advertisers were
being hoodwinked, or that it was real, in which case people ought
to be arrested. But Springer slithered free of the trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks real to me,'' Springer said. ``But are they really
angry as they appear to be? I can't tell what's in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer said that he could, in fact, recall people being
punched on the show and chairs being thrown, but he was uncertain
whether he had actually seen someone being kicked. Burke then
showed a videotape from the show in which people were kicking and
throwing chairs and evidently trying to hurt one another. Why
wouldn't they be arrested? Burke asked.
</P>
<P>
   Springer's response was that all guests were free to file police
complaints and that some do. He also wondered why no hockey players
ever get arrested at a hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   The petulant atmosphere seeped among the government officials
themselves. At one point, Burton Mitarz, an alderman, accused
Springer of accepting the invitation to speak to the council only
to boost his audience. ``I think you think we're just a bunch of
sanctimonious buffoons,'' he said. But when he tried to continue,
he was silenced by Ms. Tillman, and he angrily yelled at her. ''Why
do you interrupt me, Dorothy,'' he said. ``I don't interrupt you
when you ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   At which point Springer leaned into his microphone. ``Throw a
chair at her,'' he said.

ALLIED SIGNAL AND HONEYWELL ARE SAID TO HOLD MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allied Signal Inc., the diversified manufacturer, and Honeywell
Inc., the maker of electronic controls, are in merger discussions,
people close to the companies said Friday. A combination of the
two, which could be announced as early as Monday, would create a
company with revenue of more than $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would confirm reports Friday that they were in
talks. Calls to Allied were not returned. Pearse O'Loughlin, a
spokesman for Honeywell, said simply, ``We don't comment on any
kind of rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street clearly believes a deal is in the works.
Shares of Honeywell soared $9.125 Friday, to $105, its 52-week
high. In contrast, shares of Allied, which is based in Morristown,
N.J., dropped $2, to $58.375.
</P>
<P>
   If the two companies merged, it would answer two questions that
Allied-watchers have been asking ever since the failure of its $10
billion hostile run at AMP Inc., the electronic connector company
that instead merged with Tyco International last year: What will
Allied do to reach the $20 billion sales target that management has
often cited as its goal? And who will succeed Allied chief
executive Lawrence Bossidy? The most likely scenario would be that
Honeywell chief executive Michael Bonsignore would assume the
merged company's top spot.
</P>
<P>
   That game plan has some veteran watchers of both companies
scratching their heads. Bossidy, a former vice chairman of General
Electric Co., remains a friend of GE chairman John Welch and sits
on many of the same national business think tanks and panels that
Welch is invited to. Bonsignore, although generally well thought of
in Minneapolis, where Honeywell is based, and among people who know
the company well, nonetheless has never attained Bossidy's national
stature.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Honeywell have Allied's robust earnings growth, others
note. ``For years Allied was talking about buying Honeywell, but
always decided against it because the company just didn't seem good
enough,'' said a former Allied executive. ``And since Larry is
leaving, no one can say he's buying it to fix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Honeywell has its fans, too. The company, which had
floundered earlier this decade, has had improved sales and earnings
for several years now, and its stock price has risen sharply in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has done a wonderful job of taking a company with great
franchises and improving them,'' said Howard Rubel, a vice
president of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``His target has been to raise
margins and he's succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst put it more bluntly: ``Running a big merged
company will be a feather in Bonsignore's cap, but the truth is,
Allied needs Honeywell a lot more than Honeywell needs Allied.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the two companies do have lots of areas where they can
help each other out. Both, for example, are major players in
avionics: Allied is one of the biggest suppliers of anticollision
and other safety instruments, while Honeywell is a leader in
cockpit displays. Together, they would be the dominant seller of
airplane controls. That could raise uncomfortable antitrust
implications, and some analysts suggested that the merged company
might be forced to divest some profitable avionics lines. But few
expect antitrust problems to derail the deal. ``After all, Allied
was never competing against Honeywell in flight systems,'' Rubel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have less obvious, but equally powerful, synergies
in selling to the chemical industry: Allied is a major supplier of
chemicals and plastics used by chemical companies; Honeywell is a
major supplier of process controls to those same companies.
</P>
<P>
   And, both Bonsignore and Bossidy have been steering their
companies away from heavy dependence on manufacturing, toward more
revenue from higher margin services. Allied, for example, now reaps
nearly 50 percent of its aerospace revenue from maintaining spare
parts inventories for customers, and overhauling their fleets.
Honeywell, meanwhile, now gets more than a third of its revenue
from such services as designing energy systems for factories and
schools, or helping oil refiners use controls to improve
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell has also been on a bit of a buying spree itself of
late. In the last year it bought Elm Ltd., a Scottish maker of
control systems used in supermarkets; Data Instruments Inc., of
Acton, Mass., a maker of sensors used in factories, and the LG
Group's half of a joint venture in South Korea that makes control
products for buildings and homes.

NEWS ANALYSIS: U.S. LEFT TO DEAL WITH MILOSEVIC STILL IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like the war in the Persian Gulf, the war in Kosovo
appears to be ending with major issues unresolved, not least the
future of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and what the
United States ought to do about him.
</P>
<P>
   Although air power apparently achieved one of its greatest
successes in the 10-week campaign in the Balkans, it did not bring
about a change in government in Belgrade _ something that only an
invasion by ground forces and a prolonged occupation could be
expected to accomplish. So for the time being, the United States is
stuck with a Serbian leader it neither likes nor trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels with Iraq are intriguing: Once again, a rogue
leader, demonized by Washington, is emerging from a conflict with
an apparently firm grip on power, with a significant part of his
military forces fighting fit and with sovereignty over his
country's territory technically intact.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton acknowledged Friday that NATO's terms for
peace did not in any way address the question of Milosevic staying
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question is left open,'' the president said. ``He is
subject to the terms of the international war-crimes tribunal,
which means that if he comes within the jurisdiction of any country
that is cooperating with the United Nations, they would have an
obligation to turn him over.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official, speaking on condition that
he not be identified, acknowledged that ``that is not going to
happen.'' On the one hand, Milosevic has been indicted in The Hague
as a war criminal; on the other, he is for the moment NATO's
indispensable partner in the effort to stabilize Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awkward, embarrassing situation,'' said Michael
Mandelbaum, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who advised
Clinton on foreign-policy issues during the 1992 election campaign.
``Nobody's about to arrest him, but it's hard just to say, `Never
mind.' How can you let it pass when you went to war because you had
to stop this evil man from committing genocide?''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by the international tribunal's
plan to send investigators into Kosovo when NATO and other
peacekeepers enter that shattered province. Presumably, they will
amass forensic evidence pointing to war crimes committed by
soldiers and paramilitary groups operating under the direct orders
of Milosevic and his associates in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wedgwood, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations who specializes in international law, said it was
``incongruous but not illegal'' for a person indicted as a war
criminal to hold high office and conduct a nation's business. ``The
facts of life,'' she said, ruled out an arrest of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's best hope is slowly to marginalize him
politically,'' she said. ``They would like to put him away like
Greta Garbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the two Bosnian Serb leaders who were indicted as war
criminals, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, have been turned over
to the authorities, even though NATO has tracked their movements
and they have traveled through parts of Bosnia patrolled by allied
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made clear that he expects the Europeans to pay the
bulk of the cost of restoring Yugoslavia to economic health _ a
rebuilding program that could cost as much as $6 billion. How much
Congress would authorize in aid while Milosevic retains power could
be a complicated question.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, the director of Foreign Policy Studies at the
Brookings Institution, who worked at the National Security Council
during the Bush administration, said economic help other than food
and medicine should be linked directly to the ouster of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the Yugoslavian people every incentive to get
rid of him,'' Haass said. ``Every morning, they should get up, go
out into the streets and see the results of this man's actions
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Milosevic appeared to be preparing the way for an
escape to Greece or even South Africa, but that now appears to be
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   An uprising against Milosevic, perhaps abetted by covert NATO
operatives, remains a possibility, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Liubco Georgievski of neighboring Macedonia
suggested on Thursday that Milosevic would be ousted in a matter of
weeks. But he gave no evidence to support that opinion, and
Milosevic's grip on the army and secret police remains firm,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that might make an uprising in Serbia more likely than
one in Iraq, which has often been predicted by American officials
but has never taken place, is that Yugoslavia is a much more
developed society. The lives of ordinary people in cities there are
more disrupted by bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   If the pact as now constituted takes effect, Milosevic will have
an ``agreed number'' of troops in Kosovo and more on the border.
That troubles some Republicans, including Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., a candidate for his party's presidential nomination. In a
statement Friday, he asked several questions: How many Serbs?
Permitted to do what? Based where? Armed, and if so, how heavily
armed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are loopholes big enough to drive an armed battalion
through,'' McCain declared. ``I don't know how you can convince
Kosovars'' _ ethnic Albanians expelled from their homeland _ ``to
return, much less give up their weapons, while there are armed
Serbs in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Signaling Republican hostility to the tentative agreement, Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said he would use hearings this month to discuss ``this
administration's misguided policy of appeasing Slobodan Milosevic''
in Bosnia and Kosovo.

JUST CALL HIM BOB BAFFLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Bob Baffert comes to you _ late, but what else is
new? _ as the reigning expert on Triple Crown dreams and
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   He trained Silver Charm, who lost the Triple Crown by less than
a length in the 1997 Belmont Stakes, and Real Quiet, who went down
by a nose in '98. High highs, low lows.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does he know that D. Wayne Lukas and the nine other
trainers in today's Belmont do not?
</P>
<P>
   He knows how much a good haircut costs in Manhattan, for one
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-eight dollars,'' he said grandly, feathering that
distinctive white mop with his fingers a day after a visit to a
Gotham stylist.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he knows there's more than one use for a bidet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry I'm late,'' he said about 9:30 a.m. Friday as he stepped
from a Triple Crown sponsor's sedan outside a Belmont Park barn.
``I couldn't get the bootwasher next to the toilet in that hotel to
work. I couldn't get the mud off.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he knows the star of NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was unbelievable!'' Baffert said. ``I'm walking down
_ I don't know if it was Park Avenue _ one of those avenues _ and
this guy comes up to me and says, `Bob, I'm a big fan. Good luck
this weekend.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, `Help me out here, I recognize you.' It's Tom
Brokaw! Mike Pegram is right in front of me. I said, `Mike, come
here, I need a witness!'''
</P>
<P>
   And what does he know about the Belmont? Put it this way, if
Baffert has been up nights, it's not because he's worrying about
his chances in the race.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a different kind of Belmont week for Baffert and
Pegram, trainer and owner of Silverbulletday, the filly who will
try to stop Charismatic from clinching a Triple Crown today.
</P>
<P>
   They're staying in Manhattan, such a rough commute to the Long
Island racetrack that Baffert has been getting to the barn about
9:30 each morning, which is about 5{ hours after Lukas has been
going to work on Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert hasn't gotten to Belmont Park early enough to watch
Silverbulletday in either of her morning gallops since she arrived
Wednesday from Louisville, Ky., leaving supervision of her first
visit to the main track on Friday to exercise rider Peter Hutton
and a local trainer's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   He has been invisible to reporters who don't want to make the
15-minute hike to barn 50, on the roughest edge of the tree-lined
Belmont backside, where he moved after being assigned the close-in
barn 1.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to have entered the Belmont mainly so he can enjoy
the downtown nightlife, hence a fancy hotel in Manhattan instead of
a fancy hotel near the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supertourists,'' Baffert calls himself and Pegram. ``We're
very low-key this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to win a $1 million horse race? Or show you care
about winning a $1 million horse race?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not, and maybe that's a good enough reason to throw
Silverbulletday, the 4-1 third choice on the Belmont morning line,
out of your trifecta wagers this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Baffert isn't exactly an early riser even in the peace and
quiet of Southern California or the dull and quiet of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But 9:30 arrivals at the barn? This is getting ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   He hopped out of the car Friday morning with a smile on his face
and asked reporters to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme act like a trainer, and go look at her
(Silverbulletday),'' Baffert joked.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's a practical reason for this odd approach.
</P>
<P>
   After the past two years, when he was the center of Belmont
attention, Baffert wants to get away from it all. After hearing too
many questions about his rivalry with Lukas, he wants to get away
from the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier when you don't win the first two (races),
because the media leaves you alone,'' Baffert said. ``I know Wayne,
(Charismatic owners) Bob and Beverly Lewis and (jockey) Chris
Antley have to be mentally exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont-day advice to the Team Charismatic from a man who's been
there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just enjoy it,'' Baffert said. ``If it's meant to be, it's
meant to be. If I was Lukas and the Lewises, about 5 o'clock
(Friday) afternoon, I'd start drinking heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baffert goes into the Belmont with low pressure,
because although Silverbulletday's fans will expect big things,
their girl being the winner of eight straight races against
fillies, she is facing males for the first time under
less-than-ideal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A mile-and-a-half race, five weeks after Baffert declared
Silverbulletday couldn't handle the Kentucky Derby's 1\ miles?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know until they turn for home whether the fuel light
will come on. All I can tell you is, she's training great,''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he's been told.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll win the Belmont? No knock on Charismatic, the best horse
in the Derby and Preakness, but I'm jumping off his bandwagon
without ever jumping on. There's no value in his 2-1 morning line
or in Menifee's 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take a shot with 20-1 Patience Game, a California-based
colt who is nicely bred for the Belmont and lightly raced, leaving
room to improve on the his victory in the Derby Trial and troubled
fifth in the Preakness. Kent Desormeaux rides to forget about Real
Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   As for Silverbulletday, I don't know what Tom Brokaw would say,
but I call her a long shot.

EMPLOYMENT GROWTH SLOWED IN MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growth in the nation's payrolls slowed sharply in May to just
11,000 new jobs, surprising experts who attributed it to a shortage
of workers to fill jobs that remain plentiful in a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said evidence of a tightening labor market, which
could eventually push up wages and inflation, may add pressure on
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates at its next
meeting scheduled for June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report ``seems to be quite a shock,'' said William
Cheney, economist for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.
``The problem is supply. People can't find the bodies to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   The US unemployment rate dipped 0.1 percentage point to 4.2
percent last month, the Department of Labor said Friday in its
monthly jobs report. Economists said that the remarkably low
jobless rate has remained below 5 percent since June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor market tightened, it caused a decline in the
unemployment rate for blacks, a segment of the population that has
suffered chronically high joblessness, for a third consecutive
month. Unemployment among blacks was 7.5 percent _ the lowest level
ever recorded, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also rapidly absorbed teenagers seeking summer jobs,
driving teen unemployment to 12.6 percent in May, from 14.1 percent
in April, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's jobs report and an upcoming report on the consumer
price index for April could prove key to whether Federal Reserve
members decide to raise interest rates later this month. Fed
watchers said that if the CPI surges again in May _ as it did in
April _ there would be extreme pressures to raise rates in an
attempt to control inflation. The CPI spiked up 0.7 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
   John Youngdahl, an economist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New
York, predicted the Fed would raise rates by 0.25 percent at the
next meeting. Given evidence of a tight labor market the Fed, led
by chairman Alan Greenspan, is likely to believe the economy is
``tending toward higher costs for labor,'' Youngdahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' wages rose 5 cents last month to an average $13.19 an
hour. That compared with a 3 cent per hour rise in April and a 4
cent per hour rise in March.
</P>
<P>
   But John Hancock's Cheney said there is little consensus among
economists about the Fed's next move.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market reacted to the ambiguous report by bouncing
around early in the day. By the close, the Dow Jones industrial
stock index rose 136.15 to 10,799.84.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000 new jobs added last month pales when compared to
343,000 job growth in April, and 83,000 growth in March. May marked
the worst monthly performance since January 1996, when the economy
lost 7,000 jobs. Economists said that the numbers may reflect, in
part, problems with seasonal adjustments in the government's data.
</P>
<P>
   The government report showed that job losses in the
manufacturing and construction sectors in May were barely offset
last month by modest gains in services and other sectors. ``It
certainly is well below expectations _ a surprisingly weak
report,'' said Denis McSweeney, regional commissioner of the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, after suffering huge job losses in 1998, due to
weakness among Asian trading partners, continue to be hammered by
competition from low-cost imports. Factory jobs shrunk by 45,000 in
May _ there are 453,000 fewer factory jobs than in March 1998. A
loss of 40,000 construction jobs last month, following a 44,000
decline in April, was blamed on rising home-mortgage interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The most robust sector _ services _ added 71,000 new jobs last
month, but that was well below the average monthly gains of 125,000
experienced over the past year, the government said. Hiring by
business services firms, including computer services, continued to
show strength but the call for engineering, health services and
lodging employees waned.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Latta, a US economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI in
Lexington said a 4.2 percent unemployment rate is ``testimony to
the fact the job market remains very, very good.'' Even given
Friday's weak report, job growth has averaged 210,000 a month in
1999, compared with 236,000 last year, she said.

NATO MAY SOON HALT YUGOSLAV BOMBINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO could stop bombing Yugoslavia as early as
Sunday if the Serbs cooperate, but Pentagon officials Friday warned
that they have seen no signs of movement in the day after Slobodan
Milosevic yielded to allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   A top NATO commander, Britain's Michael Jackson, will meet
Saturday along the Macedonia and Kosovo border with his Yugoslav
counterpart to present the details for withdrawal of Serb troops
from Kosovo and the deployment of a NATO-led international security
force to protect ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton continued to voice caution about the possible
end of the 11-week-old conflict and said bombing runs aimed at
Yugoslav military targets will continue until ``we have some
evidence that there are more than words here.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Clinton
said, ``I'm anxious to end the bombing, but I want to know that our
objectives have been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's Yugoslav government accepted an international peace
plan Thursday, but NATO leaders, including Clinton, fear that the
Serb leader will renege as he has several times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Serbia cooperates, I think the bombing could be halted by
the end of the weekend or very early next week,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Jackson will present his military counterpart with a
schedule for withdrawal and explain the benchmarks that NATO must
see as proof of a withdrawal before the bombing will stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have that movement within a day or two. But
it could take much longer than that,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Yugoslavian Parliament's action to accept the peace
plan, its armed forces continued firing at insurgent Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels and harassing the few ethnic Albanians
remaining in Kosovo, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see signs that they have pulled punches, and we do
not see signs that they've begun to pull out,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 Yugoslav troops, plus Serb irregulars, poured into
the Serb province of Kosovo as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization began bombing March 24. The troops and masked security
forces have ousted nearly all the 1.7 million Kosovar Albanians
from their homes in ``ethnic cleansing'' raids.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 850,000 ethic Albanians who fled Kosovo,
and hundreds of thousands of others are hiding in the Kosovo
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan, similar to one Milosevic rejected earlier this
year, requires Yugoslavia to remove its troops and security forces
from Kosovo, to allow a NATO-dominated international security force
into Kosovo, to allow the return of all Kosovar refugees and to
allow autonomy for the Kosovar Albanians although Kosovo will
remain a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also required the Yugoslavian military to remove its
anti-aircraft equipment within 48 hours and to remove all troops
and irregular forces within seven days. Bacon said the Yugoslav
forces must withdraw beyond a 25 kilometer security zone along the
Serbia-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard the USS Kearsarge
was moving from the Adriatic Sea to the Aegean Sea. The unit will
land in Greece, where it will position itself to become the lead
element of American forces into Kosovo. NATO intends to deploy
50,000 troops into the province, 7,000 from the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House ceremony, called the conflict a ``just
and necessary'' military campaign aimed at ending the persecution
of a people based on race and ethnicity. ``Our experience in the
Balkans teaches us that true peace can only come when progress in
discussions is followed by progress on the ground,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he noted the agreement that ended the conflict in
Bosnia between Serbs, Muslims and Croats was successful only
because international security forces stayed in Bosnia after the
peace accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there is an enormous opportunity to be
seized here _ a chance to shift our focus from defeating something
evil to building something good; a chance to work with our allies
to bring a stable and prosperous and democratic southeastern Europe
in which people are never again singled out for destruction simply
because of their religious faith or their ethnic origin,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a goal that has been worth fighting for over the last
weeks ... And I believe that the overwhelming majority of Americans
share this goal. We do not want our children to grow up in a world
which is dominated by people who believe they can kill innocent
civilians because of the way they worship God or the way they were
born,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace agreement also leaves Milosevic in power, although
his policies also have fueled conflict in Bosnia. Milosevic also
was indicted last week on charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on ABC, said Milosevic's future was not addressed by
NATO. ``That's an open question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, several leaders said they would be unwilling to
provide any reconstruction aid to Yugoslavia while Milosevic
remains in power. Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, echoed
those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that beyond some humanitarian assistance that
the United States will be interested in working with an
authoritarian regime like Milosevic to help them rebuild,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be traveling to
Europe next week to meet with foreign ministers to discuss the next
steps. She also will meet with ethnic Albanian leaders, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   On day 73 of the air campaign, NATO jets made 610 sorties and
234 strikes, according to Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman in
Brussels, Belgium. He called the air raids ``a typical day and a
typical night by the standards of this air operation.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO also was showing some restraint, keeping as its targets
military equipment and forces in Kosovo rather than any broad
attacks against Belgrade and the civilian infrastructure in Serbia,
the largest Yugoslav republic.

 &HT;    DRUG ALLEGATIONS DOG ANNUAL MEETING OF U.S. AND MEXICAN
OFFICIALS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A fresh round of explosive allegations linking
high-ranking Mexican politicians to drug-trafficking put U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno and Mexican officials on the defensive
during an official two-day visit here that ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During the 16th annual U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission meeting
here, U.S. and Mexican officials hammered out agreements to help
mutually fight forest fires and border pollution, and to reduce the
risks to illegal immigrants making dangerous border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   But when officials from both countries first gathered Thursday,
some participants said relations were noticeably strained because
of press reports this week alleging that U.S. intelligence agencies
were deeply suspicious of two major Mexican political figures.
</P>
<P>
   The two are wealthy Mexican businessman Carlos Hank Gonzalez(CQ
both), who served twice as a cabinet member under previous Mexican
presidents, and Jose Liebano Saenz Ortiz, private secretary to
current Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have publicly declared that they are innocent and that
suspicions are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference Friday, Reno did not deny the
existence of U.S. intelligence gathering on the men but she
downplayed its significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not jump to judgment based on fragmentary
reports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno added, after persistent questioning, ``I know of no
evidence that would permit me to correctly conclude . . . that
(Saenz Ortiz) is guilty of any wrongdoing. It is unfair and just
plain wrong to make judgments based on fragmentary reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Mexican officials have been particularly
critical of U.S. authorities not sharing information about drug
traffickers gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Secretary of State Rosario Green reflected this view
Friday, when she told reporters that the Mexican government had
asked U.S. officials this week to clarify what information it had
about both men or ``publicly denounce'' the reports.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. anti-drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who also was in Mexico
for the meeting, also reacted angrily to the press reports based on
leaks of confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the intelligence reports and said that dossiers
are often compiled on U.S. citizens as well, but do not prove
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we've got credible evidence, we should not be trashing
people's reputations,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reno, McCaffrey said he didn't have any information about
Saenz Ortiz that would lead him to confront Mexican officials and
say ``we've got a problem with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he hadn't read the intelligence report on Hank
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   According to published accounts in Mexico and the United States,
a report by the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center called the
Hank Gonzalez family a ``significant criminal threat to the United
States'' because of alleged drug-smuggling activites.
</P>
<P>
   The National Drug Intelligence Center compiles information from
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI, the CIA, the U.S.
Customs Service and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Reno called the binational meeting, which takes place
every year, ``bread-and-butter diplomacy,'' where issues that
affect the daily lives of citizens of both countries are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The binational commission is where good things happen,'' she
said.

NO CLEAR CHOICES FOR REFUGEES CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>

   STANKOVEC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Both families face the
same decision. After being forced from their homes, herded onto
trains or pursued over mined mountain passes, they spent weeks
crowded into this sweltering refugee camp. Now they must choose
whether to return to a ravaged Kosovo or to seek a new life in
another country.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member Shala family has three children under the age of
10 who can no longer stand temperatures of more than 100 degrees.
Their house in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, has been burnt to the
ground. The Serbs stole the family's prime income source _ the taxi
belonging to 29-year-old Zegir.
</P>
<P>
   The Shalas decided this afternoon that they could not trust the
latest talk of peace and boarded a plane evacuating refugees to
Denmark, only 24 hours after the Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed to a full withdrawal of his forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the politicians don't know how long this is going to
take,'' Zegir said as he guided the family onto a bus to the
airport. ``I don't trust Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the Llalloshi family is choosing to stay and
see if they can go home to Kosovo. There are nine members of the
family who managed to flee, including a 4-year-old boy and
68-year-old and 61-year-old grandparents withering in the heat.
Their home in Pristina is occupied by Serb soldiers. Skender, 31,
was a teacher who supported the rest of the family. But he has no
idea if the elementary school he taught in is even standing. The
Llalloshis are hoping that a Serb capitulation, and their
dreamed-of return to Kosovo, may, in fact, be at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust Milosevic but we have more hope now,'' Skender
said. The decisions these two families are wrestling with echo
those of hundreds of thousands of refugees here and in Albania. For
those who can choose to leave for other countries, the question is
whether to go far away when peace suddenly appears tantalizingly
close.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came so suddenly that both NATO and relief
agencies were caught without a plan. Refugees were still straggling
over the border Friday. Even though the safe return of the refugees
to Kosovo became the central goal of the NATO air campaign, such
basic issues as who will escort the refugees back to Kosovo, who
will dismantle the booby traps to make it safe for them once they
arrive, and who will ensure that the refugees follow the plan have
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   NATO fears that once the Albanian refugees realize that the
settlement is real, they will bolt from the sweltering camps here
and try to return on their own, before Kosovo has been pacified by
NATO troops. The result, according to Major Trey Cate, a NATO
officer here, ``could be a lot of families with missing limbs once
they hit the mines on the border.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee agency, which until Wednesday was
drawing up plans to winterize those camps, is now worried that many
refugees will refuse to believe that Kosovo is safe. They fear the
refugees will decide to remain behind in a Macedonia that does not
want them because their presence would upset Macedonia's precarious
ethnic balance.
</P>
<P>
   For all of these reasons, the paramount goal of the NATO
peacekeeping force headquartered here is to get into Kosovo first
and hold off any refugee return until the Serbian province is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will NATO go into Kosovo with 100,000 or more refugees
clogging the road?'' asked Major Cate. ``Imagine what would happen
if they all wanted to go home the day the peace agreement is
signed.''
</P>
<P>
   But holding back the refugees is against international law and
the mandate of the refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The basic division of labor is clear. NATO
troops are charged with providing a ``safe and secure environment''
in Kosovo for the refugees. That involves securing the province
under the eventual control of 30,000 NATO troops, ensuring that
neither the Serbs nor the Kosovo Liberation Army renew the
conflict, and clearing the major roads of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ensures the
right of the refugees to return _ or to chose not to return _ and
to coordinate the relief aid for them once they are in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, as usual, are caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Zegir, the main wage-earner in the Shala family, had little time
to choose. His name, as well as the names of all of the roughly
100,000 refugees in camps in Macedonia, was entered into a database
when he and his family arrived here in April after being expelled
from their home in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The database is scoured by diplomats from the dozens of
countries now accepting Kosovar refugees for potential evacuees.
The ill, women with children and the elderly are given priority,
but families like the Shalas are also sometimes chosen at random.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the name of Zegir and his relatives was posted on
a list of people accepted for evacuation to a country he knew next
to nothing about _ Denmark. Zegir, who had never traveled outside
the former Yugoslavia, had no idea what to expect. He and his
family say they only hope that it will be nice there.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a peace deal on the eve of their departure
only complicated their decision. While some refugees are eager to
permanently move abroad, Zegir and other Shala family members said
they want to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go back as fast as we can,'' said Shemsije, Zegir's
20-year-old sister.

STANKOVEC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia: 20-year-old sister.   But the
Shalas are afraid of what they might face in Kosovo. Three of their
brothers are in the Kosovo Liberation Army, and they believe that
is why they were targeted early by the Serb paramilitaries. After
the Serbs burned their home, the Shalas took a train to the border
and have been waiting in the camp for two months.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, Zegir, a man who insists on dressing in slacks and a
button-down shirt in a refugee camp, decided it would be
irresponsible for him to believe Milosevic's peace offer and
subject his family to weeks more in the heat and squalor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to live in a foreign country,'' he said. ``But we
are used to Milosevic's agreements. I can't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, eight friends wept as the Shalas entered a small
fenced- off area in this dusty camp to be cleared before boarding
the bus. So did the Shalas. As they boarded the bus, they clung to
small pamphlets they were handed describing their rights as
refugees in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Llalloshi family, while not guaranteed a trip abroad, could
likely get one. They have a close relative, a brother, in Sweden
and reunifying families is an evacuation program priority.
</P>
<P>
   Skender, the elementary school teacher who is the chief decision
maker, said he is considering sending his parents to Sweden because
they are suffering in the heat. But he, his wife, his 4-year-old
son, and three siblings will wait in the camp for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Llaloshis spent six weeks fleeing from village to village,
hiding in friends' homes. They finally decided they could take no
more two weeks ago, and walked over the mountains to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Skender said he believed that NATO would eventually help them to
go home, and he feared that if they left, they might never return
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get spoiled by the conditions and don't return,'' he
said. ``Milosevic wants that.''
</P>
<P>
   Skender, whose family lives in an 80-person tent here, battles
regret and frustration as he watches his family suffer. He does not
know what the right choice is for his family.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a column of British NATO military vehicles could
give him a partial answer. The NATO vehicles are expected to drive
past this camp on their way to a Yugoslav border post just up the
road. There, British Gen. Michael Jackson is expected to meet with
senior Serb military officials to negotiate a promised Serbian
withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it,'' Skender said, referring to the peace deal,
``when I see NATO troops go into Kosovo.''

   Some Room at the Inn &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the saddest to see Robert E. Rubin step down as Treasury
Secretary are the employees at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington,
where Rubin has made Room 214 his home for the last six years.
Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, kept his permanent
residence in New York, where his wife, Judy, remained.
</P>
<P>
   His Jefferson suite includes office, living room, exercise room
and bedroom. Next door is an office for his Secret Service agents,
who are the ones lingering, but never drinking, at the hotel bar
while Rubin dines.
</P>
<P>
   Suites at the Jefferson, a five-minute walk from the White
House, usually go for $400 to $1,200 a night, with discounts for
extended stays. Rubin often entertained in the hotel's private
dining rooms, on both government and personal business.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clinton presidential campaigns, he also used the
hotel for fund-raising dinners. The staff regards him as a
courteous guest.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jefferson regulars include Sam Donaldson and his ABC staff
on Thursday nights at the bar, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Erskine
B. Bowles, Clinton confidantes who confer there.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, the campaign strategist, romped with a prostitute
in Room 205 _directly across a courtyard from Rubin's suite. In the
Reagan years, the Jefferson was home to William French Smith, the
attorney general, and Sen. John G. Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Rubin's likely departure, the Jefferson is apt to
maintain its status as the Treasury Department annex. Spotted at
dinner last Tuesday night was Lawrence H. Summers, Rubin's
successor.

   Eugene P. Grisanti, the chief executive of International Flavors
and Fragrances, thinks he knows simpatico when he sees it _ for
instance, in Marilyn Monroe's global sex appeal and the sensuality
of the fragrances his company makes, behind the scenes, for the
likes of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Emporio Armani and Clinique.
</P>
<P>
   So when Christie's went looking for a sponsor to help defray the
marketing costs for its auction in October of Monroe's personal
effects, Grisanti signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an image-building thing,'' he said, and well worth the
six-figure cost. (Neither he nor Christie's would be more
specific.) For many brand names, ``we have always been
ghostwriters, but it's becoming more and more known that IFF makes
the fragrances,'' he added. ``The perfume industry was always very
French, and that an American company is now the leader in the
perfume business _it's like California wines taking over the wine
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's plans to put Monroe's items _ evening gowns, jewelry,
books, letters _ on exhibition in New York, Los Angeles, Buenos
Aires, London and Paris. The International Flavors name will go
along for the ride, and so will Grisanti, giving parties to
entertain customers and potential customers at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   For Christie's, the partnership with Grisanti is its second
corporate sponsorship, after Vogue magazine backed its
``Unforgettable: Fashions of the Oscars'' sale in March.
</P>
<P>
   For Grisanti, it's an attempt to raise his company's flag
overseas, where 70 percent of its sales originate but where the
French still get credit for the great perfumes. Besides, Grisanti
added, ``There may be a great `Marilyn' fragrance in this; that
would be a natural.''

   Soft-spoken and even timid in public, Louis Borders, the founder
of Borders Books and Music, has entrepreneurial visions that
contrast with his demeanor. At a ribbon-cutting ceremony on
Wednesday in Oakland, Calif., flanked by Jerry Brown, the city's
animated mayor, Borders traded literature for food and drink, and
bricks and mortar for a virtual storefront, in starting Webvan, a
new competitor in the on-line-only grocery store business.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it is the most ambitious entrant to date. Borders, 51,
promises that orders will be delivered by one of his tan-painted
vans within five hours. The service is rolling out in the San
Francisco Bay area and there are plans to be in 10 markets _ most
locations still to be announced _ by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Borders, who is no longer involved with Borders Books, said he
was returning to the family business; his father was a meat
distributor in Louisville, Ky. More generally, he said that in
starting Webvan, he wanted to meet his own hearty appetite for big
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   He debated trying other on-line ventures, but decided he had to
try using the Net for a shot at the grocery business and its
roughly $500 billion in annual sales.

CHARISMATIC'S CHANCE TO JOIN THE GREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, N.Y. _ Moments after D. Wayne Lukas, Chris Antley, and
Bob Lewis arrived in New York last Wednesday, they were gathered
together for a press conference. The three were seated in front of
a huge banner for the New York Racing Association, and on the
banner were the proud names of the Triple Crown winners.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three would talk. But the eyes of at least one
observer would wander to the name ``Omaha.'' Another would talk.
This time, the eyes fixed on ``Count Fleet'' and ``Whirlaway.'' And
still a third member of Charismatic's team would speak, and the
names ``Secretariat,'' ``Seattle Slew,'' and ``Affirmed'' would
overwhelm all words.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it seemed more than a leap of faith to imagine the
name ``Charismatic'' on the same list with America's great
3-year-old horses of the past _ Gallant Fox, War Admiral, Assault,
and the others. Late Saturday afternoon at Belmont Park, though, it
just may happen.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 could be on hand to see if Charismatic can
jump from the ranks of racing's blue-collar workers _ claiming
horses _ and into immortality. It would be a huge jump.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere would be charged enough with Charismatic's
attempt to win the Triple Crown, which has not been accomplished
since Affirmed edged out Alydar in 1978 in one of the great races
in American history. But the atmosphere will be doubly-charged
because one of Charismatic's main threats will be Silverbulletday,
a superior filly who has won 11 of 12 races.
</P>
<P>
   Guys and a Doll is how Broadway might title this show _ the girl
taking on the boys _ but it certainly won't be a musical. Rather,
it will be a thriller, with each going for the others' throats. And
adding even more anticipation is the hot rivalry between Lukas,
Charismatic's trainer, and Bob Baffert, the trainer of the filly.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic likely will be 2-1 on the tote board when the gates
open, a favorite, finally, after being overlooked at 12-1 in the
Lexington Stakes, 31-1 in the Kentucky Derby, and 8-1 in the
Preakness, his last three races _ all of which he won. Even so,
many horse fanciers have not warmed up to Charismatic, and he
probably will be the highest-odds ever in the Belmont of the 25
horses who came to New York after winning the Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet and Sunday Silence, for instance, went for the Triple
Crown last year and in 1997, respectively, and each went off as
overwhelming favorites at 4-5 (each also lost). Alysheba was 4-5 in
1987 when he failed in the Belmont, Spectacular Bid was 1-5 in
1979, and others such as Tim Tam (3-20 in 1958), Carry Back (2-5 in
1961), and Northern Dancer (4-5) in 1964), were bet heavily and
still lost.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 25 who came to New York with a chance to win the Triple
Crown, of course, only eight have won. Charismatic, though, is
coming into the Belmont off a vastly-improved effort in the
Preakness and seems on the upswing. Many who have tried the
Belmont, especially those coming out of the Derby and Preakness,
have been on the downslope of their form cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising for Charismatic is that he was able to win
the Derby and the Preakness off two vastly different scenarios. In
the Derby, the pace was dawdling, and the colt was able to lay
close and take the lead early in his stretch run. In the Preakness,
by contrast, the pace was blistering, and Charismatic was forced
back to 10th place, but he was able to close from there and win
easily. No matter the pace, Charismatic can adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday may need a softer pace if the filly is to shock
the colts. Even though Nick Zito, trainer of Adonis and Stephen Got
Even, seems to have trained speed into Adonis so he can be close to
the pace, or on the pace, it seems Silverbulletday's jockey, Jerry
Bailey, may get to the lead and try to coax the filly along on a
relatively slow pace. If Bailey can do that, the filly will be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Only four horses can make the board in the Belmont _
Charismatic, Silverbulletday, Stephen Got Even, and the plodding
Menifee. Of the 12 horses in the Belmont, though, Silverbulletday's
situation is totally different from the rest. Baffert has said he
will instruct Bailey that if the filly is beaten coming for home,
the jockey is not to abuse her. So it seems more likely that
Silverbulletday would finish first if she had the lead down the
stretch, but second if she is trailing at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering in the back of one's mind, though, were the words in
Boston last Saturday from Gary Stevens, who rode Silverbulletday
before departing to ride in Europe. Stevens surprisingly said that
he felt Charismatic would win the Triple Crown, and he had doubts
whether the filly could go 1 1/2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   So there are two plays in the Belmont. In the first, take
Silverbulletday to win, Charismatic second, and Stephen Got Even
third. The filly is extraordinary, and it still seems that the
colts in this race _ aside from Charismatic _ are more common than
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The other approach to the Belmont is this: Charismatic wins the
Triple Crown, edging out Stephen Got Even, with Menifee plodding
along for third.

U.S. TO SEEK $264 MILLION FOR BUILDING OF EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, responding to criticism
that it had failed to protect U.S. diplomats from terrorist
attacks, said Friday that it would ask Congress for an additional
$264 million next year to build new, more secure embassies.
</P>
<P>
   An independent panel that investigated the bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa last August concluded in January that the
State Department needed to substantially increase its spending on
security, especially for construction of new posts that meet the
department's own internal-security guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies that were attacked, in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, did not meet those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the panel issued its report, the State Department's
budget for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, proposed a
spending increase less than half the amount the panel had
recommended for embassy security. Adm. William Crowe, the retired
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who led the panel's
investigation, publicly complained that the budget request was
inadequate, and congressional leaders contended that the
administration was shortchanging security needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, State Department officials said the Office of
Management and Budget had blocked their efforts to propose a larger
budget increase. But with pressure building from Crowe and
Congress, the White House agreed to review the fund levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admiral Crowe did a service by bringing so much attention to
this,'' an administration official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In its budget request for the next fiscal year, sent to Congress
in February, the State Department asked for an additional $36
million for new embassy construction. Now, that is being raised to
$300 million, an administration official said. A further $268
million is being sought for the hiring of new security guards and
other continuing security measures, apart from the construction of
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the administration plans to ask Congress to
allocate an extra $150 million a year for the following four years.
In 2001, funds for embassy construction would be increased to $450
million, and by 2004, this would reach $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official declined to say how many new
embassies the State Department planned to build with this money.
The official also said that the additional funds, which will be
proposed to Congress next week, would not be offset by reductions
in other State Department spending programs, although they would
have to be offset from expenses elsewhere in the federal budget.

<P>
   Something special is happening,'' intones the trim, energetic
middle-aged man in a gray V-neck sweater. ``You can feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, something special is happening to Gerald P. Hirshberg,
59, chief designer for the Nissan design studio and television
spokesman for the company's sales push. He has become the symbol of
Nissan's struggle to remake its image _ a campaign buttressed by a
fresh lineup of vehicles and $5.4 billion from Renault, which got a
37 percent stake in return.
</P>
<P>
   The loquacious Hirshberg, who suffered in relative silence as
Nissan drifted into the role of manufacturer of exceptionally
reliable cars for nobody in particular, is making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a loss of confidence, a loss of vision, a loss of
heart,'' he recalled, referring to a decade in which Nissan
abandoned every sporty model it made but failed to build a
bread-and-butter family sedan to compete directly with the Toyota
Camry and Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed hard, but they pushed harder,'' he added _ ``they''
being the Nissan executives in Tokyo who largely ignored the
American market in favor of conservative Japanese customers and
insisted on ever-blander sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg has been around this block before. Born in Cleveland,
he got a dose of liberal arts and engineering at Ohio State
University before studying at the Cleveland Institute of Art. After
securing a traveling fellowship (his winning project: a heliport
for the Cleveland lakefront), he was wooed by the General Motors
design shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit stood for everything I loathed in design,'' he
recalled. But Hirshberg's initial brush-off only made the company
more ardent. ``GM hired me as a renegade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg rose quickly through the vast bureaucracy, working
for, among others, John Z. DeLorean. In 1970, he became the chief
designer for the Pontiac division, and, in 1974, for Buick. His
credits included some sexy Pontiac GTOs and Firebirds, as well as
the stylish Buick Riviera of the late 70s _ ``but only,'' he
explained, ``to the degree that anyone can claim credit in GM's
committee-driven design system.''
</P>
<P>
   The openness to change that led the company to hire Hirshberg in
1963 evaporated with the gasoline shortages of 1973 and an
onslaught of well-made, fuel-efficient cars from Japan. ``Something
was dying at GM,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1979, when Nissan offered him a free hand in putting
together an American design studio, the Japanese auto maker was
pushing on an open door. His design team made its mark early with a
face lift for the venerable ``Z''-series sports car, plus
significant design suggestions for the first, immensely successful
Pathfinder sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the deal Hirshberg struck with Nissan was discretion to
create products other than cars. And the sheer variety of stuff
that has reached the market from Nissan Design International is
dazzling: children's furniture, a desktop PC, golf clubs, even an
ultra-fast motor yacht.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Design has no sales force, and profits _ surely modest,
though they are not disclosed _ are generally invested in staff
education and morale-boosting perks, like trips to art exhibits.
Perhaps it is no coincidence that not a single professional has
been recruited away.
</P>
<P>
   It has not all been triumph. The rounded Infiniti J30 mid-size
luxury sedan, which many view as the studio's most significant
design, was a failure in the Japanese market. So in the early
1990s, the design pendulum swung decisively back to Tokyo, as
Nissan focused on Japanese customers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, with Nissan losing market share
across the board, the company again looked to the design studio in
San Diego. It probably did not hurt that Hirshberg had been
studying Japanese. ``I can now ask where to find the toilet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken designer is bursting with enthusiasm for the
Xterra, a versatile and relatively inexpensive sport utility that
was introduced last week and is aimed at surfer dudes. And he has
transformed the Frontier compact truck by adding a second row of
seats with their own doors.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to come is a hybrid sport utility pickup, a chunkier
Pathfinder, a new Z-car in the $20,000 range and perhaps a
sedan-like hybrid with lots of cargo room.
</P>
<P>
   All this, plus a well-received business memoir _ ``The Creative
Priority'' (Harper Business, 1998) _ has left Hirshberg in an
expansive mood. Life is good in sunny Southern California with his
wife, Linda, a psychologist. And, he says effective control of
Nissan by Renault, known for innovative design, will give him even
more leeway to listen to alternate muses.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the biggest question: What does Hirshberg drive? ``Right
now, an Audi A6,'' he replied. ``I really admire Audi designs.''

BAD NEWS FOR CELTICS, WIDOW OF REGGIE LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dr. Job Fuchs told the Northeastern University school
paper this week that he will testify in court that Reggie Lewis
tested positive for cocaine while he played basketball at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news for both the Celtics and Reggie's widow, Donna
Harris-Lewis, who filed a malpractice suit against three doctors
who had treated Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs, who has flip-flopped in the past about whether Lewis
tested positive in 1987, told reporter Mike Trocchi: ``I think it
was pretty clear that he tested positive on the first test. A few
days later he tested negative.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 and '91, while playing for the Celtics, Lewis signed
three insurance applications, totaling $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the applications, Lewis was asked if he ``ever'' had used
marijuana, cocaine, etc. Lewis said no.
</P>
<P>
   If Fuchs is correct _ and his testimony will be supported by
others from Northeastern _ this becomes a $17 million fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It also contradicts the testimony of Harris-Lewis that her late
husband never used drugs, that it was against Reggie's
``philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics could find themselves at risk for $5 million. This
comes on the heels of their last financial report, which stated
that the Boston Celtics Limited Partnership, which owns 48.3
percent of the team, lost $8.5 million in the last six months of
'98.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis is being paid close to $12 million from those
insurance policies, which are covered under the statute of
limitations. However, the last policy for $5 million is not, and
the insurance company will have an open door to try to recoup that
money.
</P>
<P>
   Former NU athletic director Irwin Cohen has said all along that
Fuchs told him in 1987 that both Lewis and teammate Andre LaFleur
tested positive for cocaine. And Karl Fogel, who was the NU coach
at the time, told the school newspaper that LaFleur came to him a
few days after the test and told him that he and Lewis had tested
positive. Fogel told the paper he talked to Lewis about the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said he expects to be called by the defense lawyers in the
next couple of weeks.

   Payne Stewart knows who the winner will be in the upcoming
made-for-TV, head-to-head match between David Duval and Tiger
Woods. ``IMG will be a big winner,'' laughs Stewart, who will visit
The Country Club in Brookline in a few weeks before heading to
Europe. Stewart hopes to be back in September as part of the US
team for the Ryder Cup. ``I really hope it works out that way,''
says Stewart, who acknowledges that there is no pressure in golf
like Ryder Cup play. ``(Team captain) Ben Crenshaw has talked to
some of the guys about what we would like to see (in the course in
Brookline), and I told him that I would like to see a setup that
gives us a chance to make shots. The pressure will make all of us
either look silly or brilliant.'' As for the Woods-Duval encounter,
Stewart seemed more curious than anything. ``IMG has both golfers,
so they will start out by getting 20 percent of what they make on
the deal,'' he says. ``And then I'm sure IMG will get a piece of
the television money for putting the package together. So they are
going to do well. I hope it goes well, because I think it could
help all of golf. But I don't know how it is going to happen. It
will be live, and there is a lot of time to fill between shots when
you have those guys walking the course. When we play Skins games
they have us miked and want a lot of banter back and forth with the
players. Both of these two guys are very quiet, intense. They don't
say a lot on the golf course. I just hope it works and brings more
of the viewing public to watching golf.''

   M.L. Carr doesn't find it easy watching Tim Duncan become the
best player in the NBA in less than two years. ``I think of what
might have been and it hurts,'' says Carr, thinking back to the day
a couple of years ago when he and Celtics publicist Jeff Twiss went
to New Jersey, confident they were going to bring back Duncan and
start a new dynasty in Boston. ``Jeff and myself went down for the
draft lottery,'' remembers Carr. ``We had a higher percentage of
chances than anyone else to get the top pick, and Duncan. He is the
guy we coveted. I didn't think we would miss him. And when we did,
a little piece of me died. I took a lot of bullets (coaching the
year before) hoping we could get this kid, and it just didn't work
out.'' San Antonio ended up with the first pick and took Duncan,
who is now the cornerstone of that team. ``When we got to New York,
I was very confident we were going to get the top pick,'' says
Twiss. ``We had two lottery picks, and two expansion teams,
Vancouver and Toronto, couldn't pick if they were in the top three.
But I started to worry in the warmup. They had a mock draft to show
us how the real one was going to go, and San Antonio wound up with
the first pick in the mock draft. My palms started to sweat. Then,
when they won it again, I couldn't believe it. We could have come
out of that draft with Duncan and Keith Van Horn, and instead we
ended up with the third and sixth picks, when we had a chance for
one and two.'' Carr says Duncan is everything he thought he would
be: ``He is a dominant player. He can run the floor. Passes out of
the post. Has a nice jump hook. Can step outside and hit the jump
shot. Can go either way. If I brought him home that time there'd be
a second statue in Faneuil Hall right beside Red (Auerbach), and
that guy would be waving a towel.''

   The Celtics may bring a WNBA team to Boston, but it won't be for
another three years. Rick Pond, the Celtics' chief operating
officer, says the team has been doing all of its financial homework
and doesn't have the right formula yet. ``The big drawback is that
most of the (teams) that have WNBA teams own their own buildings.
We don't. We are tenants in the FleetCenter. The present teams in
the WNBA have their own buildings, and the new teams being added
this year all have new buildings. I don't see us being able to do
anything until 2002 at the earliest, but we do have a strong
interest, and if we can make it feasible financially, then we will
want to do it.'' What Pond is saying is that it is much easier for
a team like the Knicks, who are owned by the company that owns
Madison Square Garden, to bring in a women's team, because the
concessions, souvenirs, etc., are all owned by the same entity. In
the FleetCenter, which is owned by Delaware North (which owns the
Bruins), all of the concessions, etc., go to the FleetCenter, not
the Celtics. Therefore, it doesn't make as much sense for the
Celtics to jump into the WNBA right away. In fact, the Celtics were
thinking about putting a WNBA team in Hartford because it would be
cheaper, but the league wants the WNBA squads to play in the same
city as their brother teams.

   Although it has yet to be finalized, Boston College and Notre
Dame have made a deal for seven more football games, which will
stretch the present arrangement to 2013. In the first contract,
Notre Dame got eight games at South Bend with four in Boston. This
time ND gets four in South Bend with three in Boston. Somewhere in
the middle, the teams will not play each other for two years, due
to prior commitments . . . The day after his Bruins were whacked
out of the playoffs by Buffalo, Harry Sinden said Boston will be
willing to spend bigger bucks to land players in free agency. But
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell doesn't see that happening
at this point. ``There is no one that we can see as a free agent
now that would have a lot of interest for us,'' says O'Connell.
``But we are hoping that will change. With so many teams losing
money, we think that some of them might have to let players go
after July 1 to save money that they would not let go otherwise. If
someone pops up after July 1 that we would have an interest in,
then we would be willing to spend big money to get him.'' O'Connell
says the team's first wish would be a scoring forward. He thinks it
is solid in net and on defense. Signing goalie Byron Dafoe,
defenseman Hal Gill, and forward P.J. Axelsson are top priorities .
. . Glenn Foley is a big Keyshawn Johnson fan. Johnson, the Jets'
All-Pro wide receiver, gave Foley and the other New York
quarterbacks each a $15,000 watch for helping him get to the Pro
Bowl last season. In Foley's case, it is a special gesture because
Glenn has been traded to Seattle, and Vinny Testaverde played most
of the time last year . . . Congrats to John Scarpellini of the
Josten's Co. in North Attleborough. Scarpellini pulled a rare
``double'' for the NFL, getting to make the Super Bowl rings for
both the champion Denver Broncos and the runner-up Atlanta Falcons.

 &HT;    A former Atlantan wages a crusade for wholesome films on the
industry's home turf _ and has made some friends there.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Ted Baehr, actor, lawyer, minister and movie
producer in former lives, uses all those skills and more nowadays
in his attempt to reform the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Baehr, formerly of Atlanta, moved west 2 1/2 years ago to be
near the home court of the Hollywood elite. But he's not standing
on his northern suburban hillside throwing stones. He's come not to
conquer but to convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a positive light in everyone he touches,'' says
Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, whose
recent films include ``Tarzan'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' ``He is not
afraid to let you know when he thinks you've done something
inappropriate, but at the same time, he takes the position that if
you honor the good, more good will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook is one of dozens of studio executives and celebrities who
attended Baehr's seventh annual Movieguide Awards Gala at the
Hilton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles this spring. Along with
watching the presentation of statuettes including _ yes _ crystal
teddy bears, attendees got to hear Baehr's annual Report to the
Entertainment Industry. Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More films with what Baehr calls a ``strong Christian
worldview'' were released in 1998 than in any of the previous 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Films with little or no sex gross more than twice as much
money as sex-laden films. &QR;  G-rated movies gross, on average, three
times as much as R-rated ones.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies will be featured on PAX TV (WPXA in Atlanta) at
10 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Baehr, obviously, has yet to win over the entire industry. Some
insiders criticize him for being too hard-line, while some
Christian colleagues say he's too soft.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks films, asked
Baehr to pull together religious leaders to review ``The Prince of
Egypt.'' Tom Sherak, one of the top executives at 20th Century Fox,
has been known to call. And Cook of Disney considers him a friend.
</P>
<P>
   On any day of the week, Baehr, who maintains offices in both
Atlanta and Camarillo, is likely to be taping his nationally
syndicated radio or television segments, writing material for
Movieguide magazine (also on the Internet at www.movieguide.org),
reviewing screenplays, advising would-be Christian filmmakers,
lecturing at academic or religious events, attending early
screenings of new movies, or chatting with producers or designers
about religious details in their television shows.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls helping the directors of JAG stage a baptism,
suggesting some Scripture for ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' and
giving the makers of ``The Magnificent Seven'' television series
some synonyms for the devil.
</P>
<P>
   He comes to show biz naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Son of an actor
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1946 to Theodore Baehr, better known as Robert
``Tex'' Allen, the original ``Texas Ranger,'' and his wife, Evelyn
Peirce, an ingenue at MGM. As a child, he performed in commercials,
movies and television, and on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The home where Ted Baehr and his sister were raised was not
religious, although the entire family eventually became Christian.
Baehr had studied at Munich, Cambridge, Bordeaux and Toulouse
universities in Europe, graduated from Dartmouth with a degree in
literature and from New York University School of Law before he
turned his life over to God.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the date and the time: Feb. 12, 1975, at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had died when he was 14, and a woman who was dating
his father encouraged him to read the Bible. Feeling nagged by his
father to comply, he agreed to read the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got as far as Matthew,'' he said _ and then was converted.
</P>
<P>
   Baehr was financing independent films at the time _ mostly
sleazy, he says. He refuses to reveal the titles, but mumbles
something about ``motorcycle gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon decided to go to seminary and enrolled at the Institute
of Theology at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, an Episcopal
institution. To foot the bills, he took a job as director of the
television center at the City University of New York. There he
first began examining the impact of TV.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he was elected president of the Atlanta-based Episcopal
Radio-Television Foundation (now the Episcopal Media Center),
which, while he headed it, won an Emmy for ``The Chronicles of
Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,'' an animated
special.
</P>
<P>
   By then he had already begun thinking that there should be an
organization to promote Christian values in entertainment. Then, in
1983, while serving on both the communications board of the
mainline National Council of Churches and the evangelical National
Religious Broadcasters, he met George Heimrich.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, as head of the old Protestant Film
Office funded by the National Council of Churches, Heimrich had
served as a kind of Christian lobbyist and consultant with
producers and directors. He warned them of scenes or dialogue that
would be offensive and helped them to be accurate in their
portrayals.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Ken Wales, who made the ``Pink Panther'' movies and
most recently the television series ``Christy,'' introduced the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives viewed Heimrich just as they would a
historical consultant or an expert on any other subject, said
Wales. ``They saw him as a bright, intelligent friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Baehr met Heimrich, the NCC had long since
stopped funding the position.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wales says, Baehr has filled in the vacuum. ``We're all
very pleased to have his presence out here,'' said Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Baehr has published Movieguide since 1985 to advise parents of
film content. The magazine rates films in two separate categories:
quality and content. ``The Matrix,'' for instance, received four
stars for excellent production quality, but a -2 for acceptability,
with ``discretion advised for adults'' (a +4 is the best rating, a
-4 the worst). ``Body parts all over the place,'' says Baehr.
``It's a symphonic opera of death, a fantasy Columbine world, but
it's very exciting stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Many kids, he says, love it. ``But just because they enjoy it,
it doesn't mean it's appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex, violence a concern
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny California morning, Baehr sat in his back yard
with his wife and partner, Lili. Around them birds sang, flowers
bloomed and the world seemed serene. Baehr sipped coffee from a mug
featuring a bear wearing moose antlers with the slogan ``Please
Don't Feed the Bears,'' and talked about movies, television,
violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   In a guesthouse nearby, two employees of Movieguide worked in an
office where even the bathroom was stacked with videotapes and
papers. Prominent in Baehr's own quarters is a poster of his
father, called Papa Baehr by the family, who died last year at 92 _
the same year, coincidentally, that the film world lost two other
famous cowboys, Roy Rogers and Gene Autrey.
</P>
<P>
   When Baehr started his enterprise, it seems most conservatives
were concerned about sex in entertainment and most liberals worried
about violence. Today almost everyone gives lip service to both, he
said, and people on both sides seem to accept that there is some
connection between what people watch and what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good news _ everybody's worried about everything,''
he said, ``but nobody's doing anything about it. We want to be
entertained. We're like the Romans going into the Colosseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Baehr is out to get every bit of sex and violence
removed from cinema. ``Victorianism is not the answer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If only G-rated movies were produced, he points out, there would
be no ``Schindler's List.'' No ``Amistad.'' Baehr advocates getting
the industry ``to adopt standards and stick to them.'' He also
hopes more Christians will acquire the skills to produce their own
films with quality that matches the best on the market.
</P>
<P>
   He sees some indication that many studios are paying more
attention to what they produce, and he sees more avowed Christians
attaining influential positions in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But those things alone won't be enough, he says. To really
change the culture, people have to become ``media literate'' and
pass it on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   In his own home, he says, he and Lili talk to their four
children, ages 10 to 18, and make sure they know what the family
believes so they can apply discernment to everything they see.
Every parent should do as much, he advises in his book ``The
Media-Wise Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just engaging their minds and giving them the right questions
to ask can change their attitude about what they're watching,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But Baehr, mellower than when he began 15 years ago, does not
see a revolution coming. Now, with a $1.2 million annual budget and
a name that gets his telephone calls returned, he still finds
progress slow and hard-won. With every school shooting people ask
the questions again, but they seldom seriously try to find answers,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his yard looking over the flowers, he becomes
pensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably go on to glory and still not have this issue
resolved,'' he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIEGUIDE'S TAKE ON THREE CURRENT FILMS
</P>
<P>
   The following are excerpts from reviews in Ted Baehr's
Movieguide magazine, billed as ``A Family Guide to Movies and
Entertainment'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment''
</P>
<P>
   Production quality:
</P>
<P>
   Moral acceptability: Extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the movie premise that it takes a thief to catch a
thief, ``Entrapment'' is a retread of many Hollywood crime dramas
with some fancy special effects scenes, credible acting and
serviceable direction. Containing action violence, many obscenities
and sexual innuendo, this movie portrays the thieves as the good
guys and the FBI as the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Shakespeare's
</P>
<P>
   A Midsummer Night's Dream''
</P>
<P>
   Production quality:
</P>
<P>
   Moral acceptability: Extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring a stellar cast, sumptuous photography and art
direction, and a little naughtiness, this is perhaps one of the
most pagan of all Shakespeare's stories as it champions romantic
love in a world of fairies, sexuality and magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1_ The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   Production
</P>
<P>
   quality:
</P>
<P>
   Moral acceptability: Caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' is an epic symphony based on mythic concepts.
There are constant references to be mindful of the living Force,
which is personalized in this episode. In terms of action and plot,
``The Phantom Menace'' is comfortably PG. What is threatening is
the New Age philosophy that creeps into this movie all too
frequently. Concerned parents whose children demand to see it
should see ``Star Wars'' with their children to help them think
through the movie's theology.

 &HT;    EDs: Embagoed for Sunday June 6.
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Michael C. Carlos Museum may have acquired more
than it bargained for with its recent purchase of a $2 million
Egyptian mummy collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility _ and at this point it is only a
possibility _ that one of our new mummies might be Rameses I,''
says Museum Director Anthony Hirschel. ``If that is the case, this
would be the only royal mummy outside of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   The curatorial coup that brought the world-class collection to
the Emory University campus last month has rekindled interest in
one of archaeology's great unsolved mysteries _ the disappearance,
probably sometime in the 1800s, of the remains of Rameses I,
founder of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Where did his mummy go? Who spirited him away from his tomb in
central Egypt? No one knows for sure. But Carlos museum officials
are wondering if one of the 10 mummies they recently acquired from
the Niagara Falls Museum in Canada might be the missing patriarch
of Egypt's 19th dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance that the mummy now lying in stiff repose in
the museum's climate-controlled storeroom is Rameses I, museum
officials this week began drafting an ambitious research plan _ and
moved to pre-empt any possible political fallout before it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of museums around the world own mummies, Egypt
looks upon the remains of its royalty much as the United States
does its dead presidents: They belong at home.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has an uneven record of enforcing its antiquities laws,
but it has always been adamant about its pharaohs. The museum room
in Cairo that contains their remains is sealed by presidential
decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this turns out to be Rameses I, the right thing to do would
be to reunite him with the other royal mummies in Egypt,'' Hirschel
said. ``A royal mummy could be a terrific draw for our museum, but
if this really is Rameses I, there is absolutely no question that
we will do the right thing. We will send him home where he
belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials are in the process of notifying Egyptian
authorities and the Cairo Museum _ which holds the mummies of
Rameses I's son and grandson, Seti I, and Rameses II, one of
Egypt's most reknowned pharaohs _ of their suspicions about the
possible identity of the mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel hopes the Carlos museum's voluntary expression of good
intentions will help enlist Egypt's assistance in identifying the
mummy _ and, if it should prove to be Rameses I, might merit some
reciprocal gesture, like the loan of other Egyptian antiquities for
exhibit in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Any successful investigation would have to be built on evidence
_ scientific, archival and anecdotal _ that bridges the gap between
the late 20th century and the age of the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good detective stories, though, the search for answers
promises to be as intriguing as the answers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the notion that the mummy of Rameses I somehow
found its way out of Egypt's Valley of the Kings to Atlanta, with a
stopover in Niagara Falls, Canada, is based on incomplete,
unsubstantiated and circumstantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But officials hope that a battery of tests _ including emerging
molecular genetics techniques that may make it possible to compare
the DNA of the mummy with that of Rameses I's descendants in the
Cairo Museum _ will tell them who the mummy is. Or, at least, who
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of all the attention, a 5-foot-5 mummified male _
museum accession number 1999.1.4 _ now lies swathed in mounds of
archival quality plastic wrap in a simple cardboard box in the
storeroom of the Carlos museum. His skin is taut and blackened by
the plant resins used to embalm him. He is naked, head tilted back,
mouth open and arms crossed over his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crossed arms are usually reserved for royalty,'' said
Peter Lacovara, curator of ancient art for the museum. ``And the
scar that was left when he was eviscerated for embalming is
consistent with what we see in other mummies from around 1500 B.C.
to 1200 B.C., a period that includes the reign of Rameses I.''
</P>
<P>
   A radioactive carbon test performed in Canada several years ago
also suggests that the mummy is about 3,200 years old, give or take
a few hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara says the mummy's facial features bear uncanny
resemblance to those of Seti I, his son and successor to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crossed arms do suggest that he was a member of a royal
family,'' agreed Gayle Gibson, staff member of the Royal Ontario
Museum and president of the Society for the Study of Egyptian
Antiquities, who studied the collection when it was in Canada. ``If
that's the case, given what is known about the time and place that
these mummies were collected in Egypt, he could very well be
Rameses I.''
</P>
<P>
   The mummy collection, owned by the Niagara Falls Museum for
nearly 140 years, was assembled in the 1860s by Col. Sydney
Barnett, son of the founder of the museum. He acquired the mummies
during a visit to Thebes, in Egypt's Valley to the Kings, in 1861,
at a time when the thirst for Egyptian antiquities abroad was
fueling an epidemic of tomb robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Just how he acquired the mummies and managed to circumvent
Egypt's 1835 ban on the export of antiquities is unclear. Until
this year they remained the property of the Canadian museum.
</P>
<P>
   Rameses I's tomb was found in the same area, near Luxor, about
35 years earlier, but the whereabouts of the pharaoh's remains were
never determined. Egyptologists believe it may have been looted in
ancient times, or moved to a safer location, a secret cache for
royal mummies at Deir-el-Bahri in western Thebes.
</P>
<P>
   Tomb robbers were raiding that cache repeatedly within a decade
or so of Barnett's visit to the area. Looting and the sale of
artifacts in the area was so rampant that in 1881, Egyptian
authorities moved the rest of the royal remains to Cairo for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnett was in the right area of Egypt at about the right
time,'' says Hirschel. ``We are trying to obtain more detailed
records of his collecting. We hope they'll tell us more.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling evidence, however, may come from just across
campus, where the laboratory headed by Douglas Wallace, of Emory's
Center for Molecular Medicine, has pioneered the use of new
technology for the study of human genetic roots.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's discoveries about the origins of prehistoric people in
America, which can be read in the genetic traits of modern Native
American populations, are helping overturn popular theories about
the peopling of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   After conferring with Carlos museum officials this week, Wallace
says he is excited about the opportunity to see if emerging DNA
analytical techniques can provide a positive ID for a
3,000-year-old mummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I would have said it was impossible. But now,
with some of the new techniques that have just become available, I
think the probability of success is great enough that it will make
the investment of time and money required worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the DNA in humans' Y-chromosome is passed from father to
son virtually unchanged, Wallace says, at least in theory genetic
material from the mummies in Cairo _ the son and grandson of
Rameses I _ could be used to determine whether they are related to
the mummy in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But there are major hurdles to be overcome. Mitochondrial DNA,
which is passed on maternally from generation to generation, is
hardier and more plentiful in ancient tissue than that of the
Y-chromosome. But all of the mummies in question are males.
</P>
<P>
   Using a process called polymerase chain reaction, scientists can
amplify even minute quantities of genetic material. But because the
magnification process also magnifies the DNA from any modern
contaminants, the need for purity is paramount. The best source for
uncontaminated DNA may be the tissue inside one of the mummy's
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace says the research will require a willingness by Egyptian
authorities to make their mummies available for testing _ and
background testing of living Egyptians to determine what kind of
normal genetic variation exists in the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to raise false hope,'' he said. ``There may be no
good DNA in this mummy. It's not like taking a blood sample. This
will be a long, and very careful process that will require many
steps, with no certainty that it will give us an answer.''

MEDVEDEV BESTS NERVES, CRAMPS, AND A NO-HOPE REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Suddenly Andrei!
</P>
<P>
   For the many followers of the little bald-headed, pigeon-toed
guy from Las Vegas with the same-sounding name _ the former
roommate of ``Suddenly Susan'' TV diva Brooke Shields _ it was the
wrong one. It was bulky Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev holding a
reservation in the French Open final, and not _ not yet, anyway
_Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was Medvedev who became the symbol of love
conquering all, and not Agassi, whose highly hyped romance with
Shields has bageled out. Love's labor was not lost, after all, for
Medvedev. Nor was Friday's totally unexpected semifinal with a
delightfully loosey-goosey Brazilian, Fernando Meligeni, a 7-5,
3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) Medvedev victory in which the Ukrainian had to
squirm out of five set points in the 10th game of the opening set
and another in the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   While his reclaimed lady love, Anke Huber, smiled on him from a
courtside box (as the sun refused to do), Medvedev overcame nerves,
cramps, and a no-hope reputation to get past the barrier where he'd
crashed six years before. He also beat the rain that was bound to
leak from mean, smoky clouds, and, ranking No. 100, is in position
to become the longest-shot champ in French annals. Nice.
</P>
<P>
   His adversary in Sunday's final is a mystery because the
downpour chased Agassi and Dominik Hrbaty, plus 16,000 onlookers,
from Stade Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Agassi was threatened. Yes, he did end the day in the
lead, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 1-2, and he will be serving when they
return Saturday at noon for the conclusion of their semifinal, an
appetizer for the women's title clash between a phoenix named
Steffi Graf and a phenom named Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Las Vegas Andre is that the slugging Slovak,
21-year-old Hrbaty, acts intimidated not a bit. He pounced when it
seemed he was finished, with Agassi gripping a break point for a
3-1 edge in the third. With those coal yard clouds practically on
his shoulder, Agassi was trying too hard to get it suddenly over,
and he made mistakes that resulted in him and Hrbaty stewing all
night with their fates dangling in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   No such bad luck for the Andrei from Kiev, suddenly restored
because ``my game and Anke came back to me. I don't know why God
did this for me, in the city where I had my first big success, but
I have never been so happy in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A chirpy 18-year-old in 1993, Medvedev beat Stefan Edberg to
make the semis, then stalled against the champ-to-be, Sergi
Bruguera. For a time, he inhaled the heady atmosphere at No. 4. He
fell for Huber, a German top-10 habitue, and made a lot of money _
``more than anybody I know in Kiev ever see.'' Life was good for
the big kid, a 6-foot-4-inch, 200-pounder. But Huber dumped him,
injuries cut in, and his tennis and ranking went south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to get in this year, No. 100,'' he said. ``But I
have put in the work, the game has come together, and Anke and I
are together again. I'm not saying if we'll be married soon, or
when, but you will have plenty of notice to buy presents.''
</P>
<P>
   What were Hrbaty (No. 30), Meligeni (No. 54), and the centurion
Medvedev doing in the French semis anyway, along with
twice-flunking finalist (1990, '91) Aggasi, who ranks No. 14? It's
been a wonderfully wacky fortnight, that's all, an indication that
nobody is safe in the male precinct these days.
</P>
<P>
   Hrbaty had already rid the place of No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
the 1996 champ, and another favorite, Marcelo Rios. Meligeni bumped
off US Open champ Patrick Rafter and 1998 runner-up Alex Corretja.
Medvedev took care of Pete Sampras, 1997 champ Guga Kuerten, and
then Guga's countryman, Meligeni. ``I don't think I can get a visa
for Brazil,'' Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch Meligeni and you may find Al Pacino in ``Dog Day
Afternoon.'' There's an uncanny facial resemblance. A wispy court
clown, he's 140 pounds of pantomimist, grimacer, and pure
enjoyment, a lefthander (naturally) and ``very happy to be playing
in France,'' he said. ``The crowd know a lot about tennis, not just
coming to watch and say, `Who's this guy?' Everyone knows everyone
who's playing, 128 players. Is very good feeling in center court,
and you feel everybody's cheering for you, like you are a good
player, a nice guy. This is important for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is suddenly important for Agassi to spring off the mark
Saturday to avoid a repeat of a dog day afternoon in 1991, when a
rain interruption (though not overnight) soaked his title bid
against Jim Courier. Andre led, 6-3, 3-1, then lost in five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Agassi's coach, Brad Gilbert, ``it's not gonna
happen that way. The passion's back in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say the same for the other Andrei and his Anke.
Successful again, suddenly.

FIRST LADY MOVES ONE BIG STEP CLOSER TO SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of conjecture and nearly a dozen visits to New York
state, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that in July she would
take the first formal step toward running for the Senate from New
York, registering an exploratory committee with the Federal
Election Commission. Her aides said that would almost certainly
lead to her becoming the first first lady to run for federal
office.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tumult that has surrounded Mrs. Clinton's political
future these past six months, the first lady confirmed her
intentions _ which were by now something short of a surprise _ in a
quiet, almost matter-of-fact voice in the midst of the ``Good
Morning America'' TV program broadcast from the White House. Mrs.
Clinton answered a question posed by Diane Sawyer during a
commercial break; ABC played a tape of the exchange as soon as the
program went back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to open an exploratory committee in July,'' Mrs.
Clinton said. ``And than I'll spend some time _ a lot of time _ in
New York listening to people, and I'm looking forward to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's announcement would appear to end a political and
semantic furor that had engaged politicians and reporters from the
first time her name was mentioned as a possible candidate in
February. It was the first time that the first lady herself had
expressed such intentions publicly, and it was the first time that
anyone in her camp had described her plans without any qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who has enjoyed the largely uncritical attention
that comes from being an unannounced candidate, seemed to reveal
her intentions earlier than she might have liked, and with less
pageantry than normally accompanies such announcements. Her
comments came a day after Rep. Nita Lowey, the Westchester County
Democrat who had said she would run for the Senate if Mrs. Clinton
did not, announced that she would run for reelection because she
was convinced that the first lady was running.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, some Democrats said Mrs. Clinton ran a risk of
appearing coy if she continued to assert that she had not decided
whether to form an exploratory committee, even as she continued to
make trips to New York and her aides were saying the decision about
the committee was all but certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to put it to bed after yesterday,'' said Lisa Caputo,
her former press secretary and longtime adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's announcement does not signal an actual change
in her timetable. Mrs. Clinton is to return to New York next
Wednesday, but then is traveling to Europe and the Mideast for the
remainder of the month. She will formally establish the exploratory
committee upon her return, and then begin traveling across the
state in July and August, meeting with voters in what will probably
be formats similar to the town hall meetings that have been used so
frequently by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The visits are part of a concerted effort to deflect what has
been the main attack against her by Republicans: That the first
lady, who has never lived in New York, has little knowledge of the
state that she wants to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, Mrs. Clinton's main political strategist, said
that it was very possible that the exploratory committee would, as
allowed by law, consist of one person _ the treasurer, who would be
charged with keeping the committee's books. Notwithstanding the
name, the committee's real purpose would be to allow her to collect
campaign contributions that would go to financing her travels in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, those trips have been paid for by either taxpayers or
local political committees; Mrs. Clinton has come under some
criticism for that.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding its lack of formality, Mrs. Clinton's
announcement Friday offered her most prominent possible Republican
opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a stark illustration of
the artillery that the first lady will be able to command in a run
for office.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates who make such announcements have to rent a
ballroom, hang banners and hope that reporters will arrive to
chronicle the events. Mrs. Clinton spoke on national television
from the White House, with the president at her side, during the
broadcast of a segment of Good Morning America devoted to guns,
children and violence.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani announced his own exploratory committee six weeks
ago, it was briefly noted in most of the state's newspapers and
television stations. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton's statement was
moved as an urgent dispatch on the Associated Press wire shortly
after ABC televised the snippet.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's announcement also immediately rallied her
opponents, who for now at least seem to be focusing on the
carpetbagger issue. State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn
Democrat who has often sided with Republicans, said that he would
devote his weekly radio show to rallying his supporters to urge
Mrs. Clinton to stay out of the race. ``New York's issues are not
Arkansas' issues or Illinois issues,'' Hikind said.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Gazette of Elmira, N.Y., took sarcastic note of the
fact that Mrs. Clinton had boasted during a visit to Manhattan this
week that she had ``been to Elmira,'' offering an article based on
interviews with longtime Democratic leaders who could not recall
seeing the first lady in their part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Marsha Berry, offered an
explanation after checking with the first lady. ``She was in Elmira
probably 40 years ago,'' Ms. Berry said. ``On a family excursion
between Chicago and Scranton.''

JURY FINDS SAN ANTONIO POLICE POLICY TARGETED DOWNTOWN HOMELESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ On the legendary Alamo Plaza, under the shade of
the leafy live oaks, tourists abound.
</P>
<P>
   But look closer and there are others: bearded men pushing
shopping carts, barrio kids dressed as gangsters and tattooed punk
drifters with safety-pinned eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   It was this often unseemly lot that Onofre Serna, a veteran San
Antonio police officer, says he was ordered to harass in hopes of
driving away. And it was this order that led Serna to challenge the
Police Department in federal court, arguing that his objections to
the harassment policy led to retaliation against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury awarded Serna $500,000, effectively convinced
by him and several other officers that the Police Department did in
fact order its downtown foot and bike patrol to cleanse the
downtown area in the interest of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio police officers were ordered to selectively
enforce the law,'' said Serna's lawyer, Bruce Mery. ``Officer Serna
stood up and said, `Wait a minute, this is not right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though the judgment was not even half the $1.2 million Serna
sought, it comes as a major blow to the Police Department. More
important, perhaps, it highlights the difficult balance the city
must strike in sustaining its No. 2 industry, worth more than $3.5
billion in annual economic impact, and lending a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling against San Antonio also represents a huge
victory for a rank-and-file cop who seems to have been motivated by
little more than his convictions. Not until Serna was transferred
from the foot and bike squad to the overnight patrol, or ``dog
watch,'' did he file suit.
</P>
<P>
   Making Serna an even more unlikely champion of the homeless is
this: He was shot in the chest by a drifter 11 years ago in an
alley near San Antonio's St. Anthony Hotel, an incident in which
his partner was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Serna, 38, testified that at first he believed the foot and bike
patrol to be doing the right thing with potential troublemakers,
demanding identification from patrons in certain bars, snatching
caps and bandannas from suspected gang members, and forcing the
homeless from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But then, said Serna, who joined the force in 1984, ``I realized
we were harassing people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He drew the line,'' said Mery. ``He said, `I've got to fight
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Antonio denies the police issued orders to rid
downtown of the homeless or any other group. Nor, the Police
Department says, did it retaliate against Serna after he lodged his
protest in the summer of 1995. An appeal is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there was no retaliation or violation of any rights of
officer Serna and believe there is no evidence to support this
verdict,'' said Police Chief Al Philippus. ``The department
respects the rights of all citizens as outlined in its mission
statement and targets problems affecting our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Serna declines to discuss the case, citing his need to restore
his relationship with the Police Department. But his surprising
victory has given hope to two other officers who are challenging
the city on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The policing issue is a dicey one for San Antonio, which is not
believed to have a homeless problem as serious as cities such as
Austin or San Francisco. Still, nearly 8 million tourists visited
San Antonio in 1997, making the tourism industry second only to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But just how to deal with drifters, the homeless and others who
may discourage downtown tourism is a vexing question. While the
city says it encourages a progressive, preventive approach to law
enforcement, critics say the police continue to harass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude among the police officers is that you can do
anything you've got the guts to do,'' said Mery. ``You can get in
their faces, jack 'em up, move 'em out.''
</P>
<P>
   More troubling still, Serna contends in an affidavit that the
police targeted Hispanics, stating that his former supervisor, Lt.
Harry Griffin, told his officers, ``If you see these Mexicans
hanging around downtown drinking, give them a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids who hang around Alamo Plaza say the police harass
almost anyone who appears threatening. Rain McGregor, a 22-year-old
with green hair, army fatigues and combat boots, says he has been
ticketed for jaywalking when crossing the street with tourists,
whom the police ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who you are,'' said McGregor, who says he is
homeless. ``What matters is what you look like.''
</P>
<P>
   More than nine police officers testified on Serna's behalf,
arguing that between 1994 and 1996 they were ordered to crack down
on the homeless and assorted groups of kids. But almost as many
officers testified for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rudy Garza, a homeless man in downtown San Antonio, vouched
for the police. ``They never bother me or tell me anything,'' he
said. ``They're out to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   James Flores, a veteran officer with the downtown foot and bike
patrol, says the squad may have seized a bandanna or two or moved a
drunk from a merchant's doorway but that the police have helped
make downtown a safer place for pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what we do,'' Flores said. ``But all of a
sudden, we're getting dragged through the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, the supervisor, was himself transferred after an
internal report revealed him to have management shortcomings. But
because the Serna case focused more on the question of retaliation
than law enforcement policy, the debate over the harassment Griffin
allegedly ordered may never be fully resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there likely to be agreement over whether the police
currently harass the homeless, drifters and the barrio kids who
hang out downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But Mery, Serna's lawyer, is adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be more discreet,'' he said, ``but it's there.''

MEDVEDEV, A FRENCH OPEN FINALIST, CAN FEEL THE LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ First the course of true love finally did run smooth for
Andrei Medvedev, the decidedly romantic giant from Ukraine who
reunited with his longtime paramour, Anke Huber, just before the
French Open began. And once his heart felt lighter, Medvedev's
moribund career took a turn for the brighter.
</P>
<P>
   After barely squeaking into the main draw, a break he described
as ``a minor miracle'' for a former top 10 player ranked 100th,
Medvedev has bulldozed through his half of the draw, taking down
some big names along the way. In Friday's semifinal against
Fernando Meligeni, a clay-covered 140-pound gnat of a man, Medvedev
soldiered through his 2-hour-59-minute assignment with due
diligence but little brilliance and emerged the winner, 7-5, 3-6,
6-4, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
   It is the first Grand Slam final for the 24-year-old Medvedev,
who had not distinguished himself at a major tournament since
reaching the 1993 semifinals here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a second birth to me,'' said Medvedev, whose
six-match rampage has featured upsets of second-seeded Pete Sampras
and eighth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian who won here in
1997 and had been predicted to do so again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out of the competitive tennis for a long time,''
Medvedev said. ``Now to be back, but not by accident, it feels
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Medvedev slept poorly on the eve of this semifinal despite
the calming advice of Huber, a Grand Slam finalist herself at the
1996 Australian Open, and he figured to experience another restless
night tonight because he did not know the identity of his next
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While Medvedev and Meligeni were able to complete their match
despite intermittent rain, 13th-seeded Andre Agassi and 30th-ranked
Dominik Hrbaty had just entered the fourth set when a stubborn
system of showers settled in for the evening. Play was suspended
with Agassi out in front but no longer exerting complete control,
leading the 21-year-old Slovak by 6-4, &QC; 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's poor third set, which he opened by dropping his serve
and concluded by being broken on a backhand return on Hrbaty's
third set point, transformed what had looked to be a triumph of
experience over inexperience into an overnight cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the French Open runner-up in 1990 and 1991, is battling
to reach his first Grand Slam final since he won the 1995
Australian Open. With a title here, Agassi would become the first
man to win all four Grand Slam crowns in his career since Rod Laver
did it in a single season, in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev, who has hedged his bets and called his chances 50-50
against anybody in this field, said he was so happy to be in the
final, he did not really care which opponent came his way. ``I
think I can beat both of them, but that will take everything I've
got,'' he said. ``It's not going to be easy. Like I've said, I've
surpassed my expectations by a mile. I cannot lose, basically. Even
if lose, I would still be the happiest man on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it achieved the desired result, Medvedev's semifinal form
was far from perfect. He survived 85 unforced errors and a 0-4
beginning, not to mention the fact that his irrepressible Brazilian
opponent, who played with a liberal amount of histrionics and
comedy worthy of a Marx Brothers routine, actually won two more
points than he did.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch Medvedev, to whom scrambling around the court
does not come as naturally as it does to Meligeni, also suffered
from cramping in the third and fourth sets and eventually required
a double dose of medication, plus some smelling salts, from a
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   When the trainer, Doug Spreen, balked at handing out a second
dose, Medvedev talked him into cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me one; it didn't work,'' Medvedev said. ``I said,
`I'm a double guy, give me one more,' and he did, and then the
cramps were gone. And he also brought me the towel with the smell
where you get awake even if you're dead. I think he did a great job
on me. Thank God I'm not doing doping control today.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's women's final, sixth-seeded Steffi Graf, a
five-time champion here, takes on top-seeded Martina Hingis, the
18-year-old with a now-or-never attitude toward capturing the only
Grand Slam to evade her. Graf, 29, has not won a Grand Slam title
since the 1996 U.S. Open and came into this one with misgivings
about her durability. Graf boasts the best record against Hingis of
any player, leading her by 6-2, but the German lost their only
meeting on clay and lost to Hingis, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, in their most
recent match, at the Pan Pacific quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can beat anybody,'' Graf said. ``I obviously feel I
don't have to prove anything; I think that's going to work for
me.'' Even though Hingis has hinted that Graf is over the hill, she
has yet to beat her at a Grand Slam event, where she is 0 for 3. &QL;

HELMS SAYS COMMITTEE READY TO HOLD HEARINGS ON HOLBROOKE'S
NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee announced Friday that the panel was ready to hold
hearings on the long-stalled nomination of Richard Holbrooke as the
chief American diplomat at the United Nations. But the senator made
it clear that the nomination was anything but a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is a leading critic
of the United Nations, said in a statement that the panel would
hold four hearings beginning on June 17 and that Holbrooke would be
carefully questioned about his career, particularly his role as
mediator with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in
negotiating the Bosnia accords.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said that the committee would explore in detail
Holbrooke's ``role and responsibility for this administration's
misguided policy of appeasing Slobodan Milosevic,'' a comment that
also seemed to suggest that the hearings could be a vehicle for
closer scrutiny of administration policies in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's statement also alluded to the ethics inquiries
that were the subject of an investigation by the Justice Department
that delayed the nomination for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess that I cannot recall another Cabinet-level
nomination sent to this committee with so much ethical baggage
attached to it,'' Helms said. The federal inquiry ended in
February, when Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to the government to
settle civil accusations that he had violated federal lobbying laws
in his role at an investment banking firm that he joined after
leaving the State Department. Holbrooke has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they welcomed the announcement of
the hearings, despite the tone of Helms' statement. They had feared
that Helms might kill the nomination by refusing to hold
confirmation hearings, just as he killed the nomination of William
F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts, as ambassador to
Mexico in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have long said they are willing to
endure harsh criticism of Balkans policies and other issues because
they believed that the nomination enjoyed broad bipartisan support
and that Holbrooke would be easily confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional officials said they were pleased that
Helms had decided to devote just one of the four hearing days to
the Balkans, because that would limit the chance that the hearings
might become a vehicle for a full-scale Republican assault on the
administration policies which led to 10 weeks of airstrikes on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 peace settlement that halted
the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been the administration's
principal envoy to Milosevic, serving in that role part time while
continuing to work at the Credit Suisse First Boston investment
banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democratic on the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, said he hoped the nomination would be
approved by the end of the month and sent to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms has made the right call in moving this
nomination forward,'' he said. ``We need Dick Holbrooke in New
York. The United Nations will play an important role in helping to
end the conflict in Kosovo, and I can't think of anyone better than
Dick Holbrooke to safeguard our interests.''

FROM `CAR TALK' TO COMMENCEMENT CHATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ When MIT's president announced the names of
this year's commencement day speakers April 1, he had to assure the
public that it wasn't an April Fools' Day hoax. Tom and Ray
Magliozzi? Huh?
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which last year
had President Clinton deliver its commencement address, wasn't
kidding. Click and Clack, the irrepressible hosts of National
Public Radio's call-in show, ``Car Talk,'' were on.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Friday, there they were, America's most beloved auto
mechanics, side-by-side on the dais incongruously clad in black
faille robes with velvet trim and eight-sided black tams. For 45
rambling minutes, the Magliozzis dished out their folksy brand of
slapstick. The speech was twice as long as it was supposed to be
and was punctuated by their guffaws, which echoed across Killian
Court like an old Chevy backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have spent the last four, five or six years working in the
wrong direction,'' Tom Magliozzi told the 2,087 undergraduate and
graduate students, who included budding particle physicists,
nuclear engineers, aeronautics experts, and economists. ``You are
sliding down the razor blade of life. You must stop this from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Using graphs, the Magliozzis sought to demonstrate that there
was an inverse relationship between intelligence and happiness. One
of the graphs purported to show that humans were the least happy of
all living things, followed in order of rising happiness by golden
retrievers, cows, worms. At the top of the list was grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought we were the highest form of life on the
planet,'' said Tom. ``It turns out we're the lowest.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the big questions surrounding the event concerned the
Magliozzi brothers' choice of transport (Clinton arrived last year
by helicopter). The Magliozzis envisioned a more modest entrance in
Tom's red 1952 MG-TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom wanted to take the MG but it wasn't starting this month,''
said ``Car Talk'' producer Doug Berman, who added that MIT was
unwilling to delay graduation until the vehicle was resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
   So how'd they get there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their wives drove them,'' said Berman. ``They said they
couldn't bear the embarrassment if they broke down on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   That the speech even happened is testament to the terrier-like
persistence of the Magliozzis and the good humor of MIT President
Charles M. Vest.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Magliozzis, who are both MIT graduates, have been
goodnaturedly teasing MIT on their radio show about the ``relative
unknowns'' who have been delivering MIT commencement addresses _
``nobodies'' like UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Vice President
Al Gore, and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Vest politely rebuffed their overtures, saying they'd only be
considered as speakers if they brought their own flag. The UN, he
noted jokingly, had ``a really spiffy flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Car Talk' . . . had possessed a similarly attractive
flag,'' Vest wrote in a letter to the Magliozzis, ``we might have
been able to use you, but, as it was, we felt that we really had to
go with the secretary general for aesthetic reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Magliozzis prevailed after they designed their own flag.
</P>
<P>
   As they spoke Friday, the 4-by-6-foot banner fluttered behind
them. It was adorned with a seal that commemorated the rear of
Tom's recently departed 1963 Dodge Dart, complete with a raccoon
tail on the trunk. The flag was emblazoned with the slogan ``Non
Impediti Ratione Cogitantonis.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing their talk, the pair tried to get the audience to
repeat the English translation of the slogan: ``Unencumbered by the
thought process.''
</P>
<P>
   They signed off with their usual flourish. ``Don't drive like my
brother,'' they chimed.

   ``It's fair to say we cannot imagine a situation in which
President Milosevic remains in Serbia and all of the different
pieces of the puzzle get put together,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the vanguard of American troops for the Kosovo
operation was aboard a three-ship Marine amphibious group en route
to Salonika, Greece. About 2,000 marines would be the first
American troops to move into Kosovo, as part of an international
force that is to grow to 50,000. The United States has pledged to
send a total of 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reach Greece, the marines will travel by road to
Skopje, Macedonia, and wait for NATO to order them into Kosovo
after the alliance can verify that a significant Serbian withdrawal
is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Serbian forces would pull out of Kosovo from west to
east. A 15-mile buffer zone will separate Kosovo from the rest of
Serbia, and will help insure that remnants of the Serbian forces
cannot re-enter Kosovo or fire at NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the marines would patrol a section of eastern
Kosovo assigned to the United States. They would then yield to Army
troops and heavy armor from bases in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was instrumental in brokering the peace deal, but
American officials are still uncertain what role Russia will play
in the international force. Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary, said Russia's role remained an ``open question.'' But he
said, ``We are confident that we can work with them constructively
and they can participate.''

CHARISMATIC IS PREPARED IN BID FOR TRIPLE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ It was 5:30 on a clear, cool and quiet morning at
Belmont Park. D. Wayne Lukas led Charismatic out of his barn as the
first horse entering the track on the day before battle _ just as
he expected Charismatic to be first in the 131st Belmont Stakes on
Saturday before a crowd of more than 80,000 at Belmont Park, and
complete his dramatic surge from claimer to the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The chestnut colt galloped one mile and three-quarters, which is
a quarter of a mile more than he will race in the historic main
event Saturday. Then the trainer said all was right in
Charismatic's world, and pronounced him fully prepared to take the
final step on the road to riches: $600,000 as the winner's share of
the purse plus $5 million as a bonus for sweeping the three
classics for 3-year-old horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like his old self,'' Lukas said. ``I don't see
anything different than going into the Preakness or the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing and winning every couple of weeks, Charismatic has spun a
romantic tale that is hard to match in modern racing: ignored as a
claimer in California as late as February, fourth in the Santa
Anita Derby on April 3, first in the Lexington Stakes on April 18,
first in the Kentucky Derby at 31-1 on May 1, first in the
Preakness at 8-1 on May 15 and favored at 2-1 to win the Belmont
and make history June 5.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, he will have to outrun one fine filly,
Silverbulletday, and 10 colts, including Menifee, who ran closest
to him in the Derby (by a neck) and in the Preakness (by a length
and a half). So, for the third consecutive year, the Belmont will
feature a horse shooting for the Triple Crown. In 1997, Silver
Charm lost a thriller to Touch Gold, and in 1998, Real Quiet lost
by a whisker to Victory Gallop. Only 11 horses in racing history
have completed the sweep; 14 have failed when they lost the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   A fair and pleasant day was forecast with temperatures in the
70s, something like Friday, when Charismatic led the way onto the
track for his morning exercise. He handled the Belmont surface
gracefully and drew cheers from his trainer, who is still searching
for his first Triple Crown sweep with one horse although he has won
12 classics and at one point had won six Triple Crown races in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic goes off with the first set of horses whether it's
here, California, Kentucky or wherever,'' Lukas said, explaining
their early hours. ``We always try to get them on the track when
it's freshly harrowed. We think that's the best time. It's a
routine we've followed with all of our good horses over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee was an early riser, too, jogging three-quarters of a
mile and then galloping a mile and a quarter. His trainer, Elliott
Walden, who also trained Victory Gallop in his memorable Triple
Crown sequence, said that his main concern Saturday would be the
lack of early speed to set things up for late closers like Menifee,
who was the second choice in the race at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a front-runner in there,'' Walden said.
``If there's not a true front-runner, sometimes you wind up with a
slower pace than you really like. Menifee might sit closer to the
pace than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he confessed to being ``talked out,'' and said: ``It's time
to be quiet and let the horse run.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, third choice at 4-1, has won eight straight
races and 11 of 12 in her career, but she will be racing colts for
the first time. She will attempt to become only the third filly to
win the Belmont in 131 years, and the first since Tanya in 1905.
She got to the track early, too, and galloped a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's sharp; she's doing great,'' said her trainer, Bob
Baffert. ``Whether the fuel light comes on turning for home, we
won't know until the race. Distance is the only question. She can
handle it with a certain kind of pace. She's healthy, she's happy,
she's on her toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of Luck, who won the Peter Pan Stakes two weeks ago, walked
the grounds Friday and will gallop over the main track Saturday
morning as he gets ready for the Belmont Stakes. His trainer, Allen
Jerkens, one of the foremost horsemen in New York, has started only
two horses in the Belmont but has never won it. Virginia Rapids ran
fifth in 1993 and Limit Out ran ninth last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows there are people coming around looking at him all the
time,'' Jerkens said. ``He's got a shot. The key to most races is
pace, especially for a closer like Best of Luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont will open its gates at 8:30 on Saturday morning for its
day of days. The first race goes off at 12:30, the Belmont Stakes
at 5:27. The rest is up to Charismatic. &QL;

VAN GUNDY'S GRIPES MAKE PACERS GROAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy's portrayal of the
Pacers as whimpering whiners did not go over big in Indiana. Mark
Jackson and Reggie Miller were among several Pacers who fired
verbal shots at the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's practice in Indianapolis, Jackson was asked if he
wanted to say anything about Van Gundy's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson replied: ``Nothing, just them being what they said we
were: a bunch of babies, a nursery and whining. There's no time for
crying and complaining. Just play basketball. That's something I
expected from Phil Jackson, not Jeff Van Gundy.''
</P>
<P>
   With Game 3 Saturday night at New York's Madison Square Garden,
the gamesmanship _ well, paranoia _ grows. The Knicks and the
Pacers have a contentious subplot to support their on-court battle.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's comments came after the Knicks were whistled for 40
fouls on Tuesday in Game 2, including controversial calls against
Marcus Camby and Chris Childs in the final minutes. The comments
also came after the Pacers took umbrage with some of the Knicks'
physical tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the team that's physical,'' said Van Gundy, who
spoke to Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice president of
basketball operations, regarding the calls. ``They've got the
physical players.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Bird was asked if he had any gripes about Van
Gundy's assessment. ``Everything but the bully part,'' he said, his
voice thick with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said: ``There's no whining on our part. I think
everything is coming from their camp. If they're going to call Rod
Thorn and beg for calls, they need to look at themselves in the
mirror.''

   Walton Wowed by Turnaround
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walton has been amazed at the Knicks' transformation. He is
so impressed with their speed in the open court that he gives them
an advantage over the Pacers even without Patrick Ewing. But Walton
is putting the responsibility on the Knick players, especially the
nonstarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys have been whining about shots and
complaining about not getting enough time for most of the season,''
he said. ``Now it's their time to prove whether they can play well
without Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton admires the Knicks' resilience, but he is not a huge fan
of Larry Johnson's self-congratulatory ``L'' sign for 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a former college player of the year, a
two-time All-Star, a guy who needs no introduction,'' Walton said.
``It makes no sense. Can you imagine Michael Jordan wasting his
time with that, or Dr. J? Bring some class and dignity to the
proceedings. I'm sorry, I just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Are Players at Fault, Too?
</P>
<P>
   When Larry Johnson entered the locker room after Game 2, he had
been the victim of a beer-dousing from the Market Square Arena
stands. In another incident, Chris Childs and Kurt Thomas traded
obscenities with courtside patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to talk to the fans while we're trying to play
ball, let him talk to the fans,'' the Pacers' Derrick McKey said,
referring to Childs' altercation with a young fan during the game.
``If you're talking to the fans and feeding into that, sometimes
you've got to expect other things happening from the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson added: ``If they did that, then they're just as
much to blame as the fans. Now it's different if there are two
jerks behind our bench being disrespectful, tasteless, and we
counter what they did. But if we add to it and go back and forth
with them, then we're just as much to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are preparing for a similar deluge Saturday night at
the Garden. Reggie Miller's gum-flapping aside, the Pacers do not
want to behave like the Knicks, who some Pacers think brought the
crowd-control problems upon themselves. Antonio Davis and Jackson
have made public pleas for fans to restrain their venomous behavior
for Game 5 in Indianapolis on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right,'' Jackson said. ``That can't be accepted. I
make a plea to our fans to not let that happen again, because it's
a reflection on all of us. That's not fair and that's tasteless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Garden fans, he added: ``Hopefully, they won't react and
try something like that. If they do, so be it. But we certainly
don't condone behavior like that.'' &QL;

SIZING UP THE CLASH: CLINTON VS. GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's the out-of-towner vs. the schoolyard bully, the
PLO partisan vs. the narrow-minded cop-coddler, the limousine
liberal vs. the scab.
</P>
<P>
   It's the upcoming New York Senate race _ first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton vs. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ and you can already
hear the lips smacking over the brickbats and catcalls to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things are certain,'' said pollster Maurice Carroll,
reflecting the consensus. ``The race will be close, it will be
nasty, and, oh boy, will it be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Friday confirmed what her political adviser, Harold
Ickes, let slip the day before _ that sometime next month she will
start an exploratory committee for a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani jabbed, ``She should spend some time exploring New
York,'' a not-so-veiled reference to the fact that the first lady
has never lived here.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as the announcer says at Belmont, ``They're off!''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show a neck-and-neck race, with Clinton ahead in New York
City, Giuliani ahead in the suburbs, and the contest suspensefully
close in the vast land mass called ``upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing is that the two agree on most of the
hot-button issues dividing Republicans and Democrats elsewhere.
Both favor gun control, capital punishment, abortion rights, gay
rights, and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   One peculiarity of New York politics is that whatever issues end
up inflaming this election, they do so for their appeal or
repellency to various ethnic groups, which tend to vote in blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the biggest issue raised to date. Clinton recently
spoke out against school vouchers. She never mentioned Giuliani,
but her audience knew the mayor advocates vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who supports but does
not work for Clinton, said, ``Opposing vouchers will hurt her with
Catholics, who know what parochial schools are about and wouldn't
mind being given the choice to send their kids there instead of to
the local public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers' union will open their phone banks for her,'' he
went on, ``but Rudy will get the Catholic vote, and the Catholic
vote in this state is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton opposes the shutdown of municipal
hospitals, which Giuliani wants to privatize. This helps her not
only with still more pools of union activists, but with many black
and Hispanic voters, who cannot afford private care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like her husband, enjoys overwhelming support among
these minority groups. Giuliani has never been very popular there,
and he lost further ground after the police shooting of an unarmed
West African immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Clinton leading among blacks by an astonishing 96-4,
with virtually nobody undecided _ suggesting she could stimulate an
unusually high turnout from these groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers note she must strengthen her base of support,
which is New York City _ and boosting turnout among blacks and
Hispanics, who together comprise over half its population, is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also note she needs to cut into Giuliani's edge
upstate and in the suburbs, where she is largely untested.
</P>
<P>
   One electoral model might be Democrat Charles Schumer's
impressive 54-45 victory over three-term Republican incumbent
Alfonse D'Amato in last year's Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schumer won three-quarters of New York City, probably
more than Clinton can swing against Giuliani. And he split the
suburbs, another big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also ran a miserable campaign, as evidenced by his
winning just one-quarter of the downstate Jewish vote _ as opposed
to the 40 percent he had always won before. Last time out, he
alienated many Jews by trying to politicize his support of the
Holocaust Museum, calling Schumer by an awkwardly constructed
Yiddish vulgarity, and caricaturing Jerrold Nadler, an overweight
Jewish congressman, as ``Jerry Wadler.'' Nor did it help that
Schumer is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, on the other hand, has solid support among Jews, and
has pointedly noted that the first lady once advocated a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He is unlikely to make mistakes on D'Amato's scale, though the
possibility must rank high on Clinton's wish list. ``How does Rudy
lose?'' asked Sheinkopf. ``By being harsh, by engaging in
over-the-top attacks, by trying to belittle her _ in short, by
doing the Rudy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   New York politics contain the seed of another hope for Clinton _
a third party. Governor George Pataki and other upstate Republicans
so dislike Giuliani that they are encouraging Representative Rick
Lazio to run as the Conservative Party's nominee, to thwart the
mayor's ambitions by splitting the Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   That's another strangeness in this Senate race: united Democrats
and divided Republicans, where it's usually the other way around.

BIG TASK AWAITS CHARISMATIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The Daily Racing Form, in a rare display of
whimsy, printed photographs this week showing the facial
similarities between Charismatic and Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut coats, white stars on foreheads, trickles of white on
sharply tapered noses. The resemblance is uncanny even by equine
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Does it end there? Has Charismatic inherited the Triple Crown
gene from his great-grandsire as well?
</P>
<P>
   Can Charismatic defeat Silverbulletday, the leading filly,
Menifee, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness runner-up, and nine other
3-year-olds in today's Belmont Stakes to end a 21-year Triple Crown
drought, the longest since the 25 years between Citation (1948) and
Secretariat?
</P>
<P>
   And one more question being asked at Belmont Park: Does the
former Santa Anita claiming horse deserve to join Citation,
Secretariat and nine others on the roster of Triple Crown-winning
immortals?
</P>
<P>
   Not even his hairdresser knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The easy answer is the one offered Friday morning by Bob
Baffert, who trains Silverbulletday and whose Silver Charm and Real
Quiet lost Triple Crowns in the Belmont the past two years: ``If he
wins, it doesn't matter what anybody thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The safe answer is that if Charismatic wins _ clinching a $5
million Triple Crown bonus on top of the $600,000 winner's share of
the $1 million Belmont purse for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis _ his
will be the unlikeliest name on the list that begins with Sir
Barton in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   No Triple Crown winner came up through the claiming ranks, the
lowest level of North American racing. But Charismatic ran in
claiming sprints in November and February.
</P>
<P>
   Most Triple Crown winners went into the Kentucky Derby already
considered the leader of the age group; only Assault, who started
the Derby as an 8-1 shot, entered the series at odds higher than
4-1. But Charismatic was 31-1 in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Most Triple Crown winners dominated the Derby and Preakness;
none of them won the Derby by less than 1{ lengths, and only four
won the Preakness by less than 1{. But Charismatic and jockey Chris
Antley won the Derby by a diminishing neck and the Preakness by a
shrinking 1{.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of that lead to the hard judgment that Charismatic
doesn't deserve a Triple Crown?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, somebody has to be the worst on the list.
</P>
<P>
   But since he finished fourth in the April Santa Anita Derby as a
44-1 laughingstock, Charismatic has turned into a horse good enough
to beat this season's uninspiring group of 3-year-old colts and
geldings in the 1 1/16-mile Lexington Stakes, 1\-mile Derby and 1
3/16-mile Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't discredit the horse because I misjudged him,'' said
trainer D. Wayne Lukas, referring to the decision to twice risk him
for $62,500 claiming prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas calls his horsemanship since _ recognizing Charismatic's
affinity for hard workouts and frequent racing _ the best training
job of his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   And Lukas hasn't let up on Charismatic during the Triple Crown
series. He said the horse has dropped about 75 pounds, to an
estimated 1,200 pounds, which is still big for his average frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little racier now,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas classifies the son of Summer Squall as
``low-maintenance,'' saying he has been given two Lasix
(anti-bleeding) and two phynylbutazone (anti-inflammatory)
injections since the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   So Lukas said he's confident Charismatic is in good shape for
the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   But the colt, likely to be favored today for the first time
since his maiden victory 11 races back, will have to prove himself
against several obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   _The distance. A mile and a half is one-quarter mile longer than
he or any opponent has raced or is likely to race again. It has
been the undoing of many Derby-Preakness winners.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 horses who lost a Triple Crown in the Belmont, 11 were
running ahead of the eventual spoiler at one point in the race.
</P>
<P>
   _The filly. He has never faced her because she has never faced
males before. And Silverbulletday's talent _ eight straight
victories against other fillies _ and the chance she and jockey
Jerry Bailey can set a slow pace today make her hard for most
handicappers to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace will be determined by others in the race,'' said
Antley, who is trying to cap a sensational comeback from weight
problems. ``When the gates open, it's a whole new ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday would be the third filly _ the first since Tanya
in 1905 _ to win the Belmont. She's the first to challenge a Triple
Crown hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   _Menifee. He's the obvious ``spoiler'' based on his close
finishes at Churchill Downs and Pimlico. Trainer Elliott Walden was
in the same position last year and got the Belmont upset with
Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menifee is probably showing less signs of stress, and he's
probably coming up to the race a little better (than Victory Gallop
did),'' Walden said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Other logical spoilers are Best of Luck, the Peter Pan Stakes
winner trained by ``Giant Killer'' Allen Jerkens, and Derby Trial
winner Patience Game, whose pedigree and light campaign give him a
chance to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Before Charismatic's Lexington Stakes victory, Lukas told the
Lewises their colt is ``definitely a Belmont horse.'' Back then,
Lukas couldn't have been thinking he's a Triple Crown horse.
</P>
<P>
   Is he?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere above Belmont Park, great-granddad will be watching,
waiting to find out.

REFUGEES WANT OUT OF CAMPS BUT DISTRUST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Alush Bytyqi dreams of returning to his home
in Gjakovica, the Kosovar town where he spent much of his 83 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the home Bytyqi knew does not exist anymore, literally or
otherwise. In the days following the NATO bombing, Bytyqi's son
watched in terror as, Bytyqi recounts, 12 of the two men's
relatives were shot by uniformed Serbs, then burned with the looted
family home.
</P>
<P>
   Bytyqi escaped, and has spent the past two months in a crowded
refugee camp in central Tirana. Struggling to stand, even with his
cane, Bytyqi waits for the day when he can go back to the place
where his home had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my land,'' he said, near tears. ``Even if my house has
burned down, I want to be there. I will sleep in a tent, if I have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bytyqi is like so many Kosovar refugees who are still digesting
the news that the leader they despise, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has agreed to a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by terrifying memories of the forced deportations and
reported murders in their towns, and lulled by the sweeter
recollections of a more peaceful time in their homeland, the ethnic
Albanians are torn. They want to leave the dismal existence of the
refugee camps, but they are afraid to trust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic is willing to withdraw his military troops,
the Albanians say, they cannot live with the presence of anyone
they see as allies of the hated Yugoslav president _ be they
ordinary Serbs, or Russian peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not safe when the Serbs are there,'' said Sali Gashi, 34,
a refugee from the city of Pec who has reported atrocities to
International War Crimes Tribunal investigators. ``If we go back to
Kosovo, the Serbs must know they must leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Serbian neighbors watched'' the soldiers ``kill my father,
my brother, my uncle,'' Gashi added. ``And they didn't do anything
to stop it. How can I live with them?''
</P>
<P>
   While international military and political leaders map out a
plan to stop the fighting in Kosovo, the victims of the alleged
ethnic cleansing say there is no emotional peace at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds are so deep, the fear so consuming, and the distrust
so entrenched that the possibility of a return to an earlier life _
Serbs and Albanians sharing a territory inside Yugoslav borders _
is unthinkable now, refugees here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sleep at night,'' said Sabrije Thaqi, 68. ``They can't
live there. All this war wasn't so that the Serbs could live there.
I don't even want to look at them. Do you know how many massacres
they did?''
</P>
<P>
   The psychological damage is obvious. Children make crayon
drawings of their villages under siege, pictures that show tiny
Kosovars, disproportionately large soldiers, planes overhead, and
houses engulfed in flames. Many of the children have nightmares, or
still fear the soldiers at the refugee camps who serve them food,
since the youngsters are nervous about men in uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   An ill 96-year-old man shook in fear recently as he was
approached by non-uniformed strangers, apparently confusing them
with enemy soldiers. ``Please, don't beat me!'' the man pleaded,
taking off his Muslim cap and cowering.
</P>
<P>
   Universally, the refugees do not want to stay at the camps,
where water and medicines are both scarce. Under the moist heat of
Tirana's early summer, the lack of adequate sewage facilities in
one of the camps here is nauseatingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no celebrations going on among the worn-down
refugees. None is collecting his belongings, or making plans to
travel back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many have prayed for the end of the war, for a chance to return
to a more normal life. But the end of the battle in Kosovo as
negotiated by Russian and European Union envoys also means the end
of a much greater war for separatist ethnic Albanians _ a war they
fear they will have lost for good.
</P>
<P>
   Without independence, some Albanians say, they will never be
free from the threat of Serb repression. Despite NATO's
long-standing insistence that it did not support a partitioning of
Kosovo _ its punishing bombing of the Serbs notwithstanding _ many
Albanians nursed a dream that the war would end with an
independent, Serb-free Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won? We don't know what we won,'' said Burim Hadri, a
29-year-old refugee from Gjakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't fight, have all the killing, all the victims, so the
Serbs could stay in Kosovo,'' he said. ``Only with independence''
can Albanians live peacefully, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs stay, ``there will be war again,'' he predicted
sadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will kill them!'' a teenage Albanian blurted out,
overhearing Hadri's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians are also suspicious of Russian involvement in the
peacekeeping force _ a provision believed to be key to Milosevic's
ultimate approval of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russians are there, I don't want to go back,'' Bytyqi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are the same as the Serbs,'' said Rustem Gashi,
59, who fled from Suva Reka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if it is 100 percent without Serbs, then we will go back
to Kosovo,'' Gashi said.

NATO CAMPAIGN RELIED ON PRECISION BOMBING AND LOW ALLIED LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 73 long days of bombing, NATO finally broke the will of
President Slobodan Milosevic by finding new ways to destroy the
Serbian military, inflicting real damage on power, water, factories
and other non-military targets and demonstrating the ability to
bomb with virtual impunity, allied commanders said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slow start, hampered by political constraints and bad
weather, NATO was able to take advantage of a rebel Albanian
offensive in recent days to draw Serb forces out of hiding near the
Kosovo-Albania border. That enabled NATO bombers to hit them hard
and inflict the first major damage to Serbian forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also escalated the pressure on the Milosevic regime
by stepping up attacks on command centers, television stations and
electrical power stations in the heart of Serbia. In doing so, it
demonstrated that it would not be deterred by the public outcry
over civilian casualties caused by a relative handful of mistaken
attacks and errant bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And by holding down its own losses to the surprisingly low toll
of two combat planes over more than 33,000 missions it also proved
that it could carry out its strikes at a negligible cost to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the trick was the accuracy of the precision weapons,
the avoidance of losses and the increasing destruction of the Serb
forces,'' the top NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said Friday
in a interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, just days ago, American and NATO generals were warning
that air power alone was not enough to win. And even General Clark
concedes that NATO was not certain that air strikes alone would be
sufficient to compel Milosevic to accept NATO's terms when the
allies began their military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And while NATO savors its victory, many current and former
allied officers say the alliance must not take away the wrong
lessons from the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senior NATO officers said that political constraints imposed by
allied diplomats prevented them from conducting it the way they
would have liked, thereby prolonging the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking the war to downtown Belgrade during the
opening hours of the war, NATO waited weeks before attacking
targets in the Yugoslav capital, blunting the allies' ability to
shock the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also began with the promise never to mount a ground attack.
Only recently did it begin to assemble a peacekeeping force which
might have become an element of a larger invasion force. When
Milosevic agreed to NATO's terms on Thursday _ the very day that
President Clinton was to talk about ground troops with his top
generals _ the Yugoslav leader could not be sure that a ground
invasion would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   But what enabled the alliance to overcome the deficiences in its
strategy, allied commanders say, was the willingness of NATO
diplomats to allow them to broaden and intensify the bombing over
time. The alliance also used the professionalism of its pilots, its
high-tech weaponry and novel tactics.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Daniel J. Murphy Jr., the commander of NATO naval
forces in the Adriatic, said in a telephone interview that the war
could have been shorter and caused fewer casualities had NATO's
military been given a freer hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you followed the military template, we wouldn't have had as
many restrictions as we had, but that was a political reality,''
Admiral Murphy said. ``It's certainly true that from a military
point of view, we'd have liked to have taken the gloves off
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats never expected that their decision to put an end
to Milosevic's campaign against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
would lead to 10 weeks of day and night bombing. Their hope was
that a few days of air strikes would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   NATO started out with a three-phase plan of gradually escalating
air strikes, a far cry from the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict when
warplanes pounded central Belgrade from the opening minutes of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force officers said the Yugoslavia conflict was a
case in which the military strategy succeeded despite serious
flaws. ``It's a strange situation,'' said General Ronald Fogleman,
a former Air Force Chief of Staff. ``Just because it comes out
reasonably well, at least in the eye of the Administration, doesn't
mean it was conducted properly. The application of air power was
flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clever tactics and some luck enabled NATO commanders to
compensate for some of the weaknesses in their plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, for example, emerged as an important
element of NATO's strategy. The Serbs initially frustrated NATO by
hiding, hunkering down and trying to ride out the air war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian partisans changed that by trying to infiltrate into
Kosovo from their bases in Albania about two weeks ago. The
light-armed KLA were a poor match for the heavily equipped Serbian
military, which was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers
and artillery, and the offensive fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbs had to mass in the open to take on the guerrillas,
making them vulnerable to allied attacks from the air. In recent
weeks, Serbian forces near the Albanian-Kosov border have taken a
heavy pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced American military technology also helped. The Clinton
administration never allowed General Clark to send the battalion of
24 Apache helicopters in Albania into the fray and use the battery
of MLRS surface-to-surface rockets that were deployed with them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Army used the U.S. Army's Q-37 radar, the target
acquisition radar for the rockets. They calculated the source of
the Serbian artillery fire on the Kosovo rebels in a matter of
seconds. All this information was provided to NATO warplanes,
helping them carry out punishing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also used the U.S. Army's Predator and Hunter drones to
locate Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Serbs first used artillery, they could locate where
they were coming from,'' General Gordon Sullivan, the retired Army
chief of staff said in an interview. ``That took away their
capability to hide. It gave the Air Force a direct shot at the
artillery. That gave targeting a real-time impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the troops, however, were just one source of
pressure. As the war dragged on, NATO diplomats decided to give
General Clark more latitude in prosecuting the war in Belgrade and
throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken attack against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and
a handful of errant bombs received enormous attention by the media.
</P>
<P>
   The larger story was that the precision guided bombs, such as
laser-guided and satellite-guided weapons, enabled NATO to strike
throughout Serbia with relatively few civilian casualities.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to step up the pressure on the Milosevic regime, NATO
warplanes bombed factories owned by close associates of the
Yugoslav president, using the justification that the the goods they
made could be used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's ability to avoid losses was also an important factor,
Clark noted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its weeks of bombardment, NATO never succeeded in
demolishing the Serbian air defenses. Unlike the Iragis during the
Gulf war, the Serbs cleverly turned their targeting radars on and
off, making it hard for NATO warplanes to locate and attack Serbian
surface to air missiles. When SAM batteries were damaged, parts
were quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NATO military spokesman said recently that the alliance had
confirmed the destruction of only three of Yugoslavia's
approximately 25 mobile SA-6 surface to air missile batteries. Even
though that assessment may be overly conservative, intelligence
specialists believe that the majority of the SA-6 batteries are
still operational.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also sought to take advantage of NATO's reluctance to
attack Montenegro _ a Yugoslav republic that has sought to maintain
a degree of independence from Belgrade _ by hiding radars there.
</P>
<P>
   Another Serb tactic was to try to attack the last plane in a
NATO strike formation as it headed back to its air bases. The Serb
calculated that the aircraft would be low on fuel by that point and
relatively unprotected by other planes. Also, the last plane in a
strike formation is often flown by one of the less experienced
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the tactic almost worked last week when an
allied warplane was force to drop its fuel tank to gain the
maneuverability to dodge surface to air missiles near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only two allied planes, anF-117 and an F-16, were shot
down by the Serbs. And in both cases, special operations forces
were able to rescue the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The limited losses made it easier for the alliance to maintain
public support for the fight. While no NATO pilots were killed in
combat two American pilots were killed when their Apache helicopter
crashed in Albania during training.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tabulating the results of its attack, NATO said it took a heavy
toll on the Serb military, claiming to have destroyed more than 100
Yugoslav aircraft, 314 artillery piees, 203 armored personnel
carriers, 120 tanks, 268 other military vehicles, 14 command posts,
29 highway bridges and 11 railroad bridges.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean, however, that current and previous NATO
commanders think the air war against Yugoslav should be a model for
future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   General George Joulwan, General Clark's predecessor as NATO
commander, said in an interview that the Clinton administration
reluctance to prepare for a ground offensive had undercut the
allies leverage on Belgrade and prolonged the conflict. President
Clinton's assertion that all options were on the table was helpful
but came too late, General Joulwan added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be careful about what victory means, given
that the initial goal was to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe,'' he
said. ``What if we go in and find a lot of mass graves? The devil
is in the details.''

 &HT;    Trickle's track-record lap holds off youngsters
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ How does it feel to win the pole for a Busch
series race at the ripe old age of 57? Like being king for a day,
Dick Trickle said.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle, whose average start in 12 Busch races this year has
been 19.5, won the pole for today's MBNA 200 with a track record
lap of 155.213 mph Friday at Dover Downs International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about starting on the pole is No. 1, you're
king for a day,'' Trickle said. ``No. 2, if there's a wreck that
starts in the third row or something, you ain't a victim of it.
I've been victimized in wrecks this year terribly. You know how
this racing is: One guy messes up and collects up another five-10
cars with him.''
</P>
<P>
   All 36 drivers who qualified on speed Friday bettered the old
track Busch qualifying record of 153.498 mph held by Kevin Grubb.
Grubb qualified second at 154.952.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as good a lap as I could make it and as good a lap as the
car could make it,'' Trickle said. ``You know, the car is my
dancing partner. And if someone was going to beat my lap, they had
a lot of credit coming.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Trickle's seventh career Busch pole and third at Dover,
where he hasn't finished in the top 10 since 1991. Trickle's best
finish this year is 11th, three times, the last at Richmond in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be fighting the kids for the checkered flag today.
Combined, Grubb, 21, and Stanton Barrett, 26, who qualified third,
don't total Trickle's age.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 Winston Cup drivers who were doing double duty in
qualifying for both the Busch and Cup races made the field, led by
Kenny Irwin in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Atwood, who had qualified 19th, was penalized by NASCAR
and sent to the rear of the 43-car field when a routine fuel
inspection revealed his car did not meet specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Santerre returns
</P>
<P>
   Busch series driver Andy Santerre's return to racing was brief.
He was back behind the wheel Friday nearly four months after
breaking his right leg in six places in a season-opening wreck
during the NAPA 300 at Daytona. But he failed to qualify, running
40th fastest and getting bumped from the field by provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   Santerre had three plates and 18 screws inserted into his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers game
</P>
<P>
   David Green had to tape a No. 6 on the door panels of his
Chevrolet Friday to turn his No. 41 into No. 46. Joey McCarthy has
the number registered to him by NASCAR and was also attempting to
qualify his Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: McCarthy's car, among the slowest in practice,
failed to qualify. Green qualified fifth best among the No. 41s and
the three Green brothers (Mark starts 22nd; Jeff 30th) and may go
back to his preferred 41 for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Charity checks
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the 49 drivers who endorse MBNA's NASCAR credit
card program, Bill Elliott and Jeff Burton presented checks of
$53,000 each Friday to the Brain Injury Association and the
Make-A-Wish Foundation.

CLINTON APPOINTS GAY MAN AS AMBASSADOR AS CONGRESS IS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over Republican objections, President Clinton
Friday appointed James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg,
employing a rarely used executive privilege to make him the
nation's first openly gay envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and heir to a
meat-packing fortune, was first nominated to the post by Clinton in
October 1997. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the
nomination, but Senate conservatives, led by the majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, blocked it from a vote on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who pledged months ago to gay advocacy groups that he
was determined to make the appointment, did so Friday through a
constitutional device available to the White House when Congress is
in recess. Congress returns from its 10-day Memorial Day vacation
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of a so-called recess appointment, Hormel,
65, could remain in the job until the end of the next session of
Congress, probably in October of next year, effectively installing
him through the duration of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton had decided to use the recess
appointment when it was clear that all public and private
strategies for a vote had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who has said homosexuals are sinners, like alcoholics or
kleptomaniacs, said through a spokesman Friday that he opposed the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lott opposes the nomination of someone who has
supported an extremist, anti-Catholic group to represent the United
States,'' said the spokesman, John S. Czwartacki. ``Hormel's
refusal to condemn this brand of religious intolerance makes his
appointment by the Clinton-Gore administration a slap in the face
to Catholics everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Hormel's refusal to condemn the activities
of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a San Francisco acting
troupe featuring men who wear nuns' habits. Luxembourg is 99
percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Clinton's move
was intended for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the president's contempt for the constitutional
process, No. 1,'' Thiessen said. ``This is an effort to get
political gain out of certain presidential constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative and religious groups also expressed outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton does unpopular things in sneaky ways,'' said Robert
Knight, a spokesman for the Family Research Council. ``This
appointment was not going to fly, so he imposed it on the country.
And it means that he's using this nation to make the case to the
world for sodomy and adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, a strategist for the Human Rights Campaign, a
gay advocacy group, rejected the suggestion that Clinton had acted
purely for political gain or to benefit his political heirs, Vice
President Al Gore, who is running for president, and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who is likely to run for the Senate from New York. ``He
wanted to make a very strong statement that this type of
discrimination was not going to be tolerated,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Socarides, who oversees gay and lesbian issues for the
White House, said Gore and Mrs. Clinton would probably do well with
gay and lesbian voters anyway. Mrs. Clinton is participating in a
private fund-raising dinner on Wednesday night in New York for gay
men and lesbians sponsored by the Democratic National Committee.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the full-service stockbroker going the way of the
dodo bird?
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch's announcement on Tuesday that it would capitulate
to the on-line trading frenzy by offering do-it-yourself investors
$29.95 Internet trades later this year looked to some people like
the beginning of the end of the tradition that Merrill represents.
</P>
<P>
   Any corporate announcement that reverses decades of business
practice and entrenched philosophy, as this one did, is
breathtaking. Sure enough, investors knocked down brokerage stocks
on the news. Fears that Merrill's embrace of on-line trading and
its deep-discounted commissions would hammer profits drove the
American Stock Exchange's Securities Broker/Dealer index down 5.4
percent the day the news broke. The index ended the week down 8.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are right to be concerned about profitability at
brokerage firms. The $29.95 trades to be offered by Merrill Lynch
are well below the firm's current commission schedule and no doubt
the first salvo in what may devolve into a nasty price war.
</P>
<P>
   Net profit margins at brokerage firms _ currently around 6
percent, according to the Value Line Investment Survey _ will be
much lower in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But any celebration ofthose celebrating the death of the
full-service broker isare premature. Although the number of
old-fashioned brokers will surely dwindle, and those left will have
thinner wallets, many will survive, even thrive. The practice of
buying and selling stocks with the help of a human being is not
going to be supplanted by the click of a mouse just yet.
</P>
<P>
   This is certain, however: Brokers who do not provide value to
their customers are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lay-up business _ sell 1,000 shares of a $50 stock for a
$500 commission _ is going away,'' said Shad Rowe, who runs
Greenbrier Partners, a money-management firm in Dallas. ``People
don't have to pay for no-brainer trades anymore. But brokers who
can truly represent their customers? Their value goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investing has a lot going for it. The beauty of the
Internet, of course, is that it often eliminates the middleman and
thereby cuts costs for consumers. It also allows Americans to
pursue one of their quintessential delights: the do-it-yourself
gig.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling stocks on line has the added appeal of
providing investors with the sense that they are in the midst of a
high-stakes game.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these people may not want a broker to interject herself
between them and the action because that dilutes the rush. After
all, people who frequent the craps tables in Las Vegas don't
usually ask others to throw the dice for them.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the world of investors is in the process of
dividing into those who want help and those who don't. Still, the
trial and error that usually surrounds any do-it-yourself effort
will prove much more painful in investing than it would in, say,
plumbing or wallpapering.
</P>
<P>
   It's much harder to fix an investment that went awry than to
have a professional come in and correct a mangled drain pipe or
rehang some paper.
</P>
<P>
   An argument can also be made that now, more than ever, investors
need help sorting through the cacophony emitted by CNBC, Internet
investing chat rooms and the growing number of publications devoted
to financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with American families more time-starved than ever
before, it seems strange that the interest in do-it-yourself
investing should surge just now.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the investor enthusiasm for on-line trading is a result
of the lengthy bull market. When stocks are going up, it's easy to
have success in the market as a do-it-yourselfer. On-line trading
aficionados have not yet had to endure a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the market starts requiring that people spend a lot
more time watching over their investments rather than just looking
at the paper and seeing that their Internet stock went up, people
will have to work on figuring out why a stock's not working,'' said
Seth Novatt, managing director at CIBC Oppenheimer in New York.
``There are many people who won't want to spend the time doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that investing on one's own is alluring, of
course, is that many investors have been burned by full-service
brokers. But all brokers are not the smirking pickpockets that
on-line brokers' advertisements portray. Many are honest and
hard-working, and bring years of experience and professionalism to
bear on their clients' behalf. (Full disclosure: From 1981 to 1984,
this columnist was a stockbroker at Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, people want advice from
experienced people who have been in the business,'' said David
Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &AMP; Harris in St.
Louis. ``A broker may call me up and say, `Did you notice this
stock has been slipping?' or point out something I didn't think of.
The extra commission I pay that broker is more than made up by the
service he provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Money managers say that a full-service broker must perform many
duties if he wants to earn higher commission rates. Here is a list
of what the pros say investors have a right to expect:
</P>
<P>
   _ Honesty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perspective. An alert broker cannot help but learn from the
market, a school of hard knocks to be sure. Sharing these lessons
with clients can help them from having to learn the hard way on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discipline. A good broker helps assess the risk in an
investment, playing the devil's advocate on a stock that may look
attractive or a bond with an alluringly high yield.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expert editing. A professional broker will help delete stocks
that look shaky or inappropriate from a portfolio and will keep a
client diversified.
</P>
<P>
   _ Error protection. A computer will not keep clients from making
dumb mistakes _ buying a stock that was supposed to be sold, for
example. A trustworthy broker will, and will also keep customers
from making trades with costly tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Superior execution of trades. A good broker will work a
customer's NASDAQ or option trade, for example, squeezing between
bid and asked prices or watching for other ways to save an investor
one-eighth or one-quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grading of a firm's research analysts. An honest broker will
give her customers the benefit of her experience, separating the
amateurs from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   _ Independent research. A hard-working broker will check out
rumors or tips, using bona fide sources of information that are
relatively independent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good investment ideas that are off the beaten track.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the broker provides all of these services but
consistently loses money for his clients, he should be fired.
Making money is the goal, after all.
</P>
<P>
   A result of Merrill's on-line initiative will certainly be an
increased focus among the customers of full-service firms on the
costs levied and the benefits provided by their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good thing. If brokers don't perform, they will be
bounced, either by their clients or by their firms. No matter how
painful it is in the near term, survival of the fittest is long
overdue on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers are going to have to adjust their philosophy as well
as their commissions,'' said Rod Fadem, a broker at Oppenheimer &AMP;
Co., in Clayton, Mo., who has been in the business since 1960.
``The philosophy must be `everything for the customer first.'
Investors need to have someone on their side.''

 &HT;    Hometown edge for McGlinchy
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Braves rookie reliever Kevin McGlinchy had a hard time
hiding his grin Friday afternoon in the visiting clubhouse at
Fenway Park, where he used to come as a kid from nearby Boston
suburb Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a good mood because I'm home,'' said McGlinchy. ``I'll
have a little bit of butterflies. It'll feel like Opening Day
again. I've been really, really looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy pitched at Fenway one time for a tryout with the Red
Sox his senior year in high school but was passed over in the draft
by Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know how good I was,'' McGlinchy said. ``I'm
glad (the Braves) picked me. It's always fun to play for your
hometown team, but it would probably be a lot tougher playing here.
Coming home and everybody asking you about your performance, good
or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy spent Thursday night at home with his family and then
ate a pregame lunch Friday of a Steak Bomb Sandwich from Big A's
Sub Shop, where he used to eat before Little League games.
McGlinchy reserved tickets for 18 friends and family. Teammate and
Concord, Mass., native Tom Glavine had dibs on most of the Braves'
tickets, accumulating 80 for Friday's game from 13 teammates. Mike
Remlinger, the first-year Braves reliever from Plymouth, Mass.,
grew up a Red Sox fan, too. This is the first time he will have
pitched at Fenway since he was a college All-Star pitcher from
Dartmouth
</P>
<P>
   Klesko to DH
</P>
<P>
   Playing by American League rules in an AL ballpark, Ryan Klesko
was in the lineup as the Braves' designated hitter. The only other
time he has been used as a DH went pretty well _ 5-for-10 in Games
3, 4 and 5 of the 1995 World Series in Cleveland, setting a World
Series record with a home run in three consecutive road games.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice, Klesko would rather play in the field. ``It's
like a half-day off,'' he said of the DH. ``You stretch a lot to
keep yourself going. You walk around and try not to get too
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lure of the Green Monster
</P>
<P>
   This is right-handed hitter Brian Jordan's first shot at Fenway
Park's Green Monster in left field, which is only 315 feet from
home plate down the left field line. ``It's going to be tempting to
pull the ball,'' Jordan said. ``But you can get in trouble. You've
got to stay within yourself and take what the pitcher gives you.
Believe me (though), if I pull one and I think I popped it up, I'll
be running hard just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss on testing his sore quadriceps in Friday's
game after being out of the lineup for more than a week: ``Every
time I run, I'm going to be a little nervous to take off full speed
until I get confidence that it'll be all right.'' ...Rookie pitcher
Odalis Perez on the difference between his last two starts (four
earned runs in 15 1/3 innings) and the first seven (24 earned runs
in 38). ``I'm not scared anymore to pitch in,'' Perez said. ``If
you show them a 90 mph fastball in, they'll say he's not scared to
pitch inside. Then my change-up looks better.

REPLAY COULD BE RIGHT CALL FOR BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball awoke one day this past week to find that the genie
called technology had somehow escaped from its bottle. Offered a
single wish _ that the most questionable of an umpire's calls be
verified or corrected through instant replay _ baseball passed. In
the name of tradition, baseball executives stuffed the genie back
in its bottle and buried it under the tarpaulin to remain
forevermore, or until the Cubs win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, National League president Leonard Coleman's decision to
ban the use of television replays to review umpire decisions upheld
a grand tradition of the game: the blown call.
</P>
<P>
   Said Coleman, after rebuking umpire Frank Pulli's unsanctioned
use of replay: ``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable
practice. Part of the beauty of baseball is that it is imperfect.
Players make errors. Managers are constantly second-guessed. But
the game is played and determined by two teams between the white
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what is traditional about our national pastime is good,
including the frailties of ballplayers and the foibles of managers,
charming elements Coleman cited in justifying his decision. It is
hard to see, though, how the outcome of a game can truly be
``determined by two teams between the white lines'' when an umpire
has made the wrong call.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the incident Monday that set off this storm.
Florida Marlins player Cliff Floyd smashed a drive that umpire Greg
Gibson said hit off the scoreboard and ruled it a double. The
Marlins argued that the ball hit a facade behind the scoreboard, a
home run in Miami. After a conference, crew chief Pulli ruled it a
home run. That prompted a protest from the opposing St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pulli decided to take a look at the videotape, which
showed Gibson was right all along. Floyd went to second base and
the game resumed. That Gibson was correct is further proof that
umpires, for all the criticism they receive, get a lot more right
than they do wrong. That without replay the crew would have
reversed his call and gotten it wrong shows that they are fallible,
that they can be corrected. And what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   If the home run had stood, it would have affected the score of
the game, maybe even the outcome. It certainly would have affected
Floyd's statistics, perhaps his salary negotiations in the
off-season. While the game in question probably won't have much
bearing on the pennant race, there have been calls over the years
that have had an impact on critical games. With replay, they could
have been corrected, or at least confirmed as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Replay reviews can be a valuable tool precisely because they can
give the game back to the players. If all calls were correct,
wouldn't that be the fairest way to determine the best team on a
given night? Letting a bad call stand isn't dishonest per se, but
it unfairly affects a game and may even change its outcome. There's
no justice in that.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of practical and historical reasons to oppose
the use of replay, of course. The NFL's original experiment with
replay from 1986-91 proved, that even with the best intentions,
technology can actually make a bigger mess of things. The league's
modified review system might be an improvement, but there are still
bound to be problems.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's use of replay, limited to goal reviews, has not gone
without criticism, either. Reviews can take too long and they can
prove inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when properly implemented, replays don't make a correct
call wrong, and they can make a bad call right. And that is the
real point of officiating. If baseball can accept the designated
hitter and interleague play, it surely can accept that.

HASTERT WILL REWRITE SPENDING BILLS TO SHIFT EASE CUTS IN SOCIAL
PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Fixes 12th graph to change millions to billions)   (Exclusive)  
(rm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, his bills stymied and
his control of the House insecure, has decided to rewrite
Republican spending plans and shift some money from increased
military spending to ease cuts in social programs like health and
education, key aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert will tell the House Republican caucus on Monday that
``we're going to trim off some of the allocations for defense,
treasury, the legislative branch, and feed some of that back'' into
bills financing programs for labor, health and human services,
education, housing and veterans' affairs, a senior Republican aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a work in progress,'' said John Feehery,
spokesman for Hastert. ``We are going to have to fight each bill.''
So far, the House has failed to pass a single one of the 13
separate appropriations measures that finance the government for
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, five months into his tenure, is having a hard time
carrying out the Republican strategy: to be the party of national
defense and fiscal discipline, pour billions into new Pentagon
spending, freeze or cut everything else, and pass the spending
bills on time and in good order. Now, only the Pentagon's windfall
seems assured.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original plan for the coming year, the Defense
Department received $19 billion more than this year; domestic
programs received $26 billion less. Under the evolving plan,
several billion dollars would be transferred from the military
ledger into domestic programs. Military spending would still rise
and domestic spending would still fall, but by less than first
planned. No final figures are set.
</P>
<P>
   The new goal is to restore cuts in domestic spending that
moderate Republicans find intolerable, keep at least some
conservatives happy, and win over enough moderate Democrats to pass
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The shift would bring the House spending plan closer to the
Senate's. But with a perilously slim 223-212 majority in the House,
Hastert needs Republican unity to pass anything. He lacks it. And
House Democrats will do little to help him.
</P>
<P>
   When he became speaker, Hastert vowed to pass the spending bills
on time.
</P>
<P>
   The year's first major spending measure, a $60.8 billion
agriculture bill, was derailed last week by fiscal conservatives
who wanted to block all such bills until there was a plan for
protecting the Social Security surplus. Then Hastert could not
summon the votes to bring a $289 billion defense authorization bill
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans' conservatives are in revolt, their
moderates frustrated and their leadership red-faced. They recall
the 1998 budget breakdown and the 1995 government shutdown and
worry that their slim majority may be threatened if they appear
inept.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders ``can't communicate a strategy to their
members, they can't communicate a strategy to the American people,
and if they can't do that, they are going to be in a world of hurt
when they go up against the Democrats in 2000'' said Peter Sperry,
a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where spending bills traditionally originate,
Republicans have allocated $270 billion for the Pentagon and $268
billion for every other arm of the government in fiscal 2000. That
latter sum, expressed as a percentage of the American economy, is
the lowest allocation for domestic spending since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   And the way that sum was divided among the 13 House
appropriations subcommittees set moderate Republican chairmen
howling that the wealth was spread too thin. To Hastert's left,
liberals warned that the Republican plan starved needy people and
worthy programs. To his right, conservatives promised to hew to the
cuts, stop dipping into surplus Social Security revenues, and keep
the spending caps enacted by Congress and the White House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The caps held the budget down and helped create the surplus, but
both Republicans and Democrats are asking if they still make sense
in an era of economic prosperity. Hastert says the caps were a
solemn promise to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hastert, prodded by his two Texas colleagues, the
majority leader, Dick Armey, and the Majority Whip, Tom DeLay, came
up with two new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One aims to shift responsibility, or blame, for increased
spending to individual members. A key Republican aide said the idea
would ``keep the caps but insert a trigger'' to blow them away.
``If members want to, they could vote on cap-busting amendments,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other idea ``was changing the allocations, working with
chairmen to take a whole new approach,'' another senior Republican
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   That would redistribute billions from the bills financing the
Department of Defense, Congress, the Treasury Department and the
Postal Service. The money would be shifted to two other bills. One
finances the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education, which took a $10.7 billion cut in this year's plan, from
$88.8 billion to $78.1 billion. The other, for housing, urban
development, veterans and several independent agencies, took a $5.7
billion cut, from $71.9 billion to $66.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce, Justice and State Departments, which face a $3
billion cut, and the Interior Department, cut by $2.6 billion, also
might also see some money restored.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans have promised to stop the spending
bills in their tracks unless each one is cut or frozen at last
year's level. That forces Hastert find 13 magic numbers: sums that
will allow the 13 bills to win 218 votes in in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot, he will face a reprise of last year's last-minute
free-for-all spending bill, loaded with $21 billion of extras
financed from the Social Security surplus, or a repeat of the 1995
government shutdown. In each event, House Republicans lost face,
President Clinton gained political capital, and programs the
Republicans wanted to cut or kill won new life.

FBI SEARCHES KING'S OFFICES FOR EVIDENCE OF GRAFT IN IBF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FBI agents swept through the promoter Don King's offices in
Deerfield Beach, Fla., Friday morning, searching for information as
part of an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Newark,
N.J., into alleged illegal payments and kickbacks for rankings in
the International Boxing Federation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time agents were seizing boxes of files from his offices,
King was in Manhattan meeting with executives at Time Warner, the
parent company of HBO and TVKO, trying to get them to drop a clause
in a contract for a possible rematch between Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis. That clause would remove King from being the lead
promoter if he is indicted for anything stemming from the boxers'
first bout, which ended in a controversial draw. King has refused
to sign a contract with that clause in it. The cable network showed
the first Holyfield-Lewis bout on TVKO, its pay-per-view arm, and
has the rights to the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   King did not return a telephone message seeking comment on the
meeting or the FBI raid. Two weeks ago, King said that he believed
he was the main target of the federal investigation in Newark and
said he believed he would be indicted. He also said he had done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Deerfield Beach, which is near Fort Lauderdale, two of the
three flags that usually fly above King's offices were
conspicuously missing Friday. Gone were the ``Only in America''
flag and the stars and stripes that can usually be seen from nearby
Interstate 95. The flag with ``Liberty'' emblazoned on it still
flew.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents blocked off the two-story office building in the
morning and began loading boxes of seized material onto a Ryder
rental truck. At 5:10 p.m., another truck arrived and more boxes
were loaded from the building, which King owns. Both parking lot
entrances were blocked by FBI cars, and a Broward County sheriff's
deputy stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fabregas, an FBI special agent in Miami, said that his
office executed search warrants of King's office as part of a
continuing federal investigation. But he would not comment on
whether they were related to the federal investigation in Newark.
He would also not say whether there was a search warrant for King's
Deerfield Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for IBF president Robert Lee, said
the FBI did not search his organization's offices in East Orange,
N.J., Friday. The IBF is holding its annual convention in San Diego
this week, and its offices are closed. No one answered the
telephones there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no search warrants, no subpoenas or any other paper
outstanding on Bob Lee or anyone else connected with the IBF,''
Krovatin said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation into boxing has been going on for
several months. The federal grand jury in Newark has subpoenaed the
records of promoters, managers and boxers who have conducted
business with the IBF. Among those who have testified before the
grand jury are the promoter Bob Arum and the heavyweights George
Foreman and Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Botha said he was asked how he received his rankings in the IBF.
While he was a cruiserweight, Botha became the IBF's No. 9-ranked
heavyweight before he fought his first heavyweight bout. Later, he
jumped from No. 4 to No. 1 with King as his promoter. That move
prompted Michael Moorer, who was No. 2 at the time, to sue the IBF
in 1995, a lawsuit that prompted the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the rankings work,'' Botha said. ``I told
them what I know. From the things they asked me, I believe they are
looking into racketeering throughout boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   King has come under Federal indictment three times in the last
14 years and has never been convicted. In 1985 he was acquitted of
tax evasion charges. In 1995 there was a hung jury in an insurance
fraud trial stemming from an allegation that he altered a contract
with Julio Cesar Chavez to steal $350,000 from Lloyd's of London.
Last July he was acquitted of those charges in the retrial. &QL;

THREE RING CAPTURES THE ACORN AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three Ring bounced back from her last-place finish in
the Kentucky Derby on Friday, survived a disputed decision by the
stewards not to disqualify her for apparently bumping in the
homestretch and won the Acorn Stakes, the first race in Belmont
Park's Triple Tiara series.
</P>
<P>
   The objection was raised by Richard Migliore, the jockey on
Better Than Honour, who finished second after a meandering
homestretch ride that saw her forced wide and brushed twice by
Three Ring, the favorite. But the three stewards, after viewing the
films of the race, ruled that both fillies had moved to the right
of their lanes and declined to reverse the order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring, who is owned by Barry Schwartz, a trustee of the New
York Racing Association, was ridden for the first time by Jerry
Bailey, who stalked Sapphire n' Silk for half a mile. Then Three
Ring edged into the lead, only to be challenged by Better Than
Honour, and they dueled the rest of the way home. Three Ring veered
from inside her rival toward the outside under left-handed
whipping, and twice seemed to brush Better Than Honour, who lost by
a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both fillies moved toward the outside,'' said David Hicks, the
steward representing the New York Racing Association. ``Yes, Three
Ring moved from left to right. But so did Better Than Honour. They
both changed paths. But it did not seem decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Migliore said that Three Ring ``came out a long way,'' and
added, ``She came way, way out, about five paths, and brushed us
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey said: ``I didn't feel there was contact. I knew we
were floating out, everyone was, but I didn't feel contact. I just
followed. I knew the horse next to me was going out, but I didn't
cause it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Plesa, the trainer of Three Ring, was cheered by his
filly's return from a violent experience in the Derby, and said,
``Physically, she came out of the Derby fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring ran the Acorn mile in 1:36, paid $3.80 for a $2 bet
to win and earned $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   99-1, but in the Race
</P>
<P>
   The king of the long shots is back in the Belmont Stakes: Robert
Perez has run five horses in New York's premier race in the last
six years, and has finished no better than fifth in 1995 with Pana
Brass, at 79-1.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a victory of sorts. His 1992 entry of Agincourt and
Robert's Hero finished seventh and ninth at 24-1; Ulises ran last
in 1994 at 28-1, and Energizer ran last in 1997 at 45-1.
</P>
<P>
   His candidate in the Belmont on Saturday is Teletable, who is
99-1 in the morning line. He is a son of Colonial Affair, who won
the Belmont in 1993, but he has raced only four times and won once,
in his last start, at Gulfstream Park on Feb. 15. Still, his
trainer, Alfredo Callejas, said Friday that the colt has always
been considered a distance runner and not a jack rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he runs on the lead,'' Callejas said, with a smile, ``he'll
finish at Kennedy Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Portent  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rider Chris Antley's top picks? Charismatic, America Online
and Intel. Friday, however, he could do something about only the
last two _ he rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
Antley, a high school dropout, made more than $1 million last year
as a day trader via the Internet. His interest in stocks and bonds
began 10 years ago when he started paying attention to how Merrill
Lynch and Prudential-Bache invested his 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Now he has his own tip sheet, of the stock variety, ``The Ant
Man Report,'' and is about to launch a web site. Barely five months
ago, he passed out his newsletter to about 30 trainers around the
California tracks. Now he has 1,000 subscribers. He characterized
himself as a momentum trader _ in and out of stocks as they rise
and fall.
</P>
<P>
   It pretty much describes an often brilliant riding career that
has been interrupted by substance abuse problems and battles with
weight. So, how did he move the market Friday? Well, the Dow closed
at 10,799.84, up 136 points. Sounds like a good omen for a Triple
Crown. &QL;

BOGEY-FREE KUEHNE SHOOTS 71, FALLS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Kelli Kuehne no longer sits atop the leader
board at the U.S. Women's Open. But the Dallas resident has
achieved something unmatched by any of her 149 competitors at Old
Waverly Golf Club:
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne has completed two rounds without a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not supposed to happen,'' said Kuehne, who logged 17
pars and a birdie during a second-round 71 yesterday to move to 9
under par for the tournament, a stroke behind co-leaders Juli
Inkster and Lorie Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd told me at the start of the week I'd be doing this,
I'd have said, `No way,' '' Kuehne said. ``This is the U.S. Open.
Par is a prized possession. Birdie is like a bonus, and bogey is
expected. I've played very well. But to not have made any bogeys,
I've been very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kuehne has been very consistent. For a second
consecutive day, she reached 15 greens in regulation. This time,
she needed 32 putts to complete her round _ seven more than in her
opening 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's your seven-stroke difference right there,'' said
Kuehne, adding that she did not fully comprehend the significance
of her 64, which matched the best round in relation to par (8
under) in tournament history, until walking up to the 17th hole
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Kuehne, 22, turned to caddie Tracy Phillips and
said: ``I can't believe I shot 64 \RThursday\S. I'm doing
everything just as well but I'm 1 under, instead of 8 under. That
just shows you're living in a fantasy world if you think you're
going to shoot 64 every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally unlikely, in Kuehne's opinion, would be to finish 72
holes at the Open without a bogey. Although she is halfway home,
Kuehne said she does not expect to keep up this pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time before I make one,'' Kuehne said.
``Hopefully, I'll make a whole lot more pars and birdies than I
will bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question for Kuehne will be how she handles the pressure
of playing in the final groups during weekend rounds at a major
championship for the first time in her LPGA Tour career. Kuehne
said she is relaxed and ready after finishing seventh and first in
her past two events.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, a three-time major champion, said Kuehne will have one
advantage over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in a no-lose situation because she'd never been there,''
said Inkster, 38. ``She can go out there and play aggressive, and
if she doesn't do good, she's never been there. If she does, it's a
bonus. I think she's in a great position, and she looks pretty
confident to me. I don't see her backing down at all.''

AID OFFICIALS STEP UP PLANS FOR BALKANS RECONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officials from the United States, the European
Union and international aid agencies stepped up their planning
Friday for the formidable job of repairing the physical and
economic damage wrought throughout the Balkans by the conflict in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the first official public assessment of the costs, Romano
Prodi, the incoming president of the European Commission, said
Friday that the European Union alone might have to budget as much
as $6 billion a year for the next five years to deal with the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said that any cost estimates at this point
were little more than educated guesses. There has yet to be any
comprehensive study of the costs of rebuilding homes, power and
water systems, roads, schools and businesses in Kosovo. There are
only sketchy estimates of what it will take to accomplish the first
major goal: moving nearly 1 million refugees back into the
province, and housing and feeding them through next winter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that the United States expects Europe
to finance most of the costs of putting the Balkans together again.
Administration officials said they did not yet know precisely what
contributions the United States would make, or how much money the
administration might have to request from Congress for rebuilding
and relief assistance. A bill passed by Congress last month
included $1.1 billion for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously done a lot of thinking about this already,''
said Harriet Babbitt, the deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency
for International Development, which plans to send a team into
Kosovo as soon as allied military forces begin moving in. ``But you
can't do a lot of very specific planning until you know the
environment in which you're going to be working. There are rooms
full of frantic people putting together scenarios and budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the scale of the problem came in a study
released Friday by the International Monetary Fund. The study
concluded that the economic damage to the six countries neighboring
Yugoslavia from disruptions to trade, plus the costs of helping the
refugees, would exceed $1.25 billion this year, and could be as
high as $2.25 billion, without even considering the costs of making
Kosovo habitable again.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the rebuilding job seems likely to be far
bigger than the $5 billion, five-year international effort to
rebuild Bosnia after the end of the conflict there, officials said.
And both the United States and Europe are studying plans to go
beyond physical rebuilding in Kosovo to bolster the economies of
countries throughout the region and bring them economically and
politically closer to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not give a message of long-term stability linked to
the European Union institutions, there will never be peace in the
Balkans,'' Prodi said in an interview with CNN on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, both the United States and Europe have all but
ruled out providing any aid to help repair the tremendous damage
done to Yugoslavia by months of NATO bombing. In an apparent
attempt to foster popular discontent with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, officials in both Washington and Europe said
they would not provide help to rebuild Yugoslavia as long as
Milosevic remained in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question of dealing with Milosevic,'' Tony Blair,
the British prime minister, told Reuters Television. ``There is no
place for Serbia in the true family of nations while Milosevic
remains, and they cannot be part, in my judgment, of a Balkan
reconstruction program whilst Milosevic remains in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its economy was relatively poor and rural, Kosovo has
clearly suffered tremendous physical damage that is certain to be
costly and time-consuming to repair. The only international group
to have gotten a good look at the province since the conflict began
_ a U.N. team that spent less than three days there last week _
reported that 80 percent of the homes in some areas had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation found ``a depressing panorama of empty villages,
burned houses, looted shops, wandering livestock and unattended
farms,'' Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary-general
for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are many political, economic and logistical problems to be
overcome before any large-scale rebuilding effort can get under
way. While neighboring countries like Albania and Macedonia are
already receiving assistance from the World Bank and the IMF,
Kosovo is technically ineligible for aid from the international
financial institutions because it is not a country, and remains
part of a nation, Yugoslavia, that was kicked out of the World Bank
and the monetary fund seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how much rebuilding work will be done by
allied military forces. The experience in Bosnia indicates that
physical rebuilding goes much more quickly than the complex task of
creating a new economy. Christiaan Poortman, Balkans coordinator at
the World Bank, said that more than 90 percent of the planned road
network in Bosnia is complete, more than 90 percent of a new phone
system is up and running, elementary school enrollment is higher
than before the conflict there, nearly three-quarters of the
electrical-generation system has been restored _ but the country's
economic output is still less than half of what it was in 1990.

<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ With the Yugoslav government having agreed to
withdraw military and police forces from Kosovo, the United States
will stop its emergency airlift of refugees to this army base,
administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said
that about 3,500 refugees already in Fort Dix would continue to be
screened for resettlement in communities around the country. The
pace of the resettlement, about 100 people a day, would not slow,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional visit here, during which she heard groups of
women describe how they fled Kosovo, Shalala told them to treat the
Yugoslav pledge ``with caution,'' much as the Clinton
Administration viewed it. ``My message to the refugees today was to
get on with your lives,'' she said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, whose parents came to the United States as refugees
from Lebanon, promised to let the Kosovars know when it is safe to
return home, and said the U.S. government would pay their air fare.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Kosovars are under no legal obligation to return,
many, especially the young, said they feel divided: duty tells them
to rebuild and repopulate their destroyed homeland, they say, but
the chance to live in the United States, away from the threat of
annihilation and ethnic hatreds, is hard to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to return home as soon as possible, but I'd also like
to take back some experience from America,'' said Rudi Rubik, a
23-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Ardita Spahiu, a 20-year-old lab technician, said that she was
divided, too. ``Since I was a little girl my dream was to come to
the United States,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among older refugees, the urge was strong to reclaim the shreds
of all they had built and lost. Demiri Riza, a 70-year-old farmer
who is hard of hearing, somehow had missed the news that Yugoslavia
bowed to NATO demands and would allow the Kosovars back. He wept as
Rubik, acting as translator, told him about it today. ``Really?''
he asked in disbelief. ``Really?''
</P>
<P>
   Riza said he wanted to go home as soon as possible, to his house
in ``I don't know if it's still there,'' he said. There is also
fear that the Serbs may leave mines behind, and Riza said he would
wait for Washington to give the all-clear before going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love America, but Kosovo is sweet,'' he said, and turned to
the younger Rubik, to ask, ``Don't you miss your country?''
</P>
<P>
   Mirvete Halimi said her husband was skeptical about Serbian
intentions, even in peace, but vowed that her family would return
regardless of what their sons _ who are 11 and 13 _ want. In
Kosovar families, she said, ``There is only one boss, the mother or
the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halimi said, ``I'll tell my children, `It's time to go home.
Don't make any problems, because our country is calling us.'''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has so far taken in 6,000 of the 20,000
refugees it pledged to resettle. About 4,000 have come through Fort
Dix, and 2,000 others went straight to relatives in the United
States who offered to sponsor them.
</P>
<P>
   About 650 refugees have by now left Fort Dix for communities
around the United States, leaving 3,400 still awaiting resettlement
or a return to Kosovo.

EDITORIAL: EUROPE'S NEW MILITARY ASPIRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   The air war over Yugoslavia, though successful, brought renewed
attention to one of NATO's oldest problems. While 19 countries
belong to the alliance and take part in its political
decision-making, most of the military power comes from just one of
these countries, the United States, as does much of the political
leadership. More than two-thirds of the NATO planes used against
Serbia were American. This week the European Union, which includes
most of NATO's European members, adopted a plan aimed at partially
redressing the balance. That is a welcome development. But European
governments will have to overcome many obstacles if the plan is to
have any practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give Europe the ability to carry out peacekeeping
and small-scale combat operations on its own, while continuing its
reliance on American participation in bigger conflicts. That
ability is already improving, at least for peacekeeping. Four years
ago in Bosnia, the United States had to provide one-third of the
60,000 peacekeepers. It will be supplying only 14 percent of the
50,000 soldiers planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union plan, which would unfold over the next 18
months, commits member countries to transform their military forces
so that they can be used more effectively in crisis and
peacekeeping situations. It also designates a full-time coordinator
of European foreign and defense policy, a job given yesterday to
Javier Solana, the current secretary-general of NATO. Merely naming
a coordinator will not bring coherence to the disparate foreign
policies of the European Union's 15 sovereign countries. But
Solana's political skills and NATO experience make him a good
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's total armed forces are already larger than those of the
United States. But for the most part, they are poorly suited for
crises like Bosnia or Kosovo. More mobile and flexible forces are
needed that could fight for months at a stretch. Europe must also
increase its capacity to ferry troops where needed, reducing its
reliance on U.S. transport planes. Additionally, European armies
need modern command and intelligence tools.
</P>
<P>
   Modernizing European forces will require breaking down
bureaucratic fiefs and pushing through politically difficult
increases in defense spending. Applying force will also require
changes in European attitudes. Since the end of World War II,
Germany and Italy have been understandably reluctant to use
military force.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's inability to carry its military weight in NATO has been
a standing source of trans-Atlantic friction. More than a
half-century after the defeat of Hitler and more than a decade
after the Cold War, U.S. troops should not be expected to help
extinguish every local European conflict.

FEEDING A FRENZY: WHY INTERNET INVESTORS ARE STILL RAVENOUS

is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6)  
 (Eds: The (star) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The ink on the first draft of the history of
the Internet stock boom isn't yet dry, and the revisionists are
already having their say.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Internet shares were tumbling from their highs, three of
the companies backed by Accel Partners, a venture capital firm,
went public last month. Though their net losses total $56 million,
the three now have a combined market capitalization of $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astounding,'' James W. Breyer, the firm's managing partner,
calls that performance, echoing the giddiness common in Silicon
Valley when people talk about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same breath, Breyer decries the shortcomings of the
crop of new offerings following in his companies' footsteps.
``We've had far too many low-quality companies go public,'' he
scoffed. The recent market turmoil that has sliced the value of
many Internet stocks in half is making investors more
discriminating, he added approvingly: ``Investors can more easily
distinguish between companies building a long-term business and
those which have been merely opportunistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be a master of the Internet universe and not only make
business history, but spin it, too. As some of the air leaks out of
the Internet stock bubble, the same people who manufactured the
feeding frenzy _ the venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and
investment bankers who have been the biggest promoters of the
phenomenon _ are beginning to say it may have spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks not ready for prime time were foisted on a welcoming
public lusting for the big score, they now say. In Silicon Valley's
effervescence the past few months, discretion lost out to greed.
</P>
<P>
   And yet even as they apply the rhetorical brakes to careening
Internet mania, those same financiers are stepping on the gas,
racing to bring companies to market before the Internet euphoria
disappears. Some investment bankers say clients are asking them to
pull together ``road shows'' _ in which executives pitch their
companies to prospective buyers _ in little more than two weeks,
half the usual time. And many of the bankers, supposed arbiters of
a company's market-worthiness, are only too happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's hang onto the rocket ship and giggle all the
way to the moon,'' said Mark G. Shafir, an investment banker at
Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 59 Internet companies have gone public this year _
compared with 30 in all of 1998, according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data, which tracks such numbers. Fifty-six percent of
the 212 Internet and Internet-related companies filing plans to go
public with the Securities and Exchange Commission since January
1994 did so in the last six months. May was the busiest month on
record, as 35 companies registered with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   That pace concerns David Menlow, who, as the longtime president
of IPO Financial Network, a firm in Milburn, N.J., that tracks new
offerings, has seen his share of hysteria on Wall Street. Even he
is stunned at the crush of companies rushing to go public since
Internet stocks hit a record high in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Menlow's most recent newsletter is chock-full of comments on the
new crop, and few are charitable. ``Right church, wrong pew,'' he
writes about one Internet-related medical concern. ``Talk about
swimming upstream,'' he says of a company that creates computer
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet stocks is still fertile, Menlow said,
but companies like these will be judged more harshly in coming
months, since the euphoria over the sector has ebbed. ``Before, the
window was wide open,'' he said. ``Now the window has a fine mesh
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with Silicon Valley still working overtime to generate
excitement _ and the transformative power of Internet innovation a
genuine, powerful lure _ investors can be said to share a new
caution only if their behavior is judged against the hysteria of
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   In January, according to Securities Data, initial public
offerings of Internet companies averaged a first-day gain of 248
percent. By the end of May, with so many deals to choose from and
appetites waning a bit, that gain had dwindled to 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fearlessly, though, Silicon Valley financiers are developing
ways to institutionalize the Web frenzy. Venture capitalists are
demanding that shares of some new companies be sold on line, where
Internet-hungry investors are abundant. And some neophyte
investment firms see that as an opportunity to supplant the more
established banks.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at innocently, they are aiming to democratize investment.
Looked at cynically, they are looking to give every investor equal
standing in the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley veterans believe it is time for some
cooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually despair what is going on in the Valley,'' said Judy
Estrin, chief technology officer at Cisco Systems, herself an
entrepreneur who was a co-founder of three companies. ``It used to
be if you had good products and you took care of your clients and
customers, you'd win. That's not enough anymore. Today it's more
about marketing hype and rising above the noise level.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overly pessimistic. Most here are ecstatic at the
speed and breadth of innovation that the Internet has unleashed.
But for the financiers, one thing is certain, even with Web shares
down: It doesn't get much better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Silicon Valley's venture capitalists and investment
bankers ply their trade in Menlo Park, not far from grassy pastures
dotted with cows and an occasional deer. There, in the 2700 block
of Sand Hill Road (more aptly named ``Stand Still Road'' when
rush-hour traffic clogs the four-lane route), two of the fiercest
competitors in investment banking have set up shop. A small,
flower-filled courtyard separates the offices of rivals Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and the Goldman Sachs Group, their buildings
connected by a covered walkway 100 yards long.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's an intimacy rare even in a place where deals are cut at
Saturday-morning soccer games. ``We have a pact not to go through
the trash,'' joked Eff W. Martin, a Goldman partner, pointing at
Morgan's offices through a slit in the window blinds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrangements seem a bit cozy, as if what the bankers
have in common _ their insider status in a very rich game _ trumps
any antagonisms. Bradford C. Koenig, Goldman's co-head of high
technology, employed the same nanny later hired by Rex Golding, a
Harvard Business School classmate and his counterpart at Morgan
Stanley. And it is not uncommon to see bankers from both camps
schmoozing at the same Valley soirees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investment bankers sit at the top of the
financial pyramid; here they mainly play the role of courtiers. The
true princes of finance are the venture capitalists, who invest in
start-ups with the hope of a big payoff when a company goes public
or is sold.
</P>
<P>
   More Internet venture dollars are chasing deals than ever
before. Funds raised by venture capitalists have blossomed in the
past four years, from $774 million in 1995 to $4.9 billion last
year, according to the VentureOne Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lee, an entrepreneur in Redwood City, Calif., who last
September started a company called Corio that distributes business
software over the Internet, said he was approached by no fewer than
20 venture capital firms, including the godfather of Silicon Valley
venture capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, ``there wasn't a countervailing presence to the
lunacy of the bankers,'' said Gary Rieschel, managing general
partner at Softbank Technology Ventures, an early investor in
Yahoo, the Internet directory service. ``Now you have the lunacy of
the venture capitalists to counter the lunacy of the bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this decade's venture capitalists have much in common
with bankers of a decade ago who hired publicists to promote
themselves and their successes. In keeping with the spirit of the
companies they finance, most have their own Web sites and are
skilled at creating a buzz loud enough to rise above the Valley
static.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more accomplished is Robert Kagle, a venture
capitalist at Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park. Benchmark was an
early investor in Ebay, the on-line auction company that has seen
its share price climb more than 1,000 percent since going public
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kagle, 43, a Michigan native who, like many Valley veterans,
moved to Palo Alto to attend Stanford Business School and never
left, is self-deprecating. ``Some venture capitalists see
themselves as the center of the universe,'' he said. ``We see it as
a service business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shares credit with colleagues for his successes,
Mr. Kagle is an adept salesman for the companies he backs. In a
recent interview, for instance, he readily volunteered that he
collects antique fishing decoys _ bought through Ebay, of course.
And he strained to use the term ``Ebaysian'' (``pronounced
e-BAY-ze-an,'' he said) no fewer than five times in a 35-minute
telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It is his attempt to introduce Ebay culture _ which
advocates the equal standing of every bidder _ into the new
language of the Internet, a bit of manipulation that he doesn't
deny and even laughs about.
</P>
<P>
   No other Internet company has been so hotly fought over as Ebay,
and the story of its public offering suggests how eager bankers are
to hook up with a company they think will be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, when Kagle and Ebay's chief executive, Meg Whitman,
invited investment banks to pitch for the job of taking the company
public, Goldman and Morgan jumped at the chance. Ms. Whitman had
one peculiar demand: When they came calling, each bank had to bring
an item bought on Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   A team of eight Goldman executives entered Ebay's headquarters,
bags crammed with charts, market data _ and Tank the Armadillo, a
Beanie Baby that Koenig had bought for his 7-year-old son, Austin,
for $32.75 in an Ebay auction.
</P>
<P>
   Michael K. Parekh, an analyst, had a 25-year-old Parcheesi game
that he had bought for $110. He also presented the Ebay executives
with a sample research report before the Goldman team swept them
off to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear they would be a leader in this market,'' Koenig
said, explaining the avid campaign. ``The more time we spent on the
site, we realized it was a whole new dimension in personal
trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's inventiveness struck a chord with Ebay, though Morgan
Stanley was dogged, too. Its executives also logged hours on Ebay's
Web site, buying fine French wine and a couple of piggy banks in
which Ebay could stuff its newfound money. But ``they didn't
display as deep an understanding,'' Kagle said. And it cost Morgan
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers were devastated. ``We walked out of the meeting
right then and knew that it didn't click,'' said Mary Meeker,
Morgan's celebrated Internet analyst _ ``Queen Mary'' to her fans,
``Bloody Mary'' to her detractors and a stock-moving powerhouse in
the eyes of both.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker was convinced that Ebay would be a market leader, and
after Morgan lost, she quickly went to work repairing the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   She spent hours getting to know Ms. Whitman, including a dinner
at Logan Airport in Boston last July, one of several meetings over
a period of months. In August, Ruth Porat, Morgan's co-head of
global technology and Ms. Meeker spent an evening on the phone with
Ms. Whitman, critiquing Goldman's road-show presentation.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that the company demonstrate its users'
enthusiasm better; as a result, Ebay created slides listing some of
the thousands of items for sale related just to the baseball
superstar Mark McGwire.
</P>

   Ms. Meeker also took the unprecedented step of publishing a
favorable research report the day after Ebay began trading last
September. (Analysts usually like to wait until the company has a
track record before giving an endorsement.)
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was legally barred from talking up the stock for 30 days
after the offering, Ms. Whitman noted, ``so Mary became the one the
press called. She became associated with Ebay.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's hard work paid off. In March, Goldman lined up
investors for Ebay's $1 billion secondary stock offering but was
forced to share the business with Morgan. Goldman chafed at the
concession but was powerless to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan earned it,'' Ms. Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any question that technology is transforming
business, investors need look only at the most staid rite of
passage on Wall Street: going public.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that for a standard 7 percent underwriting fee,
bankers would herd management onto a chartered jet for a two-week
road show, cram in 10 to 12 meetings a day with mutual fund
managers and other investors and hope to end up with a list of
interested buyers _ with a tiny portion of the stock reserved for
mom-and-pop investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors' mania for the stocks minted by Silicon Valley
financiers _ along with the growing trend toward do-it-yourself
investing on line _ has banks scrambling to find new ways to get
stock in IPOs into the hands of individuals. And the new on-line
banks, without armies of bankers and salesmen, expect to charge
companies fees of 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you had the discount brokers,'' said Michael Moritz, a
venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park. ``Now you have
the emergence of the discount investment banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Established firms like the Charles Schwab Corp. and DLJ Direct,
the on-line affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, already
distribute shares on line and help underwrite stock offerings. But
the emergence of on-line investment banks _ like the Wit Capital
Group of New York (which itself went public on Friday) and
E(star)Offering, which is backed by Sanford Robertson, a co-founder
of Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Co. of San Francisco _ could open the
process further, with new stocks available on a first-come,
first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   The most revolutionary concept is being championed by William
Hambrecht, co-founder of another San Francisco investment bank,
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. Housed in a former warehouse in the city's
design district, his firm, W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., sells new stocks
over the Internet in a so-called Dutch auction, with investors
setting the price.
</P>
<P>
   Investors place bids for the number of shares they want at a
price they are willing to pay. After a few weeks of bidding, a
clearing price is set at the lowest offer at which all shares can
be sold. Those bidding above the clearing price get all the shares
they asked for. Investors bidding at that price may get only a
percentage of the shares they want. Those who bid too low are shut
out.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, while by no means proven, appeals to venture
capitalists like Bruce Dunlevie, a partner at Benchmark Capital.
``I think the trends favor it,'' he said. ``It is the rise of the
consumer in the IPO market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mechanics may serve only to feed the frenzy further,
encouraging overbidding. ``If you guess the actual price, you run
the risk of not getting stock,'' acknowledged Ian H. Zwicker,
president of W.R. Hambrecht.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it is unclear whether many analysts will follow the
companies and offer investors needed guidance. Ravenswood Winery,
the first company whose stock was auctioned this way, got a tepid
reaction from investors. But most experts believe the logical users
of Hambrecht's services are Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   If the market for Internet stocks remains weak, Silicon Valley
may have no choice but to pause and catch its breath. That would
please Lee, the founder of Corio.
</P>
<P>
   Corio's fiercest competitor, a Maryland company called
USinternetworking, was grabbing headlines after its stock price
shot up from $21 to a high of $60 on April 9, the day it went
public. Though USinternetworking had $33 million in net losses and
a still-developing business model, the first day's trading gave it
an eye-popping market capitalization of $2.4 billion and, Lee
worried, instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   He was faced with a decision: Should Corio go public, too? It
had promising sales but couldn't guarantee the same success in the
coming months. And while Wall Street analysts may not require
profits, they do demand predictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't come without processes, people and tools in
place,'' Lee said. After an agonizing two-hour board meeting in
April, the company chose to hold off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely felt the pressure,'' Lee said. ``You get caught
up in the hype. Given that we could do it, of course we thought
about it. A lot of people do. We are fighting a clock.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, he doesn't regret the decision.
USinternetworking's market capitalization has fallen to $1 billion,
and investors who bought in the first day's euphoria are facing
losses of more than 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is that an IPO is a measure of doing something
well,'' Lee said. He hesitated for a moment, reconsidering the
thought. ``But it's also about being at the right place at the
right time.''

KOSOVO OUTCOME SHOWS HOW AIR POWER CAN WIN WITHOUT GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic once boasted that a
high-technology bombing war would never force Serbian soldiers out
of Kosovo. ``You are not willing to sacrifice lives to achieve our
surrender,'' he proclaimed five weeks into the 10-week conflict.
``We are willing to die to defend our rights as an independent
sovereign nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet without one combat casualty, the U.S.-led NATO alliance has
proved the dictator wrong. If the peace deal that Milosevic agreed
to on Thursday holds up, his government has unwillingly become the
first case study in how precision weaponry, overwhelming resources
and a steely willingness to keep bombing can compel victory _ all
without risking NATO soldiers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's dismissive view of a ``say uncle'' strategy that
from Day 1 ruled out U.S. ground forces was echoed by many of the
West's most prominent military experts. They and Milosevic
certainly had history on their side. From World War II to Vietnam
to the Persian Gulf war, air power has always promised far more
than it delivered. Victory, if it came at all, demanded that young
men get down in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   But after two and a half months in which the only ground combat
was conducted by Albanian separatist guerrillas, Milosevic
apparently calculated that the cost of controlling Kosovo, which
Serbs regard as the sacred root of their national identity, was
more than his government could bear.
</P>
<P>
   The cost included the death of 5,000 members of the Yugoslav
armed forces and the wounding of more than 10,000 other fighters,
according to NATO. As important, the air campaign, which Milosevic
was apparently powerless to stop or substantially hinder, ravaged
the basic installations of Yugoslavia and, for the first time in a
decade of fighting in the Balkans, brought home the misery of war
to the middle classes in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO victory represented by the peace deal also exacted a
savage human price from the people in whose name the war in Kosovo
was fought. Nearly a million ethnic Albanians were forced out of
their homeland by a Serbian campaign of intimidation and murder
that accelerated with the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said at the beginning of the bombing that it
would protect the Kosovo Albanians, who made up 90 percent of the
population in the province. But White House strategists have since
conceded that that was never really a practical goal. Bombing could
neither protect the Kosovars, the officials said, nor could it
force out the Yugoslav armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   What the White House had hoped air power would do and what it
has apparently done, after an air campaign that continued far
longer than planned, is diminish Milosevic's chances of survival to
the point where it made sense for him to sue for peace.
</P>
<P>
   A supposedly crippling flaw that military analysts diagnosed in
the bombing strategy was that it allowed Milosevic to be the sole
judge of when he had lost the war. Gen. Colin Powell, the Gulf war
strategist who championed the idea that America should go to war
only when victory was guaranteed by overwhelming force, said that
an air-only campaign gave Milosevic the option of deciding ``when
he's had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What Powell appears not to have noticed is that throughout this
decade Milosevic has been quite willing to ``say uncle'' and lose
wars, provided that it is in his interest to do so. The Kosovo
accord makes this the fourth time since 1991 that Milosevic has
done exactly that, initiate damage control and give up on wars that
he started.
</P>
<P>
   As far as saving his own skin, the deal that Milosevic, an
indicted war criminal, agreed to is a considerable improvement on
the Rambouillet plan that the West tried and failed to impose on
him this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new pact calls for a NATO and Russian force under United
Nations auspices to deploy only in and near Kosovo. The Rambouillet
plan would have given purely NATO forces guaranteed access to all
of Yugoslavia, including Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House calculated, at the start of the bombing in March
that Milosevic's resolve in Kosovo would crumble in a few days,
just as it did in Bosnia in 1995. The Administration was shocked, a
former White House official recounted, that Milosevic was using the
bombing as an occasion for stepped-up ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking Plan B and nervous about the political effects of combat
deaths in an obscure corner of Europe, the White House and NATO
stuck to its air strategy, while increasing the number of bombing
runs to a level never contemplated before the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, after the bombing strategy set off a
rally-round-the-flag reaction in Yugoslavia, Milosevic publicly
sneered at the West's plan. ``Your leaders are not strategic
thinkers,'' he said in an interview with United Press
International. ``Short-term quick fixes, yes. They said, `Let's
bomb Yugoslavia and then figure out what to do next.'''
</P>
<P>
   What the United States and NATO did next was simply bomb some
more. Spokesmen in Washington and Brussels publicly but
perfunctorily regretted raids that killed civilians, but the
bombing steadily increased in frequency and ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of American public opinion have found, after examining
polls dating from the Korean War, that the single most important
factor that can turn the American public against a foreign war is a
spike in U.S. combat casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public applies a fairly reasonable cost-benefit analysis
when evaluating foreign affairs, but it vastly overvalues the lives
of Americans and undervalues the lives of foreigners,'' said John
Mueller, an expert on polling and foreign wars who is a professor
of political science at the University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Polling since April by the Pew Research Center has found 60
percent of Americans ``very worried'' about American combat
casualties, although there have been none. The polling also found
that even after bombing mistakes killed scores upon scores of
civilians, just 40 percent of Americans were ``very worried'' about
that.
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, the Kosovo effort was perfectly attuned to
American opinion. The sole American deaths occurred when two
helicopter pilots died in a training accident.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, two planes went down, and the pilots were whisked
away by a supersecret high-technology rescue force. The leap in
high-tech warfare, even compared to the gulf war in 1991, when 75
coalition aircraft were shot down, was nothing less than
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In an entirely different way, the campaign was also attuned to
Serbian opinion. There is an enduring myth among the Serbs of brave
and hopeless struggle against overwhelming odds. It dates from 1389
and the Serbian loss in Kosovo to Ottoman invaders. The myth has
been relentlessly reinforced by Milosevic's control of state
television.
</P>
<P>
   If the war does end with the new accord, lost-cause myths are
highly unlikely to sustain Milosevic, especially as the Serbian
people add up the costs of their fight. In that accounting, the
Bosnia precedent could be telling. Eighteen months after
Milosevic's surrender there in 1995, tens of thousands of unhappy
and increasingly impoverished Serbs took to the streets to demand
his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The gestation period for protests in Belgrade seems quite likely
to be much shorter after Kosovo.

A BIRDIE BARRAGE AT THE LPGA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Miss., Ore., Korea, Sweden)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ One day after Kelli Kuehne shot a 64 at the
U.S. Women's Open, Lorie Kane and Becky Iverson did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Don't players usually struggle to make par at the Open? Aren't
birdies supposed to be precious, and bogeys commonplace? Not this
year, and not at Old Waverly Golf Club, which may surrender the
lowest 72-hole score in Open history.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting an eight-under-par 64, and soaring from seven strokes
behind into a tie for first place, Kane was 10 under par (134) for
the tournament and shared the second-round lead with Juli Inkster
after another day of high temperatures and low scores.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne was one stroke behind in third place, still very much in
the picture after shooting a 71 Friday. Iverson, who equaled Kane
with the day's best round (64), was in fourth place at 136 and in
contention to capture her first major.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-hole cut was par-144, the lowest in U.S. Women's Open
history. The previous low cut was three over par, in 1993 at
Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Notable players missing the cut included Annika Sorenstam and
Laura Davies, at 146, and Nancy Lopez, who was at 149 in her 23d
attempt to win the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Four talented players were tied for fifth place at seven under
par _ Grace Park, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion who is turning
professional after the tournament; Dottie Pepper, who won the
year's first major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore; Sherri Steinhauer, who
made the winning putt for last year's U.S. Solheim Cup team, and
Catriona Matthew of Sweden, a member of last year's European
Solheim Cup team. The defending champion, Se Ri Pak, was six under
par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten under is not going to win this tournament,'' said Inkster,
who shot a 69 and finished with a birdie on No. 18 to tie Kane.
``You've got to play aggressive. You've got to make birdies. I
don't think there's anything wrong with that. I would rather see
what I'm seeing this week than see what I saw last year. I mean, it
was a joke. Bogey, bogey, bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no comparison between this Open and last year's, held
at Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Kohler, Wis., one of the most
demanding venues ever.
</P>
<P>
   Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn finished tied for the lead at six
over par after 72 holes before Pak won in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   This year, six over par sent you home for the weekend. The
72-hole Open record of 10 under par, set by Alison Nicholas in 1997
at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in North Plains, Ore., is in serious
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   With wide-open fairways, manageable rough and perfectly
manicured greens that were softened by heavy rain Wednesday, Old
Waverly has been defenseless to stop the birdie barrage.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the most demanding obstacle has been the weather, as the
afternoon temperature reached 93 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat did not break the concentration of Kane, 34, who
breezed through Old Waverly just as Kuehne did Thursday. Kane set
the tone by starting with three consecutive birdies, making a
20-footer on the opening hole. She made three putts from 15 feet or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some putts that kind of hung on the edge and fell in,''
Kane said. ``I keep learning from those experiences and try to
build on them. If it stays this hot and we don't get rain, then
it's going to be a different ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kuehne's 71 was a far cry from her opening-round 64, she
has yet to make a bogey and remained confident about her chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shoot 64 every day at the U.S. Open,'' said Kuehne,
a 22-year-old former two-time U.S. Amateur champion. ``I wish you
could. I hit 15 greens yesterday and 15 today. I hit a lot of great
putts today that I did not make. That's golf.'' &QL;

HASTERT WILL REWRITE SPENDING BILLS TO SHIFT EASE CUTS IN SOCIAL
PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Fixes 12th graph to clarify that figures are not the total
U.S. budget)   (Exclusive)  
(rm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, his bills stymied and
his control of the House insecure, has decided to rewrite
Republican spending plans and shift some money from increased
military spending to ease cuts in social programs like health and
education, key aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert will tell the House Republican caucus on Monday that
``we're going to trim off some of the allocations for defense,
treasury, the legislative branch, and feed some of that back'' into
bills financing programs for labor, health and human services,
education, housing and veterans' affairs, a senior Republican aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a work in progress,'' said John Feehery,
spokesman for Hastert. ``We are going to have to fight each bill.''
So far, the House has failed to pass a single one of the 13
separate appropriations measures that finance the government for
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, five months into his tenure, is having a hard time
carrying out the Republican strategy: to be the party of national
defense and fiscal discipline, pour billions into new Pentagon
spending, freeze or cut everything else, and pass the spending
bills on time and in good order. Now, only the Pentagon's windfall
seems assured.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original plan for the coming year, the Defense
Department received $19 billion more than this year; domestic
programs received $26 billion less. Under the evolving plan,
several billion dollars would be transferred from the military
ledger into domestic programs. Military spending would still rise
and domestic spending would still fall, but by less than first
planned. No final figures are set.
</P>
<P>
   The new goal is to restore cuts in domestic spending that
moderate Republicans find intolerable, keep at least some
conservatives happy, and win over enough moderate Democrats to pass
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The shift would bring the House spending plan closer to the
Senate's. But with a perilously slim 223-212 majority in the House,
Hastert needs Republican unity to pass anything. He lacks it. And
House Democrats will do little to help him.
</P>
<P>
   When he became speaker, Hastert vowed to pass the spending bills
on time.
</P>
<P>
   The year's first major spending measure, a $60.8 billion
agriculture bill, was derailed last week by fiscal conservatives
who wanted to block all such bills until there was a plan for
protecting the Social Security surplus. Then Hastert could not
summon the votes to bring a $289 billion defense authorization bill
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans' conservatives are in revolt, their
moderates frustrated and their leadership red-faced. They recall
the 1998 budget breakdown and the 1995 government shutdown and
worry that their slim majority may be threatened if they appear
inept.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders ``can't communicate a strategy to their
members, they can't communicate a strategy to the American people,
and if they can't do that, they are going to be in a world of hurt
when they go up against the Democrats in 2000'' said Peter Sperry,
a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where spending bills traditionally originate,
Republicans have allocated $270 billion for the Pentagon and $268
billion for every other arm of the government combined. That $538
billion is what is left of the $1.75 trillion budget after paying
for mandatory programs like Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And the way that sum was divided among the 13 House
appropriations subcommittees set moderate Republican chairmen
howling that the wealth was spread too thin. To Hastert's left,
liberals warned that the Republican plan starved needy people and
worthy programs. To his right, conservatives promised to hew to the
cuts, stop dipping into surplus Social Security revenues, and keep
the spending caps enacted by Congress and the White House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The caps held the budget down and helped create the surplus, but
both Republicans and Democrats are asking if they still make sense
in an era of economic prosperity. Hastert says the caps were a
solemn promise to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hastert, prodded by his two Texas colleagues, the
majority leader, Dick Armey, and the Majority Whip, Tom DeLay, came
up with two new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One aims to shift responsibility, or blame, for increased
spending to individual members. A key Republican aide said the idea
would ``keep the caps but insert a trigger'' to blow them away.
``If members want to, they could vote on cap-busting amendments,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other idea ``was changing the allocations, working with
chairmen to take a whole new approach,'' another senior Republican
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   That would redistribute billions from the bills financing the
Department of Defense, Congress, the Treasury Department and the
Postal Service. The money would be shifted to two other bills. One
finances the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education, which took a $10.7 billion cut in this year's plan, from
$88.8 billion to $78.1 billion. The other, for housing, urban
development, veterans and several independent agencies, took a $5.7
billion cut, from $71.9 billion to $66.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce, Justice and State Departments, which face a $3
billion cut, and the Interior Department, cut by $2.6 billion, also
might also see some money restored.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans have promised to stop the spending
bills in their tracks unless each one is cut or frozen at last
year's level. That forces Hastert find 13 magic numbers: sums that
will allow the 13 bills to win 218 votes in in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot, he will face a reprise of last year's last-minute
free-for-all spending bill, loaded with $21 billion of extras
financed from the Social Security surplus, or a repeat of the 1995
government shutdown. In each event, House Republicans lost face,
President Clinton gained political capital, and programs the
Republicans wanted to cut or kill won new life.

COMMENTARY: DON'T GIVE MILOSEVIC ROOM TO WIGGLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Has Slobodan Milosevic really capitulated to NATO's
demands? The test will be straightforward: Will the expelled ethnic
Albanians return to Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   They will not return if they have to go through checks at the
border by Serbian police or soldiers. They will not return if
sectors of Kosovo are controlled by Russian troops outside an
effective single international command. One more essential: They
will not return if the United States and its allies show signs of
relaxing their commitment and their pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In that last regard, President Clinton's reaction to the news
from Belgrade was encouraging. He could have claimed victory in
Milosevic's announced acceptance of the G-8 terms. Instead he urged
caution.
</P>
<P>
   With Milosevic, the need for hard work begins when he ``agrees''
to something. He agreed last October to withdraw Serbian forces
from Kosovo _ and then, while the West's attention wandered, began
planning his bloody assault on the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   In the days ahead, Western leaders will have to use all their
diplomatic skill and political firmness with Russia to preserve the
crucial concept of an international force under unified command.
They will have to flesh out details of the agreement to give the
Kosovars the assurance of a secure life that will lead them to
return.
</P>
<P>
   The West must deny Milosevic wiggle room. There can be no
negotiations with a mass murderer. He must be kept isolated: no
handshakes, no concessions. Sanctions must remain on Serbia. The
Serbian people will suffer, but so they must for the tyranny they
have repeatedly endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   The West must be ready, too, for fresh aggression by Milosevic.
His likely next target is Montenegro, junior partner of Serbia in
Yugoslavia. We must act, not just talk, against any Milosevic
attempt to overthrow its pro-Western government.
</P>
<P>
   If our resolve sticks, the diplomatic denouement in Belgrade may
open the way to a decent outcome of this conflict. Or at least
decent in the sense of turning back a monster after letting him do
terrible human and physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that we, the West, allowed the monster to feed
unchecked for years. Timothy Garton Ash, that most thoughtful
observer of Eastern Europe, sums it up in the current New York
Review of Books:
</P>
<P>
   ``(There has been) a decade of appeasement, by the West, of an
evil post-Communist politician who has exploited Serbian
nationalism to bring power and riches to himself and his family.
... Milosevic is not Hitler, but the basic pattern of appeasement
is comparable: The longer you wait, the higher the price. Hitler
should have been stopped when he remilitarized the Rhineland in
1936; Milosevic, at the siege of Vukovar in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeasers, the Neville Chamberlains of 1991, were George
Bush and James Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger. They could have
stopped Milosevic at Vukovar but airily ignored him: the worst
American foreign-policy decision in many decades. Prime Minister
John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain were just
as feeble.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has his share of the responsibility, too. He
dithered over Serbian atrocities in Bosnia until Dayton, and
dithered over Kosovo until he finally challenged Milosevic and
began bombing in March.
</P>
<P>
   The president was without a plan when Milosevic savaged the
Kosovars. So was NATO, with its disastrous decision to forsake
ground forces at the start. Who will fear an alliance that dares
not risk the life of a single soldier in the cause it proclaims?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, many of them, performed disgracefully.
Tom DeLay, the House whip, saw the Kosovo conflict as a way to pin
a losing war on the Democrats. As recently as last week, House
Republicans pressed to cut off all funds for the war on Sept. 30.
Such Republicans as John McCain and Bob Dole saw Milosevic for what
he was. DeLay &AMP; Co. were on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Relief at the apparent outcome of this war must not, finally,
lead us to forget Slobodan Milosevic. No one will be safe in the
Balkans until he is where he belongs: before the International War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. An earnest of our commitment to that
end would be to arrest the indicted Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan
Karadzic. That is up to French forces in Bosnia, in whose sector he
is hiding.

EDITORIAL: SPENDING TO STOP SMOKING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   New York lags woefully behind states like California and
Massachusetts in combating smoking, the leading preventable cause
of death and disease. More than 30,000 New York residents die
annually from tobacco-related illness. Yet the state spends a
pittance _ $6.5 million annually, or 37 cents per person _ on
anti-smoking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall from the multistate tobacco settlement should make
it possible for New York, which expects to receive roughly $1
billion a year, to turn that around. This week Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver outlined a plan that would provide about $80 million
a year for new smoking-prevention programs, financed mostly by the
settlement money and part of a five-cent increase on the minimum
price of cigarettes. Gov. George Pataki says he is not opposed to
spending more, but his own proposal to use 75 percent of the state
government's share of the settlement on debt reduction and the rest
on other health care programs might leave too little for new
anti-smoking measures.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong evidence that aggressive anti-tobacco programs
can reduce the allure of smoking to teen-agers. Florida, for
example, spent $70 million last year on a comprehensive
youth-oriented smoking prevention plan. In just one year, smoking
rates declined by 19 percent among Florida's middle-school
students, and by 8 percent among high schoolers. California, which
spends $120 million a year on anti-smoking programs, and
Massachusetts, which spends $60 million a year, have slowed the
growth rate in teen-age smoking. In Oregon, per capita cigarette
consumption dropped by 11 percent after a ballot measure raised
cigarette taxes to finance anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Centers for Disease Control suggested last year that
a comprehensive tobacco control strategy for New York would require
between $93 million and $259 million a year. A coalition of health
groups has urged a very reasonable $90 million a year for
anti-tobacco education, counter-advertising campaigns and smoking
cessation programs. Silver's plan would come close to that goal.
New York taxpayers spend $1.8 billion a year in Medicaid costs
alone to treat smoking-related illnesses. Spending a tiny fraction
of that amount on smoking prevention would help curb medical costs
and reduce a lot of human misery.

COMMENTARY: STRUGGLING TO MOVE BEYOND OK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending on your rooting interests, the Mets-Yankees subway
series comes at a curious time. If you're pulling for the Yankees,
it couldn't come at a better time. After two terrible losses to
Cleveland, the Bombers are looking to shift into a higher gear. If
you're pulling for the Mets, the series couldn't come at a better
time. The team entered the series on a six-game losing streak, five
games out of first place and reeling.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're pulling for Bobby Valentine, the series couldn't
have come at a worse time. The timing has matched the wobbling Mets
against the World Series champion Yankees in a venue regarded as
the most hallowed in sports. Most of all, the three-game series
juxtaposes Joe Torre, the epitome of managing, with Valentine, a
manager who specializes in rebuilding teams but one who has never
been able to get past ``OK''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 seasons, Valentine has never led a team to a division
title, and this season the wheels are wobbling on the Mets, a team
with the fifth-highest payroll in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The latest embarrassing moment came Friday when it was reported
that two Mets, Bobby Bonilla and Brian McRae, were placed on
irrevocable waivers. Both players were in the starting lineup, and
McRae even homered. What bothered both McRae and Bonilla was that
they found out about the move as they arrived at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad way to find out about something like that,''
McRae said. ``Especially just before the series starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine once again found himself in a difficult position and
before the game asked reporters, in typical sarcastic fashion, what
he might say to McRae and Bonilla to smooth ruffled feathers.
``What do you say: `It wasn't me, it was him?' It's not going to be
an easy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Add McRae and Bonilla to a growing list of players Valentine has
had nasty snits with: Todd Hundley, Pete Harnisch, Lance Johnson.
But if the Knicks have proved anything this season, it is that
winning makes blemishes seem acceptable, if not beautiful. A sea of
sins will be forgiven when you win or are perceived as a winner.
This is where Valentine runs into problems. There is a sense he may
have hit his ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine spent a career trying to get past being ``OK'' as a
player _ he was never the same after he broke his leg _ and as a
manager. As a manager his record is barely .500. What might may
define Valentine's career is the end of last season, when the Mets,
needing one or two victories to capture a wild-card berth, lost all
five games. Valentine could not find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a high-priced team. Last winter Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager, said, ``We put together a wish list and were
able to get everyone on it.'' Is this an echo of 1992? The Mets
slumped in 1991, and in the winter they acquired big-name veteran
players through trades and free agency. That summer, the Mets were
miserable. They had the highest payroll in the game but finished 18
games under .500 and 24 games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla had a nightmare of a first run in New York in 1992; this
week the Mets all but tried to give him away. Will the recent moves
backfire as they did seven seasons ago?
</P>
<P>
   Back then the Mets put big names together without thinking
chemistry. They became the worst team money could buy: David Cone
was sent away; Bonilla wound up hitting .249 and constantly feuded
with the news media. And 1993 was worse.
</P>
<P>
   But give Valentine some credit: He took over in 1997 and turned
the Mets around. Now the payroll is between $65 million and $70
million _ the Yankees' is $84 million. Valentine's Achilles' heel
has been a contentious personality: starting messes when there were
none, inciting feuds rather than quelling them, circumventing
rather than facing up and expressing contrition when he gets
caught.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre came back from cancer surgery and the Yankees were
unsettled, he soothed nervous spirits and righted the listing ship.
What would Valentine do with this Yankees roster? You shudder to
think.
</P>
<P>
   Last night someone asked Valentine if he felt he had ``fences to
mend.''
</P>
<P>
   With McRae and Bonilla, Valentine didn't waver. ``When you're a
professional guy and you're making a salary and you're getting paid
to play and something happens that doesn't affect your job today, I
think you still got to do your job,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Bonilla's physical condition, Valentine said
the outfielder was looking better, but added, ``I'm just trying to
determine if better is good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what the Mets must eventually decide about
Valentine. &QL;

 &HT;    16-K job by Martinez
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Against the best pitcher in the majors right now, and
one of the best teams in the American League, the Braves needed Tom
Glavine at his best Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place he hasn't been all season, and wasn't going to find
even in the comfort of his home state with 80 family and friends
watching at Fenway Park. Not against Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 16 and won his ninth consecutive decision as
the Boston Red Sox took the first game of this interleague series
5-1, and it didn't seem that close.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (11-1) pitched a three-hitter and lowered his
major-league best ERA to 1.91 while dominating Braves hitters like
they haven't been since losing to Randy Johnson in April.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out nine of the first 19 batters he faced. Both
Andruw Jones and Randall Simon were caught swinging at pitches up
around eye level. Martinez humored the Braves by allowing a runner
to take third base in the second and fifth innings, but they
advanced no further. Andruw Jones was on third base with nobody out
in the fifth inning, but was left there as Simon and Gerald
Williams struck out and Walt Weiss popped up to short to cheers of
``Pedro, Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   The chants started up again at the end of the next inning after
Martinez collected his 10th strikeout, the third by Braves cleanup
hitter Brian Jordan. Martinez has hit double-digits in strikeouts
in eight of his 12 starts this season. Three of the four times he
missed, he had nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got a little redemption with a solo home run from
Ryan Klesko in the seventh inning, but it only had to travel an
estimated 310 feet before clearing the right field wall just inside
the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   While Martinez rolled to his 11th win, Glavine was on his way to
his seventh loss, one more than he had all last season. He survived
the first inning by allowing two runs. Four times he faced batters
with the bases loaded and had to feel good about giving up only two
runs, which he did on consecutive two-strike hits to left field by
Troy O'Leary and Damon Buford.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Slow but Steady, Williams-Sonoma Finally Goes Online  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The preparation of Williams-Sonoma Inc.'s Web site has been more
like that of a slow-cooking roast than a three-minute egg.
<P>
   Depending on who you ask, the kitchenware retailer's late entry
to e-commerce _ its first major site was launched just this week _
could be a benefit or a disadvantage. But if the gambit proves
successful, it could debunk the conventional wisdom that the
earliest e-commerce entrants will shut out the arrivistes.
</P>
<P>
   The early reviews are positive. By waiting, Williams-Sonoma got
its site right the first time rather than starting with a primitive
storefront and improving it through successive overhauls, said Kate
Delhagen, an analyst with Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.1, I'd say better late than never and No.2, I'd say maybe
it's better because they're late,'' said Delhagen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Back in 1994 and 1995, when pioneering retailers like Land's
End were launching first-generation sites, San Francisco-based
Williams-Sonoma was battling bugs in the computer systems that
support its brick-and-mortar stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of glitches at a new distribution center in Tennessee,
stock outages were common and holiday catalog shoppers were finding
the wrong gifts on their doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problems were corrected by mid-1996, but the
company's stock and profits had taken a beating. On top of that, a
Williams-Sonoma home page on Time-Warner's ill-fated Pathfinder
mall was a disappointment and was dropped quickly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma's management is inherently conservative,
particularly in contrast with wild and woolly Web-only companies.
Couple that tendency with the mid-1990s computer headaches, and the
result was predictable: Executives moved cautiously in setting up
their first full-scale e-commerce site.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Williams-Sonoma launched a bridal registry with some
43,000 registrants at  &LR; www.wswedding.com.  &LR; This fall it will add an
online Williams-Sonoma store that eventually will include features
like a database of 8,000 recipes and printable grocery lists.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the company will open either a bridal registry
or general e-commerce site for Pottery Barn, its home furnishings
chain, and the second Pottery Barn site will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Connolly, executive vice president of Williams-Sonoma,
acknowledges his company is late to the game, but insists that's
all to the good because of improvements in Web technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt from the beginning we had to operate at a higher
standard,'' Connolly said. ``We spent a lot of time on this because
it's important that customers have the same kind of experience on
the Net that they have in our stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma has spent recent years ironing out wrinkles in
its existing computer and telecom systems, strengthening its
financial position in the wake of the mid-1990s problems and
plotting its Web strategy, Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While it may have lost some sales over the years,
Williams-Sonoma avoided the cost of launching and then remodeling
its site. And it didn't alienate customers with a clumsy effort
that didn't work well, Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As to whether a site launched in mid-1999 can still attract
eyeballs, the answer seems to be yes. In its first week, sales on
wswedding.com were running at triple the rate of toll-free
telephone orders. And there were no significant glitches, Connolly
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams-Sonoma contacted people who had signed up for the
registry in stores, only 3 percent asked that their gift lists not
be posted.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the registry, there seems to be plenty of demand on
the Web for a Williams-Sonoma store. A small site slapped up in
December with 25 holiday gift items generated twice as many sales
as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday site was created to convince the company's last
foot-draggers that e-commerce should be a priority. ``That sort of
testing is already a couple of years out of date,'' noted a local
Web developer who is familiar with Williams-Sonoma's cyber efforts.
He described the company as having ``a special kind of
conservativism you'll see in the old-guard type of businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   By launching its site now, Williams-Sonoma is just squeaking
under the e-commerce wire, said Delhagen. ``If you miss the fourth
quarter of 1999, you're pretty much toast because this is going to
be another big learning season,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Williams-Sonoma will begin promoting the site with
in-store signs and ads in its catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma moved quickly to set up wswedding.com after
making the final decision to proceed with it late last year. Soon
90 people were involved, half Williams-Sonoma employees and half
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's USWeb/CKS was assigned the complicated task of
linking the Web site to the rest of Williams-Sonoma's computer
systems, from the accounting department to the Tennessee warehouse;
San Francisco's Adjacency helped design the graphics; and Prophet
Brand Strategy, also of San Francisco, coordinated the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Because Williams-Sonoma went to the trouble and expense of
integrating the site into its existing systems, it can update
registries everywhere _ in stores, in the call centers that handle
catalog orders and on the Web _ within minutes after a gift is
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Web site is tied into Williams-Sonoma's inventory
database, shoppers are told whether a requested item is in stock
when they place an order. Many sites, including that of rival Crate
&AMP; Barrel, accept orders and then send an e-mail message hours or
days later if the item is not in stock. (Crate &AMP; Barrel currently
operates an online store and is launching its Web registry this
summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Such services are ``absolutely critical,'' Delhagen said. ``This
will put more pressure on Macy's and Crate &AMP; Barrel to get their
registries up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishnan Menon, a partner with USWeb/CKS, estimates that only 10
to 15 percent of brick-and-mortar retailers' Web sites have fully
integrated systems. Instead, most rely on staffers to bridge the
connection by updating Web registries and checking inventories.
</P>
<P>
   John Nicolai, an e-commerce consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young in San
Francisco, said he found the site unusually attractive, easy to
use, ``and it has a lot of good information.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly refused to divulge how much Williams-Sonoma spent to
set up the site, but the developer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, estimated it at $3 million to $10 million.

NATO AND RUSSIA WORK TO FILL IN PACT'S DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ American leaders and NATO officials said
Friday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had yet to take
concrete steps to back up the peace accord for Kosovo and warned
that the deal could still slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is not over,'' Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy
secretary of state, said Friday, before meeting with President
Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, who acted as an envoy for NATO.
``Trust does not belong in the vocabulary,'' Talbott remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their caveats, American and Finnish diplomats
declared themselves genuinely optimistic and indeed surprised by
Milosevic's abrupt turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Chernomyrdin, representing Russia in the negotiations,
canceled plans for a meeting Friday with Talbott and Ahtisaari in
Helsinki and flew back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from all three countries said Chernomyrdin changed his
plans in order to shore up political support for the deal in
Moscow. Russian and American officials remain at odds over at least
one important aspect of the plan _ the extent to which Russian
peacekeeping troops in Yugoslavia would be under NATO authority.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said Milosevic must now come up with concrete measures
to make good on his pledge, in particular how he plans to
accommodate international troops in Kosovo with NATO in a ``core''
role.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Yugoslav leaders plan to meet on Saturday on the
Macedonian border with Yugoslavia, the first effort to establish
what Talbott called ``military-to-military'' contacts. Talbott said
such military talks appeared Friday to be the best approach.
``That's where the action is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials must still work out at least one major issue
with the Russians. Russia adamantly objects to the idea of putting
its troops under NATO control, since NATO was founded as an
anti-Soviet military alliance and Russia's post-communist leaders
are deeply unhappy about NATO's expansion into central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders badly want to retain Russian support in dealing
with Milosevic, and diplomats on all sides say that Chernomyrdin's
agreement with NATO was crucial to Milosevic's consent to the deal
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American officials plainly hope to smooth their way around the
issue by creating a force that would be dominated by NATO yet not
be an official NATO enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a precedent for Russian government participation in
an international peacekeeping operation that does not have NATO in
the name,'' Talbott said. ``We did in Bosnia and I think we can do
it again in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari pursued a diplomatic effort for much of the past
month, though he studiously kept himself out of the spotlight until
just a few days ago. Even after leaving Belgrade, the Yugoslav
capital, with the new promises from Milosevic, Ahtisaari has let
others do most of the talking.
</P>
<P>
   American officials went out of their way Friday to praise
Ahtisaari's efforts. Talbott called him one of the ``heroes'' of
the last few days and said he had struck ``exactly the right note''
in conveying the proposal to Belgrade.

 _ SF CHRON  
 AT&AMP;T Ordered to Open Cable Line Access  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a groundbreaking decision that could give consumers more choices
and lower prices for high-speed Internet access, a federal judge in
Portland has ruled that AT&AMP;T must open its cable lines in that city
to competitors such as America Online and other Internet service
providers.
<P>
   The ruling is significant for San Francisco and other cities,
which have been closely watching the Portland case and may model
their own policies based on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling survives appeals, it could set a nationwide
precedent, allowing customers to get high-speed Internet access via
cable TV from several providers, not just the company that owns the
cable.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a blow to AT&AMP;T, which has been trying to keep
control of the cable TV lines it inherited when it bought TCI
Cable &UR;  &LR; earlier this year. The decision is the first to chip away at
AT&AMP;T's growing cable empire, which will be the nation's No.1 cable
company if its planned purchase of MediaOne Group goes through.
</P>
<P>
   It is also damaging to Redwood City's Excite AtHome, the
high-flying Internet company. AT&AMP;T owns 40 percent of Excite AtHome
and controls 70 percent of its board votes.
</P>
<P>
   Excite AtHome, which offers consumers a super-fast way to surf
the Internet via cable TV lines, would have to share its
proprietary lines with other ISPs like AOL and Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sent Excite AtHome's stock tumbling by $10.75 to
$94.50 yesterday. AT&AMP;T shares slipped 88 cents to $53.38, while AOL
rose $12 to $117.75.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials called the decision ``inexplicable'' and said it
would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe strongly in the merits of our legal
arguments,'' said Mark Rosenblum, AT&AMP;T vice president. ``AT&AMP;T
raised numerous substantial challenges. ... This decision can only
have the potential to delay and reduce the new services that
companies like AT&AMP;T will be able to offer them.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who pressed for AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines said the
decision is a win for consumers and one that may be hard to
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is potentially very far-reaching because many
cities ... have been waiting to see what the Portland court does,''
said John Raposa, assistant general counsel for GTE Corp. ``What
this means is that consumers can have a choice of ISPs and won't be
locked into AT&AMP;T's affiliate, Excite AtHome.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by AT&AMP;T and TCI Cable
against the city of Portland. &UR;  &LR; When AT&AMP;T bought TCI, it had to
apply for a ``transfer of control'' of TCI's cable TV franchises in
each city where TCI operates.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of approving the franchise transfer in Portland,
officials there wanted to force AT&AMP;T to lease its cable lines to
competitors so they could offer phone, video and high-speed
Internet access. Portland officials argued that without ``open
access,'' TCI customers would have only one choice for high-speed
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and TCI sued Portland, saying cities had no right to
require open access as a condition of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, U.S. District Judge Owen Panner disagreed, saying
cable regulators in Portland can require open access as a condition
of AT&AMP;T's $55 billion purchase of TCI Cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open access requirement is within the authority of the
city and county to protect competition,'' Panner wrote in his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the decision will be hard to challenge
given AT&AMP;T's dominance in the cable market. If it buys Denver-based
MediaOne, it will be the nation's No.1 cable company with more than
16 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that AT&AMP;T has a dominant position in the cable industry,
if they don't open their networks to competitors, everyone loses,''
said Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. ``With
size comes responsibility. Had they remained a 20 percent market
share player, it would have been an issue in only those markets,
but if they're a 60 percent market share player and they're keeping
AOL and other ISPs out of the competitive marketplace for those
high-speed services, it will harm competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if Bay Area customers want to connect to the Internet
via cable TV lines, they have to go through Excite AtHome. The
service is available in about 40 Bay Area communities for $40 a
month, on top of the fee for cable TV service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acting as a fast ISP, Excite AtHome also offers
content, e-mail and other services _ putting it in direct
competition with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   To fight back, AOL wants to let its customers access its content
via cable modems, which are about 100 times faster than traditional
dial-up modems. Earlier this year, AOL tried to buy MediaOne so it
could get access to cable lines, but eventually dropped out of the
bidding after AT&AMP;T increased its offer. The only other way to
access cable lines is to lease them from the provider, and AT&AMP;T has
been reluctant to lease its lines to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's ruling would change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What open access would mean is just as you can now use your
phone line to dial any ISP, you'd be able to use your cable modem
to connect to any ISP,'' said Katie Roper, acting executive
director of the Bay Area Open Access Coalition. ``You wouldn't be
restricted to the ISP that is affiliated with the cable provider,
in this case Excite AtHome.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ISPs also are signing agreements with phone companies to
offer a fast Internet service called digital subscriber line, but
DSL is still &LR; not as fast as a cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers warned that yesterday's decision could
have a ``chilling effect'' on AT&AMP;T's plans to upgrade TCI's cable
systems to handle high-speed access. If AT&AMP;T has to share its cable
lines _ and thus give up market share _ the company might be
reluctant to upgrade quickly, said Vince Tobkin, who follows
telecommunications for consulting firm Bain &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may chill AT&AMP;T's interest in investing capital to upgrade
its network and it could have the perverse effect of slowing down
high-speed access,'' Tobkin said. ``For any community that does
this, they can be sure they'll be moved to the back of the list for
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagreed, saying AT&AMP;T bought TCI so it could offer
phone and Internet access to customers and is not likely to upset
shareholders by backing away from that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T spent a fortune to buy TCI and in order to make it work,
they have to upgrade their cable. If they don't, shareholders could
revolt,'' said Kagan, the telecommunications analyst.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6)  
 (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE, Texas _ Crossing a shady creek bed in South Texas
nearly 150 years ago _ in the middle of what many people called the
Desert of the Dead _ Captain Richard King had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a steamboat pilot with a thriving business on
the Rio Grande, Captain King saw an opportunity to raise cattle on
the parched, untamed land that surrounded him. He bought 15,500
acres, about 20 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, from a land
grant known as Rincon de Santa Gertrudis. And he began carving out
a ranching enterprise that would become an American legend.
</P>
<P>
   His descendants built on his dream, creating one of the largest
ranches in the country, with 825,000 acres in Texas and operations
around the world. Over the years, family members developed the
Santa Gertrudis, the first new breed of cattle to be produced in
the United States; advanced new methods of clearing brush;
perfected the American quarter horse (not to mention breeding a
line of thoroughbreds that included Assault, a Triple Crown winner
in the 1940s), and refined a system of land management and
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as the cattle business has become less
profitable and the family has grown larger and more costly to
support, the vision seems to have blurred. Many think it faded
altogether when the last King descendant to work the ranch, Stephen
J. (Tio) Kleberg, 53, was dismissed in April 1998 by the
professional manager brought in three years earlier to lead the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, at least eight key employees have quit or
been dismissed. At a place where employees have been well tended
for generations, managers say they feel uncertain about their
future, with their work scrutinized and their decisions
second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe these changes have to happen,'' said Bill Baxter, a
computer technology specialist at the ranch for 17 years until he
resigned in November, dissatisfied after Kleberg's departure. ``I
just wonder if there's a good way to do that without destroying the
legacy. It's sad to see the traditions die.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tradition has been under assault at King Ranch for
years, maybe decades. Captain King's rule _ the guiding principle
of many of the white settlers of Texas _ was that bigger was
better. When he died, in 1885, the ranch had grown to more than
600,000 acres. It now consists of four units sprawled across five
counties, one of them named for his Kleberg descendants.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he imported the residents of an entire Mexican
village to work his cattle; the children of these kinenos, as they
became known, were educated on the ranch, and generations were
guaranteed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional ranching activities have been a diminishing part
of King Ranch's business, as Americans have reduced their
consumption of beef and as more profitable uses have been found for
the land, from oil drilling to quail hunting to tourism. And a
portfolio of nonranch holdings has been developed to generate the
dividends demanded by the 84 family shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jack Hunt, who has an MBA from Harvard and a background in
agribusiness, took over as chief executive and president in May
1995, he has sold the ranch's lumber operations, a cotton warehouse
in Galveston and a horse farm in Kentucky. He terminated some
farming leases in Arizona. The ranch is now looking to merge or
sell King Ranch Energy, an oil and gas company.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, King Ranch has bought a 5 percent stake in
Agraquest, a Davis, Calif., company that makes natural pest
controls for crops. Last year, the company led a consortium,
Consolidated Citrus, in the acquisition of Turner Foods, one of
Florida's largest citrus growers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is privately held, does not divulge financial
information about its operations. But people close to it have said
that in a good year, pretax profit from cattle can range from $1
million to $3 million. Hunting, they say, can bring in $3 million a
year; sod, $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 article in Texas Monthly magazine quoted ``company
insiders'' as saying that overall revenues were $183 million in
1994, up from about $100 million in the late 1980s. The company has
some 600 employees globally, about 160 of them working the Texas
ranch land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are very interested in continuing to grow and
provide and meet the expectations of the shareholders,'' said Hunt,
a reserved man who runs King Ranch from the company's office in
Houston. ``At the same time, we're absolutely committed to operate
and maintain the South Texas property.''
</P>
<P>
   The family says that it, too, is committed to the ranch and that
the best way to assure its future is by securing its viability.
</P>
<P>
   Captain King's descendants will gather in South Texas this week
for their annual summer camp and shareholders meeting, a time when
family members get reacquainted with the land and one another. They
also consider the ranch's future _ and with each passing year, that
seems to become more of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch has struggled to support itself since 1977, when the
shareholders laid claim to 75 percent of the royalties coming from
gas and oil reserves on the ranch. That cash flow had given the
ranching operations breathing room, and once it was gone, many
operations were deemed unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   The thoroughbred racehorses were put up for sale, as were most
of the overseas ranches. Only a 50,000-acre ranch in Brazil
remains, run by Kleberg's son Chris, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate management at the ranch predated Jack Hunt. In 1988,
seeing a need to diversify, the family hired Darwin E. Smith, the
chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, the paper maker, as
its first outside chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted only a year, and was replaced by an oil executive,
Roger Jarvis. During their tenure, the ranch added a citrus grove
and sod farm in Florida, an alfalfa hay farm in Arizona and a
cluster of offshore oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While the family deferred, for the most part, to its
professional managers, Tio Kleberg ran the ranching operations. A
fifth-generation descendant of Captain King, with a bushy red
mustache and a penchant for chewing cigars, he had grown up on the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the original kinenos gave him his nickname, which
means uncle in Spanish, because they saw him as cut from the same
cloth as his uncle Robert J. Kleberg Jr., who led the ranch for
more than 50 years, helping to save it in the 1930s when an estate
tax bill posed a mortal threat.
</P>
<P>
   Tio Kleberg went to work here full time in 1971, when he was 25,
after serving in the Army. ``I was given a car and a set of ranch
keys, and they said, `Go to work','' he recalled. ``All I ever
wanted to do was cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already familiar with cattle, from his childhood on the ranch,
he set out to master other aspects of the operations:
brush-clearing, fence-building, the location of windmills. He
learned every square inch of the land and participated in every
roundup, happiest when he was out working the ranch rather than
sitting in an office minding the books.

 KINGSVILLE, Texas: the books.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1977, Kleberg was head of ranching operations. But the ranch
was already unprofitable, he said, and land management was becoming
an increasingly important part of the business. He oversaw a shift
from cattle to fostering wildlife development, for everything from
hunting to bird watching, and expanded farming operations on parts
of the ranch. Under his stewardship, the ranch brought in experts
on cattle fertility and continued to build on the Santa Gertrudis,
breeding them to be more productive.
</P>
<P>
   People who know both Tio Kleberg and Jack Hunt, the
Harvard-trained chief executive, are not surprised that they
clashed. Both are said to be strong-willed, and each had a
well-cultivated sense of how a ranch should be managed. Often,
those visions conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Ivy League credentials, Hunt came to Texas
with more than 20 years of experience in agribusiness _ 14 of them
at the 270,000-acre Tejon Ranch in Southern California, long
controlled by the Chandler family, owners of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Their final confrontation, Kleberg said, came after he was asked
to examine whether the ranch's agricultural operations _ sod, cane
and citrus in Florida and cotton and sorghum in Texas _ should be
split from the ranching operations.
</P>
<P>
   After talking to the head of the Florida business, Kleberg
concluded that the time wasn't right. The man had a young family,
he explained, and a reorganization would require him to travel much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, Kleberg said, he realized that his opinion wasn't
being sought, that he was being told to split the operations.
Shortly after reporting his findings, Kleberg said, he was called
to a meeting with Hunt and the chairman of the ranch board, Abraham
Zeleznik, a psychoanalyst who is professor emeritus at Harvard.
They asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt plays down the resignation, noting that Kleberg joined the
board of directors of the company at the time and still lives on
the ranch. Keeping Kleberg involved ``was an important element of
the move,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kleberg's removal from the day-to-day operations
unleashed some doubt about the stability of employment at King
Ranch, a worry foreign to a company in which jobs have remained in
families _ both of Kings and kinenos _ for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight people who have departed in the last year were
several ranch managers and Hunt's own secretary, who had been with
the company about nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said that most of the people who left were pursuing better
job opportunities. But the handful who were willing to discuss
their departures described feeling under constant scrutiny, and
they expressed frustration at what they saw as a lack of direction
in King Ranch's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, too, felt the sting. ``The best beating heart they
had is gone,'' said Gus T. Canales, whose family was ranching here
before Captain King put down roots in the area, speaking of
Kleberg. ``It's hard for those of us who have grown up with this
life style. We have more emotional ties, and maybe not so
economically feasible feelings. But I think that the next
generation should give us a lot of credit for trying to change as
fast was we can and still keep the affection for the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the romance of the West, what is happening at the
King Ranch doesn't seem that different from a typical story of the
corporate world: New management comes in and scrutinizes the
operation for ways to make it more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of King Ranch, that means asking questions like:
What is the optimal mix of ranching and hunting? What is the best
kind of feed grass? Should helicopters be brought in at $275 a day
for rounding up cattle, or is the job best done the old-fashioned
way, on horseback?
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't like we're going to change the world,'' said Paul C.
Genho, who was hired away from the Mormon Church's 300,000-acre
Deseret Ranch of Florida to head King Ranch's ranch and livestock
operations after Kleberg's resignation. ``It's going to be small,
gradual changes.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, he stopped at a field where men were
setting fence posts for a new weaning lot. The lot would be near
grain bins, to eliminate the 12-mile round trip previously
required, saving as much as $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Another change, Genho said, involved the ranch's developing a
mineral supplement for cattle and producing it through outside
contractors, for half as much as a commercially produced supplement
had cost.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, Genho, who at Brigham Young University earned
a doctorate in animal science with a specialty in cattle
reproduction, continues to work on cross-breeding the Santa
Gertrudis to develop cattle with higher weaning weights and greater
growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   He also hires consultants to advise him on maintaining the most
productive mix of bush and grazing land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a big ranch can't be intuitive,'' he said, glancing
over acre after acre of scrub land.
</P>
<P>
   A knowledgeable man with a good sense of humor, Genho, 57, takes
a more hierarchical approach than his predecessor to running the
ranch. Just a handful of managers report directly to him, compared
with the dozen or so who reported to Kleberg. Those who have left
the ranch since his arrival, he said, represent a mere 2 percent
turnover rate.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have stayed, he has introduced up-to-date
incentive programs. For example, a cowboy, likely to be making
around $20,000 a year, can make an additional 10 percent if he does
three things: build three miles of fence, help cut production costs
and get his high school equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Genho's agenda is getting back to some traditional ways
of working cattle _ putting in more time on horses and spending
less money on the helicopters that have become popular in recent
years for herding.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the observation by former employees that people were
feeling nervous about their jobs, Genho said, ``I can understand
people's concern, but there's no intent to do anything but to treat
those people right.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts remain, however, about the ranch's future course. With
the arrival of Genho, a Mormon and 17-year veteran of the church's
Florida ranch, came rumors that the Utah church was positioning
itself to buy King Ranch, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's totally ridiculous,'' Genho said.
</P>
<P>
   Local cattlemen, too, say they see nothing to the rumor. But in
the next breath, they'll tell you they never expected to see a day
that a Kleberg wasn't running the ranch, either.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on King Ranch affect the entire Texas cattle
industry. Cattlemen have stabilized American beef consumption after
years of decline and have stepped up their search for export
markets. But cattle ranching remains a low-margin business.

 KINGSVILLE, Texas: margin business.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The last several years, it's been extremely difficult in some
years to make a profit, and in some years we don't make a profit,''
said Hilmar G. Moore, who serves on the King Ranch board of
directors and is himself a fifth-generation rancher in Fort Bend
County, just outside Houston. ``You have to run a much leaner,
meaner operation.''
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just the cattle; ranchers also need to get more out
of their land. Indeed, many ranchers view themselves more as land
managers _ on the prowl for profitable, sustainable uses of their
acreage _ than as cattlemen.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for the most part, that has meant hunting.
</P>
<P>
   King Ranch, historically rather secretive about its operations,
came relatively late to the business of marketing its land as an
attraction. But in the last decade, it has embraced the notion,
leasing more than 500,000 acres to hunters at $6 to $12 an acre
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, hunters lease the land directly. Outfitters also
work in conjunction with the ranch to put together organized hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of hunters: those who have hunted on King
Ranch and those who want to hunt on King Ranch,'' said Luther
Young, an outfitter who has a contract to guide groups of quail
hunters on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, he said, are willing to pay as much as $850 a day for
the privilege. For that fee, they must bring a gun, shells and an
appetite; he provides lodging and gourmet meals at his
bed-and-breakfast nearby, as well as transportation and dogs. The
general stay is three days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the hunters, some 50,000 people visit the ranch every
year, most of them for scheduled tours of the property, who pay $7
for each adult and $2.50 per child; others for bird watching or
wildlife tours. The company is exploring additional ways to use its
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me 25 years ago King Ranch would be hosting bird
watching and hosting tours, I'd say you've got to be kidding,''
said Steve Munday, vice president of the Southwest Texas Cattle
Raisers Association. ``But that's using their resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the bleachers of the rodeo arena at King Ranch,
Jamene Toelkes reminisced as she watched Adan Alvarez put cattle in
chutes for roping practice, his 4-year-old daughter, Clarissa, in
the saddle in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved here 20 years ago, we could have survived a
holocaust right out here,'' said Mrs. Toelkes, whose husband is the
veterinarian at the ranch. There were four commissaries, one in
each of the ranch's four units, to serve the needs of the hundreds
of people who lived on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while some 100 people still call the ranch home _ and
more than 130 children from the ranch and neighboring Kingsville
attend a school on the property _ many of the employees commute to
work; the commissaries have all closed.
</P>
<P>
   On her little finger next to her wedding band, Mrs. Toelkes,
whose family came to the ranch from Abilene, Texas, in 1978, wears
a ring made from some of the diamonds her husband received, on tie
tacks, for his 20 years of service. He gave each of his sons _
Philip, 34, and Dell, 33 _ a diamond-studded tie tack, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Toelkes, who works in the ranch museum, said her husband
told them: ``When we made the commitment to go to South Texas, we
all became a part of King Ranch history.''
</P>
<P>
   Can that heritage be preserved? ``My children, neither ever
wanted to be cowboys,'' she said. ``Their tastes were too
expensive.'' Dell is a land developer in Colorado City, Texas, and
Philip is a partner in an engineering firm in Brentwood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But watching Alvarez, a fifth-generation ranch resident, and his
daughter, Mrs. Toelkes nonetheless saw something that she hopes
will never die. ``This is what King Ranch is all about _ the old
teaching the young,'' she said as Clarissa guided her horse through
the arena. ``It's in her genes. It's horse heritage. Generations
before her did this.''
</P>
<P>
   And the generations that come _ what will they make of King
Ranch? Ms. Toelkes paused, then came up with a knowing answer. ``It
will be,'' she said, ``what the shareholders want it to be.''

 _ SF CHRON   Governor Davis to Replace PUC Reps 
 &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Two interim commissioners appointed just before Thursday's Public
Utilities Commission meeting apparently won't be back for next
Thursday's meeting, according to a spokesman for Governor Gray
Davis.
<P>
   ``They have not been unappointed quite yet, but they will be
shortly,'' said Davis press secretary Michael Bustamante.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic duo that practically parachuted into Thursday's PUC
meeting were Loretta Lynch, director of the governor's Office of
Planning and Research, and Tal Finney, the governor's director of
policy. Both had been sworn in that morning to the $100,000-a-year
positions that normally carry six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   PUC President Richard Bilas said he was alerted new
commissioners were coming only an hour before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bilas said he knew they were temporary, but assumed they'd be
around longer than a day or two. After all, Steve Jobs has been
Apple Computer's interim CEO for almost two years now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We've got computers, offices, secretaries, cars and advisers
for them. Everything,'' Bilas said.
</P>
<P>
   The quick decommissioning of the commissioners seems to support
speculation that the two Davis aides had been appointed merely to
delay three crucial votes scheduled for Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The current rumor is that Davis will have permanent replacements
ready for the PUC's next meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The name that pops up most often is Southern Californian Carl
Wood, a national representative for the Utility Workers Union of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible this commissioner-du-jour drama was a stop-gap
measure and he has permanent members in the wings,'' said Nettie
Hoge, director of the consumer group, The Utility Reform Network.
``It's the only explanation that makes any sense. Otherwise, what
was accomplished?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that Davis has plugged holes with
temporary appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Finney has been a gubernatorial ``temp'' on four previous
occasions, dispatched to short stints at the Department of Social
Services, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the Managed Risk
Medical Board and the California Earthquake Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Until Davis took office, such temporary appointments were almost
unprecedented in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last times it happened was two decades ago, when
then-Governror Jerry Brown appointed an aide named Gray Davis to a
temporary stint on the California Horse Racing Board to settle a
beef with the Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   It's less clear what the purpose of this week's PUC appointments
may have been. The pair's first, and perhaps only, act was to ask
that the full commission delay votes on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   One decision could have raised the cost of Internet access for
consumers by changing the way phone companies pay each other for
completing each other's calls.
</P>
<P>
   Another would have let electric utilities earn as much as an
11.6 percent profit on regulated activities. Consumer advocates
have favored a lower profit cap, something closer to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final measure would establish the PUC's position on a bill
that would change it governance structure. One thing the bill would
do is allow the PUC's president to be picked by the governor _ not
by peer selection.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Finney nor Lynch returned phone calls yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly understood their assignments were interim, but
neither seemed to know how brief the tenure was to be.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday's meeting, each gathered up armloads of
materials which they said they were going to read over the weekend
in preparation for next week's PUC meeting.

JET CO-PILOT GIVES ACCOUNT CONTRADICTING CRASH DATA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Texas)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ In his first interview with federal safety
officials since the crash of a jet in Little Rock, Ark., the
plane's first officer, Michael Origel, Friday said that he had felt
the airplane hydroplane over the rain-slicked runway just before it
crashed early Wednesday, killing nine people.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, George
Black Jr., said that physical evidence contradicted Origel's
recollection and that additional interviews would be necessary to
resolve the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   Origel, who suffered a broken leg in the crash and was
interviewed in his hospital room, had been unable to meet with
investigators, who considered his account of the crash crucial to
establishing what happened at the end of Flight 1420.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts, asked about Black's statement on the
discrepancies between the first officer's memory and the physical
evidence, said that differences or contradictions between
recollection and data were not unusual. Black also noted Friday
that Origel has been receiving medication which could have affected
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing, Black said that Origel had confirmed that the
flight captain, Richard Buschmann, was at the controls of the
aircraft when it crashed, and that control tower personnel at
Little Rock National Airport had provided the cockpit crew with all
relevant weather information.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation gained momentum Friday, several hundred
relatives and friends of the nine people who died aboard the
American Airlines jet joined some of the survivors of the accident
at a brief and tearful memorial ceremony 100 yards from the
wreckage of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the worst in the history of Little Rock
National Airport and the first fatal commercial airline accident in
the United States in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann, 48, of Napierville, Ill., was killed, leaving Origel,
of Redondo Beach, Calif., as a crucial source of information.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of the victims, escorted by a phalanx of
police motorcycles, were driven to the scene in seven chartered
buses by the authorities who said they hoped the experience would
help the survivors, emotionally, deal with the accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of the jagged wreckage, resting fewer than a 100
yards from the Arkansas River on the north edge of the airport, was
plainly unsettling to many of the mourners, most of whom held red
roses distributed at the scene. ``I heard him scream but I couldn't
see him. The smoke was too thick. I couldn't get to him. I could
only hear him scream,'' said Kevin Mergel, his voice cracking,
remembering the final moments of his close friend, James Harrison,
21, of Paragould, Ark. Both were members of the Ouachita Baptist
University choir at nearby Arkadelphia who had been returning from
a European tour. Harrison was not among the 136 other people aboard
Flight 1420 who were able to escape the crash and the flames that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The eight other deaths included five members of a group from
Russellville, Ark., who had just ended a tour of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for my father,'' said Ray Toler Jr., a California man
whose father, Ray Sr., of College Station, Tex., was recovering
from broken bones suffered in the crash and unable to attend the
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want these for my dad,'' the younger Toler said as he
carefully snapped photographs of the wreckage. ``If he chooses to
see what he managed to escape from that night, he'll at least have
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Toler's father was among the 80 people who were admitted to
seven metropolitan Little Rock hospitals following the accident.
Several other passengers were treated for less serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the first lawsuit coming out of the crash was filed in
the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, in Little Rock. The suit said
Darrell D. Arnold of Lonoke County, Ark., a passenger aboard the
jet, had suffered ``great physical and mental pain and anguish''
and sought unspecified damages from American Airlines, which the
lawsuit accused of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, and an accompanying press release by the plaintiff's
lawyer, Peter Miller of Little Rock, charged that the airplane's
crew should not have tried a landing ``in weather conditions when a
prudent airline pilot and crew would not have attempted to land''
and for allegedly failing to properly supervise the evacuation of
the passengers after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420 _ a twin-engine MD-80 from Dallas _ skidded out of
control seconds after landing early Wednesday. The flight data
recorder indicated the plane made a successful initial touchdown,
then abruptly veered right, then left, before continuing along the
7,200 feet of Runway 4 Right, ultimately smashing into a large
steel standard supporting the airport's approach lights. The impact
split the jet near its midsection, and many of the 136 surviving
passengers and crew used the gaping hole as an escape route.

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ One couldn't wait to return to childhood
friends in her tranquil hometown. Another planned to meet an
Internet friend for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Couch and Debra Ann Sattari didn't know each
other, but they shared a goal of getting to Little Rock on American
Airlines Flight 1420.
</P>
<P>
   Neither made it.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the nine people killed when the jetliner crashed
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Couch, 68, stunned her hometown of Havana, Ark., a
farming community with a population of 350. She was on the flight
with a group of widows and older couples returning from London.
</P>
<P>
   Five tour group members from the nearby town of Russellville
also perished in the fiery crash.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths came just a month after three other Russellville
residents _ Jim and Floye Patterson and their daughter, Jennifer _
died when an amphibious tourist craft sank on Lake Hamilton near
Hot Springs, the ``Arkansas Democrat-Gazette'' reported.
</P>
<P>
   Couch loved animals and had nine cats and a dog. A mother of
three adult children, she had a daily routine that began with a
stop at the local post office.
</P>
<P>
   Then she would head to the Guinn McBride country store and later
take a 2-mile walk with friends before an evening visit with
members of the Active Extensions Homemakers Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to believe what happened,'' said Norman Jones,
Havana's postmaster. ``There's an empty place in my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Couch often exchanged friendly ribbing with him and
the postal carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, her mother was the postmaster,'' he said. ``I think
that's why she was so comfortable coming here every day. ... Later,
her mother and father ran the town's bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gillespie, who had known Couch since the seventh grade,
said the two were like sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to love the (University of Arkansas) Razorbacks,''
Gillespie said, laughing. ``She couldn't watch it if the game was
too close. She'd call me to find out who won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said she won't question why the tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In California on Friday, Victoria Cutchens answered the
telephone in a voice heavy with grief. But as she reminisced about
her best friend, Sattari, she broke into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to describe Debra is that she was all heart,''
said Cutchens, whose home is across the street from Sattari's.
``Whenever times were tough, she used to tell me, `When God gives
you lemons, you make lemonade.' I'll never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sattari, 38, the mother of a 19-year-old son, was on medical
leave from her job as food-and-beverage manager for the
Hiddenbrooke Country Club in Vallejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't relaxing by listening to soft jazz, she occupied
her time chatting on the Internet. She established a friendship
with someone she had planned to meet for the first time in Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Sattari was scheduled to return Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debra hated to fly,'' Cutchens said. ``She was afraid to fly.
She decided to take this trip because she thought it would be good
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sattari's sister, a flight attendant for American Airlines,
arranged for a complimentary first-class ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cutchens said that word of her friend's death left her
distressed and fighting for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was her destiny,'' Cutchens said. ``This was her date
with God.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ When 8-year-old Samantha Salmans closes her
eyes, the crash of Flight 1420 is in her mind. But she spends most
of her time dreading the next dressing change for the burns that
cover 20 percent of her body.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster from Cabot, Ark., is one of three crash survivors
recovering in the Arkansas Children's Hospital 10-bed burn unit.
All three have long, very painful recoveries ahead of them,
hospital officials said.

   Kristin Maddox, 22, of Ponca City, Okla., is on a ventilator and
has burns on her arms and face. Maddox's hospital roommate and
acquaintance, 14-year-old Rachel Fuller of Arkadelphia, also is on
a ventilator and has burns on 55 percent of her body. Both will
need skin grafts.
</P>
<P>
   It's the dressing changes that are the most painful.
</P>
<P>
   During the changes, doctors and nurses at the state's only burn
unit unwrap the dressings from the burns, which sometimes have
exposed nerve endings. The burns then must be cleaned and redressed
to prevent infection, said Esther Pipkin, a specialist with the
hospital's Child Life &AMP; Education Department who works with
children in the burn and rehabilitative units and provides support
to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every move that they make hurts. Every anticipation of every
move hurts,'' Pipkin said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes up to four hours to change the dressings that cover
Rachel's burns, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Pipkin has spent time with the three survivors, trying to help
them cope with the crash, their burns and the scars that will
forever be with them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Pipkin uses dolls to show the younger children how
different medical procedures will work. Sometimes she plays music
for them or provides a distraction during a dressing change.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, Pipkin just listens and holds their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox is smiling and using hand signals, and she requested some
classical music, which she plays in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel can't talk because she is on a ventilator. She's still
disoriented, Pipkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha is still in a lot of pain and has had to spend most her
energy dealing with the medical procedures that consume her day.
But the trauma of the plane crash hasn't escaped her, Pipkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she closes her eyes, she still sees it,'' Pipkin said.
``She's a very intelligent little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   For burn patients, the first 72 hours are the most critical,
said Sandra Meredith, a nurse and burn unit manager.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the risk of infection, burns cause patients to lose
fluids, and they increase patients' body temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition is a huge part of'' the healing process, Meredith
said. ``If you were burned today, your required caloric intake
would double tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pain medication, the trauma of the fire and the
pain, however, most patients cannot eat, so they are fed through
tubes, Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Once patients learn to cope with the agony of a dressing change
and the pain of movement, they have to work through the emotional
trauma of being scarred forever.
</P>
<P>
   At first they don't seem to understand that their scars are
permanent, Meredith said. Once they do, depression sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't force them to look in the mirror if they've been
burned in the face,'' Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Because patients feel they've lost control of their lives,
hospital staff members allow them to hang posters in their rooms
and listen to whatever music they like, Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients attend Camp Sunshine, a three-day camp for burn
victims. There, those who were recently injured can meet other burn
victims, Meredith said, and ``see that life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   If patients are still in school, a team from the Child Life &AMP;
Education Department will visit the patient's class, explaining to
classmates what a burn feels like and showing them pictures of the
patient's wounds.
</P>
<P>
   That prevents the ``recoil'' that often happens when someone
first sees a burn victim, Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the child knows what to expect, it's not such a shock,''
Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   And although Samantha, Rachel and Maddox are not yet showing any
signs of depression, they, too, will experience a range of emotions
as they heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that lasts an hour, a day or a month, that depends,''
Meredith said.

CRASH VICTIM SUES AMERICAN AIRLINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. An Arkansas man who survived the American
Airlines crash sued Friday, saying that the pilots were negligent
in landing the plane in tumultuous weather.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names the airline as the only defendant and does not
specify the amount of damages sought.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock attorney Peter Miller sued on behalf of Darrell
Arnold of Cabot, a 38-year-old truck driver who suffered cuts,
bruises, and back and neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he has asked Arlington, Texas, attorney Bob Bodoin
to assist in the case. Bodoin represented Walter Ward Richardson, a
North Texas man awarded $4.75 million for injuries suffered in the
1989 crash of an American Airlines plane at Chicago's O'Hare
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that although filing the suit three days after the
crash may seem premature, he and his client believe that the
airline was negligent in endangering the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a passenger in a plane that was apparently negligently
operated,'' Miller said. ``The plane crashed, and he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear in my mind that American Airlines is at fault.''
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman Al Becker said company attorneys had not seen
the suit and had no comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus right now is on taking care of the needs of
passengers and the families of the victims,'' Becker said. ``Beyond
that we will have no other comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the McDonnell Douglas Super 80 jetliner and eight
passengers were killed in the crash. At least 82 of the 136
survivors were injured, some critically.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's suit alleges that the cockpit crew did not follow
``established or reasonable and prudent procedures'' for landing an
aircraft in bad weather. The suit also accuses the crew of
negligence for not advising and preparing passengers for the
emergency situation and not evacuating them using ``established or
reasonable and prudent emergency procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodoin said the plane that crashed is not designed to land in
crosswinds exceeding 35 knots (40.25 mph). The plane crashed at
11:51 p.m Tuesday, when winds at Little Rock National Airport were
clocked at 35 mph. Within five minutes, federal investigators have
said, a gust of more than 80 mph was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was sitting in seat 15F when the jet skidded on the
runway and barreled through steel poles supporting lighting
structures, splitting the plane into three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold escaped by slipping through a rip in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, Miller said, Arnold has suffered ``intense''
mental pain and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been having flashbacks, dizzy spells. He's been having
panic attacks,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines sent all passengers on the jet $25,000 checks
for unanticipated expenses. Although the checks came with ``no
strings attached,'' Miller described them as ``hush money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want the victims to call lawyers. They don't want
the victims to assert their rights. They want the victims to think,
`Well, American is giving us this money, and that's nice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that since Tuesday night's crash, he has received
about five or six phone calls from people involved in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas law prevents lawyers from calling or visiting accident
victims for 30 days. Lawyers can, however, send direct mail to the
injured if it is in an envelope marked ``advertisement'' in red
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he routinely advertises on television but does not
send out letters.

SURVIVORS SHOCKED AT SIGHT OF DAMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ When American Airlines Flight 1420 broke
apart, Stephanie Manus could think only of saving her two young
daughters. With the help of two other passengers, Manus carried
Lauren, 4, and Emily, 2, to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Benton resident was on one of the seven buses that
returned survivors to the crumpled McDonnell Douglas Super 80,
allowing passengers to comprehend how they survived as the jet
separated and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to see it,'' Manus said. ``I had no idea the plane
was damaged that badly. You could see where it had burned above our
seats. It just makes me even more thankful that I got my daughters
out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In what was similar to a presidential motorcade, the passengers
were escorted slowly along a taxiway adjacent to Runway 4R. The
buses were flanked by five police motorcycles, three police cars
and an ambulance. The buses stopped at a distance from the
wreckage, and passengers and relatives got out to look at the site
in daylight. Some of the injured looked at the debris from
wheelchairs. Some took photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Manus talked to reporters outside the Excelsior Hotel in
downtown Little Rock shortly after returning from Little Rock
National Airport. Most of the passengers were too upset to talk
after the hourlong visit as they entered the hotel escorted by
American Airlines support teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' said one woman, who had her left hand in a
cast, before declining to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Manus, who was comforted by her husband, Jimmy Manus, credited
two men sitting near her on the plane with leading her children to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thank God those men were there,'' Stephanie Manus said
as she began crying. ``They were looking after our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Manus, who was inside the terminal and saw the plane land,
is worried about the psychological toll on Lauren. Both girls
escaped serious injury in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry if this is going to hit her later,'' Jimmy Manus said.
``I don't want her to be scarred by this event but, right now, we
just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Manus was critical of American for landing the plane
in the middle of a thunderstorm. The couple also complained about
the way the airline and the airport responded to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the plane go by and then waited and waited,'' Jimmy
Manus said. ``Then Stephanie called me on a cell phone, and said
she was OK and she was off the plane, and I was like, `What?
Where?' That's when she said they had crashed. We weren't told
anything for several hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many survivors were overcome by emotion after seeing
the site where nine lost their lives, Caroline Golden, 20, was
remarkably composed. The Ouachita Baptist University sophomore was
part of a school choir returning from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will affect me later, but I haven't been
crying,'' Golden said. ``I was really surprised by the damage. I
didn't think it was that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the choir, James Harrison, 21, died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky I got out, that I wasn't hurt,'' Golden said. ``I
just remember the plane coming down and looking back and seeing
flames. For a second, I thought that was the only way out and then
someone pointed to an opening in the plane and I climbed out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site Friday, Golden took photographs and swapped
addresses with other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a time to see other people and see that they were
all right,'' Golden said. ``We plan on talking to each other again
and remembering that we survived. I'm just relieved that most of us
got out of there. When you look at the damage, it's kind of
shocking that so many of us made it.''

   EXPECT A FED RATE INCREASE
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rallied and bond prices moved slightly lower as
investors signaled that many expected a rate increase when Federal
Reserve policy-makers meet at the end of this month. The selloffs
in stocks since May 18, when the Fed first indicated it was leaning
toward a rate increase, have been enough to compensate for higher
interest rates, in the view of many investors. Sectors that had
been hit particularly hard, including drugs, banks and technology
stocks, helped lead the rally Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 136.15 points, or 1.28
percent, to 10,799.84, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500
stocks rose 28.21 points, or 2.17 percent, to 1,327.75. The NASDAQ
composite index, which had dropped 10 percent from its recent high,
jumped 75.02 points, or 3.12 percent, to 2,478.34.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond inched up to 5.96
percent, from 5.95 on Thursday.

   BANKERS TRUST ACQUIRED; JOBS CUT
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, sealing its position as the world's largest bank,
completed its $9 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust and said it
planned to phase out use of the Bankers Trust brand name. A round
of layoffs also began at Bankers Trust with large job cuts in the
fixed-income business. Deutsche has announced a plan to lay off
5,500 people from both companies over a three-year period.

   JAPAN CLOSES AN INSURANCE COMPANY

   Japanese authorities suspended operations of Toho Mutual Life
Insurance Co., which has a link to GE Capital of the United States.
Although Toho is only the second major insurer in Japan to go out
of business since World War II, its trouble underscores
industrywide problems.

   PHILIPPINE AIRLINES RAISES CAPITAL
</P>
<P>
   Debt-ridden Philippine Airlines met the deadline to raise $200
million or face liquidation. But half the money comes from its
largest shareholder, Lucio Tan. Creditors have been increasingly
hostile toward him and may not support his bid to keep control of
the carrier. And Cathay Pacific Airways is preparing for talks with
its pilots to resolve a dispute that has grounded many of its
flights since May 28, but analysts were cautious about the outlook
for the talks.

<P>
   RESOLUTION SOUGHT ON GOLD SALES
</P>
<P>
   The head of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus,
said that he hoped the thorny issue of sales of gold from IMF
reserves could be resolved before the fund's annual meeting in
September. The sale proceeds would be used to create a trust fund
to aid poor countries.

<P>
   U.S. TRIES TO UNDERCUT MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft introduced a host of evidence this week to show that
the Netscape browser was still healthy and thriving. But in a
single stroke, a government lawyer undercut Microsoft's strategy by
producing a Microsoft e-mail written in January suggesting that the
company had cynically and selectively produced data to support this
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON.COM SEEKS COURT RULING
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com sought a ruling in federal court to allow it to
continue posting The New York Times best-seller lists online after
the newspaper had demanded that the Seattle company stop publishing
the lists in the absence of a licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   PATENT FRAUD COMPLAINT DISMISSED
</P>
<P>
   A judge dismissed a government complaint accusing Visx, the
maker of vision-correction lasers, of patent fraud.

INKSTER, KANE SHARE LEAD, RECORD PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Juli Inkster buried a 30-foot birdie putt on
her final stroke of yesterday's second round, joining Lorie Kane on
a pace to par their remaining 36 holes and still tie the tournament
scoring record at the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Inkster uttered the words that cut to the quick of every
U.S. Golf Association official at Old Waverly Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this golf course, 10 under is not going to win this
tournament,'' said Inkster, who joined Kane at 10 under par through
36 holes after a second-round 69. ``You've got to go out and make
some birdies. I know that you can't play to the middle of the
greens. You have to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different mind-set for the Open. But I don't think
there's anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, a birdie-fest was not what USGA officials had in
mind when Old Waverly was selected as site of this event. But the
rough topped out at two inches, about half its target height,
because of Mississippi's sizzling spring temperatures. In addition,
heavy rains Wednesday night and a light shower after the opening
round Thursday left greens soft and receptive for a second
consecutive day. And the wind has not been a factor in determining
scoring conditions in either round.
</P>
<P>
   Kane took full advantage, firing a second-round 64 that matched
the lowest score of the tournament and tied the Open record for
lowest in relation to par (8 under) in any round. By the end of the
day, Becky Iverson leaped onto the leader board with a 64 of her
own, moving to 8 under for the tournament and a stroke behind
Dallas resident Kelli Kuehne (9 under), the first-round leader who
opened with 64 but slid to 71 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature is dictating a lot more of this than the golf
course,'' said Dottie Pepper, who moved to 7 under after a
second-round 69. ``Some people have termed this an easy course, but
that's not something I agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that figures to be Old Waverly's legacy in Women's Open
lore, unless a radical reversal of fortune takes place during the
weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the scoring records in the books for the 1999 Women's
Open:
</P>
<P>
   Lowest cut total (even par) in tournament history, eclipsing the
mark of 3 over set at the 1993 Open at Crooked Stick Golf Club in
Carmel, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Most sub-par rounds in tournament history (105), with two days
remaining. The mark was 89, set over four days in 1993 at Crooked
Stick.
</P>
<P>
   Most sub-par rounds in a single day (62), set yesterday. The
previous high was 43, set in the opening round at Old Waverly.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 44 of the 63 cut survivors will carry under-par totals
into the weekend rounds, the most in Open history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely an element of playing aggressively,'' said
Kane, who balanced nine birdies with a bogey. ``I birdied the first
three holes \Ryesterday\S and that set the tone. That's the type of
player I am. If I can get rolling early, I'm comfortable for the
whole day.''
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon (4 under), who won the 1991 Women's Open at Colonial
Country Club, predicted some ``payback'' from USGA officials in the
form of well-tucked pins for the weekend rounds. Inkster suggested
that might not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it doesn't set a standard, I think one year of
really low scores is OK at the Open.''

HIGH POLLEN COUNTS MEAN SWAMPED ALLERGY CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On top of a building in downtown Brooklyn _ with nice
views of the harbor on one side and Manhattan on the other _ sits a
little monitor of human misery called a Rotorod Sampler, Model 140.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the size of a hatbox, with a whirligig that twirls in
the breeze. And every weekday afternoon, Dr. Ishtiaq Chaudhry makes
his way upstairs to hear it tell its sad tale. ``Today,'' he
announces, after extracting a pair of tiny glass rods and checking
them under a microscope, ``we have 61. Another bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not measuring bad vibes, but he might as well be. He is
counting grass pollen, which along with tree pollens waged its
nastiest assault in years last spring and summer on more than one
million seasonal allergy sufferers across the New York metropolitan
region. This year, according to the detector, it is much worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Chaudhry does not need a machine to know this. Downstairs in
the allergy clinic at Long Island College Hospital, there are a
dozen wheezing, watery-eyed, walking pollen detectors like
Christina Clum, who describes what feels like ``a bunch of pollen
lodged in the back of my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If my nose isn't running all over the place,'' complains Ms.
Clum, 30, a freelance camera assistant, ``it's totally clogged
up.'' Right now, it is clogged up, and she sounds like she cannot
decide whether to talk or breathe.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month now, allergy clinics and doctors' offices
across the city, the suburbs and beyond have been swamped with the
same complaints. People say they are itching in places they cannot
scratch. They are astounded at the amount of stuff coming out of
their noses all day. It hurts to eat because the roofs of their
mouths have become raw. People tell horror stories of going to
their cars and finding them coated with a menacing green fuzz, like
targets of chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   And the heavy pollen counts contribute to more than just
miserable-but-ultimately-manageable suffering. In the Bronx, for
example, the Childhood Asthma Initiative at Montefiore Medical
Center is treating nearly 300 children who live in city shelters _
many with little continuous health care. Half of the asthmatic
children have seasonal allergies, which can trigger dangerous
asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to add antihistamines to a lot of the asthma
treatments,'' said Dr. Shawn Bowen at Montefiore. ``Their coughing
was getting worse, and their asthma was getting worse. We're seeing
a lot of children much younger than usual with runny noses and
itchy eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say several factors have contributed to the feeling
sweeping through the region in recent weeks that some kind of
allergy apocalypse is under way. For one thing, two mild winters
have promoted the growth of pollen-producing grass and weeds. Then,
this spring, the tree pollen season, which usually tapers off in
late April and gives sufferers a respite, got pushed far into May
because of a dozen rainy days in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put yourself in the place of the poor tree,''
explains Dr. Ira Finegold, chief of allergy at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center, which is receiving hundreds of allergy sufferers
who complain of being assaulted by Central Park. ``Trees don't have
any pretty flowers to attract insects; they have to put their
pollen airborne. So they wait for good conditions, and balmy, dry
days are great.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in his profession, Finegold should be careful about
betraying any feelings for trees. One day last week in Brooklyn,
just after Alicia Sirico, 7, was examined by her allergy doctor,
she sat near the waiting room and colored in a picture she had
drawn: It showed a tree with a villainous, scowling face. She
leaned over to her mother, Maria, and whispered: ``Mommy, please
tell the doctor I do this all the time.'' Then she started to
twitch her nose like something had landed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arlene T. Schneider, acting chairwoman of the Department of
Allergy and Immunology at Long Island College Hospital, says that
the hospital's pollen counter, the only one in the city that
supplies data to the National Allergy Bureau in Milwaukee, recorded
nine days in May with a grass pollen count of more than 100, which
is considered high. Last year in May, only three days showed those
levels. Also this May, there were 18 days with counts above 30 _
which is when allergic people start showing symptoms _ compared
with 12 such days last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year for the past three years we've had higher and higher
counts,'' Dr. Schneider said, adding that grasses _ all with such
idyllic-sounding names as timothy and orchard, sweet vernal and
meadow fescue _ can waft their pollen airborne as far as 300 or 400
miles, meaning that a window washer on a tower in midtown could get
pollen from Wheeling, W. Va., stuck in his eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think,'' she said, ``that if you're in the middle of a
city you'll be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to achieve some measure of protection is to follow
allergists' rules, which sound a lot like guidelines for becoming a
recluse: don't go out when it's windy or in the morning, because
that is when pollen is usually emitted; keep your windows closed at
home and in your car; don't hang anything outside to dry; don't
work in your yard; don't have too many indoor plants; keep your air
conditioner and your air filter humming; make sure to take the
cocktail of pills and nose sprays that you will probably need to
control your symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some other great news: seasonal allergies generally
work on a principle called ``priming,'' which Finegold explains is
a technical way to say that things will get worse before they get
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that when allergy season starts, your whole system
gets completely primed to respond, and when the next allergen comes
along, it hits you even harder,'' he said. By July 4 the height of
the grass pollen season will have passed. But by mid-August,
ragweed season, which causes hay fever, will take its place.

CROWDED AT TOP: TREVINO SHARES LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ After nine holes Friday, Lee Trevino's
appearance in the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic had the look of another
forgettable round, one that would make him a postscript to a
tournament he once dominated. Heading to the back nine at the Upper
Montclair Country Club, Trevino was sent off with no more than
polite applause from the gallery, something that came as little
surprise to Trevino, a winner only once on the Senior Tour in the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Five birdies and two hours later, Trevino approached the 18th
green greeted by a cheering crowd that whistled and hooted. His
ball awaited where he had hit it from 60 yards away _ 10 inches
from the cup _ and after his tap-in birdie, the 59-year-old Trevino
was tied for the first-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I tell you; I'm big in New Jersey,'' Trevino said
moments after his five-under-par 67 left him tied with five other
golfers. ``Man, they like me here.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two years after he burst on the national scene with a
fifth-place finish at the United States Open at the nearby
Baltusrol Country Club and six years after he won the inaugural
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, Trevino was back in New Jersey and
proclaiming his admiration for everything about the state, even the
way the locals drive their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before: I like the people and their approach to
life,'' Trevino said. ``Aggressive drivers, aggressive people, I
love watching them. I got here and saw people weaving in and out,
cars turning over on the freeway. I'm telling you, these people
could go right to Nascar.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the Upper Montclair course, designed in 1901 by
A.W. Tillinghast with tree-lined fairways and large, accessible
greens that afford the golfer a variety of approach shot choices.
Imagination and flexibility has always been a Trevino strength, and
though he came to this week's tournament with a dismal record
recently, he found himself overcoming a discouraging 37 on the
front nine with a dazzling array of bump-and-run shots and other
creative recoveries as his round concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, who has never finished out of the top 10 in six
appearances at this event, entered Saturday's second round tied
with Tom McGinnis, DeWitt Weaver, Bob Charles, Joe Inman and Allen
Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an older course like this one,'' Trevino said, ``if your
A game isn't working, you can go to your B game or your C game. You
can't do that on the newer courses where you have to hit everything
high and land it soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevino has won 28 Senior PGA Tour events, one more than he won
in a Hall of Fame career on the PGA Tour. But since 1994 there have
been only four victories, and this year has been particularly
vexing. In his last three tournaments, there have been three rounds
of 76 and a 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been playing very well,'' Trevino said. ``But maybe
I'm too comfortable in life and the golf doesn't matter as much.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 10-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son at home,
Trevino said he practiced no more than three times a week, and only
45 minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be 1,000 balls a day, every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Trevino's competitive zeal is not completely lost.
Asked if he could win this week's tournament, Trevino said: ``Well,
New Jersey is where I got my start, at Baltusrol. Anything's
possible. If I hit it like I did today I should be OK come
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL portion of the tournament ends Saturday with a final
round pitting those players who posted the 12 best scores Friday.
Glenn Foley, the former Jets quarterback now with the Seattle
Seahawks, qualified with a 76 Friday. It was a score bettered only
by the Tennessee Titans punter Craig Hentrich, who shot a 75. But
Foley withdrew from Saturday's round because he had agreed to be
the best man in a wedding outside Boston. &QL;

VIEWS MIXED ON THE IMPACT OF EWING'S ABSENCE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Dudley is a well-traveled center, master of the hard foul,
a wise and crafty veteran who can be valuable in a limited role.
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Ewing sidelined for the season with a partly torn
left Achilles' tendon, the unassuming Dudley will be called on to
be a major contributor for the Knicks for the rest of the Eastern
Conference finals. Coach Jeff Van Gundy announced Friday that
Dudley, who often fouls more than he scores, will start Saturday
night in Game 3 against the Indiana Pacers at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley, a 13-year backup who has played in 42 playoff games but
never with so much at stake, admitted to being excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great situation, although I don't like how it
happened,'' Dudley said Friday after taking extra time to hone his
offensive skills at SUNY-Purchase. ``Pat's a friend of mine, and
I'm real disappointed for him that he got hurt. I was happy enough
just contributing. Contributing quality minutes off the bench with
Pat playing would've been a better scenario for me, because I hate
to get Pat hurt at this time. But it's not just me replacing
Patrick. Everybody's got to step up in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The views are mixed about what the loss of Ewing will do to the
Knicks, who were 9-7 in Dudley's 16 starts this season. While some
observers contend that the Knicks' free spirits will be fully
unencumbered and more effective, a more pensive group wonders if
the Knicks can overcome the lack of Ewing's presence. No matter how
sluggish Ewing was, the Pacers had to respect his offensive
ability, double-team him at times and pay a little less attention
to Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Larry Johnson. Ewing gave
Rik Smits fits, keeping the Pacers center in constant foul trouble.
Now another Knick, preferably Dudley, will have to at least make
Smits and the rest of the Pacers defenders mindful of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have to find some unexpected offense somewhere,''
Van Gundy said. ``Who that comes from, I don't know. We know that
we need Larry and Allan and Latrell to be very efficient and then
get some unexpected production from some other people, like a
couple of guys having double-figure games. Like Dudley did in the
Atlanta Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   In that Knicks-Hawks second-round playoff game, Dudley shocked
the Garden crowd, the television and radio audiences, his
opponents, his teammates and perhaps even himself. Matched against
Dikembe Mutombo, a three-time defensive player of the year, Dudley
had career playoff highs of 12 rebounds and 14 points, 2 of which
came on an emphatic tip dunk. Even in his finest post-season
moment, Dudley was still bound by his inability to stay out of foul
trouble. He fouled out of Game 3 against Atlanta in 23 minutes, and
he has 10 fouls in 25 minutes in this series.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot give Van Gundy a respectable allotment of foul-free
play Saturday night, the Knicks could find themselves calling on
the 41-year-old Herb Williams. Even with such precarious
possibilities, Van Gundy and his players are confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than enough to win with,'' Van Gundy said boldly.
``Is our margin of error smaller? Absolutely. But we have more than
enough to win with, and I think our guys believe that. We also know
what a great team we're facing too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of proclaiming the Knicks' superiority, Van Gundy
lobbed a few well-intentioned praises in Indiana's direction. After
tagging the Pacers as whiners on Thursday, he overstated their
ability to play on the road, saying they were better at Milwaukee
and at Philadelphia than they were in Indianapolis. Never mind that
Indiana won all of its playoff games, home and away, before facing
the Knicks, or that the Pacers were a shabby 2-6 on the road in
last year's post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they've been a much better road team in the playoffs
than they've been at home,'' Van Gundy said. ``Reggie Miller plays
better on the road. He's played extremely well in the Garden, as
has Mark Jackson and Chris Mullin and Smits. So we know we're going
to play a team that's going to play better than they have in their
two previous games, and we've got to be ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he did not know whether he would use a big
backcourt of Sprewell and Houston, which proved effective against
Indiana in Game 2. While he admitted to having secretly planned
that strategy before the series, he said whether he went to it
Saturday night would depend on the circumstances, one being the
foul situation of the team's post men.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he does not want Dudley to quash his
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into the game trying to avoid foul trouble, you
can't be effective,'' Van Gundy said. ``We can't go into the game
with our primary thinking being to avoid foul trouble, because then
we're not going to be effective. We've got to be aggressive. We've
got to be tenacious. We've got to be passionate. But we've also got
to be smart.''  &QL;

JUDGE SAYS AT&AMP;T CAN BE FORCED TO SHARE LINES WITH OTHER WEB
PROVIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that could have far-reaching implications for
consumers and the telecommunications industry, a federal judge in
Portland, Ore., ruled Friday that a local government could force
AT&AMP;T Corp. to share its cable lines with competing Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The case has represented one front in a battle that pits AT&AMP;T
against a coalition of Internet service providers and consumer
groups that assert that an emerging source of high-speed Internet
access, cable modems, faces monopoly control.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Friday, involving Portland and the county of which
it is a part, may not have any immediate practical effect because
AT&AMP;T does not offer cable modem service in Portland and the ruling
does not bind AT&AMP;T or other cable operators elsewhere. But analysts
called it a blow to AT&AMP;T and said other cities could be prompted to
follow Portland's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenblum, vice president for law for AT&AMP;T, called the
decision ``inexplicable,'' arguing that Portland and the county are
beyond their legal authority in requiring open competition. He said
the company intended to appeal the ruling, which was issued by
Judge Owen Panner of U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel battle is being waged in Washington, where America
Online and other Internet providers have been lobbying regulators
and Congress to require cable companies to offer high-speed
Internet subscribers a choice of service providers, without
advantage to any one. The Federal Communications Commission has
taken a wait-and-see attitude, but some analysts said the Oregon
ruling would force regulators to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision is going to force the FCC to admit
there's a pink elephant in the parlor,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 million American homes have Internet access over
conventional phone lines, called dial-up access. About half a
million gain access over cable or phone lines that are 10 to 80
times faster than typical phone connections, and research firms
project that the number of such high-speed subscribers will grow to
10 million to 16 million by 2002. The Portland dispute had its
genesis in June 1998, when AT&AMP;T announced its intention to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc., then one of the largest cable companies
in the nation, with 14 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   In a seeming rubber-stamp maneuver, hundreds of municipalities
around the country needed to authorize the transfer of TCI cable
franchises, which had been granted locally, to AT&AMP;T. But in the
Portland area, consumer groups and Internet service providers urged
politicians to challenge the deal.
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that AT&AMP;T should not be allowed to use TCI's cable
lines to offer Internet access exclusively through the At Home
Network, a cable modem service provider that is partly owned by
AT&AMP;T. The Portland City Council and the Multnomah County
commissioners voted in December not to approve the franchise
transfer unless AT&AMP;T agreed to allow competing providers to offer
high-speed Internet access over its lines _ just as local phone
companies must connect to a variety of long-distance providers.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies argue that there is little incentive for them to
undertake the considerable capital expense of upgrading their lines
for high-speed Internet connections if they are merely to become a
pipe through which others deliver service.
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling Friday, Panner wrote that AT&AMP;T had ``no
contractual right under the franchise agreements to exclude
competitors from the cable modem platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cleland, managing director of Legg Mason Precursor Group,
a Washington-based firm that advises institutional investors,
called the decision ``very significant'' and said it could embolden
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the marketplace was looking at Congress and the FCC, the
grass roots caught fire,'' he said.

OFFICIALS INTERVIEW CO-PILOT ABOUT CRASH
</HEADLINE>

By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The pilots of American Airlines Flight 1420
never discussed diverting to another airport while they approached
Little Rock National Airport in a thunderstorm Tuesday night, First
Officer Michael Origel told federal investigators Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Origel told investigators during a two-hour interrogation that
the jet's approach looked good and he was able to keep the runway
in sight all the way to touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But after the plane landed in heavy rain, its wheels seemed to
be hydroplaning on the wet runway and there was no ``feeling of
deceleration,'' the investigators quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots could not see the end of the runway after touching
down, Origel said. Visibility was 1,600 feet _ only a few seconds
at the touchdown speed of 143 knots, or about 164 mph. The limited
visibility could have been partly responsible for their inability
to keep the jet on the runway until it stopped, federal
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane drifted to the right after touchdown, indicating a
crosswind blowing from the left, or west, side of the field. But
the plane went off the left side of the runway into the grass about
1,000 feet before the end of the 7,200-foot runway, which led
investigators to believe that the winds might have shifted to the
opposite direction right after touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Wind data are still being studied, said George W. Black Jr., the
National Transportation Safety Board member in charge of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport slid off the runway
at 11:51 p.m. at a speed between 92 and 103 mph, went down an
embankment, struck steel supports for runway approach lights, broke
apart and caught fire. Nine people died, including Capt. Richard
Buschmann, and 82 people were injured, several seriously. Little
Rock Mayor Jim Dailey called the survival of 136 people ``a real
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Origel, who broke his leg in the crash, had been flying the
McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 since February. But Buschmann was a 20-year
American Airlines veteran pilot and one of the airline's chief
pilots in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann was flying the plane and Origel was talking with the
air traffic controller by radio and going over the landing
checklist as the jet approached Little Rock, Origel told
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they had to dodge some clouds, but that the approach
to the airport was pretty clear, like coming down a bowling lane,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were aware of the approaching storm but did not know
how strong it was or that it was moving onto the airport, Origel
told safety board interviewers, who included airline pilots
employed by the safety board and American.
</P>
<P>
   Origel could not shed any light on why the ground spoilers did
not pop up from the top of the wings after touchdown to help slow
the plane, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Those spoilers must be armed before landing so that sensors in
the nose wheel will trigger them to deploy once the plane is on the
runway, and Origel told investigators that he thought the captain
had pulled a lever on his side of the center control stack in the
cockpit that arms the spoilers, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But an American Airlines spokesman said the airline's policy is
for the nonflying pilot _ in this case, Origel _ to arm the
spoilers before landing. Investigators don't know whether the lever
was put into the armed position, chief investigator Greg Feith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lever was in an ``abnormal position'' as the plane lay on
the ground after the crash, but that could have been caused by the
crash or by rescue workers accidentally hitting it while trying to
remove the pilot and co-pilot from the cockpit, Feith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spoilers would have helped slow the plane, they
would not necessarily have had to be deployed for it to stop
safely, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The captain tried twice to use the thrust reversers to slow down
the jet, but the procedure did not seem to help, Origel told
interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   The captain might have cycled the thrust reversers to the off
position after the first use to give him better control of the
aircraft as it was veering off the runway, Black said. Use of the
thrust reversers can decrease the effectiveness of an MD-82's
rudder, which is used to help steer it in the air and at high
speeds on the ground, Feith said.
</P>
<P>
   Origel could not explain why one of the two thrust reversers was
deployed a third time just before the crash, but the other one was
left in the off position. Investigators suggested Thursday that the
captain might have tried to use the thrust reverser on the left
side of the plane to help steer it back to the right and onto the
runway after it went into the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators used a runway friction-testing truck lent to the
safety board by Dallas/Fort Worth Airport on Friday to determine
how well an aircraft might have been able to stop if the runway
surface were wet, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skid resistance checks showed that this was the best
runway surface the D/FW Airport people had ever tested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete runway was built in 1991 and is in excellent
condition, but the rain may have been heavy enough to overtax the
drainage system and leave the runway dangerously wet when the plane
landed, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had been told about the rapidly deteriorating weather
at the airport, had been given two wind-shear alerts, and had been
given 20- to 30-second updates on increasing wind speeds as they
neared the field, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That information should have been enough to persuade the crew
not to attempt a landing, David Stempler, executive director of the
Air Travelers Association and an aviation attorney, said Friday
from his office in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening thing for airline passengers to know is that
pilots do this all the time,'' Stempler said. ``The big question
that needs to be answered to prevent an accident such as this in
the future is why a well-trained, highly experienced pilot like
this captain would make this kind of decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines is a very safe airline with a good training
program, and if a pilot like that can make bad decisions that cost
people their lives, what can we expect of airlines that aren't
quite that good?''
</P>
<P>
   Stempler suggested that maybe the captain succumbed to what
pilots sometimes refer to as ``get-home-itis,'' a burning desire to
complete a flight against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   To get more details about the flight and the crash, safety board
investigators interviewed passengers Friday at Little Rock
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Black discounted reports that a power failure at
the Little Rock airport just before the crash might have kept
rescue vehicles locked in their station because an electric garage
door wouldn't open.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles were delayed in reaching the scene because rescuers
went to the wrong end of the runway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cost them three or four minutes getting there, but we
don't believe that was a factor in helping save lives,'' Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said investigators don't know whether crew fatigue
played a role in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that even though the pilots had been on duty 13
hours and 20 minutes at the time of the accident _ 40 minutes shy
of their maximum allowed 14-hour duty period _ they had logged only
five hours of flying during that time. They were waiting on the
ground the rest of the time, including a two-hour weather and
equipment delay Tuesday night before leaving D/FW for to Little
Rock.

MARTINEZ STRIKES OUT 16 AS SOX BEAT ATLANTA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ American League, National League, interleague, it
doesn't make any difference to Pedro Martinez, who raised the bar
on his own magnificence after striking out a career-best 16 in a
three-hit, 5-1 win over the Atlanta Braves in a Fenway Park
teetering on pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   How about a league of his own?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Nintendo tonight,'' said Sox second baseman Jeff Frye
after Martinez raised his record to 11-1 with his ninth straight
victory while remaining the majors' only pitcher with double-digit
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing he can throw that hard and have that good a
control. He made a lot of good hitters look bad tonight. You know a
guy has very good stuff when that happens, because they've got a
good lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the best-pitched games I've ever been involved
in.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as it was, remarkably, it wasn't the most whiffs by a
Braves team against a member of the Martinez family. It was,
however, their most strikeouts since Ramon Martinez of the Dodgers
struck out 18 Braves June 4, 1990, exactly nine years ago Friday in
a 6-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine took the loss Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I saw Pedro,'' said Atlanta manager
Bobby Cox. ``He was pitching for the Dodgers in relief, and I said,
`My God, he looks like he's throwing 130 miles an hour and weighs
about 140 pounds.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his arm was going to fly off. But he's gotten bigger
and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smooth. He doesn't stress his delivery. (Pitching coach
Joe) Kerrigan has done a super job. He's had him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who lowered his earned run average to 1.91, best in
the majors, gave up a leadoff single to Javy Lopez in the second, a
leadoff double to Andruw Jones in the fifth, and lost his shutout
when Ryan Klesko curled his seventh home run around the Pesky Pole
with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out at least one batter in every inning, and ended
seven of his nine innings with a K, which sent the sellout crowd of
33,411 into a frenzy every time.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm wasn't confined to the seats. Up in the broadcast
booth, Hall of Famer-to-be Dennis Eckersley, filling in for Jerry
Remy, was doing enough fist-pumping for both pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the most dominating games I've ever seen,'' said
Eckersley, who was in Oakland in 1990 when Bob Welch won 27 games,
the high-water mark for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was styling for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out every batter in the Braves' lineup at least
once. He struck out cleanup hitter Brian Jordan four times. He
struck out Gerald Williams, the No. 9 hitter, three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher in the game, man,'' said Jordan, shaking
his head. ``It's not fair, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who were swept in three games by the Braves when they
first returned to the city of their roots two years ago, gave
Martinez all the cushion he would need in the first, the inning in
which Glavine historically is most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin walked on four pitches and Nomar Garciaparra
followed with a wall double. When Glavine fell behind Mike Stanley,
2-and-0, he elected to walk the Sox cleanup hitter intentionally,
but Troy O'Leary crossed up that strategy by reaching out and
slapping an 0-and-2 pitch through the left side, scoring Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford followed with another single, the first of three
hits for the center fielder. He later doubled and scored on Frye's
two-out single in the third, and homered off reliever Justin Speier
in the eighth.

JOCKEYS USUALLY WIN OR LOSE BELMONT THROUGH PACING ON BACKSTRETCH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Chris Antley moved Charismatic down the
backstretch in the Preakness, hopeful but not confident that he
could capture the second leg of the Triple Crown. As he reached the
half-mile mark, the jockey felt trapped by what he believed was a
struggling Stephen Got Even on his outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``G-Man, give me a shot,'' Antley hollered at Stephen Got Even's
rider, Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, little buddy,'' Stevens said, according to Antley,
who took Charismatic outside and to the doorstep of Triple Crown
history.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations amid tons of horse flesh traveling at 35 miles
an hour are far briefer than the dozens of communications that
owners, trainers and jockeys will be engaged in during the hours
leading to Saturday's Belmont Stakes. This is a talking game,
especially before a $1 million race at the unusual and grueling
distance of 1{ miles, as Pat Day, the rider of Menifee, observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 12 different sets of connections trying to figure out
what's the best way to run their horse: on the pace or off the
pace, inside or outside,'' Day said. ``You're trying to guess what
everybody else is going to do, and that's difficult to do. And
finally, there are the horses. They have to cooperate, and that
doesn't always happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happens about 50 percent of the time, especially in
big races, is that the gates open and the riders adjust and figure
it out as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who says he was ``dead on''
about how Charismatic's victories in the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness would set up, concedes that the Belmont is a rider's
race. But he still intends to bend Antley's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't run this distance but once in a horse's lifetime,''
Lukas said. ``There's no telling what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Charlie Whittingham, the late Hall of Fame trainer,
Lukas said: ``A bad rider can't do what you tell him and a good one
won't listen to you anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Belmont is known for its staggering stretch run, the
race is usually won or lost on the backstretch. The trick is
staying close, but without stretching the horse's comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the horses to stride quickly, but not ask for much,''
said Day, who is aboard a notorious late runner. He acknowledged
that Menifee must be kept closer earlier than he was as the
runner-up in the Derby and Preakness. ``You want to lope along.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear which horse will dictate the early pace because
there are no definitive speed horses in the field of 12, though the
99-1 Teletable is likely to rocket ahead from the rail. The filly,
Silverbulletday, is quick but does not need the lead. Her trainer,
Bob Baffert, says he will spend the first part of the race watching
the timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a leisurely pace,'' Baffert said, hoping for times for
the quarter-mile of ``24 and change'' and for the half-mile of 49
seconds. ``If they're going any faster than that, I'll be
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a slow pace, Menifee, along with other late runners
like Best of Luck and Pineaff, must do much work. ``I'll be on him
on the back side, keeping his attention,'' said Jean-Luc Samyn, who
will ride Best of Luck, trained by Allen Jerkens. ``I have to give
him a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   When the horses enter Belmont Park's wide sweeping far turn,
they will have traveled a mile, and recent history says the
eventual winner will be on the lead or at least within five lengths
of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 Belmonts, only Easy Goer and Touch Gold came on
to win from far behind heading into the turn. In 1989, Easy Goer
was in third place, five lengths back. In 1997, Touch Gold was in
fourth place, four lengths back. The race begins in the last
half-mile, according to Lukas, who expects Charismatic to be ready
to launch his bid for history then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stays in the race and can make a prolonged drive,'' Lukas
said. ``Most horses can run full out for an eighth of a mile, good
ones for a quarter of the mile, and great ones a half-mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kent Desormeaux sent Real Quiet around the far turn
and had a four-length lead at the stretch. In retrospect, Baffert
says he moved the Triple Crown hopeful too early. When Victory
Gallop caught him by a nose at the wire, Real Quiet flunked Lukas'
criteria for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Though a crowd of more than 80,000 is certain to drown them out,
the riders will get noisier in the stretch. There is chatter as
they go around. When Day feels someone is dangerously crowding him,
he says he will ask, ``How're you doing, jock?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear guys making kissing sounds and clucking to their
horses,'' Day said. He then proceeded to demonstrate his sound
effects. ``The hollering starts in the stretch. I get in rhythm
with my whip: `Hah! Hah!' It is sort of an unconscious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas insists there is no manual on how to win the Belmont. He
ran seven horses here, beginning in 1980, before he got his first
victory in 1994 with Tabasco Cat. He won the next two years with
Thunder Gulch and Editor's Note.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his unsuccessful visits, Lukas stayed up late and
watched tapes of every Belmont ever recorded, including
Secretariat's gate-to-wire victory in 1973. Secretariat won the
Belmont, and with it the Triple Crown, by 31 lengths in 2 minutes
24 seconds, which remains an American record. And all that tape
review?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of an idea to have Secretariat as your horse is
all I got out of them,'' Lukas said.

JURY IN POLICE BRUTALITY CASE BEGINS DELIBERATIONS  
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ The jury in the Abner Louima brutality case began
deliberations Friday, quickly turning to the most serious charge
remaining and asking to have testimony read concerning a police
officer's alleged role in the torture of Louima in a Brooklyn
station house.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after the jurors began considering a month's
worth of testimony in the trial in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
they sent out a note asking to rehear the testimony of Louima, two
officers and a police investigator concerning a charge that one
officer, Charles Schwarz, held Louima down while another officer,
Justin Volpe, rammed a stick into Louima's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is one of four police officers who went to trial on
charges of brutalizing Louima. All four officers were accused of
beating Louima in a police car, and two of them _ Volpe and Schwarz
_ were also accused of attacking him with the stick in a restroom
at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Prosecutors said
these assaults occurred after Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian
immigrant, was arrested in a brawl outside a nightclub in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe interrupted the trial last week to plead guilty in the
hope that in doing so, he would receive less than the life prison
sentence he could get for violating Louima's civil rights. Volpe's
departure from the courtroom _ he was immediately dismissed from
the police force _ left Schwarz facing the same charge and possible
sentence if he is convicted of aiding Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also charged that Schwarz had taken Louima, in
handcuffs and with his pants down, from the main desk of the
station house directly to the restroom after he had been booked on
a charge of assaulting Volpe during the street brawl. The charge
against Louima was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's first note called for all of Louima's testimony
``from the time in front of the main desk until the conclusion of
the alleged bathroom assault and subsequent leading of Louima out
of the bathroom into the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified that an officer whom the prosecution said was
Schwarz had taken him directly from the main desk of the police
station to the restroom and had restrained him there.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also asked for the testimony of two police officers who
had said they had seen Schwarz walk Louima from the desk toward the
restroom area, and for the testimony of a Police Department
investigator who was the first to interview Louima, at Coney Island
Hospital the day after he was attacked. The investigator testified
that Louima had told him that he had been put in a cell for 10
minutes before two officers had taken him to the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen Worth, said the investigator's
testimony called into question the testimony incriminating his
client.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Loretta Lynch, said it did not because Louima was
under heavy medication during that interview, and the rest of his
account was ``consistent with the major point of everything he has
said since.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were still hearing the testimony they had called for
Friday when they were dismissed for the weekend by Judge Eugene
Nickerson. The jurors are to remain ``partially sequestered,'' as
the court defines it. This means they go home after each day's
court session, but are transported to and from the courthouse by
federal marshals, and, when not in the courtroom, are kept together
in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   Partial sequestration is an approach often used in sensitive
cases in federal court, where it is rare that juries are fully
sequestered. Lawyers said that if the Louima case were being tried
in state court, the jury would probably be fully sequestered during
deliberations. The Louima jurors are also anonymous, their
identities withheld from defense and prosecution lawyers as well as
from the public. Nickerson ruled that this was necessary to insure
that the jurors' judgment would not be tainted by outside
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The other officers accused of assaulting Louima in the police
car are Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder. A fifth officer, Sgt.
Michael Bellomo, is also on trial. He is accused of trying to cover
up that beating and Volpe's assault of a second man.

LAWS MAKE IT TOUGH FOR TEMP WORKERS TO ORGANIZE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Laws preventing temporary workers from organizing into
collective bargaining units, as 18 Microsoft temps have been
struggling to do for the past month, are outdated and should be
reworked, two officials connected with the National Labor Relations
Board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the laws are changed, such a small group faces a daunting
task of getting companies to negotiate, say the labor experts.
</P>
<P>
   William Gould, who chaired the labor organization from 1994 to
1998, said the law is ``creating a second class of subordinate
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, now a professor of law at Stanford University, said, ``I
think one of the great challenges of American labor law is to bring
these contingent workers into the mainstream so they can enjoy
fringe benefits including health benefits, which are vital, and
collective bargaining rights if they choose to exercise them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 workers, many of whom are certified public accountants,
lawyers and MBAs, on May 19 wrote to the four temporary agencies
that represent them, asking to negotiate job classification, wages,
benefits and working conditions. A majority of the 18 had voted to
form a collective-bargaining unit through the Washington Alliance
of Technology Workers (WashTech), a Seattle local of the
Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The group is participating in a confidential Microsoft project
code-named Dingo.
</P>
<P>
   Two agencies, Volt Services Group and Excell Data Corp., have
refused to bargain with the group, said Barbara Judd, representing
the 18 workers. The other two, Kelly Technical Services and General
Employment, have not yet given their final responses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law
governing U.S. labor relations, employers are under no obligation
to negotiate with a group unless it has been certified by the
National Labor Relations Board. The Dingo group has not sought such
certification, and Judd said it doesn't intend to. It's too long
and involved a process, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's only alternative is to expand, then try to use its
clout to force the agencies to bargain, said Dan Sanders, an
attorney with the NLRB's Seattle office.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said that for several reasons it may be almost impossible
for workers like the Dingo group to win the right to bargain
collectively.
</P>
<P>
   _ In order to be certified as a bargaining unit, a group must
show that it has a ``community of interests,'' in the words of the
National Labor Relations Act. Among temporary workers, those
communities can be small. Creating bargaining units with so few
people is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   _ Collective bargaining must be performed between employees and
employers. But in the case of temporary workers, there is still
controversy over who the employer is, the temp agency or the
company whose work is being done. Two cases currently in the
Seattle U.S. District Court, Vizcaino vs. Microsoft and Hughes vs.
Microsoft, indicate that acting like an employer makes a company an
employer, no matter who actually issues the paycheck. This issue
must be resolved before workers know whom to negotiate with.
</P>
<P>
   _ Often temporary workers labor side by side with permanent
employees on a project. A 1973 NLRB case known as Greenhoot ruled
that under those circumstances, both the temporary agency and the
employer must give their consent to collective bargaining.

INDICTED EX-SERGEANT SAYS HE KNOWS WHO BOMBED U.S. EMBASSIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former U.S. Army sergeant accused of being a part
of a terrorist conspiracy has told the FBI that he knew the people
who carried out the embassy bombings in Africa last year but has
refused to identify them, according to court documents released
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The former sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed, was indicted last month
after talks with the government broke down. The discussions were
held to determine whether he would cooperate with the federal
investigation into Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The documents offer much more detail about Mohamed's dealings
with the FBI, showing that the bureau began talking with him about
Laden as early as 1993, according to one document.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 interview, for example, Mohamed told FBI agents ``that
Osama bin Laden ran an organization called al Qaeda and was
building an army which may be used to overthrow the Saudi
government,'' a document shows.
</P>
<P>
   In another interview with the FBI, in October 1997, Mohamed said
he had lived in Laden's house in Khartoum, Sudan, in 1994, and had
trained Laden's bodyguards after an attempt was made to assassinate
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   No details were provided in the documents about that attempt,
except that an FBI agent said he was aware of such an attempt in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were unsealed by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand
in Manhattan, after The New York Times filed a request with the
court seeking their release and the government agreed, making
certain changes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the material is a 10-page government complaint detailing
the charges made against Mohamed, also known as Abu Omar, when he
was secretly arrested last September.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed's lawyer, James Roth, had no comment Friday night on the
new disclosures. Mohamed recently refused to enter a plea at his
arraignment, and a federal magistrate entered a not guilty plea for
him. After that hearing, Roth said his client was protesting the
prosecution. ``Mohamed has difficulty recognizing the jurisdiction
of this court,'' Roth said. ``He thinks basically that it's a
political indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White, declined to
comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released documents also show for the first time the
existence of three confidential sources who are working with
prosecutors in the investigation. Previously, the government has
confirmed only that one source, identified as CS-1, a convicted
terrorist and former associate of Laden, was cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents cited confidential sources 2, 3, and 4 as
having provided information about Mohamed and his activities with
al Qaeda in the United States and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   What is not made clear in the newly disclosed papers is the
precise nature of Mohamed's relationship with the FBI. It has been
previously reported that Mohamed, who had also sought
unsuccessfully to work for the CIA in the mid-1980s, had acted as
an informant for the bureau on the West Coast in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The documents made public Friday shed new light on this
ambiguous relationship between a covert source and a man the
government now says is one of the perpetrators of terrorism against
U.S. citizens. It offers new suggestions that he tried to insinuate
himself with the sensitive U.S. government agencies while he was
associated with Laden.

HOUSTON ASTROS OWNER FACES HISPANIC COMMUNITY'S OUTRAGE OVER
ALLEGED REMARKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A night Drayton McLane Jr. was honored for his
marketing skills turned into a public relations nightmare as
Houston's Hispanic community became outraged by comments the Astros
owner allegedly made about it.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-speaking television station KTMD-Channel 48 Telemundo
reported Thursday night that McLane had made offensive remarks to
the station's general manager earlier that evening.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, McLane said he does not market to the
Hispanic community because baseball is too complicated for its
citizens and they don't keep up with the sport because it requires
reading newspapers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said McLane complained that Hispanics buy the
cheaper seats at games and don't buy food at the Astrodome because
they don't like what is served there.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came during a casual conversation McLane had with
Telemundo Vice President and General Manager Marco Camacho, two
other Telemundo executives and several others during a reception at
the Aerial Theater in Houston. Later that evening, the Houston
Advertising Federation presented McLane its Trailblazer Award for
improving Houston's image with his strong marketing acumen.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Camacho was telling story to radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he said this shows he has a misperception of
Hispanics,'' Camacho said. ``He doesn't understand the market in
the community. He tells me he doesn't think this is a market that
is important for him to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday afternoon, amid growing pressure from Hispanic
groups, McLane issued a prepared statement denying the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry and outraged by the accusation that KTMD-Channel 48
Telemundo made last night,'' McLane said. ``The report was
absolutely not true. I did not do an interview with the television
station nor did I make any such remarks to anyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will seek an apology from Telemundo.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros players, mired in a minislump, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Hispanic community was not as silent, said Bob Perry,
general manager of KQQK radio.
</P>
<P>
   After Camacho called the Spanish-speaking station to tell it of
the Telemundo report the night before, the station's morning talk
show was deluged with calls, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made a lot of callers very, very mad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As pressure mounted Friday and Astros officials grew more
concerned the incident could harm the team, McLane cut short a
vacation with his wife and flew from Harlingen in South Texas to
what turned into a bizarre press conference at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   While McLane further explained his statements, which he said
were taken out of context, Camacho and two of his employees _ Rod
Rodriguez and Abel Salas _ sat on the front row of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes into the 45-minute press conference _ parts of
which were broadcast live by three TV stations _ Camacho took the
microphone to deny McLane's account.
</P>
<P>
   The two politely traded their versions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of talking specifically about Hispanics, McLane said he
was referring to problems marketing the team to all potential fans.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has had a hard time attracting fans, he said, because
it is hard to understand because of its large amount of strategy.
He said his comments about reading the newspaper was a point that
baseball requires daily attention because the season has 162
regular-season games, not 16 like professional football.
</P>
<P>
   His comments about the food, he said, were that all sections of
the community periodically complain about it. He said he did not
indicate that Hispanics buy only the least expensive seats, but
that those are available to anyone who can't afford more costly
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking about everybody,'' McLane said. ``I've had lots
in my family that I had to teach baseball to. It was never meant to
be about Hispanics. It was meant for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Camacho stuck by his story, which whipped up a maelstrom of
criticism from Houston's Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind, there is nothing we can do to help the Hispanic
market _ we don't understand the game, we don't read the
newspaper,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho, who did not tape the original discussion or tell McLane
he would broadcast the remarks, said he went public to let people
know how business is done in Houston. ``I want people to know what
is said during these cocktail parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Salas backed up the story.
</P>
<P>
   McLane would not speculate on Camacho's motives. But Astros
officials speculated that Camacho was trying to boost Telemundo's
viewership, which is far behind Houston's other Spanish-language TV
station, KXLN-Channel 45 Univision.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho discounted such talk, saying that ratings weeks have
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Telemundo was the talk of Houston's Hispanic
community. Not only were Spanish-speaking radio stations flooded
with angry callers, the Houston League of United Latin American
Citizens is considering a boycott of Astros games.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, LULAC wants Major League Baseball to consider
sanctioning McLane, comparing his alleged comments to those by
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   MLB fined Schott $25,000 and banished her for a year after an
investigation indicated she made disparaging remarks about blacks
and Jews to employees of her ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the harm and damage this man (McLane) has done,''
Johnny Mata, Houston LULAC spokesman said, ``it's hard to see how
someone who made so many millions of dollars can be so stupid. It
makes your blood boil.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a release supporting
McLane after talking with the Astros owner, who has been one of
Selig's biggest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drayton McLane is one of the most honorable, sensitive and
dedicated individuals in the game today and one of the finest men I
have ever had the privilege to call a friend,'' Selig said. ``It is
an outrage that he would be targeted for this kind of slander by
any media outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drayton has accomplished wonders for Houston and for the
community of Houston. He has my full support and the support of
everyone in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The racial brouhaha placed Houston's Hispanic leaders in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, McLane promised Hispanic and African-American
leaders 30 percent of the concession business at Enron Field in
return for support of a referendum on building the downtown
baseball park now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum's narrow victory was attributed to McLane's
last-second pledge, as Hispanics and African-Americans approved the
referendum by a substantially higher margin than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Torres, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
which endorsed the referendum, said Friday he wanted to talk to
McLane before passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, he said this ... it's not only insulting to the
baseball fans, but the players,'' Torres said. ``We hope that in
fact it is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, and City Councilman
Orlando Sanchez took essentially the same approach, saying it was
difficult to determine which version of the story to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos, adding he had no reason to doubt Telemundo, said he
will suggest that McLane and members of Houston's Hispanic
community meet to try and resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Drayton my friend and if he did make these
comments, Drayton needs a lot of help in understanding our
community, the fastest-growing population not only in Houston, but
the country,'' Gallegos said.

TEEN HELD AFTER VIDEOTAPE SHOWS HIM RIDE BICYCLE FROM FATAL
SHOOTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., France)   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An 18-year-old high school student was charged Friday
with fatally shooting a Morningside Heights woman two months ago
when she tried to keep him from stealing her purse, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Shawn Harris, had been arrested Thursday night at
his home in Morningside Heights on charges of murder, robbery and
using a firearm in the commission of a felony, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Harris had confessed to
detectives, who had arrested him after receiving tips from
witnesses and reviewing videotape from surveillance cameras at an
apartment building near the scene of the killing. The videotape did
not include the killing, but did show a man riding away on his
bicycle, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Jacqueline Frezza, 34, was shot after leaving her
co-op apartment at 9 a.m. on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frezza was carrying her purse and a canvas bag of clothes to
be cleaned when she was approached by the gunman, who rode up to
her on a bicycle , the police said. The man grabbed her purse and
she jerked it back. The gunman then shot Ms. Frezza once in the
chest and rode away, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   After the slaying, detectives canvassed nearby neighborhoods,
posting fliers and showing the surveillance videotape to anyone who
might be able to identify the man.
</P>
<P>
   The crime shook merchants, students and retirees around
Morningside Gardens, a seven-building, 1,000-apartment complex
built as city-supervised, middle-income housing. It was the third
slaying this year in the 26th Precinct; there were only three
homicides there in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives arrested Harris on Thursday night after keeping him
under surveillance for six days, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said one or two people might be able to claim the $45,000
reward offered for information leading to the arrest if Harris is
convicted. The money was raised by the police department, local
residents and the co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Harris had been suspended for unknown reasons from
Louis D. Brandeis High School before the arrest. Safir said Harris
did not have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frezza grew up in Cocoa Beach, Fla., and moved to New York
about 10 years ago to attend Hunter College. She had lived in the
city since then, except for one year in which she lived in France.
She had been working for herself as a marketing consultant after
leaving a job with Merrill Lynch a few years ago, and relatives
said she had been helping set up a nonprofit organization to teach
the elderly and the poor how to use computers.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Arthur Frezza, a retired engineer from NASA in Cape
Canaveral, Fla., called his daughter ``a wonderful human being''
and said he hoped Harris ``may have enough goodness to do good the
rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked, `Aren't you angry at the person?' but that will
not change what has been done,'' Frezza said.

FOR JONES, A TOUGH TEST AGAINST A FAMILIAR FOE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ The estranged relationship Roy Jones Jr. has
with his father is not the boxer's favorite topic.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Reggie Johnson (39-5-1), the IBF light heavyweight
champion, professed his love and respect for the elder Jones, it
added an extra spark to the light heavyweight unification bout
between the boxers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones-Johnson bout will headline a card that includes two
other world championships: Roberto Garcia (32-0) defending his IBF
junior lightweight championship against Derrick Gainer (27-4), and
Arthur Williams (30-4-1) defending his IBF cruiserweight
championship against Vissiliy Jirov (20-0), who won a gold medal
for Kazakhstan in the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the toughest challenge Jones (39-1) has faced since
he beat James Toney for the IBF supermiddleweight title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was not trying to get under Jones' skin on
Thursday when he said he loved Jones' father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just expressing the fact that I appreciated what his dad
had done for me,'' Johnson said. ``Roy Jones Sr. was never my
trainer when I was down there. But he helped me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' father used to bring top-notch sparring partners to the
Pensacola, Fla., gym where his son trained. In 1992, while
preparing for the WBA middleweight title bout against Steve
Collins, Johnson went to Pensacola and sparred with Jones for two
rounds, with neither boxer giving any ground. Jones Jr. called a
halt to the sparring, and the rift between him and his father grew.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he never liked sparring against boxers whom he deemed
future opponents. But he said Johnson's comments did not strike a
nerve with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't bother me because I think he was being sincere,''
Jones said. ``My dad can be nice with other people. He's just that
way. But I can't get the same respect from him that he gives to
other people. I love my daddy, but he didn't raise me to be his
friend.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 10 long weeks of bombing, NATO finally broke the will of
President Slobodan Milosevic by finding new ways to destroy the
Yugoslav military in the field while escalating attacks on
strategic targets like command bunkers and power stations with
virtual impunity, allied commanders said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The start was hampered by political constraints and bad weather,
but in recent days NATO was able to take advantage of a rebel
Albanian offensive to draw Yugoslav forces out of their hiding
places near the Kosovo-Albania border. That enabled NATO A-10
Warthogs and other fighter-bombers to hit them hard from the air
and inflict the first major damage to Yugoslav forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also increased the pressure on the Milosevic
government by stepping up strikes on electrical transmission
systems and radio relay towers in the heart of Serbia. In doing so,
it demonstrated that it would not be deterred by the public outcry
over civilian casualties caused by a relative handful of mistaken
attacks and errant bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And by holding down its own losses to the surprisingly low toll
of two combat planes over more than 33,000 missions it also proved
that it could carry out its strikes at a negligible cost to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the trick was the accuracy of the precision weapons,
the avoidance of losses and the increasing destruction of the Serb
forces,'' the top NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said Friday
in a interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, just days ago, American and NATO generals were warning
that air power alone was not enough to win. And even General Clark
concedes that NATO was not certain that air strikes alone would be
sufficient to compel Milosevic to accept NATO's terms when the
allies began their military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And while NATO savors its victory, many current and former
allied officers say the alliance must not take away the wrong
lessons from the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senior NATO officers said that political constraints imposed by
allied diplomats prevented them from conducting it the way they
would have liked, thereby prolonging the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking the war to downtown Belgrade during the
opening hours of the war, NATO waited weeks before attacking
targets in the Yugoslav capital, blunting the allies' ability to
shock the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also began with the promise never to mount a ground attack.
Only recently did it begin to assemble a peacekeeping force which
might have become an element of a larger invasion force. When
Milosevic agreed to NATO's terms on Thursday _ the very day that
President Clinton was to talk about ground troops with his top
generals _ the Yugoslav leader could not be sure that a ground
invasion would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   But what enabled the alliance to overcome the deficiencies in
its strategy, allied commanders say, was the willingness of NATO
diplomats to allow them to broaden and intensify the bombing over
time. The alliance also used the professionalism of its pilots, its
high-tech weaponry and novel tactics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Daniel J. Murphy Jr., the commander of NATO naval
forces in the Adriatic, said in a telephone interview that the war
could have been shorter and caused fewer casualties had NATO's
military been given a freer hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you followed the military template, we wouldn't have had as
many restrictions as we had, but that was a political reality,''
Admiral Murphy said. ``It's certainly true that from a military
point of view, we'd have liked to have taken the gloves off
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats never expected that their decision to put an end
to Milosevic's campaign against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
would lead to 10 weeks of day and night bombing. Their hope was
that a few days of air strikes would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   NATO started out with a three-phase plan of gradually escalating
airstrikes, a far cry from the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict when
warplanes pounded central Baghdad from the opening minutes of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force officers said the Yugoslavia conflict was a
case in which the military strategy succeeded despite serious
flaws. ``It's a strange situation,'' said General Ronald Fogleman,
a former Air Force Chief of Staff. ``Just because it comes out
reasonably well, at least in the eye of the Administration, doesn't
mean it was conducted properly. The application of air power was
flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clever tactics and some luck enabled NATO commanders to
compensate for some of the weaknesses in their plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, for example, emerged as an important
element of NATO's strategy. The Serbs initially frustrated NATO by
hiding, hunkering down and trying to ride out the air war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian partisans changed that by trying to infiltrate into
Kosovo from their bases in Albania about two weeks ago. The
light-armed KLA were a poor match for the heavily equipped Serbian
military, which was armed with tanks, armored personnel carriers
and artillery, and the offensive fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbs had to mass in the open to take on the guerrillas,
making them vulnerable to allied attacks from the air. In recent
weeks, Serbian forces near the Albanian-Kosovo border have taken a
heavy pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced American military technology also helped. The Clinton
administration never allowed General Clark to send the battalion of
24 Apache helicopters in Albania into the fray and use the battery
of MLRS surface-to-surface rockets that were deployed with them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Army used the U.S. Army's Q-37 radar, the target
acquisition radar for the rockets. They calculated the source of
the Serbian artillery fire on the Kosovo rebels in a matter of
seconds. All this information was provided to NATO warplanes,
helping them carry out punishing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also used the U.S. Army's Predator and Hunter drones to
locate Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Serbs fired their artillery, they could locate where
they were coming from,'' General Gordon Sullivan, the retired Army
chief of staff said in an interview. ``That took away their
capability to hide. It gave the Air Force a direct shot at the
artillery. That gave targeting a real-time impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is well informed on the tactics used in the war. This
week he received high-level briefings on the campaign at the Army's
European headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the troops, however, were just one source of
pressure. As the war dragged on, NATO diplomats decided to give
General Clark more latitude in prosecuting the war in Belgrade and
throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The mistaken attack against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and
a handful of errant bombs received enormous attention by the media.
</P>
<P>
   The larger story was that the precision guided bombs, such as
laser-guided and satellite-guided weapons, enabled NATO to strike
throughout Serbia with relatively few civilian casualities.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to step up the pressure on the Milosevic regime, NATO
warplanes bombed factories owned by close associates of the
Yugoslav president, using the justification that the the goods they
made could be used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's ability to avoid losses was also an important factor,
Clark noted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its weeks of bombardment, NATO never succeeded in
demolishing the Serbian air defenses. Unlike the Iraqis during the
Gulf war, the Serbs cleverly turned their targeting radars on and
off, making it hard for NATO warplanes to locate and attack Serbian
surface to air missiles. When SAM batteries were damaged, parts
were quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NATO military spokesman said recently that the alliance had
confirmed the destruction of only three of Yugoslavia's
approximately 25 mobile SA-6 surface to air missile batteries. Even
though that assessment may be overly conservative, intelligence
specialists believe that the majority of the SA-6 batteries are
still operational.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also sought to take advantage of NATO's reluctance to
attack Montenegro _ a Yugoslav republic that has sought to maintain
a degree of independence from Belgrade _ by hiding radars there.
</P>
<P>
   Another Serb tactic was to try to attack the last plane in a
NATO strike formation as it headed back to its air bases. The Serb
calculated that the aircraft would be low on fuel by that point and
relatively unprotected by other planes. Also, the last plane in a
strike formation is often flown by one of the less experienced
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the tactic almost worked last week when an
allied warplane was force to drop its fuel tank to gain the
maneuverability to dodge surface to air missiles near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only two allied planes, anF-117 and an F-16, were shot
down by the Serbs. And in both cases, special operations forces
were able to rescue the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The limited losses made it easier for the alliance to maintain
public support for the fight. While no NATO pilots were killed in
combat two American pilots were killed when their Apache helicopter
crashed in Albania during training.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tabulating the results of its attack, NATO said it took a heavy
toll on the Serb military, claiming to have destroyed more than 100
Yugoslav aircraft, 314 artillery pieces, 203 armored personnel
carriers, 120 tanks, 268 other military vehicles, 14 command posts,
29 highway bridges and 11 railroad bridges.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean, however, that current and previous NATO
commanders think the air war against Yugoslav should be a model for
future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   General George Joulwan, General Clark's predecessor as NATO
commander, said in an interview that the Clinton administration
reluctance to prepare for a ground offensive had undercut the
allies leverage on Belgrade and prolonged the conflict. President
Clinton's assertion that all options were on the table was helpful
but came too late, General Joulwan added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be careful about what victory means, given
that the initial goal was to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe,'' he
said. ``What if we go in and find a lot of mass graves? We may have
an agreement, but at what price?''

WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? FOR BENITEZ AND MARTINEZ, PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometime during this highly anticipated and
scrutinized three-game series between the Yankees and Mets, Armando
Benitez could be summoned to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez will be booed incessantly by the Yankee Stadium fans,
who will recall how he pinned a fastball between the 2 and the 4 on
Tino Martinez's back while he was with the Baltimore Orioles 13
months ago. He expects to be bathed in boos and should.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's routine,'' Benitez said. ``That's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Plunking Martinez was a terrible act by Benitez, an act that
would have put Martinez's career in peril had he been drilled in
the head. Martinez barely managed to avoid being bashed in the
helmet, but the questionable pitch caused a nasty brawl. The
Yankees felt that Benitez aimed at Martinez in retaliation for
Bernie Williams' mammoth two-run homer in the previous at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was suspended for eight games, and some Orioles were so
embarrassed by the incident that they publicly criticized him and
in effect apologized to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Ray Miller was so spooked by Benitez's pitch and the
possibility of repercussions that he did not use him the next nine
times the Orioles and the Yankees played. The Orioles traded
Benitez last December. They had to.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is obvious that Benitez regrets the pitch, he
still tried to convince a reporter that he was just throwing inside
because Martinez steps toward the plate when he swings.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez giggled about being booed, but he conceded that it
disturbed him a little to be considered such a villain. He sounded
sheepish as he apparently revealed for the first time how he tried
to apologize to Martinez and how he had seemingly been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote him a letter,'' Benitez said. ``I told him I was
sorry. I was trying to pitch inside. We're all real people. I know
he has a family. I didn't want this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said that it was his idea to write the letter and that
he had his agent, Mike Powers, read it and send it to Martinez
through the Yankees. Benitez said Powers mailed it May 22, 1998,
three days after he plunked Martinez. Does Benitez know if the
letter reached Martinez?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Benitez said. ``I know he's still ticked off.
Nobody wants to go through that. They don't want to be hit by a
pitch, especially from somebody like me. I throw hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Before batting practice, Martinez diplomatically answered three
questions about Benitez. He said that he tries not to think about
what happened last season and said that Benitez is not the only
pitcher to have hit him on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Benitez has hit Martinez twice: the hard-throwing
right-hander also buzzed him in the upper back after Edgar
Martinez's grand slam while Martinez was with Seattle in 1995,
inciting another fight.
</P>
<P>
   After Benitez made his revelation about the apology letter, a
reporter approached Martinez a second time and asked him if he had
ever received it. The normally polite first baseman grew agitated
and said: ``I'm not going to answer that. Why is that important?''
</P>
<P>
   It is still a tender issue for Martinez. Joe Torre has
repeatedly said that Martinez, who went 18 for 100 after being hit,
struggled for more than a month, though he still hit .281 with 23
homers and 118 runs batted in. Martinez refuses to admit that being
hit by a 97-mile-an-hour fastball, which left an ugly bruise on his
back and influenced his flexibility and swing, contributed to his
slump.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter persisted whether Martinez received the letter,
he waved his hands and said: ``It's not me against him. It's us
against the Mets. I haven't been asked about any other pitcher. I
haven't been asked about Rick Reed, Yoshii or Al Leiter. I don't
want this to be the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then retreated into the players' lounge, which is off
limits to reporters. It was his indication that he did not want to
talk about Benitez's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Martinez consider the topic taboo? Perhaps Martinez
does not want to acknowledge the receipt of Benitez's letter
because, in some way, that would signal that he forgives Benitez or
would at least let Benitez off the hook. Benitez does not deserve
sympathy, and Martinez, who has two hits and has been hit twice in
four at-bats against him, does not have to grant forgiveness. They
could meet again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure, if the situation arises, I'd like to face him
again,'' Martinez said. ``I'm not saying I want to face him more.
But if he's out there and I'm hitting, I'm not going to want to get
pinch-hit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez will be ready, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to do is pitch like it's normal if I face Tino,''
Benitez said. ``If I have to throw inside against him, I'll throw
inside.'' &QL;

NEW YORK LEADERS AGREE ON A $35.3 BILLION BUDGET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two weeks of relatively painless negotiations,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City Council leaders agreed Friday on a
$35.3 billion budget that takes advantage of record-high tax
revenues and contains only a smattering of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone gleefully
announced the agreement in the City Hall rotunda, boasting that
they had easily reached a consensus while politicians in Albany
were still struggling to adopt a state budget that is now 66 days
late.
</P>
<P>
   In another swipe at state lawmakers, the two leaders said their
only hurdle had been the Legislature's repeal of the city's
commuter tax last month, which punched a $360 million hole in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden loss of revenue forced the mayor and the speaker to
jettison many of their own tax cut proposals, they said, including
cuts that would have helped businesses, working parents, home
buyers and car owners. But their budget plan still includes modest
tax cuts, and spending increases for the Board of Education, the
Police Department and many other agencies for the city's fiscal
year, which begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sweet because we were able to do an awful lot to enhance
the quality of life in our city,'' Vallone said of the budget.
``It's bitter, also, because in spite of all we've been able to do,
for the first time ever we have had a hostile act from our brethren
in Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement follows the framework of the budget that the
Republican mayor proposed in May, although Council leaders won some
concessions. Giuliani allowed them to restore $165 million in cuts
he had planned for cultural institutions, libraries and community
programs. The Council extracted an additional $80 million for those
programs, including $9.5 million for a summer reading program in
libraries and $17 million for services for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also modified his plan to accelerate a class of 1,500
police recruits, agreeing to delay their hiring by three months. He
agreed, as he had been expected to do, to at least temporarily
abandon his plan to use city funds for an experimental school
voucher program, instead agreeing to spend $6 million to study
several education ideas, including vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Council accepted the mayor's controversial
plan to set aside millions of dollars for stadium construction in
the future. But Vallone insisted that the amount come down to $90
million, from $96 million. He demanded that the money come from the
general budget, instead of from commercial rent tax revenue, as
Giuliani had proposed. The mayor also agreed to let the Council
have a say in how the money is eventually spent.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone also compromised in the area of tax reductions, agreeing
to $348 million in cuts instead of the nearly $700 million he
proposed in March. The most significant cut _ eliminating the sales
tax on clothing and shoes that cost less than $110 _ was Giuliani's
idea. That cut, which will take effect in December, will cost the
city $134 million next year, growing to $237 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The budget agreement also extends a tax relief program for
owners of co-ops and condominiums, worth $166 million a year, and
provides an earned income tax credit for the working poor, worth
$48 million a year. New York would be the first city in the nation
to offer its own earned income tax credit, which would save the
average family $100 a year. Both cuts would need approval from Gov.
George Pataki and the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The city has sued to overturn the commuter tax repeal, and
Giuliani said Friday that if the suit succeeded, he might use that
money to cut more taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The budget agreement still requires the approval of the full
51-member Council, but that is a formality because Vallone, a
Democrat, wields tight control.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has all but declared himself a candidate for the
U.S. Senate, heaped praise on his own spending practices Friday,
saying he had dramatically improved the city's fiscal health by
keeping spending under the rate of inflation and reducing budget
gaps in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But independent budget monitors said Friday that future budget
deficits remained a serious problem, especially since Giuliani's
estimates do not account for potentially costly settlements with
municipal workers. They questioned whether the $629 million that
the mayor is setting aside for unanticipated needs is enough, given
that the local economy, driven mostly by Wall Street, could weaken.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Vallone's chumminess _ the mayor not only pumped
the speaker's hand, but kissed several Council members on the cheek
_ contrasted sharply with last year's stormy budget negotiations,
which broke off when Vallone refused to abandon a plan to hold a
referendum on the future of Yankee Stadium. This time around they
emphasized that they had agreed on a new budget before the legal
deadline.

ZACHARY FISHER, 88, NEW YORK BUILDER AND PHILANTHROPIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zachary Fisher, a leading New York builder and
philanthropist who virtually willed the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space
Museum into existence at its Hudson River berth, died Friday at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 88 and lived in
Manhattan and Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was a member of the the Fisher Brothers real estate
dynasty that helped reshape the city's skyline in recent decades
with the luxury high-rises and office towers they built, owned and
managed in Manhattan. These include Imperial House, a 30-story
residential building on Lexington Avenue at 69th Street; Bankers
Trust Plaza; 50 Sutton Place; Park Avenue Plaza; 400 Park Ave., and
605 Third Ave., along with thousands of apartments scattered across
the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The Fishers, together with others like the Rudins, Dursts,
Roses, Tishmans and Resnicks, are considered one of the royal
families that over two or three generations have molded the
Manhattan real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher hurt his knee in a construction site accident when he was
a teen-ager, and the injury led to his rejection by the Marine
Corps when he tried to enlist in 1942. But he never forgot his
interest in the armed forces. Over the years Fisher lavished
attention and money on military and veterans' projects. He gave
more than $25 million to the establishment of the Intrepid Museum.
He also set up a foundation that sent $10,000 checks to families of
the 241 people who died when a Marine barracks was bombed in Beirut
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, saying that he never knew any other civilian
who cared as much about the military, awarded Fisher the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s Fisher championed the USS Intrepid, the aircraft
carrier that has become a floating museum. The Intrepid he saw was
a rotting, rusting aircraft carrier headed for the scrap heap. But
it was a ship that had sailed with distinction in World War II and
the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam. The carrier sustained many
blows, including a kamikaze strike in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher founded the Intrepid Museum Foundation in 1978 to save
the battle-scarred carrier, and he was the main force behind the
move to revive it as a tourist attraction and a learning center for
children. After it found its new mission in 1982 on Pier 86 at 46th
Street, he also helped maneuver the moored museum through financial
difficulties in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Intrepid, now the world's largest naval museum, receives
more than half a million visitors a year from around the world.
Thousands of children come for physics and history lessons,
vocational training and counseling or to attend the summer and
after-school programs of the Intrepid's cadet corps.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the philanthropy endowed by Fisher and his wife,
Elizabeth, directly benefited members of the military, veterans and
their dependents. The interest was rooted in their life
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fisher served overseas with the United Service
Organizations in World War II, entertaining troops as a Ziegfeld
girl and visiting the bedsides of wounded soldiers, sailors and
airmen. Fisher assisted the Army Corps of Engineers in building
coastal defense installations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisher Armed Services Foundation not only aided the families
of those killed in the barracks bombing in Beirut, but also the
families of scores of other servicemen who lost their lives. Among
the recipients of the foundation's help were the families of the
sailors killed in a gun turret explosion on the USS Iowa in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Fisher Armed Forces Scholarship Foundation was
established to help active and former military personnel and their
families obtain educations. The Fishers also gave money to the U.S.
Naval Academy, and they began the Fisher House Program in 1990 to
build ``homes away from home'' for families of hospitalized
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said ``the death of Zachary
Fisher, an American patriot, is a great loss to this country and
the Department of Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Fisher's wife, Elizabeth, was stricken with Alzheimer's
disease. Four years later the Fisher Medical Foundation joined
David Rockefeller in providing $5 million for the Zachary and
Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at
Rockefeller University. The center houses the largest laboratory in
the nation involved in Alzheimer's research. Fisher's medical
foundation was set up for the purpose of helping to find a cure for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Among his many other charities were the Jewish Institute of
National Security Affairs, the United Jewish Appeal, the George C.
Marshall Foundation, the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and the
Reagan Presidential Library. He also served on the boards of
Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Fisher was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 26, 1910, and went
to work in construction at 16. The family business was started
earlier in the century by his father, Carl Fisher, who became a
force in real estate as a general contractor building apartment
houses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He and his older brothers Martin and Larry formed Fisher
Brothers as the privately held core of a conglomeration of
construction, holding and management businesses. Fisher was for
many years in charge of the company's leasing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Brothers, which controls more than five million square
feet of office towers, now is largely operated by five of his
nephews and great-nephews. Most recently it was considering a bid
to become the building contractor for a huge, Hollywood-type movie
studio proposed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Fisher died in 1976. In addition to his wife of more than
50 years, the former Elizabeth Kenowsky, Zachary Fisher is survived
by his stepson, Bill Crovello; his brother Larry, managing partner
of Fisher Brothers, and his sister, Ginny Ross, all of Manhattan.

RUTH WHITNEY, 71, EDITOR   WHO MADE GLAMOUR RELEVANT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Ill.)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31
years and influenced several generations of women during three
important decades in American feminism, died Friday at her home in
Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine
owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1
million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her
mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not
intimidating, to American women.
</P>
<P>
   Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour,
where _ along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like
frothy fashion spreads and light service articles _ she published
articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that
other women's magazines had generally avoided. Her editorial
decisions _ like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in
1968, a first in the women's magazine industry _ sometimes caused a
stir in magazine circles.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs.
Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ``I
always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of
a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to
everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret
of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about
themselves, not just about what they wore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was
born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother,
Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of
gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice
of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to
drive in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where
she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly
after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended
journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency,
Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and
went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter.
She didn't last long in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said.
``And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more
sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young
Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for
Newsweek or Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always say next,'' she said, ``was that if you had a
uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job
in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a
now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She
arrived at Glamour in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine
Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and
one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived
by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in
America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal
Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an
editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for
her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S.I.
Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent
company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th
anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her
name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When
she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in
1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the
way up to the president. ``I never shied away from controversy,''
Mrs. Whitney said last year. ``It's always good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October
1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against
the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs.
Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine _ with its
special feature on notable women of the year _ and went home to
watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and
said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill
as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly
magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said
that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney.
``She was always trying to get as much real information into the
pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms.
Steinem said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial
articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second
in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a
privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its
magazines, but in 1997 chief executive officer Steven Florio said
Glamour's annual profits were in the ``tens of millions of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now
the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's
rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her
forward thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable
women,'' he said, ``but functioning citizens of America, with all
the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have.
And of course she was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all
editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who
survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine;
his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People
magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of
Oshkosh.

JURY AWARDS FORMER PSYCHOLOGIST $16.6 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury in Manhattan has awarded a former
state psychologist $16.6 million in damages after concluding that
he was the victim of false allegations, orchestrated by another
employee, that he had sexually abused mentally retarded patients in
a treatment center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Melanie Fudenberg, who was ordered to pay the
damages, was a mental health therapy aide at the Williamsburg
Residential Training Center in the mid-1980s, at the same time that
the psychologist, Mark Komlosi, practiced there.
</P>
<P>
   Komlosi said Friday that he believed that Ms. Fudenberg was
carrying out a personal vendetta against him. A lawyer for Ms.
Fudenberg denied that she had been behind the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict returned Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan ended a torturous, almost Kafkaesque legal battle for
Komlosi, who had fought for about 15 years to win back his
reputation and compensation, he said, for the damage caused by the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the accusations, made originally in 1984 and 1985
by several retarded patients at the training center, Komlosi was
arrested and jailed for 15 days. The headline of one newspaper
article in The New York Post said: ``Shrink held in sex attacks on
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately in 1986, Komlosi was put on trial in the state
Supreme Court in Brooklyn, charged with sexual abuse of one of the
patients. But more than a week into the trial, the patient who had
testified that he was abused by Komlosi broke down after court and
admitted, as the judge said at the time, that ``the entire thing
was a lie; that it never happened and was completely made up,'' a
transcript shows.
</P>
<P>
   The case was dropped, and the justice presiding at the time told
Komlosi that the legal ``process works in strange ways.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be an understatement, as far as Komlosi was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he sued state and city officials, as well as Ms.
Fudenberg. But in subsequent court rulings, the officials were
found to be immune from suit in federal court, leaving only Ms.
Fudenberg to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The entire jury award, including $10 million in punitive
damages, was returned against her, according to the verdict sheet.
It was unclear Friday how much of the award Ms. Fudenberg would be
able to pay, but one of Komlosi's lawyers, Jeremiah Sheehan, said
the verdict would enable Komlosi to seek payment of damages from
the state and the city in other court actions. Komlosi, 59, who has
a master's degree in psychology and was working toward a doctorate
when he was first accused, said the allegations destroyed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being a professional,'' he said, ``to being
professionally lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not able to recover,'' he added, saying that he now
works as a doorman in a building on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   He said of the jury's verdict, ``It's like when you unload a
truck of huge stones from my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goidell, a lawyer for Ms. Fudenberg, said she would appeal
the ruling. Goidell said that his client denied having patients
falsely accuse Komlosi, and that she was passing on patient
complaints she believed to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a messenger,'' Goidell said. ``She was an extremely
caring and concerned therapy aide.'' He said that Ms. Fudenberg
``denied concocting anything against Komlosi.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Peter Collins, another lawyer representing Komlosi, said the
allegations against his client first surfaced in 1984, when a
female patient accused him of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In a court affidavit, Komlosi has said that he learned later
that Ms. Fudenberg had told the patient ``to play a game on me''
and ``had manipulated and coerced'' the patient ``to make these
statements in return for a bribe of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, several other patients made false accusations of abuse
against Komlosi, at Ms. Fudenberg's direction, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that repeated investigations by state agencies
cleared Komlosi, but that in March 1985, he was accused again, by
the patient who later recanted his statement at trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal trial that ended last week before Magistrate
Judge Henry Pitman, the jury found that Komlosi ``had a right to be
free of malicious prosecution,'' the verdict sheet shows, and that
``Ms. Fudenberg knew with absolute certainty that the allegations
of sexual misconduct'' by Komlosi were false.

EDITORIAL: FINALLY, HORMEL GETS THE JOB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 5:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton took an appropriate stand against bigotry
Friday by giving James Hormel a recess appointment as the nation's
ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel's nomination had been blocked for
20 months by a handful of Senate Republicans disturbed by his
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The credentials of Hormel, heir to a meat-packing fortune and a
former dean at the University of Chicago Law School who has been
active in civic, educational and political causes, were not the
sticking point. There were sufficient Senate votes to confirm him
had Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott allowed a vote. But Hormel's
homosexuality did not sit well with Lott, who last year likened
homosexuality to alcoholism, kleptomania and ``sex addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Lott was happy to go along with Sens. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Robert Smith of New
Hampshire in preventing a vote on the floor. This unenlightened
trio suggested that Hormel's gay ``agenda'' somehow threatened a
collapse of Luxembourg's moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitutional provision that allows presidents to
bypass the confirmation process when Congress is in recess, Hormel
can remain as ambassador until late next year. His shameful
treatment by Lott and his GOP colleagues will be remembered long
beyond that.

SENATOR ASSAILS FBI OFFICE OVER INVESTIGATION OF FLIGHT 800 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. senator who has sharply criticized the FBI's
investigation into the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 has
written to the agency's director, Louis Freeh, condemning the
leadership of the New York office of the bureau, which he said was
``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was writing in response
to a letter that he received this week from about 450 New
York-based agents and other employees that attacked a Senate
subcommittee hearing he held last month to examine the bureau's
investigation into the 1996 crash off New York's Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-and-a-half-page letter, which was sent to Freeh on
Thursday, Grassley charged that the agents' letter had been
orchestrated by FBI management in New York, which he said was
``clearly trying to wrap its arms around the rank and file as a
screen against legitimate criticism of its failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley added: ``This orchestration smacks of FBI managers
resisting legitimate, constitutional oversight by the United States
Congress. The FBI is not above the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At the subcommittee hearing on May 10, the senator said the
bureau's handling of the 16-month investigation had been ``a
disaster.'' Some witnesses also testified that bureau officials in
New York had ignored or suppressed reports that had found
mechanical failure, and instead obsessively pursued a theory that a
bomb had caused the crash, which killed 230 people on July 17,
1996. Ultimately, the investigation concluded that the explosion
was not the result of terrorism or any criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Senior FBI officials strongly rejected the criticism at the
hearing. The agents, meanwhile, in their letter to Grassley, called
his remarks biased and inaccurate, and the hearing one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, in his letter to the director, avoided direct
criticism of the agents, but said the bureau's management in New
York had ``felt the embarrassment of its failures.'' He asked Freeh
to look into his concerns and report back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI office
in New York, declined to comment on the senator's criticism in the
letter to Freeh, but added: ``I stand behind that investigation. It
was obviously a phenomenal effort on the part of the personnel of
the New York office. I was aware of their letter and in fact, in my
individual capacity, was proud to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carter, a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, declined
comment except to say that Freeh ``will respond directly to Senator
Grassley.''

FAA PLANS TO ENFORCE RULE REQUIRING PILOT REST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it would
soon begin strictly enforcing a 1985 regulation requiring airline
pilots to have at least eight hours of uninterrupted rest in the 24
hours before finishing their flight duty.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots and safety advocates have been calling on the agency to
enforce the rule for years. In May, the Allied Pilots Association,
which represents 9,500 pilots at American Airlines, asked the
inspector general of the Department of Transportation to
investigate why the agency had refused.
</P>
<P>
   Union president Richard LaVoy said that FAA Administrator Jane
Garvey, the administrator of the agency, told him at a meeting
Friday that the FAA would publish a notice in the Federal Register
next week giving airlines 120 days to comply with the rule, which
most major carriers now routinely ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Duquette, a spokeswoman, confirmed that the agency
intended to enforce the rule but would not say when the notice
would be published or how long a grace period the airlines would be
given.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to getting it out soon,'' Ms. Duquette said.
``We hope in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot fatigue is one factor being investigated in the crash this
week of an American Airlines jet in Little Rock, Ark. Nine people
were killed, including the jet's captain. At the time of the crash,
the captain and first officer had been on duty for more than 13
hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Duquette said that Friday's action by the agency was a
decision that was made weeks ago, long before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crash may now tip the balance in the battle that has
raged for more than a decade between safety experts and pilot
groups on one side and the airline industry on the other. Pilot
unions and the National Transportation Safety Board say crew
fatigue is a significant factor in many accidents and have urged
the aviation agency to revise its regulations to reflect new
scientific evidence on the subject. The transportation board has
also strongly criticized the aviation agency for not enforcing the
current rule mandating pilot rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the industry's lobbying group,
has countered that fatigue is not a major safety threat and that
making carriers fully comply with the current regulation would
force them to hire more pilots, adding billions of dollars to the
industry's costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that because of this crash in Little Rock
there is no rush to judgment on this issue,'' said David A. Fuscus,
a spokesman for the association. ``These are very complicated
issues with a wide diversity of opinion about them and they need to
be addressed in the right manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulation requiring eight hours' rest does not pose a
problem for most senior pilots who fly regular schedules. But
thousands of reserve pilots get up each morning, not knowing if
they will be asked to fly at 10 a.m. or 10 p.m. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A few airlines comply with the rule by dividing their reserve
pilots into three groups that are scheduled to rest in staggered
eight-hour shifts throughout the day. But most major carriers
ignore the rule.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the aviation agency announced its intention to modify
the regulation and asked for suggestions. But after receiving 2,000
comments on all sides, it declined to act. Last year, Ms. Garvey
asked a committee of pilots and airline executives to draft a new
proposal, promising to enforce the current rule strictly if the
panel could not reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The group disbanded in February after failing to reach an
agreement, but Ms. Garvey still did not act. Last month, the Air
Line Pilots Association, which represents 53,000 pilots at 50
airlines, publicly called on Ms. Garvey to make good on her
promise.

AMAZON.COM SEEKS RULING ON USE OF N.Y. TIMES BEST-SELLER LISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leading online bookseller, Amazon.com, sought a legal ruling
in federal court Friday to allow it to continue posting The New
York Times best-seller lists after the newspaper had demanded in a
letter that the Seattle company stop publishing the lists in the
absence of a licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action came as a price war over best sellers on The
New York Times lists has engulfed the top online bookstores,
including Borders.com and Barnesandnoble.com. All three booksellers
are offering 50 percent discounts on more than 60 titles on the
various best-seller lists of The Times, which the companies post on
their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also sent a similar letter Thursday to executives at
Borders.com, a unit of Borders Group Inc., seeking to stop it from
using the best-seller lists. But Friday, a spokesman for Borders,
Rich Fahle, said it had not ``made a decision on how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com did not get a warning because executives of
The New York Times Co. said it had a business relationship with the
book chain that included a licensing agreement, stipulating when
Barnesandnoble.com could post the best-seller lists. The Times
maintains ties to Barnesandnoble.com through links from its Web
site to the electronic bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's best-seller list has been used widely for more
than 20 years by bookstores as a standard to promote popular
titles. Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said the company had filed a
motion in U.S. District Court in Seattle, where the company is
based, seeking a ruling on whether it could cite the best-seller
lists to promote its discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said the company believed that its citations were a ``fair
use of the information on the list, and it's like saying, `Here's
an Academy Award winner.' It's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Richieri, an assistant general counsel for The New York
Times, said that the company became aware of the extensive use of
the lists after the price wars started in May. He said that the
company was particularly concerned that Amazon was posting the
lists on the Wednesdays before they were formally published each
Sunday in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Richieri said The Times Co. was not concerned that Amazon
labeled books as best-sellers on The Times lists. The issue, he
said, ``is taking the list in its entirety and publishing it and
using that list in essentially a commercial way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since The Times Co. complained, the bookseller has altered the
list so that titles are alphabetical rather than in order of
popularity. Amazon is also posting its new listing on the Mondays
after the rankings appear in The Times, and it has added a
disclaimer, saying the newspaper ``does not sponsor or endorse the
services of Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Richieri said those changes ``are basically an acknowledgment
that they were over the line before.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company was open to establishing licensing
agreements with Amazon but wanted Amazon to remove the list first.
``Amazon just put it up,'' Richieri said. ``They just dissed us.
Their view is that they don't need the license.'' &QL;

HANDLER ANNOUNCES HE WILL RETIRE FROM NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Alan Handler
announced Friday that he would retire in September. His departure
will open the way for Gov. Christie Whitman to make her fourth
nomination to the state's highest court and will assure that her
imprint is stamped on one of the nation's most respected benches
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Handler made the announcement barely a month after Attorney
General Peter Verniero was confirmed for a seat on the bench at the
end of a grueling political fight over his nomination. Handler will
leave the bench Sept. 1, the same day that Verniero is scheduled to
join the court.
</P>
<P>
   At 68, Handler, one of the most liberal voices on the court, is
still two years away from the mandatory retirement age. He gave no
specific reason for stepping down, other than that it was time to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly why I decided to retire now,'' he said in
a telephone interview Friday. ``It's one of these indefinable inner
clocks that ticks away. It's long enough. I look forward to taking
life a little less seriously; that's as close to elation as I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has made three appointments to the seven-member court:
Verniero, Chief Justice Deborah Poritz and Justice James Coleman.
She will have the chance to place at least one more person on the
Supreme Court early next year because Justice Daniel O'Hern will
reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Whitman, said that the
governor had not decided on a replacement for Handler. But Ms.
O'Connor said, ``The governor will not be submitting her nominee to
the State Bar Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, angry over the bar association's rejection of Verniero
as unqualified to be a justice, said last month that she would not
send any future Supreme Court nominees to the bar for review.
Governors, including Whitman on all her nominations to date, have
submitted nominations for the bar association's review for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Handler's retirement gives Whitman the opportunity to make some
of the most significant changes to the court in its history, and
her choices could determine the court's views on issues from the
fate of death row inmates to how the state deals with inequities
between rich and poor school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Handler is the most outspoken opponent of capital punishment
remaining on the court. Although that position has placed him in a
decided minority, his arguments over 22 years have persuaded many
of his colleagues who support the death penalty to grant enhanced
protections for capital defendants. New Jersey has not carried out
an execution since it restored the death penalty in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After the retirement of Chief Justice Robert Wilentz in 1996,
Handler became the leading voice on the court in the state's long
fight over school financing. That legal battle, embodied in a 1990
case known as Abbot vs. Burke, has led to years of court rulings in
which the state is constitutionally required to provide parity in
financing for all school districts. Handler wrote the court's
majority decision in the two most recent rulings on the issue, in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, Handler, Wilentz, and Justice Stewart Pollock,
whom Verniero will replace in September, were the strong liberal
voices on the New Jersey Supreme Court, leading the way on
decisions about race, criminal justice, abortion and equal rights
for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this wonderful court is quickly being transformed,''
said Frank Askin, a professor at Rutgers University Law School and
general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of New
Jersey. ``Handler was clearly the conscience of this court. His
retirement is going to put a lot of pressure on Chief Justice
Poritz because it is definitely turning into the Poritz court.''
</P>
<P>
   Handler said that even with the probability of at least five
nominees to the bench by Whitman, he was not worried that the court
would swing drastically in any particular direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's really possible to control these things too
closely,'' he said, ``and I don't think people should be unduly
concerned or perturbed that coincidentally one governor has the
opportunity to make fewer or more appointments than another.''
</P>
<P>
   Handler attended Princeton University and is a graduate of the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He
received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1956 and was
admitted to the New Jersey bar the same year. He was a deputy
attorney general and a first assistant attorney general before he
was appointed to the state Superior Court in 1967. He quit the
bench in 1976 to work as special counsel to Gov. Brendan Byrne. A
year later, Byrne nominated him to the state Supreme Court.

NYC COLUMN: THROUGH RAIN, SLEET AND BITES FROM DOGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., N.Y., Texas)   (rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ryder post office on East 45th Street near
Flatbush Avenue is the busiest in Brooklyn, and on Thursday morning
the talk among the men and women in gray and blue was of dogs.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 350,000 dogs in Brooklyn and only 2,200 mail
carriers, a ratio that helps explain why the U.S. Postal Service
this week ranked Brooklyn fifth on its annual list of Top 10 Dog
Bite Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The news had Joseph Lubrano grabbing the back of his right
thigh. Lubrano is now the postmaster of Brooklyn, but years ago as
a rookie carrier in Queens, he met the business end of a Doberman
pinscher.
</P>
<P>
   He had followed protocol, stepping inside the fence only after
he rattled the gate. But the Doberman rounded the corner and
clamped onto his leg, and the memory hasn't ever quite gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 injury that a letter carrier sustains nationally is
a dog bite,'' said Lubrano, ``so we take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if much of the mail-receiving public does not. The struggle
between mailman and mutt is eternal and pretty lopsided if you're
rooting for the mailman. People in all 50 states love dogs much
more than they do the Postal Service, a fact not lost on Lubrano
and other mail officials. They went to the Ryder office bearing
grim dog war stories and glossy literature to drum up attention as
part of a national dog bite prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
   First, they played on sympathy. Angelo Mangano carried mail for
37 years and escaped flesh wounds thanks to his quick feet and a
supply of dog biscuits in his bag. But as president of the Brooklyn
letter carrier's local, he relayed tales from others of mangled
forearms and punctured legs and rabies scares.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for those moved more by money than suffering, Lubrano
noted that the 2,541 dog bites in fiscal year 1998, including 22 in
Brooklyn, cost the Postal Service $25 million. (Houston ranked
first, with 49, followed by Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a visitor was allowed to venture outside the Ryder
office and follow Bruno Papalia, 28, on his route through Brooklyn.
Energetic and friendly, Papalia said the dog count on his route is
seven pit bulls, two Dalmatians, two cocker spaniels, a black
Labrador, three poodles, two Rottweilers and dozens of mutts and
strays. He does not think Brooklyn dogs are any more malicious than
suburban or small-town dogs, only that there are more of them.
</P>
<P>
   He is armed with a 1.5-ounce canister of ``Halt!'' pepper spray,
but didn't have time to use it when he was attacked on April 30,
his third bite in less than three years. He still has five pink
puncture wounds on his shin, but his pride suffered the greater
injury _ his assailant was a poodle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got me all the way down to the bone,'' Papalia said. A
co-worker gave him the card of a lawyer specializing in dog
litigation, but he decided not to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Papalia knows that conflict is inevitable between a beast
trained to protect home and hearth and a carrier sworn to deliver
mail through adversity. He also thinks dogs hate his uniform. Dogs
have pushed through screen doors to attack him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a pit bull chased him around a car after its owner
accidentally dropped its leash. On Thursday morning, a black dog
contentedly riding in the back seat of a blue sedan stuck its wet
nose out the window and barked at the sight of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``7329 Avenue M,'' Papalia said respectfully, recognizing the
Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he came to Bergen Court, known among carriers at the Ryder
office as ``Satan's block.'' There is even a ``Dog Warning Card''
filed at the office alerting carriers to Satan's address.
``Everybody knows Satan,'' Papalia said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fence and a ``Beware of Dog'' sign, but no Satan.
The owner, Steve Goldman, described his dog as ``a pussycat. She
just doesn't like uniforms.'' He pointed to Papalia and said, ``If
you hide him, I'll let the dog out and he'll lick you in the
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   Papalia smiled and hurried down the block to deliver more mail.
Satan emerged and bounded down the steps, equal parts pit bull,
English bulldog and fire hydrant. She growled through the fence.
But when Goldman opened the gate and let the visitor in, she seemed
almost, well, sweet. He said Satan growls and nips only at people
outside the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And her name is Sadie,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have the root of problem. One man's Satan is
another man's Sadie. It all depends on which side of the fence
you're standing on.

JAY ELLISON, A STREET FIGHTER AND A SURVIVOR, GETS A SECOND
CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ James ``Jay'' Ellison will return home a new man on
Sunday, free of the violent tremors that had caused his body to
painfully jerk and shudder, the visible symptoms of a disease that
was rapidly eroding his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison firmly believes he has been cured of multiple sclerosis
by the high-dose chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplant
he fought so hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the day he got the transplant, March 22, his ``new
birthday.'' He fought hard for that day. He battled the disease,
and he battled his insurance company after it refused to pay for
the experimental transplant.
</P>
<P>
   He took his fight for coverage public until an anonymous donor
stepped in, making the transplant possible. Today, he says the
transformation that led him on this path to rebirth began many
years ago when he was a troubled youth with a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I learned from my mistakes, and I learned you can
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his doctors noted, Ellison also apparently learned
some ``street fighter'' skills that served him well in his battle
with the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he will return home to Covington, Wash., (near Kent)
after two months of ``house arrest'' at the Marriott Residence Inn,
next door to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison was discharged from the hospital in early April, but
like all transplant patients has had to stay near Fred Hutchinson
so his post-transplant progress could be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors say there is no way to know yet if the treatment, a
refinement of the bone marrow transplant, has worked. But
privately, in conversations with their patient, it's clear they are
as elated with his progress as the patient himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever something like this happens, when there are dramatic
changes, as researchers we have to be careful not to overstate
things,'' said Dr. Richard Nash, one of Ellison's transplant
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all very impressed with the response so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be premature, Nash said, to say the transplant has
rid Ellison of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep telling me to stop saying I'm cured, but I know I
am,'' the 37-year-old former painting contractor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who has four children, plans to work hard to get out of
his wheelchair and take full advantage of this hard-won contract on
a new life.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed last fall with primary progressive MS. Doctors
said the disease was moving so rapidly without remission that none
of the standard drug therapies offered him any benefit. His only
hope was the transplant, which would cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nash and other experts at the University of Washington pleaded
with Ellison's insurance company, Premera Blue Cross, to pay for
coverage, saying Ellison's unusually aggressive form of MS did not
respond to standard therapies and the transplant offered him his
only hope.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison refused to take no for an answer. With help from the
advocacy group Washington Citizen Action and state Insurance
Commissioner Deborah Senn, he went to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   A public fund-raising effort was launched and then abruptly cut
short when an anonymous donor contacted Fred Hutchinson and agreed
to pay the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Bowen, a UW neurologist who advocated for Ellison's
transplant, said part of what made Ellison different from other
patients who face such denials was his savvy and direct
confrontation of the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor also noted his patient's gift for public speaking, an
ability for rhetorical counterpunch that even Bill Clinton might
admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd describe it as non-physical street fighting,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Jay Ellison the public knows: a dedicated and
hard-working family man, a devout Christian, who smiles easily and
speaks with a kind of common-man sincerity that almost seems quaint
these days.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the real Ellison today. But the savvy, street-smart
side probably owes a lot to the old Jay Ellison _ the boy who never
graduated from high school and who spent 18 months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say just about every kid in my old neighborhood ended up
in prison at some point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a professional gambler he never met, Ellison grew up
in Auburn, Kent and Federal Way. He and his family spent part of
their lives in the housing projects. Ellison said he lived in a
culture where petty crime was routine and often done simply for
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, he was arrested for burglarizing the home of a
Washington State Patrol officer. He and his teenage friends took
the loot _ guns, alcohol and video equipment _ to their fort in the
woods. When they returned the next day, the police were waiting.
``Looking back on it now, that was the best thing that could have
happened to me,'' Ellison said. ``I was a follower then, in with
some pretty bad kids. I needed discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   After release from youth detention, Ellison said he resolved to
clean up his act. He got a job and, at 17, got married. But his
troubles weren't over. Ellison said he and his wife still dabbled
in drugs, using them even as they were starting a family. Compared
with his earlier mistakes, he said it seemed a small vice at the
time. It wasn't. Early on in the marriage, the couple had a
daughter, Cerena. Four years later, the marriage had disintegrated
but the couple had another child on the way. Ellison said his
second son, Brian, was born with severe health problems that the
doctors attributed to maternal drug use. Ellison has custody of
both children.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Ellison's own mother was diagnosed with
MS. He was so busy dealing with his son's health problems he said
he wasn't able to give his mother's diagnosis much attention. Just
as it would hit him about 15 years later, the disease hit his
mother with lightning suddenness and immediately put her in a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty overwhelming,'' said Cathy Ellison, Jay's second
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The experts wanted to keep the infant boy medicated with
phenobarbital to prevent seizures. But the Ellisons did their own
research and decided the long-term medication was doing more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd already decided that we'd rather have him live one day
with a clear mind than live a lifetime on the medications they had
him on,'' Jay Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   They found other doctors who were willing to wean the boy off
his medications, and today Brian is doing fine, excelling at karate
and acting in all other ways like a normal teenager. He is quiet
about his father's battle with MS, and Jay Ellison said he's not
sure how to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I know how to be a father to a teenager, maybe
because I didn't have a father when I was a teenager,'' Ellison
said.
</P>
<P>
   He seems most uncertain when he talks about his family. His
confidence when testifying in Olympia in favor of patient-rights
legislation or when holding a news conference to challenge the
health insurance industry seems to ebb then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a lot of mistakes and, by golly, I'll probably keep
on making mistakes,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   But most agree he has made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison has drawn attention to a promising new treatment for
people with the severest forms of MS and other autoimmune diseases.
Since he went to the media, calls to Fred Hutchinson and the UW
about stem cell transplantation for MS have come in from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison also drew attention to a huge gap in the health care
system _ the lack of consistent financing for experimental
therapies. At the request of Washington Citizen Action and the
insurance commissioner, he became the poster boy for a drive to
pass a patients bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed to produce a new law, and Ellison has since
grown a little wiser about life as a media symbol. He is grateful
to those who helped him, but at the same time he said he is
uncomfortable that his name was used like a political commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was kind of naive,'' Ellison said. ``I just figured
they were trying to help me. And they did help me. ... But after a
while it was pretty clear it wasn't about me so much as it was
about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, it is going to be about his family. Ellison
believes this treatment has given him a new beginning. He is one of
only about 60 people in the world to have received a stem cell
transplant for MS and hopes to be one of the very few to show it
can do more than simply stop the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty fortunate,'' Ellison said. ``I'm thinking
there's a reason for all this. Maybe this guinea pig was meant to
fly.''

<P>
   COMPLAINT ON MEAT BAN
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission called a U.S. ban on poultry and pork
imports from all European Union countries ``disproportionate.'' The
U.S. Agriculture Department issued the ban on Thursday after meat
from Belgium was found to contain the toxic chemical dioxin. Amid
concern the chemical may also be present in Belgian beef, the
Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Canada and Hong Kong have joined
the United States in restricting Belgian food imports. The European
Commission has said it will ban the sale of chicken, pork, beef and

   Canada's economy lost 14,000 jobs in May, the fourth consecutive
month with no growth in employment, Statistics Canada reported.
Nevertheless, the national unemployment rate dipped to 8.1 percent,
from 8.3 percent in April, because 49,000 people withdrew from the
labor force. Ruth Getter, chief economist at Toronto Dominion Bank,
said all the jobs lost were for full-time work in the private
sector, while public sector employment continued to grow.
Statistics Canada also reported that the consumer price index was
1.7 percent higher in April than a year ago, the largest annual
increase since October 1997.

   BRAZILIAN NATURAL GAS PROJECT
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Brazilian government's effort to increase the use
of natural gas as an energy source instead of petroleum, a group of
state-controlled energy companies and regional administrations
announced plans for two gas pipelines to fuel the electric energy
grids of three far-flung Amazonian states. Led by the state oil and
gas company Petrobras, the group, which also includes Eletrobras, a
state holding company for energy investments, plans to invest about
$860 million in the project. The pipelines are part of a larger
push by federal authorities to improve infrastructure in some of
Brazil's most remote regions.

   MEXICAN PHONE USE
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Telecommunications Commission of Mexico reported
increased use of mobile phones in May after a system that charges
callers was put into effect. The agency disputed a report by
Salomon Smith Barney that cellular phone use fell 50 percent in
May. One beeper company in Mexico also attributed a recent 30
percent increase in clients to frustration with costlier cellular
phones. When the ``caller pays'' system went into effect for mobile
phone users on May 1, the government also authorized higher rates,
as high as 75 cents for a three-minute call, and added complicated
dialing procedures.

   KOSOVO-U.S.-REAX (Washington) _ President Clinton declared
Friday that he was ``anxious to end the bombing'' in Yugoslavia,
and the Pentagon said that the 10 week air war could end as early
as Sunday if Serb military authorities begin their troop withdrawal
from Kosovo. By Alison Mitchell. WITH PHOTO.

Belgrade on Saturday to meet Yugoslav army brass; bombing may end
Sunday. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-AIRPOWER (Undated) _ Without one combat casualty, NATO
has turned Milosevic's Yugoslavia into the first case study in how
precision weaponry, overwhelming resources and a steely willingness
to keep bombing can compel victory _ all without risking NATO
soldiers on the ground. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-RECOVERY-ASSESS (Washington) _ On how Yugoslavia's recovery
might be constrained by fact that its president has been indicted
on war-crimes charges. Like the Persian Gulf war, the Kosovo war
appears to be ending with major issues unresolved, not least the
future of President Slobodan Milosevic and what the U.S. ought to
do about him. By R.W. Apple.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade) _ As soon as Russia came to
agreement with NATO on the principles for a peace settlement for
Kosovo, Milosevic understood that he had no choice but to accept

deal could still slip away. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ How/why the military campaign is
ending. After 73 days of bombing, NATO finally broke Milosevic's

SEATTLE AT FOREFRONT OF STEM CELL TRANSPLANT RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like so many discoveries in science, the idea that
bone marrow transplantation might be useful in the treatment of
autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis or lupus came about by accident.
</P>
<P>
   It is an accident upon which medical researchers intend to
capitalize. Seattle is at the center of a rapidly expanding
nationwide effort, led by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, to study the effectiveness of bone marrow or stem cell
transplantation as a treatment for autoimmune diseases.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, with the rate
much higher in the Pacific Northwest and other northern regions.
About 150 people per 100,000 population have the disease in the
Northwest, compared with about half that in California. Scientists
don't know why the rate is higher in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The stem cell transplant, a refinement of the bone marrow
transplant, involves injecting basic blood-forming cells back into
a patient to create a new immune system and costs about $100,000.
For people with leukemia or lymphoma, the transplant is standard
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   For some people with autoimmune disorders, it's the choice
between this experimental therapy or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a big deal for a patient group like MS, because
there is so little standard therapy can do for people with severe
forms of the disease,'' said Dr. Peter McSweeney, a transplant
physician who helped develop the autoimmune project at Fred
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeney, who is leaving Seattle to direct a bone marrow and
stem cell transplant program at the University of Colorado hospital
in Denver, said the primary impetus for this approach came from
patients who had autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis in addition to
leukemia or lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   These patients were treated for their cancer by high-dose
chemotherapy and radiation followed by bone marrow transplantation
to restore immunity, McSweeney said. But in addition to being rid
of cancer, he said, these patients also appeared to rid themselves
of their arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of these transplants involved the use of donor
marrow, which is more risky than autologous transplants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Development of autologous transplantation _ using the patients'
own marrow or immmune system cells _ involved enough of a reduction
in risk to get people thinking about pursuing transplantation as a
treatment for non-terminal autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Kraft, director of University of Washington's
Multiple Sclerosis Research and Training Center, said most people
with MS will respond well to one of the available medications. But
those with severe forms of the disorder _ about 10 percent _ often
fail to respond to drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still experimental, but for some people it's the right
option,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Bowen, a UW neurologist who has referred people with
MS to Fred Hutchinson for transplantation, said it's really not
much of conceptual stretch to move from current drug therapies for
MS to transplantation. Both, Bowen noted, are attempts to combat a
dysfunctional immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've long had suspicions that something gone wrong in the
immune system might be the cause of multiple sclerosis,'' he said.
In MS, he said, the body's own immune system cells attack the
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The current drug therapies are all immunosuppressive agents,
Bowen said, whereas high-dose chemotherapy and radiation wipes out
the immune system so the bone marrow or stem cell transplant can
rebuild a healthy new system.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not fully accepted, he said, that MS is an autoimmune
disorder. And it's certainly not been accepted yet, Bowen said,
that transplantation should be the treatment of choice for severe
cases of MS.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the research consortium launched by Fred Hutchinson,
in partnership with the UW and also with arthritis researchers at
Virginia Mason Medical Center, hopes to answer. The City of Hope
biomedical research institution in Los Angeles is also part of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   A similar but separate clinical study looking at marrow or stem
cell transplantation for autoimmune disorders is also under way at
Northwestern University in Chicago.
