<HEADLINE> Iran Repatriates 136 Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday repatriated 136
Afghan refugees to their homeland as part of an ongoing "voluntary
repatriation program," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All the 136 refugees were repatriated from the central province
of Isfahan, from where some 9,586 Afghan have returned home since
the beginning of the current Iranian year on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The refugee repatriation program, which started on April 8, will
continue until October in line with an agreement signed between the
Iranian government and the Untied Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, some 100,000 Afghan refugees are to be
repatriated to Afghanistan in six months.
</P>
<P>
Toshiro Odahsima, head of the UNHCR office in Tehran, announced
on Tuesday that a total of 83,777 Afghan refugees have returned
home from different parts of Iran since the start of the program.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR puts the total number of Afghan refugees in Iran at 1.
4 million, of which some 70,000 are living here illegally.
</P>
<P>
Afghan refugees have been blamed for the high rate of
unemployment in Iran. Labor Minister Hussein Kamali said in May
that about 2 million refugees, most of them Afghans, are working
illegally in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 154 members of Iran's Majlis (parliament) also
urged President Mohammad Khatami's government to repatriate Afghan
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of Afghan refugees and their long presence
here has given rise to numerous problems for Iranian citizens, the
Majlis members said in an open letter to the president.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks to Resume Sunday: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians will
resume low-level negotiations on Sunday, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat announced here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was addressing the evening session of the Central Council
of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which started its
meetings here early in the day to discuss whether or not to declare
an independent Palestinian state on September 13 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters before entering the council meeting that
U.S. President Bill Clinton would continue his mediating efforts in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Palestinian Minister of International
Cooperation Nabil Shaath told reporters that the Israeli-
Palestinian talks would be resumed as of Sunday and last five
weeks, to be held alternately in Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat returned to Gaza Saturday morning after his meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to lead to a breakthrough on the
Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held separate
meetings with Clinton on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit
in an effort to unblock the peace impasse. But lack of progress
apparently prevented them from meeting each other, although
observers had regarded this as an excellent opportunity to resume
peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the 15
European Union (EU) nations Saturday called on the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after a meeting held in Versailles
southwest of Paris, EU finance ministers said that the present
price of oil makes up "a source of great concern."
</P>
<P>
"This should be dealt with, as OPEC has promised, by an
increase of production leading to a lower price," said the finance
ministers.
</P>
<P>
They called on OPEC to take measures to guarantee a market
supply which should be better adapted to the present world
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also said that out of economic and environmental
reasons, the governments of the 15 EU countries will not cut oil
taxes to reduce oil price.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that a coordination be launched in the
framework of the International Energy Agency on energy savings and
a policy of energy diversification.
</P>
<P>
OPEC countries will meet on Sunday in Vienna to discuss a
possible increase of oil production.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges EU to Build Federal Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Interior Minister Enzo
Bianco Saturday put his weight behind plans for a federal police
force in the European Union (EU) and a European prosecutor's
office.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the first pan-European conference of anti-Mafia
prosecutors opened on Friday in Italian northern city of Caserta,
he said crime organizations now have a "supra-national matrix and
dimensions".
</P>
<P>
The EU nations are already on the path to closer police
cooperation and the creation of what is called a "common juridical
space" involving a prosecutor's office and common norms for some
crimes, but some have been reluctant to consider even that, let
alone anything more extensive.
</P>
<P>
"In time, we must arrive at a full-fledged federal police force
to combat crime with a supra-national dimension," Bianco proposed.
</P>
<P>
"To get results, one must move in step with a European
juridical space, the common norms for some crimes and a European
prosecutor's office," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pan-European conference of anti-Mafia prosecutors will end
Sunday in Caserta.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 2,000 Contracts Shelved by U.S., Britain: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States and British
delegates at the United Nations Sanctions Committee have put on
hold a total of 1,966 contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries
under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraqi Trade Ministry said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, the
ministry said that the contracts, worth 3.3 billion U.S. dollars,
were meant for Iraq to import humanitarian supplies to alleviate
the crippling impacts of the decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The contracts, including 886 for the oil sector, 219 for health,
284 for electricity, 103 for transport and communication, were
concluded between Iraq and Arab, European and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the U.S. and Britain block the contracts
to impede the implementation of the oil-for-food deal "to inflict
more harm on the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that only the total lifting of the
sanctions can end Iraqi people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and British members at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its vital imports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord started in
late 1996 allows it to export crude in return for U.N.-supervised
imports of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says that the sanctions have claimed over 1.3 million
lives, causing a humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are not to be lifted until Iraq is given a clean
bill of health by the U.N. arms inspectors. But Iraq has barred U.
N. inspectors from entering since December 1998 when the U.S. and
Britain launched large-scale air strikes Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The impact of the roaring oil prices on Turkey's
current account deficit is projected to amount to somewhere between
1.5 to 2 billion U.S. dollars by the end of the year, Turkish Daily
News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that each one dollar increase in the prices of oil
per barrel means 180 million dollars on external accounts, assuming
that Turkey will import 180 million barrels of oil this year.
</P>
<P>
A leading culprit behind the deteriorating current account
balance, Turkey's oil import bill has grown by twice this year when
compared to 1998, which was also a year of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Turkey imported 1.9 billion
dollars of crude oil compared to 1 billion in the same period of
1998.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Arab Monetary Association (SAMA) will start
to use the European single currency euro in all its monetary
accounts as of September 13, the Arabic-language daily Al-Alam Al-
Youm reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
SAMA has asked businessmen and financial institutions via the
Saudi Trade Chambers to stop issuing payment orders and documentary
credits in other European currencies as of September 13.
</P>
<P>
Saudi economists expect that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
countries could adopt measures to reduce their national currencies'
linkage with the U.S. dollar and make a shift towards a broader
euro-dominated international currency basket, said the report.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish brokerage firm Garanti Yatirim, U.S.
investment bank JP Morgan Capital and the National Bank of Greece
on Friday set up a special capital fund of 45 million U.S. dollars
to finance the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has named the new entity Bosphorus Capital
Partners, which was created with equal contributions by the three
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the new company is expected shortly to increase
from 45 million dollars to 100 million dollars through
international funds.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- The Central Bank of Iraq has announced that Iraqi
citizens living at home or abroad can open bank accounts in foreign
currency at the Iraqi banks in and outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank did not mention the interest rates on foreign
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1991 Gulf War, Iraqi dinar was officially traded at
3.2 U.S. dollars. Now, a dollar can buy about 2,000 Iraqi dinars,
said the bank in a circular.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will set up a Highway Technology Transfer
Center in Ankara together with the U.S. Federal Highways
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Highway General Director Dincer Yigit said Friday that
they were ready to cooperate with any country on earthquakes-
resistant highway construction.
</P>
<P>
He added that they had already started cooperation with the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Launches Anti-Measles Vaccination Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Health Ministry on
Saturday launched a six-day campaign to vaccinate Iraq's 900,000
children from nine months to five years old to contain measles.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide campaign aims at controlling infections and
mortality from measles among children, said Qussay Kamil, director
of the Health Education Department under the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has made available all the necessary equipment,
including 5,000 vaccination teams, 750 trucks to transport the
teams and 1,000 health supervisors, Kamil said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was conducted with the cooperation of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been struggling under the 10-year-old stringent U.N.
sanctions for its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Beat Schweizer, head of the International Committee of the Red
Cross delegation in Iraq, has warned that Iraq's hospitals are
close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that more than 10,000 people, including 7,457
children, died in July as a direct result of malnutrition and
severe medicine shortage caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
And this has brought the total number of victims of the
sanctions to 1,335,060 since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British members at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the vital contracts Iraq
signed with foreign countries within the framework of the U.N. oil-
for-food program to import food, medicine and other basic goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program, which took effect in 1996, allows
Iraq to sell oil in return for humanitarian supplies under U.N.
supervision.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean farm Workers Plan to Sue Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary General of the Council Douglas Mutembwa told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the government was neglecting its role
as the new employer on farms it was acquiring in the resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
"The government must pay compensation to the farm workers or
give them retrenchment packages as their new employer," said
Mutembwa.
</P>
<P>
He said the organization was not against the land
redistribution process, but wanted the government to honor its
responsibility according to the Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
He said they considered the action taken by the government to
ignore the farm workers as illegal retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Relations Act stipulates that in case of a transfer
of ownership of an enterprise, the person who acquires the
enterprise becomes the new employer to the workers.
</P>
<P>
He said as the new employer, the government should comply with
contractual agreements made between the former employers and the
employees.
</P>
<P>
vice-president Joseph Msika's secretary Frederick Chunga told
the national news agency that the government had put in place
policies to cater for farm workers.
</P>
<P>
Mutembwa said,"People can come up with policies, but the fact
remains that the white farms' workers are suffering. The
government is resettling people while it is displacing others."
</P>
<P>
More than 240,000 white farms' workers are estimated to lose
employment because of the fast track land reform program expected
to finish before the rain season starts at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
The government has embarked on the land reform process to
correct the historical imbalance in which only 4,500 white farmers
own more than 70 percent of arable land with the majority of the
12.5 million people squashed on unproductive land.

Chairman of the association Willard Zireva said in a statement
that business had slowed and some retailers had been forced to
close shop because the disposable incomes of customers had been
eroded by inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Customers do not have money to spend and there has been a
reduction in performance across the retail sector," he said.

"Demand on the same dollar has increased as people face
increases in electricity and transport costs, food, telephone

The increase in the prices of some commodities had resulted
from a shortage of foreign currency which was needed to import raw

A critical foreign currency shortage has been gripping the

<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has concluded
arrangements to repatriate its nationals from neighboring Guinea
after accusing security forces there of mistreating them, said a
source reaching here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The source quoted a statement from Liberia's information
ministry as saying that Liberians were being subjected to "
inhumane treatment" in Guinea as the relations between the two
countries became tense over the cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The statement follows reports of an incursion by armed bandits
into Guinea, allegedly from Liberia and Sierra Leone. Guinea had
reportedly sent military reinforcements to the border areas to
increase security, following a series of rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has earlier asked Guinea to call back its charge d'
affaires after Liberia's ambassador was refused entry to Guinea
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has charged Guinea of supporting rebels to launch cross-
border attacks in its northern Lofa county, while Guinea denied
the accusation.

<P>
Walta Information Center of Ethiopia reported Saturday that in
a meeting held recently in Axum town, about 600 km north of Addis
Ababa, the Italian team proposed that the obelisk should be cut
into three pieces for the convenience of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian side have consented to the proposal, said Jara
Hailemariam, head of the Ethiopian Heritage Research and
Protection Organization.
</P>
<P>
The 28-meter-high Axum obelisk, one of the most famous
Ethiopian historical relics, was looted by Italian troops during
their occupation of Ethiopia between 1936 and 1941.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that experts of the two countries had also
discussed the availability of transport infrastructure and the
mode of transportation, as well as the provision of other
machinery for the safe handling of the obelisk, and have agreed
that these facilities could be provided by the Ethiopian side,
Jara said.
</P>
<P>
However, Jara noted that the two sides had not decided when the
whole process should be started. Further consultations are to be

Commenting on the possibility of a stay-away if the government
fails to take heed of the union's demand, Zindoga said, "We are
testing the waters. We will cross the bridge when we come there as
at the moment we are concerned with negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He added the government should restore order on commercial
farms by removing war veterans who have occupied about 1,500 white

In a written speech delivered at Riga International Airport

have been developing smoothly, and mutual understanding and trust
have been expanding, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Urge More Oil Production to Reduce Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance
ministers on Saturday urged the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase oil production so as to
reduce prices.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement available here that
they considered the current level of oil prices was a source of
major concern and that the rise in oil prices had to be dealt with
as the OPEC has promised by increased production leading to a
lower price.
</P>
<P>
"Oil prices need to return to a level that preserves worldwide
growth," the ministers said in their statement issued after their
meeting at Versailles.
</P>
<P>
The EU finance ministers did not say what oil price they wanted.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers, however, said that their governments
would not change their policy on oil taxation for economic and
environmental reasons.
</P>
<P>
The rising oil prices and hence fuel prices have led to public
unrest in several EU countries. Truck drivers in France set up
road blockades to protest against the rising fuel prices. They
were later joined by farmers and taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
Across the border in Germany and across the channel in Britain,
truck drivers also took to the streets and blocked fuel depots to
protest.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian truck drivers' union is organizing a downtown
driving demonstration in the capital city of Brussels on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities have earlier moved to cut down the
taxation on fuels to calm the protesters, yet the latter would
like to pressure for more cuts on fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing of oil prices posted since early 1999 has
triggered a debate in the EU on the crude oil prices, refining and
distribution as well as taxation on oil products, the three
components of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials would hold the tight production quota by the
OPEC responsible for the rising crude oil prices that in turn had
lead to rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in February
this year following an uninterrupted rise since December 1998 when
the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Long-Term Solutions vs. Peso Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
now drawing up long-term measures that would involve the banking
sector and the public to further strengthen the peso against
speculative trading.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora disclosed this plan Saturday
as he called on banks not to sell too much U.S. dollars to
multinational corporations which, he said, can eat up as much as
three months' supply of dollars in one transaction, the
Philippines News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank of the Philippines can do that but the other
banks must also play a role," Zamora said, referring to the fight
against speculators.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the central bank finally turned to its dollar
reserves to intervene in the market to prop up the peso, improving
its standing from P45.90 to P45.50 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
But Zamora said the government cannot continue dipping into its
dollar reserves to ward off speculative trading and must come up
with a long-term program to discourage this practice.
</P>
<P>
The government has over 15 billion dollars in gross
international reserves, the highest in the country's financial
history.
</P>
<P>
"Those speculative ventures against the peso must be stopped,"
Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said the government is careful to make sure
that its intervention to prop up the peso's value would not
distort market operations.
</P>
<P>
He said last week's intervention should be a signal that while
the economy remains market-driven, the government will not allow
speculators to pull down the peso's value artificially.
</P>
<P>
Zamora assured the public that the central bank continues to
maintain a delicate balance in its intervention in the market to
defend the peso.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Currency Assets Jump Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The fall in India's foreign
currency assets (FCA) has finally been arrested after more than
eight weeks of continuous decline, with the assets rising by 111
million U.S. dollars to 32.787 billion dollars during the week
ended September 1, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the increase in the FCA, the country's foreign
currency reserves also inched up by 17 million dollars to 35.619
billion U.S. dollars, the PTI quoted the Reserve Bank of India in
Mumbai as saying in its weekly statistical supplement.
</P>
<P>
While the special drawing rights remained static at two million
dollars, gold reserves were down by 94 million dollars to 190
million dollars, the supplement added.
</P>
<P>
India's foreign currency reserves had kept on falling almost
throughout August as the country's currency rupees depreciated
sharply against U.S. dollar, leading to a strong dollar demand in
the foreign exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Export 160,000 Cubic Meters of Wood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government decided to
use 160,000 cubic meters of wood to make wooden products for
export this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, which was signed by Deputy Prime Minister
Nguyen Cong Tan, about 300,000 cubic meters of wood will be logged
from natural forests in 2000 and the volume will be maintained
annually for the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam currently has 19.03 million hectares (ha) of forest. Of
the total acreage, 8.25 million ha are covered with natural
forests and 1.05 million ha, with plantations.
</P>
<P>
Natural forests shrink by between 70,000 ha and 80,000 ha every
year, threatening the habitats of many forest animals. Only nine
percent of natural forests are capable of yielding an average 150
cubic meters of wood per ha; 33 percent, 80-150 cubic meters of
wood; and the rest, very little.
</P>
<P>
To preserve and develop natural forests, Vietnamese government
has controlled their exploitation and has tended to close them off.

this year before ending the losing streak with a first-round
victory over Greg Rusedski at Wimbledon. His other victory came
the next week when he defeated Sergi Brugera at Gstaad.

Spadea, 26, played for the U.S. Davis Cup team in July, losing
to Juan Carlos Ferrero as Spain blanked the United States 5-0.

<HEADLINE> Yak Research Draws World Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Research on yaks and plateau
environment by Chinese scientists has drawn world attention.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 scholars from 17 countries and international
organizations participated in the third International Symposium on
Yaks, which concluded today in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Yaks live on high and cold plateaus, and provide a source of
meat, dairy and woolen products. China has over 12 million yaks,
or 85 percent of yaks found in the world.
</P>
<P>
The research on the animal started in China in the 1970s,
concentrated in Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, Gansu and Xinjiang, the
major production areas of yaks.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have extracted photosensitive material from
the bone of yaks. And a kind of enzyme took from yak blood can be
used to make high-quality cosmetics and food additives.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers also found that the meat of yak has high
content of protein and is low in fat.
</P>
<P>
Denis Hoffmann, a representative from the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organization, said China's research on yaks will
be helpful to study about disease prevention in the animal
husbandry, grassland development, protection of genetic resources
and eco-system.
</P>
<P>
There are over 20 enterprises in Tibet dealing in yak products
from meat and fur processing to yak horn handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
The symposium has strengthened yak research and industry
development, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Manila Welcomes Release of 4 European Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
welcomed Saturday the release of four European hostages by the Abu
Sayyaf, but expressed concern for the safety of one Filipino and
two French journalists still held by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the four hostages were freed. But we are
concerned about the remaining captives. We are hopeful they will
be released soon," Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman
Ricardo uno said in a terse statement.
</P>
<P>
The four Europeans freed Saturday afternoon -- two Finns, one
French and one German -- were among the original group of 21
hostages seized by the Abu Sayyaf on Malaysia's resort island of
Sipadan on April 23 and later brought to the southern Philippine
island of Jolo, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
But the Abu Sayyaf left behind one Filipino, the last remaining
hostage of the Sipadan group, and two French TV journalists
abducted in Jolo in July while covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said in the
southern city of Zmboanga after securing the release of the four
Europeans that he would communicate with the Abu Sayyaf Saturday
night over the release of the Filipino and the two French
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, together with Libyan envoy Rajab Azzarouq, escorted
the four Europeans from Jolo to Zamboanga and turned them over to
the ambassadors of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The four were later flown to the central city of Cebu, where
they would stay overnight before flying to Libya on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out Saturday morning in Jolo between one faction
of the Abu Sayaf led by Ghlib Andang, better known as Commander
Robot, and Mujib Susukan and another faction led by Abu Sabar and
a certain Commander Randy over whether to release four or all the
six European hostages.
</P>
<P>
The faction of Commander Robot reportedly wanted to free only
the four Europeans of the Sipadan group it held while the faction
of Abu Sabar wanted the two French journalists in its hands to be
released together with the four.
</P>
<P>
A team of government negotiators going to Jolo to secure the
release of the hostages was caught in the cross-fire of the
factional fighting, which killed one bodyguard of the negotiating
team and wounded five others.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Release of Hostage by Philippine Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Saturday hailed the release of French hostage Stephane
Loisy by the Philippine Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"This happy news marks the end of his ordeal that undergone
with courage and dignity on the part of his parents and brother,"
said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said France is making efforts to
seek the release of two other French hostages -- two journalists
working for France 2 TV channel Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland
Madura -- who are still held by the rebels of Abu Sayyaf in the
southern Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac Saturday called the families of
the two journalists, expressing his determination to seek their
release in a safe and sound condition.
</P>
<P>
A Libyan mediator in the hostage crisis said on the same day
that the rebels will release the two journalists within 24 hours,
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the Gaddafi Foundation in Tripoli as saying that a
Libyan plane will fly to the Philippines on Saturday to bring four
newly released hostages, including Stephane Loisy, to Tripoli.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Pulls out of Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- British 400m runner Mark
Richardson is out of the Olympic Games, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation confirmed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
IAAF media director Giorgio Reineri revealed it had been agreed
between the lawyers of both camps that Richardson's case should be
delayed until after the Games.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old runner tested positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone in October 1999 but was cleared of any wrong-doing by
UK Athletics in July.
</P>
<P>
However the IAAF ordered Richardson's case appear before their
Court of Arbitration - initially announcing it would be presided
on before the Olympics began on September 15.
</P>
<P>
But both parties require more time to get their documentation
prepared in the proper manner, meaning Richardson will miss the
Games.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the IAAF said: "A request from UK Athletics to
adjourn the arbitration hearing of the British 400m runner Mark
Richardson has been accepted.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF raised no objection to the request from UK Athletics
and noted that Mark Richardson will not compete in the 2000
Olympic Games."

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Foreign IPR Protection, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China reiterated today that it
will intensify the protection of foreign intellectual property
rights (IPR), and deal harshly with activities involving
counterfeit well-known trademarks in the world.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MFTEC) told foreign participants to Fourth China Fair
for International Investment and Trade, which opened here Friday,
that China's economy has developed rapidly over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the official pointed out, activities involving
counterfeit trademarks remains a serious problem. A survey on 146
foreign-funded enterprises, carried out by the development and
research center under the State Council, revealed that these
enterprises suffered a loss of 1.6 billion yuan from counterfeit
products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the encroachment of foreign IPR has also
damaged the Chinese economy seriously, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has established a legal
system which protects the IPR..
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China has launched a campaign to
crack down on activities involving encroachment of IPR and
pirating, and activities to protect trademarks and IPR. China will
take more severe measures to deal with such illegal activities in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The official said China is revising and perfecting its laws on
patent, trademark and copyright, in accordance with the basic
rules of the World Trade Organizations (WTO). China's judicial and
administrative departments have also taken timely and effective
measures to crack down on activities involving copyright
infringements.
</P>
<P>
The China Association of Foreign-funded Enterprises said more
significant measures are being taken to crack down on local
protectionism to deal with activities involving pirating and
making fake commodities.

<P>
Foreign investors have set up a group of research and
development centers in China, including 14 in Shanghai, which are
mainly engaged in chemistry, automobiles, and medicine. Beijing
has 20 in the computer, software and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
The research and development centers have played an active role
in expanding China's foreign economic cooperation, promoting the
development of high-tech industries, and in encouraging
multinationals to invest in China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that concerned departments in China will take a
series of practical measures, grant preferential treatment and set
up a special fund to encourage foreign business people to set up
research and development centers in China.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Office for Criminal Appeals Set up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A new prosecution office
handling criminal appeals has been established in the Supreme
People's Procuratorate (SPP) to help maintain justice for people
wronged by judicial bodies.
</P>
<P>
The problem is still serious that people have little means to
lodge complaints against judiciaries, Han Zhubin, procurator-
general of the SPP, said here today at a national conference.
</P>
<P>
He urged the new office to serve justice to people whose cases
has been misjudged or never brought to court for criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"It is against the law to ignore criminal appeals, or not to
correct misjudged cases," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that criminal appeals handled by procuratorates
has been rising steadily every year in the past decade, which
reached to 8,699 in 1999, 77.7 percent up from 1990.
</P>
<P>
Of the appeals handled in the past 10 years, 12,024 have been
redressed.
</P>
<P>
However, according to He Yehui, head of the new office, a
considerable amount of criminal appeals have never been assessed
by prosecutors, and the situation is worse at grassroots levels
who are reluctant to handle appeals from the area under their own
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, many people have been lodging complaints to
higher level procuratorates and make them to busy to handle all
cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Han said today that all criminal appeals must be re-examined
through legal procedures, and a timetable for the re-examination
should be formulated by all procuratorates.

<HEADLINE> 2nd lead: Four Remaining Sipadan European Hostages Freed EDS Update With Details, Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The freed four European
hostages arrived in the southern city of Zamboanga Saturday
afternoon after more than four months of ordeal in the Abu Sayyaf'
s jungle lair in nearby Jolo island, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
They arrived by helicopter at the Edwin Andrews air base in
Zamboanga at around 5:30 p.m., under the escort of Philippine
government chief negotiator Robert Aventajao, Libyan envoy Rajab
Azzarouq and Sulu governor Abdusakur Tan, the ABS-CBN TV station
reported.
</P>
<P>
At the air base, Aventajado formally turned over the four --
two Finns, one French and one German -- to the ambassadors of
their countries.
</P>
<P>
The four were among the original group of 21 hostages seized by
the Abu Sayyaf on Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23
and later brought to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
An excited German Marc Wallert, whose parents were released
separately earlier, expressed his thanks for everyone who cares
about them, saying he couldn't describe his feeling at the moment.
</P>
<P>
One of the Finns, Risto Mirco Vahanen, said he would "kiss the
earth of Finland."
</P>
<P>
Calling "a nightmare" their near 140 days of captivity in the
rebels' jungle lair in Jolo, he extended his sincere thanks to
Aventajado and Azzarouq and all those who worked hard to " safely
bring us out of terror."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held later at the air base,
Aventajado said Saturday is a happy day, but "let's not forget the
mission is not over and there are still two French journalists not
released."
</P>
<P>
The two French journalists were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf in
Jolo in July while covering the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Azzarouq, on his part, said they would continue to work for the
release of the two French journalists and one Filipino, the last
remaining hostage of the Sipadan group still in the hands of the
Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish, French and German ambassadors expressed their
gratitude to the Philippine government and Aventajado and Azzarouq
for their efforts in securing the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
They also thanked for Libyan involvement in solving the hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The four Europeans were later flown to the central city of Cebu
where a chartered Libyan plane will reportedly fly them to the
Libyan capital of Tripoli Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Libya had agreed to pay 1
million U.S. dollars each for the six foreign hostages in addition
to an earlier offer of 25 million dollars in ransom to the Abu
Sayyaf for the release of their hostages.
</P>
<P>
But both Tripoli and Manila have denied that they paid any
ransoms. Libyan said its funds were for livelihood projects for
Muslim areas in Mindanao in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said factional fighting in the Abu Sayyaf broke
out Saturday morning in Jolo, raising fears that the Europeans'
release would be delayed again after the rebel group postponed its
promised release of six European hostages on Friday for reported
disagreement over ransom.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out around 10 a.m. between one faction of the
Abu Sayyaf led by Ghlib Andang, better known as Commander Robot,
and Mujib Susukan and another faction led by Abu Sabar and a
certain Commander Randy over whether to release four or all the
six European hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The faction of Commander Robot reportedly wanted to free only
the remaining four Sipandan hostages it held while the faction of
Abu Sabar wanted its two captives, the two French journalists
abducted in Jolo in July, released together with the four Sipadan
hostages.
</P>
<P>
A team of government emissaries going to Jolo to secure the
release of the hostages was caught in the cross-fire between two
factions of the Abu Sayyaf in Talipao town, Jolo, which killed one
bodyguard of the negotiating team and wounded five others.

<HEADLINE> Famine Situation in Kenya Still Bad: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The famine situation in Kenya
is still severe and persistent with at least 3.3 million people
being directly affected, the People daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Kenya's National Drought Response
Committee Chairman Uhuru Kenyatta as saying at the closure of a
drought preparedness intervention and recovery program that the
number of people succumbing to hunger continues to rise,
especially in the pastoral and marginal districts.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is experiencing the worst drought over the past 40 years,
resulting in food shortage after crop failure for three successive
harvesting seasons, power rationing nationwide and water rationing
in cities.
</P>
<P>
The stocks in the national food reserve are declining at a
worrying rate, Kenyatta said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the nutritional status of most of the population
in the country, particularly children and women, has worsened,
thus making them vulnerable to diseases.
</P>
<P>
Uhuru appealed for more food aid, saying the situation is yet
to be brought to manageable levels and the current food shortage
has pushed prices beyond the reach of susceptible groups.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mobile Commerce Emerging as New Business Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The explosive growth seen in
both mobile phone and Internet sector over the past five years
indicates that the booming electronic commerce is quickly
advancing to the stage of mobile commerce.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the enormous profound effects of the progression toward
3G and mobile Internet on the business world, the Hong Kong
Industrial Technology Center Corporation organized the Business &AMP;
Technology Exchange Forum on 3G &AMP; M-commerce earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
3G technology, which will give cell phones nearly five times
current bandwidth and the capability to carry video and CD-quality
sound, will transform mobile phones from simple voice
communication devices into pocket computers.
</P>
<P>
"Mobile phones and the Internet have quickly become
indispensable. Their combination presents us with some of the most
compelling business and lifestyle opportunities of the information
age," said Peter Y Lo, chief executive officer of the center.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of mobile phone subscribers
worldwide has increased from over 11 million in 1990 to over 400
million. By 2004 this figure will have exceeded one billion and
will surpass the number of fixed line subscribers. At about the
same time, the number of wireless devices accessing the Internet
will exceed the number of wired ones.
</P>
<P>
The high expectations for the value of wireless access to
Internet led to the intensity of bidding for 3G licenses in the
United Kingdom in April, when five companies paid a total of 33
billion U.S. dollars for spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Despite the size of this figure, which was ten times higher
than expected, it was dwarfed last month when Germany's spectrum
auction netted more than 46 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the telecommunication companies involved in these
auctions have come under fire for paying too much, the sums
involved point at the long-term value they all place in 3G
spectrum, and specifically the wireless Internet, with its promise
of high-speed data delivery, location-based services and global
interoperability.
</P>
<P>
NTT DoCoMo, a mobile phone operator, in the 18 months since its
launch, has captured the imagination and the wallets of more than
10 million subscribers, leap-frogging every fixed line ISP (
Internet Service Provider) to become Japan's largest ISP.
In Hong Kong, with a 61.5 percent mobile phone penetration rate,
the second highest in the world, it is forecast that there will be
nearly 3.5 million active wireless Internet users in five years.
Their use of data services alone is projected to generate more
than 450 million U.S. dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Voice, for so long the dominant paradigm in communications,
will continue to play an important role, but, as 3G becomes more
and more established, new services based on high speed data, video
and broadband technologies will begin to assume greater importance.

constitutional affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Saturday urged all 3.05 million registered voters to
cast their ballots at the Legislative Council (LegCo) Elections on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Suen pointed out that this year's LegCo Elections is another

He called on all voters to exercise their rights by electing
their representatives to the LegCo to serve for Hong Kong in the
future four years.
</P>
<P>

has to do is to mark a tick in the circle next to the list of
candidates he/she has chosen with a chop provided by polling staff.
</P>
<P>
In the Functional Constituencies elections, nine candidates had
been elected uncontested.
</P>
<P>
Except the Transport Functional Constituency, voters of the
remaining 18 Functional Constituencies should mark the ballot
papers with a chop provided by polling staff.
</P>
<P>
For the Election Committee election, each voter is required to
choose six candidates by shading in black the ovals against the
names of the six candidates of his/her choice with a pen provided
by polling staff.
</P>
<P>
A total of 522 polling stations have been set up throughout the
Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat in Japan Spy Scandal Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) - A Russian diplomat involved in a
recent scandal of alleged spying activities in Japan has flown
home, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether military attache of the Russian
Embassy Andrei Bogatenkov left Japan voluntarily or was expelled
by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Japanese police arrested Shigehiro Hagisaki, a
38-year-old retired naval officer currently working for the
national institute of defense research, on suspicion of selling
classified information to Russian intelligence, Russian media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has yet to decide whether to deport a Japanese diplomat
in retaliation, Interfax quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Losyukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia "must act very carefully here, look into all
circumstances and make a balanced decision with the context of
Russian-Japanese relations taken into account among other things,"
Losyukov said.
</P>
<P>
The term of Bogatenkov's mission "has nearly expired and he was
about to leave Japan regardless of the scandal," the deputy
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The arrest took place in a Tokyo restaurant where Hagisaki met
with Bogatenkov to whom, according to Japanese police, the naval
officer had been handing over classified information for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
The previous similar incident in relations between Moscow and
Tokyo took place 20 years ago, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Four Remaining Sipadan European Hostages Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf freed Saturday
afternoon the four remaining European hostages it kidnapped from
Malaysia in April, the local ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent a helicopter to the southern island of
Jolo from nearby Zamboanga city to fetch the four Europeans, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The four -- two Finns, one French and one German, were among
the original group of 21 hostages seized by the Abu Sayyaf on
Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23 and later brought
to Jolo, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Finnish, French and German ambassadors to the Philippines are
reportedly now in Zamboanga waiting for the arrival of their
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said factional fighting in the Abu Sayyaf broke
out Saturday morning in Jolo, raising fears that their release
would be delayed again after the rebel group postponed its
promised release of six European hostages on Friday for reported
disagreement over ransom.
</P>
<P>
A team of government negotiators going to Jolo to secure the
release of the hostages was caught in the cross-fire between two
factions of the Abu Sayyaf in Talipao town, Jolo, which killed one
bodyguard of the negotiating team and wounded five others, the ABS-
CBN said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out around 10 a.m. between one faction of the
Abu Sayyaf led by Ghlib Andang, better known as Commander Robot,
and Mujib Susukan and another faction led by Abu Sabar and a
certain Commander Randy over whether to release four or all the
six European hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf for months in its
jungle lairs in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The faction of Commander Rbot reportedly wanted to free only
the remaining four Sipandan hostages it held while the faction of
Abu Sabar wanted its two captives, the two French journalists
abducted in Jolo in July, released together with the four Sipadan
hostages.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf is still holding one Filipino, the last
of the Sipandan hostages, the two French journalists and 12
Christian evangelists who went to the rebel camps in July to pray
for the hostages.

<HEADLINE> PLO Discusses Declaration of Palestinian State EDS -- Updates with details, backgrounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Council of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) started its meetings here
Saturday to discuss whether or not to declare an independent
Palestinian state on September 13 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Council will review a detailed report submitted by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the latest developments of the
political situation, the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
Arafat's recent world tour to rally support for the declaration of
the statehood.
</P>
<P>
Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestinian National Council
(PNC), said on Friday it is likely that the Central Council will
postpone the declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Zanoun warned that he will resign from chairmanship of the PNC,
the Palestinian supreme power organ, if such a postponement is to
go beyond this year end.
</P>
<P>
The 129-member Central Council, which comprises all factions in
the PLO, called on all its members in the Palestinian territories
to attend the two-day meetings. However, just over 100 of the
Council members reported attended the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian groups opposing to the peace talks with Israel,
including the radical Islamic militant movement Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad, said they will boycott the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin attended the meetings of the Council
held in April 1999 as an observer. That meeting decided to postpone
the declaration of the statehood due to the Israeli general
elections in May that year.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has pledged to declare statehood on September 13, the
date fixed last year by Israel and the Palestinians to reach a
final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He has been under strong pressure from the United States and
Israel, who oppose a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
statehood, after a summit between the three sides in the U.S. in
July failed to produce an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Plans Railway to Link Indian Ocean via Tanzanian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is planning to
construct a railway to link its capital Kigali to the Isaka dry
port in western Tanzania to facilitate transportation from the
lank-locked country to the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania Zephyr Mutanguha,
his government is trying hard to convince donor countries to fund
the project.
</P>
<P>
He described the inauguration of the Isaka dry port in
Shinyanga Region Thursday as a major step forward for the economic
development in Rwanda, media here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"To enable the port to be of immense help to the common man in
Rwanda we are planning the railway line so as to reduce freight
costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Tanzania Railway Corporation and the Tanzania
Revenue Authority to ensure speedy, reliable and timely ferrying
of cargoes going through this port.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of handling 42,000 tons of break-bulk cargo and
13,000 twenty-foot containers annually, the Isaka port will be
able to effectively handle goods bound to and from Rwanda and two
other landlocked countries, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The three countries' sea-borne goods transportation via the
Isaka dry port via Tanzania's Central Railway to Dar es Salaam is
502 kilometers shorter than the existing northern corridor that
runs to Kenya's Indian coast city of Mombassa.
</P>
<P>
Cargo-handling time is expected to be reduced from the current
over 14 days to about five days and transportation costs by 40
percent, Tanzanian officials said.

<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian high jumper Vyacheslav
Voronin defeated some of his top rivals at the eve of the Sydney
Olympic Games when he won the Super Meet 2000 men's high jump
event with 2.33 meters in Yokohama, Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Voronin, the reigning world champion, beat Cuban world record
holder Javier Sotomayor at 2.28 meters and 1996 Atlanta gold medal
winner American Charles Austin at 2.31 meters in the final
athletics match before the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Voronin failed on his first two attempts at 2.33 meters but
soared over the bar on his third attempt and managed to safely
land on the crash mat's edge by a matter of centimeters.
</P>
<P>
"I am honored with my result today but I think at the Olympics,
I don't know what can happen," Voronin said.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, battling injuries after recently being reinstated
following a drug suspension, had two dismal attempts at 2.33
meters before scraping the bar on his third failed attempt.
</P>
<P>
"This year I am not aiming for a new world record because I
have been away for quite a long time. I hope to aim for 2.36 meter-
jump at Sydney," Sotomayor said, adding that he feels he is in
good shape going into Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Jonathan Edwards won the triple jump with a mark of
17.32 meters. Fellow Briton Larry Achike was a distant second at
16.56 meters and Chinese Gu Junjie third at 16.37.

<HEADLINE> Carrard: Doping Report Based on Old Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Francois Carrard, director-
general of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on
Saturday that a U.S.report criticising the organisation's record
on doping was out of date because it was based on a four-year-old
study.
</P>
<P>
The report, due to be released on Sunday, was leaked to New
York Times along with critical comments from the director of the U.
S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
"When the Games begin millions of children will watch every
event," McCaffrey was quoted as saying. "Unless we continue to rid
the Games of doping and drugs, these children will also take the
same drugs as they see their stars cheating with."
</P>
<P>
Carrard told a news conference on Saturday that although he
had not yet read the report he had been informed it was based on
research carried out in 1996 and might not reflect what was being
done now.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely convinced that the IOC, the international
federations and the NOC's (National Olympic Committees) are doing
the utmost and the most serious efforts to complete that fight,
and it is a most serious fight," he said. "We will see what
happens in Sydney."

<HEADLINE> 15 Export Processing Zones to Go in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua)-- A total of 15 export processing
zones (EPZs) will be put into operation in early October, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Detailed rules and regulations of the zones will also take
effects at the same time, said Zhao Guanghua, vice general
director of China Administration of Customs, on the Fourth China
Fair for Investment and Trade which opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
New overseas investors who plan to start processing trade in
China are the main customers of EPZs, said Gao Hucheng, assistant
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors could get efficient and convenient services
in EPZs, said Gao.
</P>
<P>
China is now trying to link up the EPZs with the world's free
trade zones, which will help the EPZs adopt the internationalized
management system.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade has covered many of China's industries at
present. The import and export volume of the processing trade
recorded 105.64 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year, up 29.3 percent over the same period last year and
accounting for 48.7 percent of the nation's total foreign trade
volume.

<HEADLINE> China to Remove Restrictions On Foreign Share-holding in FICEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businessmen now can
under certain conditions control foreign-invested commercial
enterprises (FICEs) in China, and China will gradually remove all
the restrictions on foreign share-holding in such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The process of removing the restrictions on foreign share-
holding will be completed within three years after China becomes a
full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said sources
from the State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, an economist with the SAIT, made his remarks at the
on-going fourth China Fair for International Investment and Trade,
which opened in the east port city of Xiamen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said, all of China's municipalities, provincial capitals
and relevant cities can set up FICEs, and foreign investors are
permitted to hold shares no more than 65 percent in the FICEs
provided that they run only three or less than three chain stores.
</P>
<P>
China has lifted the restrictions on the number and location of
foreign-invested retail sales enterprises. And China is studying
whether or not to impose restrictions on foreign investors in
large chain stores and storage shops.
</P>
<P>
China's first foreign-funded retail sales store went into
operation in Shanghai in 1995. So far, China has insisted that
Chinese side controls the major shares of such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A senior WTO official said that speeding up the development of
service sector in China is of great importance in creating more
jobs, absorbing surplus rural laborers, urbanization, taxation,
and in enriching the cultural life of the public, and in
readjusting the country's economic structure.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's service sector only accounts for 39 percent
of the national economy, far falling behind the world's average of
61 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guo Geping, chairman of the China Association for Chain Store
Management, said the inflow of foreign funds into China's retail
sales and other service sectors is helpful to revitalizing the
market, and is good for the development of domestic enterprises
while benefiting foreign investors themselves.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 300 FICEs, whose sales volume accounts
for 3 percent of the nation's total.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed on
Friday in a traffic accident in Iran's northeastern province of
Khorasan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Traffic police of the province said the accident happened on the
road linking the Qouchan city and provincial capital Mashhad when a
pick-up collided with a jeep running on the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred when the pick-up suddenly swerved to the
left.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are on the rise in Iran. Traffic experts believe
that the narrow roads, heavy traffic and non-observation of traffic
rules by drivers are the main reasons for deadly accidents.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted in this regard revealed that some 200,
000 accidents take place on Iranian highways each year, resulting
in the death of 15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Complete First Phase of Retrenchment Next Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government's first
phase of civil service retrenchment involving 25,780 civil
servants from 16 ministries including the Office of the President
will be completed by next Friday, Kenyan press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In total, 48,829 civil servants will have been retrenched by
June 2002 in order to create a leaner, more shipshape and
productive civil service, said Kenyan Cabinet Minister William ole
Ntimama on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now has a total of over 215,000 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"The government expenditure must be restrained in order to free-
up capital for private sector investment that will create new
employment," Ntimama said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, each retrenched will receive a
severance payment of 40,000 shillings (about 520 U.S. dollars)
which the government could afford, plus their lump-sum pension and
a monthly pension for life.
</P>
<P>
The government will organize training for all the retirees to
prepare them psychologically and equip them with basic knowledge
and skills to enable them to utilize their retirement benefits, he
explained, saying that the training of the retrenched will kick
off from next Monday at 200 centers nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Appeals for Release of Suspended Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has called on
the international financial institutions to release more than 1
billion U.S. dollars which were promised as development assistance
before the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The aid was suspended during the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict,
but the two countries already signed a ceasefire agreement in June
this year, Ethiopia's Ministry of Economic Development and
Cooperation said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The aid suspension vastly affected projects such as food
security, education and road construction which had been supported
by the donor community as priority areas for poverty alleviation,"
said Gezazhew Bizuayehu, a ranking official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the average foreign development aid that the sub-
Saharan African countries receive is between 30 and 40 U.S.
dollars per capita, Bizuayehu complained that foreign aid to
Ethiopia has fallen from 12 U.S. dollars per capita before its war
with Eritrea broke out to eight U.S. dollars per person..
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia gets development assistance mainly from the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union
and western countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Propose Fare Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Four major U.S. airlines
have added new fuel surcharges, amounting to a 20 U.S. dollars
increase, on domestic round-trip fares.
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines moved first, posting the higher domestic
fares Thursday. By Friday, TWA and the nation's three largest
carriers - United, American and Delta Air Lines - had indicated
they would match the increase.
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines, the country's No. 4 carrier, said it was
watching the situation. Analysts said Northwest could torpedo the
surcharge increase by refusing to go along.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Airways Group Inc., the sixth-largest carrier, had not
matched the surcharge, a spokesman said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It's been something that has been thought about for months as
we've watched the costs of fuel rise and rise and rise. But it's
also because of the other airlines raising their prices at the
same time," said TWA spokeswoman Julia Bishop-Cross.
</P>
<P>
Jet fuel prices have been rising along with the price of crude
oil, which reached 10-year highs this week. Crude oil futures
closed at 33.6 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange Friday, down from as much as 35.4 dollars, as prices
slipped from recent decade highs. Fuel is the airline industry's
second-greatest cost, after labor.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predict that the additional charge could push
more travelers, especially families, to secondary airports served
by discount carriers. For example, when surcharges are included,
fares from Washington's two airports to San Diego are now nearly
double the fares from Southwest's hub at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- British swimmer James Hickman
has decided to withdraw from the Olympic 200 meters individual
medley event so as to focus on the 100m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
The British team said that the 24-year-old had decided to
restrict himself to three events at the Games -- the 100 and 200
meters butterfly and the 4x100 meters medley relay.
</P>

According to the schedule, the 100 meters butterfly semifinal
is on the same night as the 200 meters individual medley final and
Hickman believes he has a far greater chance to win in the
butterfly event.
</P>

He took a silver medal in the 200 meter butterfly and a bronze
in the 100 butterfly at July's European championships in Helsinki.
He was last in the 200 individual medley final.
</P>

Hickman, a 200 meters individual medley finalist at the 1998
world championships, will not be replaced in the event as he was

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has approved the
establishment of 11 state economic and technological development
zones (ETDZs) in its central and western region this year,
bringing the total number of such zones in the region to 16.
</P>
<P>
These zones are expected to play an active role in the
development of western region, and in the promotion of the co-
ordinated development of regional economies, according to sources
with the on-going fourth China Fair for International Investment
and Trade, which opened in this port city in east China's Fujian
Province on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has 43 state-level ETDZs, which have
attracted foreign investments of more than 32 billion U.S. dollars,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period this year, the state ETDZs
produced a GDP of 73.95 billion yuan (8.9 billion U.S. dollars), a
tax revenue of 13.29 billion yuan (1.6 billion U.S. dollars), and
a trade volume of 14.63 billion U.S. dollars, or 6.76 percent of
the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months, the state ETDZs attracted a
contractual foreign investment of 3.8 billion U.S. dollars, and
the amount of foreign funds used was 1.81 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, Algeria Resume Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Algeria have decided to
resume full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level seven
years after their ties were severed, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in New York on Friday by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and his Algerian counterpart Abdulaziz Boutafliqua
on the sidelines of the United Nations millenium summit held
September 6-8.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents issued a joint statement announcing to resume
full relations starting Saturday after meeting in "a very cordial
and frank atmosphere," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the two heads of state reviewed
international issues of interest of their countries and respective
regions, in particular those of the Middle East and the Maghreb.
</P>
<P>
Khatami and Boutafliqua also exchanged views on the political
developments occurring in the Arab world and the Islamic community.
They "recognized the strength of the bonds tying their countries
through Islam and the Islamic civilization," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran and Algeria's memberships in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the statement stressed that both
countries "wage a common struggle" for the same economic interests.
</P>
<P>
The two countries broke off ties in 1993 after the African
nation accused Iran of supporting the Islamic Salvation Front, the
major opposition of the Algerian government. The charges were
denied by Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Supply Zambia Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan government has
offered to supply Zambia with crude oil and petroleum products as
a way of enhancing economic cooperation between the two countries,
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Libya has a desire to invest in Zambia in different fields,
said Libyan ambassador to Zambia, Khalifa Omar Swieyi, while
speaking at celebrations to mark Libya's 31st independence
anniversary Thursday evening in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard Libya agreed to supply Zambia with its needs of
crude oil and petroleum products," he said, adding that a Libyan
delegation will soon arrive in Zambia to study other investment
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Zambian Energy and Water Development Minister David
Saviye called on Libya to provide assistance in the energy sector
especially in oil exploration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Make Progress in Finding Blood Alternative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the
University of Southern California (USC) said Friday that they are
using a polymer coating to make red blood cells compatible for
universal donation.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal is to take this technology and apply it to
the whole blood supply so that every unit of blood that's given in
the United States would be converted to a universal type before
transfusion," said Dr. Timothy Fisher, an assistant professor in
the department of physiology and biophysics at USC's Keck School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"The polymer coating hides the blood group antigens so that the
recipient's immune system can't recognize the foreign blood cells.
" he added.
</P>
<P>
About 14 million units of blood are transfused every year in
the United States, but shortages typically peak in the summer,
during holidays and illness outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that, even when supplies of donated blood are
plentiful, there still may be risks. More than 300,000 people
contracted Hepatitis C from contaminated blood transfusions before
a test was developed to screen the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
In laboratory research, scientists Meiselman, Fisher and a
colleague, Jon Armstrong, have used polyethylene glycol, or PEG,
to mask blood type and protect the red cells from attack by the
immune system.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the coating is similar to the substance
used to make soft contact lenses. It acts as a barrier, but is
still able to allow oxygen and small molecules to pass through and
diffuse to other cells -- a normal cell function.
</P>
<P>
The thin barrier also provides a "non-stick" coating for the
red blood cells, allowing them to slide past one another and glide
across blood-vessel walls to deliver oxygen to the tissues.
</P>
<P>
"Polymer coating prevents red blood cells from sticking to each
other and the artery wall, so it could also be useful in patients
who had had heart attack, stroke or vessel disease," said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary tests also have shown the compound may be useful in
treating sickle cell anemia by thinning the blood to increase flow
and oxygen-delivery capacity. Tests in humans, however, could be
at least five years away, the researchers estimated.

<HEADLINE> Kodak, Sharp to Jointly Manufacture Digital Camera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Eastman Kodak Co. and
Japan's Sharp Corp. have agreed to jointly manufacture digital
cameras, said Kodak Friday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Sharp will be the original equipment
manufacturer in Japan for "lower-end" cameras to be sold in the
United States under the Kodak brand name. Terms of the agreement,
however, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking expansion of the (digital camera) line into
lower-end cameras," priced under 200 U.S. dollars, said Kodak
spokesman Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's new line of digital cameras will be used largely for
sending digital images via electronic mail or for posting on Web
pages, Allen said. Previously Kodak had focused on pricier, high-
resolution, mega-pixel digital cameras for high-quality prints.
</P>
<P>
Both companies said they would seek to expand the alliance into
new products in the future. Analysts noted that the deal is the
first of its kind for Kodak and Sharp.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Strengthening of U.N. in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has called for
strengthening of the U.N. organization while entering the new
millennium, saying that by doing so it will be able to cope with
new challenges and new realities.
</P>
<P>
In his statement given at the Millennium Summit in New York on
Thursday, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung stressed the
paramount importance of the role played by the U.N., calling for
reform of the organization without weakening the principles and
charters of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The cardinal principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity,
sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs
have enabled the world community to live in peace with one another,
he pointed out, disagreeing with those who contend that these
principles are outdated and that it does not need them in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the summit would once again reaffirm the cardinal
principles of international conduct, saying that these principles
have served well in the old millennium and will serve equally in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is no single formula that could be
applied to all countries, warning that there would be a mistake
for powerful countries to impose their systems on others and mold
the developing countries in their own image.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Myanmar is building a genuine and durable
democratic system in its own way, saying that in Myanmar "the
flames of conflicts have been extinguished, the guns have been
silenced."
</P>
<P>
He charged the opposition forces in the country with embarking
on a path of destruction and confrontation, warning that these
acts could only impede the process of democratization of the
country.

<HEADLINE> EU Panel Suggests Ending Sanctions Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 8 (Xinhua) - The panel of outside experts
appointed by the European Union (EU) suggested on Friday that the
seven-month-old political sanctions imposed by the EU against the
Austrian government for allowing the ultra-right Freedom Party
into the coalition government be lifted.
</P>
<P>
"The Austrian government's respect in particular for the rights
of minorities, refugees and immigrants is not inferior to that of
the other European Union member states," the panel said in a
report submitted to French President Jacques Chirac, whose country
currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas, particularly concerning the rights of national
minorities, Austrian standards can be considered to be higher than
those applied in many other EU countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it added, it is still correct to describe the
Freedom Party, which entered the government in February, as an
ultra-right party "with radical elements."
</P>
<P>
It said the sanctions had been effective in upholding European
values, but they should end now.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the sanctions had incited nationalism in
Austria, and was misunderstood as a punishment against Austrians.
</P>
<P>
The panel's report received widespread welcome in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed by the EU on February 3, bar high-level
bilateral contacts with Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel's
government. In accordance with the sanctions announced by Portugal
on behalf of the EU, all bilateral meetings with the Austrian
government are to be suspended and any Austria-proposed candidate
seeking positions in international organizations will not be
supported.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Implement Pro-active Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bandar Seri Begawan, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance
Minister Xiang Huaicheng said Saturday the Chinese government
decided to continue the pro-active fiscal policy in 2000 with a
view to maintaining the growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to the coordination
between fiscal policy and monetary policy, thereby rendering the
latter more effective in optimizing macro-economic management, he
said at the on-going 7th APEC Finance Ministers Meeting which
opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a developing country, China must successfully
deal with the tripartite relationship between reform, development
and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said over the last two years, the monetary policy has played
a role in stimulating domestic demand and promoting sustainable
growth through bank intermediation for infrastructure development,
technical upgrading of enterprises, rural development, and
household consumption.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that in the first six months this year,
China's gross domestic product(GDP) grew by 8.2 percent, fixed
investment was up 11 percent, the aggregate retail sales went up
by 10.1 percent, the trade surplus amounted to 12.4 billion U.S.
dollars, the foreign exchange reserves stood at 158.6 billion U.S.
dollars by the end of June this year, and deflationary pressure
eased.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the growth momentum, China will increase the bond
issuance this year by RMB Yuan 50 billion (some 6 billion dollars)
as a follow up to the additional bond issuance of RMB Yuan 100
billion and 60 billion in 1998 and 1999 respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
In promoting economic growth through strengthening the marco-
economic management, the Chinese government has been closely
monitoring the macro-economic indicators to prevent possible
fiscal and financial risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a sound social security system is the
precondition of State-owned Enterprises' reform and social
stability, therefore the Chinese government has attached great
importance to building up the social security system and
readjusted the expenditure structure to ensure adequate spending
on priority items including social security.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's budget spending for social security registered
RMB Yuan 36 billion, 1.1 times as much as that for the previous
year, he said, adding that in 2000, budgetary funding for social
security is expected to be further increased by RMB Yuan 70.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
He said China's capital market will be better regulated and
broadened to provide reliable resources for the social security
system and at the same time, China will build a unified, standard
and sound social security system through enhancing the legal
framework and reforming the medical insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The minister said China has maintained the stability of its
currency since 1998, making contribution to the regional economy
in its efforts to overcome the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's steady growth momentum and forthcoming accession to WTO
will help promote its trade and investment relations with the rest
of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister pledged that China will continue to make
efforts to contribute to the economic recovery and development in
this region.

SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States Forces Korea (USFK) are discussing how to designate a part
of Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) for an inter-Korean area that Seoul
and Pyongyang can jointly manage, the Defense Ministry said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The area is needed for reconstruction of the railway line from
Seoul to Shinuiju in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) and a parallel road.
</P>
<P>
The entire DMZ is wholly under the control of the USFK in
accordance with the 1953 armistice agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both Seoul and Pyongyang are looking for a way to allow them to
efficiently manage the construction project without violating the
agreement, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The USFK made it clear late last month that the reconstruction
work on the railway and the road should be completed within the
framework of the cease-fire treaty, and the South expressed a
willingness to comply with it.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Urges Indonesia to Disarm Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday urged the Government of Indonesia to
immediately disarm and disband the militiamen in West Timor of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution which was unanimously adopted, the 15-member
security council also called on Indonesia to restore law and
ensure safety and security in the refugee camps and for
humanitarian workers in West Timor, and to prevent cross-border
incursions by the militia into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
A group of militiamen against the independence of East Timor on
Wednesday stormed the local office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) in West Timor and killed three
UNHCR workers.
</P>
<P>
The incident forced the U.N. agency to suspend its aid
activities for an estimated 100,000 East Timorese refugees in West
Timor, who fled their homes amid chaos following the U.N.-brokered
referendum in August 1999, which turned to be in favor of East
Timor's independence.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed that those responsible for the attack on
international personnel in West and East Timor must be brought to
justice.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the Indonesian authorities to take immediate
and effective measures to ensure the safe return of refugees who
choose to go back to East Timor and stressed the need for parallel
programs to resettle individuals who choose not to return.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed that UNHCR workers cannot return to West
Timor until there is a credible security guarantee, including real
progress towards disarming and disbanding the militias.
</P>
<P>
The council underlined the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor should respond robustly to the
militia threat in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to dispatch as soon as possible a mission to
the region to discuss the implementation of this resolution.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Charges Foreigners with Jeopardizing Education Pursuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-
General Khin Nyunt Friday charged some 15 foreigners with
jeopardizing the present peaceful pursuit of education in the
country in collusion with the opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the Year 2000 International
Literacy Day, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State

up discussions on education at the party's headquarters on August
21 and having it videotaped and distributed to other countries,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt further accused the foreigners of masterminding
plans to dampen the enthusiasm and spirit of the students and the
people, and create difficulties for the country's Education for
All, continuing education, education improvement programs and its
related special four-year plan.
</P>
<P>
He warned against such flagrant interference in the internal
affairs of Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Ends Operation in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday that its
activities had come to an end in relation to the voluntary return
of the Guatemalans and related programs.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said in a communique that all its programs during the
last nine years were carried out in coordination with the
Guatemalan government and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony to officially declare the end of the UNHCR
programs, a UNHCR official said several programs had been
implemented to help refugees who had returned to Guatemala. These
programs started with negotiations on a voluntary repatriation of
some 8,000 families, or 43,000 people.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months after their return, each family
received food, agriculture implements, accommodation and medical
assistance. The UNHCR also helped Guatemala in infrastructure
development, including road building.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fleeing their country's civil
war started to flock into Mexico and the United States in 1981.
The war came to an end in late 1996 after the government and
rebels reached a peace agreement, leaving behind 200,000 people
being killed or missing.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The interior ministers of 11
former Soviet states Friday signed an agreement on jointly
combating terrorism, religious extremism and organized crimes in
Central Asia at the end of their three-day meeting in Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Amid a spate of terrorist incursions into the region, the
ministers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) also

terrorism among their countries, Interfax news agency quoted
Russian First Deputy Interior Minister Valery Federov as saying
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, convened in the Cholpon-Ata resort of Kyrgyzstan,
came against the backdrop that international terrorist activities
in Chechnya have become rampant and already spilt over to Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Federov urged the CIS, which groups all the former Soviet
states except the three Baltic nations, to intensify their efforts
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that combating across-border drug trafficking was
another topic of the meeting.
</P>

no chance, Pederov said.

<HEADLINE> Chile To Present Swordfish Case Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile and the European Union,
the latter representing the Spanish fishing fleet, will present
their cases in the swordfish dispute before the High Seas Court on
September 14 in Hamburg, Germany, an official of the Chilean
Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz said Chile will submit
additional documents to strengthen its position on refusing
Spanish fishing vessels access to Chilean ports to unload and re-
ship swordfish catches.
</P>
<P>
Chile, which first banned the vessels in 1991 in order to
protect the rare fish, says that allowing them would violate
Chile's restriction on harvesting the fish.
</P>
<P>
Munoz said a meeting is likely to be held late this month as
part of the parallel World Trade Organization process to resolve
the dispute.

<HEADLINE> China Strives to Uproot Narcotic Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua)-- China will launch a three-month
national campaign to take tougher action to crack down on
production and trafficking of the drug "ice", according to an
official source.
</P>
<P>
The action will try to uncover and eliminate underground "ice"
factories, prevent the drug from entering the market and ban the
illegal use of other chemicals that could be made into drugs.
Enterprises found involved in trafficking of such drugs will be
shut down, said Bai Jingfu, vice director of China National
Narcotics Control Commission, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police detected over 170 cases involving the production
and sale of "ice" and confiscated 7.3 tons of the drug between
1991 and 1998. In 1999, drug addicts in China were recorded at 681,
000, the commission sources said.
</P>
<P>
Trafficking of chemicals used to make drugs has increased when
foreign drug producers want more raw materials. China seized over
1,100 tons of such chemicals between 1997 and last June.
</P>
<P>
Bai believed that the nationwide crackdown would help eliminate
the trafficking of "ice" and other substances.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Extend Ceasefire Agreement in Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
Mahfud M.D. said the ceasefire agreement between the government
and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) will not be extended beyond
December because it is too advantageous to the province's
separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
The first three-month truce agreement was signed in Switzerland
on May 12 and came into effect on June 2. After it expired on
September 2, the two sides agreed to extend the so-called "
humanitarian pause" for an unspecified period.
</P>
<P>
During the implementation of ceasefire, GAM has been able to
stockpile thousands of weapons and build up its combat forces, the
minister said Friday in Surabaya, capital of East Java province.
</P>
<P>
The GAM has been launching acts of terror, such as replacing
pro-Jakarta subdistrict heads and village heads with members of
the separatist movement, the Indonesian Observer Saturday quoted
the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because those actions have been taking place during the
humanitarian pause, the government has not been able to take any
action to stop the rebels, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, he said, the government has decided to extend the
humanitarian pause until December, providing that GAM carries out
its activities as part of the Unilateral Republic of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, the government says GAM must drop its demand for
the creation of an independent state, and must accept the offer of
special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Anything beyond those requirements will be ignored," said the
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Muhfud warned if GAM breaches the agreement, the government
could unilaterally cancel the ceasefire. He reiterated that
Indonesia will remain united, adding that independence calls from
Aceh and Irian Jaya will fall on deaf ears in Jakarta. "At all
costs, Aceh and Irian Jaya will remain part of Indonesia," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Separatist in Aceh have been fighting since 1975 for
independence in their resource-rich homeland. At least 5,000
people have been killed in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 12 people including three policemen were
killed in the past few days after the signing of the second
ceasefire accord between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> More Fund on Research Demanded in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia risks losing its
place in the international research effort if it does not spend
more money.
</P>
<P>
According to The Australian daily Saturday, a report based on a
survey of 270 researchers said that Australia must spend at least
2.6 billion Australian dollars (1.46 billion U.S. dollars) on
research and development over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Most Australian researchers working overseas did want to
return to Australia to a research position," the report said,
adding that "however, considerable concern was expressed about the
availability of research funds, poor job security and lack of
career structure and opportunities in the Australian research
sector."
</P>
<P>
Rob Ramsay, president of the Australian Society for Medical
Research was quoted by the daily as saying that researchers saw
Australia in danger of being uncoupled from the rest of the
international research community and becoming nothing but a
training ground feeding researchers to overseas.
</P>
<P>
Australia has a serious brain drain problem with the United
States, Germany, France, the UK and Japan luring the brightest
from it.
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 40,000 Australians reportedly go to England
and altogether 400,000 are working there.

<HEADLINE> Drug Traffickers Fund Colombian Rebels, Paramilitaries: U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Drug traffickers in Colombia
finance both right-wing paramilitary groups and left-wing rebels,
said the U.S. Ambassador to Bogota Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ann Patterson, who assumed her post two weeks ago, made the
statement to the press after meeting with Colombian Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez, who on Tuesday triggered a
controversy by asking at a congress session when the issue of the
financing of paramilitarism would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"That is the reason for which the United States supports the
Plan Colombia, because it has a full justification that the FARC
and other groups that are outlawed finance their illicit
activities with money they obtain from the laboratories that
produce cocaine," the ambassador told the press.
</P>
<P>
The Plan Colombia, which involves 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in
aid to Colombia, is a series of projects of President Andres
Pastrana for the war against drugs, the search for peace and
development, and the substitution of illegal cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest
and oldest surviving rebel force in Latin America, has 15,000
members and controls about 40 percent of Colombia's territory.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is engaged in slow-moving peace talks with the
government, but no cease-fire deal has ever been agreed on as part
of the peace process, which aims to end a decade-old conflict in
which 35,000 people have died.

BOGOTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian Air Force (FAC)
Friday destroyed a plane with a load of weapons it carried from
overseas for rebels, said FAC Commander General Hector Fabio
Velasco.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was destroyed on a landing strip of Buenos Aires,
a remote border area of the departments of Guainia, Guavire and
Meta in southeastern Colombia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The plane had as its destination the zone of distention in the

the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), said the
officer.
</P>
<P>
"We know that it brought a cargo of weapons. These are planes
that make trips taking out drug and bring in weapons," Velasco
told local reporters.

The people aboard the plane, whose nationality has not yet been
confirmed, abandoned the plane in a hurry before the FAC
destroyed it.

<HEADLINE> Bush Agrees to Negotiate on Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush Friday agreed to negotiate
on presidential debates to end the dispute with his Democratic
rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor Bush directed his campaign chairman Don Evans to
inform the Commission on Presidential Debates that he would meet
with the commission and the Gore campaign to work out a plan for
debates, according to his spokesman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
The Bush and Gore campaigns are expected to meet with the
presidential debate commission next week to negotiate terms for a
series of televised debates between the two presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
"The Bush campaign has accepted the Commission on Presidential
Debates' invitation to meet. We are working to schedule a meeting
with Bush and Gore campaign representatives next week," said
commission executive director Janet Brown.
</P>
<P>
Bush earlier insisted that he would only attend one formal
debate sponsored by the commission, and accept two other less-
formal TV appearances instead of the formal ones.
</P>
<P>
Bush had proposed to attend a TV appearance in an NBC program
on Tuesday night even if Gore refused to show up, but NBC informed
the Bush campaign that there would be no debate as scheduled
unless both candidates agreed to appear.
</P>
<P>
Bush received harsh criticism from several major newspapers for
refusing to attend the formal debates to be arranged by the
bipartisan debate commission.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said that he would consider other
formats only after Bush agreed to the three formal debates
sponsored by the commission.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the Bush campaign has agreed to meet with
the bipartisan commission on presidential debates. We look forward
to that meeting," said William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Currency Gets into Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dropped
to 55.89 U.S. cents Friday at the close of the Sydney trading, the
lowest level since 1998, despite the fact that the Reserve Bank
intervened for the third successive day.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency was floated in December 1983. Since
then, only for one time it had been under 57 U.S. cents, and
affected by the Asian economic crisis, had a brief touch on the 55.
30 mark in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current round of steep fall of the dollar started from
November 1999. The Asian economies regained their vigor while
Australia entered its ninth continuing year of high growth.
</P>
<P>
As Prime Minister John Howard said happily "the Australian
economy at the present time is stronger than it's been for more
than 30 years." And economists foretold the Australian dollar
would soar towards the brilliant mark of 80 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Thus nobody noticed the snakes in the grass, though they had
been there for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Australian officials explained that all the troubles came from
a too strong U.S. dollar and for the country's lack of
participation in the information technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the field of research and development, Australia is weak and
seems getting weaker. Universities and researching institutes are
puzzled by the lack of fund and forced to make money themselves.
Young and ambitious researchers and professionals leave for abroad.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Australians have been content with using
computers and getting profits from doing so rather than making
them. There is no one big IT enterprise in the country with stocks
above 10 Australian dollars. As a result, capital is sucked out
along with brains.
</P>
<P>
However, there is not only one snake. There is another one:
high foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Australia is ranked 28th in the world in national savings, an
incredible 43rd on financial risk and 28th on financial debt.
Given its huge debt and current account deficit, the country must
borrow big sums every day. Latest official figures show that 36
billion Australian dollars (about 20.16 billion U.S. dollars) was
added to its debt in the year to June as the banks borrowed
heavily on global markets.
</P>
<P>
Now, the country's total liabilities, including foreign
ownership, have soared to 404 billion Australian dollars (226.24
billion U.S. dollars) or 64 percent of GDP compared to 45 percent
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
All these have made international investors nervous and quick
to sell the Australian dollar in big quantities. The trouble with
Australian dollar has once again exposed the snakes in the grass
of the continent.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Demand Extradition of Arms Traffickers From Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian judicial authorities
will ask their Russian counterparts to extradite three members of
an international arms trafficking group allegedly headed by former
Peruvian army lieutenant Jose Luis Aybar Cancho, Peruvian judicial
sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Celinda Segura Salas, the judge in charge of a case concerning
arms trafficking from Jordan, announced that she would request the
Russian government to extradite Ana Doris, Astrih, and Brihani
from the same Aybar Cancho family, who are involved "in this
criminal act."
</P>
<P>
The arms trafficking group had already sold some 10,000
Kalashnikov rifles to guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Official procedures will be carried out soon to facilitate the
extradition, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Investigations carried out by the First Prosecutor Office show
that the 45-year-old Ana Doris Aybar Cancho, who is on the run in
Russia, is the contact person of the arms smuggling organization
with its partners in Croatia, Russia, the United States and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian police said they know little about Astrih and Brichani.

PANAMA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Panama's National Maritime
Service patrol officers, police and Drug Prosecutor Office agents
confiscated 90 kilograms of drugs dumped into the sea in less than
a month, according to official sources on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They said 20 people were detained during the operation.
</P>
<P>
The authorities explained that drugs had been dropped from
light planes by drug traffickers, most of them Colombians, at
night and were to be recovered afterwards by Panamanian drug
traffickers. The drugs, hidden in fuel tanks of vehicles, would be
smuggled via Central America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the trucks which carry drugs to the
Central American countries often return with weapons for the
Colombian paramilitary and guerrillas.

OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Argentina signed two
agreements here Friday on cooperation in environment protection
and in the development of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
Attending the signing of the two documents were Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, Industry Minister John Manley,
Environment Minister David Anderson and Adalberto Rodriguez
Giavarini, Argentinean Minister of Foreign Relations,
International Trade and Worship.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed during the two-day official working
visit by Argentinean President Fernando de la Rua, who arrived
here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"Canada and Argentina have significantly enhanced their
bilateral co-operation over the past decade," said Axworthy. "
Today's agreements will contribute to a cleaner global environment
and help to reduce the amount of waste produced by nuclear power
plants," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Co-operation
will facilitate the transfer of clean technologies.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that a number of Canadian environmental firms have
formed partnerships and won contracts as a direct result of their
participation in Canada's activities in Argentina," said Manley.
</P>
<P>
Under the Joint Study Program Agreement, the Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited and Nucleoelectrica Argentina S.A. propose to
undertake a joint feasibility study on using slightly enriched
uranium in the CANDU reactor at Embalse, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The conversion of a nuclear reactor from natural uranium to
SEU can result in fuel savings of over 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Gets Olympic Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- British hurdler Colin Jackson
was given a stark warning from his American rival that his
performances will have to be special in Sydney if he wants to win
the gold medal in his event.
</P>
<P>
Curtis Frye, coach of American rival Allen Johnson, is
confident that his 110m title holder will return to form and
upstage his Welsh rival at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who did not compete in Brussels and Gateshead in
August after injuring his hamstring while training for an expected
showdown with world champion Jackson in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old returned to America for treatment with his
personal physiotherapist and will return to action in Japan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Frye said:"If he runs under 13.30 seconds in Tokyo then look
for a big one from Allen in Sydney. I am sure it is going to be a
great race in Sydney. I know Mr. Jackson is starting to run into
form and I know Allen will be on top form."
</P>
<P>
"He was more injured than we thought but things are going very
well for Allen now. He has put some really good training in," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who regained his world 110m title in Seville last
year after defending champion Johnson pulled out before his semi-
final through injury, has also been battling with problems.
</P>
<P>
But Jackson's own coach Malcolm Arnold believes that the 33-
year-old Welshman will be at his best in Sydney and ready to seize
the only title missing from his trophy cabinet at the fourth
attempt.
</P>
<P>
"Colin is running very well. He is fine, in good shape," said
Arnold. "It is shame he couldn't have had a few more races, but
there was nothing we could do about that."
</P>
<P>
"We have still got another two weeks before he goes to Sydney
so we are just putting the icing on the cake really," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ottey to Run a Record Sixth Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Merlene Ottey, the favorite
daughter of Jamaica, was on her way for a record sixth Olympics
against a dire fact that the 40-year-old was still crying for her
first ever Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who returned to competition in July after a 12-month
drugs ban was overturned, has made it plain she expects to run
track and field's blue riband event plus the 100m relay in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jamaica's athletes selectors were still short of
final decisions on her outings in both events, as team manager
Winston Ulett said that "we saw that and we heard that but we
don't know anything about it."
</P>
<P>
The sprint queen flew into Australia on Wednesday, and was
staying somewhere in Brisbane where the rest of the Jamaican team
is preparing for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Ulett said Ottey would run the relay if she continued the form
shown since the Jamaican trials in July but on decision on whether
she would line up in the 100m would be made until September 19,
the day before nominations are due.
</P>
<P>
He said Ottey would be vying for the three individual spots
with the trio of women who finished ahead of her at the trials in
July.
</P>
<P>
Ottey ran 11.27 seconds in the trials and Ulett noted she had
twice run faster and twice slower since then.
</P>
<P>
Ottey has won seven Olympic medals, but none of them gold, and
14 world championship medals including six golds, which is more
than any other athlete.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaica's woman sprinter was banned after testing positive
to the anabolic steroid nandralone in July 1999 but the suspension
was lifted in July this year by an International Amateur Athletic
Federation panel.
</P>
<P>
Tested about 100 times since 1979, Ottey dismissed the initial
finding as a "terrible mistake" and the Jamaican Amateur Athletics
Federation in November last year found her not guilty of the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
She was designated a roving ambassador for Jamaica in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Canada Upholds Decision to Strip Two Players From Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada upheld its decision
Friday to strip two of its players from the country's Sydney
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Equestrian Federation (CEF) announced a lifetime
ban on Olympic equestian team member Eric Lamaze from competition
after a second positive test for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
"The pursuit of drug-free equestrian sport is a priority for
the CEF," said the federation in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Lamaze was suspended for four years after failing a drug test
before the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a doping review panel from the Canadian Centre for
Ethics told Alberta hammer-thrower Robin Lyons, 23, that she has
lost her appeal of her suspension from Canada's Olympic team for
testing positive for an anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
"The doping control review board released its decision
dismissing Robin's protest," her lawyer Thomas Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
Lyons tested positive for norandrosterone, a metabolite of
nandrolone, at the Canadian Olympic trials in August.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian national champion in the hammer-throw event has
denied taking any steroids ever since.

<P>
A program official with an international crane foundation was
highly complimentary after his inspection tour of the nature
reserve, saying, "Yunnan has made valuable contributions to the
protection of black-neck cranes."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the increasing numbers of cranes have given
rise to conflicts over sharing swamps between the cranes and local
farmers. Zhaotong where the reserve is located, is one of China's
poverty-stricken areas, and most local farmers are still facing
problems in terms of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the human population grows, farmers in and near
the reserve are expanding farmland area, and some are even
beginning to reclaim swamps, which pose a threat to the cranes'
life.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the conflict, the local government decided to move
some farmers, making more space for the cranes. Over 1,000 people
moved out of the reserve area last year and a total of 5,000 will
move out within three years, decreasing by more than one-third
from the present 14,000 residents living in the area, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation will not only help local people fight poverty,
but also enable full protection and management over the core area
of the reserve, hence creating a better winter habitat for black-
neck cranes, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> China Protects World Largest Winter Habitat For Cranes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest winter
habitat for black-neck cranes has been well protected in China's
southwest Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northeast of Yunnan at 3,200 meters above sea
level, the Dashanbao Black-Neck Crane Nature Reserve is the
largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
It has been increased in area from 4,000 hectares to 20,000
hectares and its winter visitors -- black-neck cranes have also
increased since it was set up 10 years ago, according to Zhong
Xingyao, local forestry bureau director of Zhaotong.
</P>
<P>
The Black-neck crane, a worldwide endangered wildlife species,
is a rare bird that inhabits tablelands. Its tall and beautiful
figure makes it valuable for bird-watching and scientific research.
In China, it can only be seen in remote areas of Qinghai, Yunnan,
Sichuan, Guizhou provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In the early stage of the reserve, local farmers knew little
about the importance of protecting the cranes. They used to poach
and kill the cranes. The reserve workers spared no efforts to
increase awareness about protecting wildlife, especially among
farmers and their families, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has made decrees to ban hunting, damaging
swamps, and farming by deforestation in the reserve area, and to
give cash rewards to local farmers who save and cure ill or hurt
cranes and those who report poaching and killing.
</P>
<P>
There have been no recent reports of cranes being killed in the
reserve area.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Software Simulating Oil Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a new kind
of software capable of simulating the change of oil-bearing
formations in exploited oil fields, thus helping oil companies get
information about the remaining oil and a cost-effective way of
getting it.
</P>
<P>
 Feng Yulin, director of the Institute of Software under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said Friday that the software, known
as high-performance numerical parallel software for simulating oil
reserve, or PRIS 2.0, is the result of a 10-year research effort
by the institute.
</P>
<P>
 Application of the software in China's state-of-the-art
computers, such as Shengwei (Invincible Might) and Downing
computers in the past year, has enabled researchers and their oil
company partners to simulate the change in oil-bearing formations
from when the oil fields were first put in place to pump out oil,
said the director.
</P>
<P>
Then they can get the information on the remaining oil, which
is vital for choosing the most effective technique, said Feng.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the software is very important for China's oil
industry as most of the oil output comes from the oil fields that
have been used for almost 30 years, including Daqing Oil Field in
northeast China, the leading oil field in the country.
</P>
<P>
The software will eventually help oil companies produce oil
from those fields in an efficient way to power the country's
growing economy.
</P>
<P>
The software has passed the test by American multinational
company James Atlas SSI, which describes it as reliable and
effective.
</P>
<P>
According to experts with the institute, the PRIS 2.0 is as
good as the imported software used by Chinese oil companies at the
moment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Intensify Campaign Against Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
decided here Friday to intensify campaign against drug-trafficking
by air, by using all possible means including use of detecting
machines, snuffer dogs and a coordinated and well-knit
intelligence system.
</P>
<P>
This was decided at a meeting presided over by Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
Moinuddin Haider told the meeting that the world has
appreciated and acknowledged Pakistan's efforts against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully controlled and reduced poppy cultivation
to a great extent besides being able to destroy a large number of
heroine laboratories," he added.
</P>
<P>
He remarked that there is need to concentrate more on drug-
trafficking from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Moinuddin lamented that a number of drug traffickers with
Pakistani passports are arrested in the Gulf States and other
parts of the world which brings a bad name to the country.
</P>
<P>
This situation, he said, must be immediately arrested and
strict and concrete efforts be made in this connection.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the Foreign Office will instruct Pakistani
missions abroad to provide all available information about those
arrested in their respective states to the concerned agencies in
Pakistan, so that it can be analyzed and utilized in busting the
gangs involved in drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, law enforcing and other co-agencies are asked to make
arrangements which can be contacted and can co-act for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Moinuddin Haider instructed the authorities to make sure that
the warning system for the drug-peddlers is strengthened and taken
to a high-key, so that traffickers are time and again reminded
that penalty for the offense was as strict as death in some
countries of the world.

deficit came down to 313 million dollars as compared to 375.6
million dollars of the corresponding period of last fiscal,

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's homemade helicopters
will be used for the first time in civil aviation after it went
through a high-standard airworthiness flight test recently.
</P>
<P>
The test, called "flying on the verge of death", requires the
aircraft to undergo high-risk flight trials.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the aircraft created a breakthrough in China's
airworthiness flight test.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter has created several records during the trial
flight, with flight duration of five hours at normal temperature,
a two-hour flight at 38 degrees Celsius below zero and a
temperature difference between 6 degrees Centigrade and 43 degrees
Centigrade minus. It also managed 1,332 km fault-free flight.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of the helicopter began in 1991 by Changhe
Company in Jindezhen of east China's Jiangxi Province. It is able
to fly 598 km at a speed of 240 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter can be used for many purposes, such as coaching,
reconnaissance, communication, rescue, smuggle suppression and
scientific research.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Develops Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has become an
important industry in China's southwestern regions, according to
an interprovincial conference on economic development held
recently in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Yunnan Province will further develop its
domestic and international tourism market by opening more key
tourist routes.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will join hands with neighboring
provinces and regions to promote local tourism resources and build
tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province hosted the Kunming International Horticulture
Expo last year. The Expo increased the tourism value of Yunnan by
20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The international media predicts that the Tibet Autonomous
Region will be one of the world's hottest tourism destinations in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The newly opened direct flight from the German city of Munich
to southwest China's Chongqing Municipality will bring more
European tourists to China.
</P>
<P>
The route provides the quickest and the most economical way for
European tourists to directly enter China's hinterland. After
arrival in Chongqing, European tourists are able to take part in
more than 20 tourism programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
This will break the traditional tourism route, in which
European tourists first visit eastern China before traveling to
western China.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the provinces of Sichuan,
Yunnan and Guizhou have signed agreements on further cooperation
in the tourism industry. They will share tourism resources and
jointly develop a series of tourism programs to major scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Tourism development in the region will concentrate on
traditional sightseeing, exploration tours, recreational vacations,
exposition visits and participation in scientific projects.

<HEADLINE> Students in Sanctions-Stricken Iraq Start New School Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Students across the sanctions-
stricken Iraq started their new school year on Saturday, faced with
lack of fund, equipment, textbooks and even teachers.
</P>
<P>
The pupils at Al-Razi elementary school in the center of capital
Baghdad held a flag-raising ceremony, chanting the Iraqi national
anthem and pledged loyalty to President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
But they have to bear the bite of the sweeping sanctions,
imposed by the United Nations for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. The school has no new equipment and no fund. In the
classrooms, two pupils have to share a desk designed for one; at
least half of the textbooks are old ones.
</P>
<P>
Before the sanctions, all the children received a simple but
nutritious meal of milk, biscuits, and fresh fruit each day, but
now schools are neither able to renew their physical infrastructure
nor to invest in students' health well-being.
</P>
<P>
To most of the students, computer is something they can only
dream of.
</P>
<P>
Education in Iraq now remains free, but parents of the students
are encouraged to donate a few U.S. dollars to the schools where
their children attend. But even a few dollars are a small fortune
to ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
A teacher's monthly salary could be as much as 500 dollars
before the sanctions, now a teacher is lucky to get an average of
6,000 dinars (three dollars) a month. To make ends meet, most
teachers have to take second or even third jobs.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, it is no news that a school teacher has to sell
cigarettes, ice cream or drive taxis to make more money. Neither is
it a surprise that every year more than 100,000 children drop out
of school to help support their families.
</P>
<P>
However, things were totally different before the sanctions.
According to the U.N. Development Program's 1991 human development
report, Iraq's combined primary and secondary enrollment ratio for
1989 stood at 75 percent, higher than the 70 percent for all
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Children's Funds (UNICEF) has estimated that no more
than 45 percent of Iraq's schools have even the basic
infrastructure needed for teaching to take place.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Urged to Attract More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official here
on Saturday urged more government efforts to address the country's
shortage of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Iran attracted less than 1 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investments, which is indicative of the slow pace in
mobilizing resources to attract foreign capital, said Mohammad
Jafar Eslami, deputy minister of mines and metals for planning,
development and renovation.
</P>
<P>
Given the total direct foreign investments of 872 billion
dollars in the world in 1999, Iran, with 1 percent of the world
population, should have absorbed about 8.7 billion dollars of the
total, he said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Eslami urged the government to make more efforts to speed up the
pace in attracting foreign investments. Security, foreign policy
and publicity are among the factors that prepare the ground for
foreign investments, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the Ministry of Mines and Metals had
offered 100 projects worth 10 billion dollars, adding that with the
right and more transparent investment environment, the amount of
foreign investments in this sector will rise.
</P>
<P>
He said that a measure has been adopted to prolong the
excavation period of the country's mines from five to 25 years.
This is expected to be an incentive for potential investors in the
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting incentives for investments is a feature of the third
five-year economic development plan (March 2000-March 2005)
compared to that of the first and second development plans, he
pointed out.

</P>
<P>
Earlier, SLS entered into a commercial partnership with Thuraya,
by which it has become the service provider for Thuraya's satellite
enhanced payphone service.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran and Russia have agreed to set up a liquefaction
plant in Iran to produce liquefied hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be built soon, is part of the country's plan to
replace fossil fuels with new environment-friendly energy sources,
said Faramarz Golshani, managing-director of the New Energies
Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the liquefied hydrogen is used as fuel for diesel

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Over 70 Taiwanese exhibitors, including several
internationally recognized manufacturers, will display a wide range
of IT products at Gitex 2000, to be held at the Dubai World Trade
Center (DWTC) on October 28-November 1.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Cubans Protesting U.S. Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 15,000 Cubans
Saturday demonstrated against the U.S. policy toward Cuba in the
central municipality of Florencia, 460 kilometers east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
Arguments advocating for the end of the U.S. economic embargo
were heard during the event, which was led by the first Cuban Vice-
President Raul Castro. They also criticized the Helms-Burton and
Torricelli laws and the Cuban Adjustment Act.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators said that the Cuban Adjustment Act encourages
illegal emigration from the island, which causes the death toll of
many people during their trips from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The speeches alternated during the protest demonstrations with
music and dance performances.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress imposed sanctions on Cuba in the hopes of
ousting Cuban President Fidel Castro, who led the Communists to
power on the island in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords between the two
countries, 20,000 Cubans are allowed to immigrate to the United
States legally.
</P>
<P>
In line with those accords, the Cubans trying to enter the
United States illegally who are intercepted at sea must be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But unlike other illegal immigrants, the Cubans who manage to
evade the Coast Guard and reach US shores are allowed to seek
legal residency and work permits under the Cuban Adjustment Act
passed in 1966.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Industrial Countries Responsible for High Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato Saturday warned that the industrial countries brought the
present oil price on themselves.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to bring Italian petrol prices within the EU average,
he told reporters that the industrial countries had been
irresponsible towards the oil producers by when they watched the
price of oil drop to 10 U.S. dollars a barrel -- "and no one did
anything."
</P>
<P>
"We complain, but we forget what we did to them," he said, "
these are developing countries whose revenue comes from oil. No
one offered a helping hand, so they did their own thing and cut
back production."
</P>
<P>
Amato, who also said he is sure an equilibrium point will be
found in the oil market, confirmed that the government's plans to
reduce Italian petrol prices by maintaining the present 50-lire
tax discount and rationalizing the distribution system to reduce
costs.
</P>
<P>
Similar policies are being urged by the EU, especially
increased competition among the oil companies to bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU's finance and economics ministers Saturday
called on the Opec oil producers to increase their production
enough to bring oil prices down to about 28 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The final statement at their meeting in France described high
oil prices as a "source of great concern" and said they should
return to the levels which favor world growth.
</P>
<P>
The high prices ruling for most of this year, now as high as 34-
35 dollars a barrel, have blighted growth prospects in the EU and
elsewhere and, by threatening European prospects, have also sent
the euro plunging to record lows against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Protests Trigger First Fuel Shortages in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Fuel shortages were taking hold
at some petrol stations as oil refinery blockades in England and
Wales start to bite on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shell, BP and Sainsbury's and Tesco supermarkets have all
reported supply problems as protesters vent their anger at rising
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
But retailers have sought to calm the situation amid reports
of panic buying, saying a fuel crisis is unlikely. The blockades
came as Europe's finance ministers appealed to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce prices ahead of
their meeting in Vienna on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest protest over rising fuel price in Britain has been
at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, where two oil refineries run by
Texaco and Elf have been blocked by around 50 lorries since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Workers on Saturday morning were forced to enter the depot on
foot as protesters including members of the public, farmers, taxi
drivers and coach operators blocked road access.
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil's Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port, in Cheshire,
and a petrol distribution depot at Avonmouth near Bristol are also
being targeted.
</P>
<P>
Shell warned that 20 to 30 stations in the North West would
run out of petrol "imminently" as a result of the Stanlow protests,
while Sainsbury's said two of its 223 petrol stations had already
run out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
But Ray Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers'
Association, said that 30 or so filling stations out of 1,200 in
the region did not mean Britain was running out of petrol.
</P>
<P>
The protests could be spreading to Ireland next week after the
Irish Road Haulage Association, which represents 1,200 of Ireland'
s 4,000 truckers, announced protests on Friday and the following
Monday in support of its claim for a reduction in fuel duty.

BOGOTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) urban faction blew up a gas pipeline of the state
oil company in the Barrancabermeja river port and caused a big
fire, regional police authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack occurred Saturday in a sector of Colombia'

meters high.
</P>
<P>
The fire was threatening two neighborhoods, but it was
controlled after several hours of work of the fire brigades,
company technicians and policemen, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
The police chief attributed the attack to an urban faction of
the main guerrilla of the country, the FARC, saying that the
authorities have not determined what kind of explosive the rebels
used.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari's Michael Schumacher was
poised to strike back at championship leader Mika Hakkinen
Saturday after winning pole position in the starting grid for
tomorrow's Italian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Beside him on the grid will be Ferrari team-mate, Rubens
Barrichello, who also clocked a faster time than Hakkinen. The
Finn will start third, with McLaren's other driver, David
Coulthard, back in seventh.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher led the Formula 1 drivers' championship until two
races ago when Hakkinen overtook him. Then, two weeks ago in
Belgium, Hakkinen's McLaren shot past Schumacher's Ferrari when
the German was within four laps of victory.
</P>
<P>
After winning four races in the early part of the Formula 1
championship, the German has disappointed fans in recent Grand
Prix races and raised fears that he will fail for the third year
running to deliver the championship title he has promised Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Now six points separate the rivals at the top of the driver's
standings. With four races to go and 40 points up for grabs, the
stage is set for a dramatic finish to the Formula 1 season.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Schumacher said he was confident he could
still win the title that has eluded Ferrari for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He also promised significant changes to his car, which has been
visibly slower than the two McLarens in recent races.
</P>
<P>
Today's first and second place on the grid was Ferrari's first
since the Malaysian Grand Prix eleven months ago.
</P>
<P>
In that race Schumacher led till just before the end when he
allowed then team-mate Eddie Irvine to pass him.

<HEADLINE> China, Latvia to Further Expand Parliamentary Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIGA, Latvia, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Latvia agreed
here on Saturday to make continued efforts to expand exchanges and
cooperation between the legislative bodies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at a meeting between visiting China's top
legislator Li Peng and chairman of Parliament of Latvia Janis
Straume.
</P>
<P>
Straume said it is important for Latvia to keep friendly and
cooperative relations with China as the world is in a process of
multi-polarization and economic globalization. Li's visit will
inject new vigor into bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Latvia is grateful of China because it was
among the first to recognize the independence of Latvia, an
important historic event of the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said China recognized Latvia and established diplomatic
relations with Latvia soon after the disband of the Soviet Union,
as China observes an independent foreign policy of peace, and
insists that all countries, large or small, should be equal.
</P>
<P>
People of each country have the right to choose their own
social system and ideology, Li said, adding that China supports
Latvia's efforts in maintaining the country's independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and understands Latvia's
policy of joining the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Straume said Latvia will continue to observe the one-China
policy.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the two parliaments should increase contacts, and
expand cooperation in the economic, trade and science and
technology areas. Li invited Straume to visit China, and Straume
accepted with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Saturday afternoon on a three-day official
visit.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Forecasts Oil Prices Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez was quoted as saying that key oil producers including his
country were making effort to help bring crude oil prices down to
25-28 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the largest oil exporter in the Western Hemisphere,
is due to host the second Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) summit later this month.
</P>
<P>
He told the Brazilian news agency Estado de Sao Paulo that
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso "need not worry
because Venezuela is working and is going to succeed in
stabilizing the price of this commodity."
</P>
<P>
High fuel costs have sparked concern and even outrage in
several consuming nations.
</P>
<P>
As international pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to
stem surging fuel prices, OPEC members said Saturday they
supported raising their official output by at least half a million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed in June to pump an additional 500,000
barrels a day if the average price for several types of OPEC crude
exceeded 28 dollars for 20 consecutive business days.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, this average OPEC price was 33.84 dollars and
had been higher than  28 dollars a barrel for 19 consecutive days.
Prices surged to 10-year highs in New York and London this week,
surpassing 34 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
With the production of some 3 million barrels per day (bpd),
Venezuela is currently exporting more than 1.8 million bpd.
