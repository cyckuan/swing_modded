<HEADLINE> U.N. Investigating Sudan Bomb Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The United Nations is sending a medical  
team to Sudan to check out rebel claims that the government dropped 
chemical or biological bombs on two towns held by southern rebels, 
a senior U.N. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will leave tomorrow and will camp outside the towns of  
Kaaya and Lainya in Western Equatoria province, where the Sudanese 
air force allegedly dropped the bombs on July 23, said Dr. Sharad 
Sapra, a Nairobi-based coordinator for Operation Lifeline Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Lifeline Sudan is an umbrella group of U.N. and  
private relief agencies working in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapra said two employees of the World Food Program and one from  
the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association, the rebel's relief 
agency, were affected by the unidentified substance while passing 
through Lainya. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them underwent tests at a Nairobi hospital, but the  
results were not ready Tuesday, Sapra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said investigators will also provide medical treatment to  
villagers, if needed. Team members plan to take medical samples to 
determine what chemical substances, if any, were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army said a  
government plane dropped 16 bombs in Lainya and six in Kaaya on 
July 23, the day unsuccessful peace talks to end the war concluded 
in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is reported that a day after the bombing of these towns,  
children and men and women started to vomit blood,'' Samson Kwanje, 
a rebel spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said since the bombing ``almost all pregnant women have  
aborted or are gravely ill'' and goats, sheep, cats, dogs and birds 
are dying in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-government Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper quoted army  
spokesman Gen. Mohamed Osman as saying that such reports are a 
smear campaign against the Sudanese government. 
</P>
<P>
	``These rebel allegations are mere lies and fabrications,''  
Yassin was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.9 million people have been killed in Sudan's civil  
war and war-related famines since the war began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are fighting Sudan's central Muslim-dominated  
government, seeking autonomy and a greater share in the country's 
wealth for the south, where people are predominantly Christian or 
animists.

	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Charles Levarity Smith, a member of  
the Bahamas softball team at the Pan American Games, has been 
charged with sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 36, has been released on $500 ($340 U.S.) bail and told  
to appear in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged victim is a member of the cleaning staff at the  
athletes village just outside Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was alleged to have occurred on Monday, it was reported on  
Monday and investigated and in consultation with a crown attorney 
the criminal charge of sexual assault was laid,'' Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police spokesman Steve Saunders said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders said it will be up to the courts to decide whether  
Smith can return home with the rest of his team. The games end 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is a third baseman for the Bahamas.

	 *RECOVERING MASCOT:* Brenda Reinhardt, a Pan Am Games volunteer,  
hopes to be back at work soon as Pato, the wood duck who serves as 
a mascot for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, she suffered neck injuries when she was rammed  
in the head from behind while walking to the baseball stadium. She 
said the force of the blow rocked her head inside the heavy helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	A man is in custody and is expected to be charged with assault.  
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't detroy any of the pure joy I've experienced doing  
this,, Reinhardt said. ``It's just one silly person, that's all it 
is.''

	 *SHOOTOUT SORROW:* Canada's shot at the gold medal in women's  
soccer disappeared with a penalty shot off the goalpost. A second 
opportunity, no less, for 16-year-old Claire Rustad. 
</P>
<P>
	With the game tied 2-2 against Mexico, a shootout was held.  
Mexico's first three shooters all connected, then midfielder Rustad 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Her kick was directly into goalkeeper Linny Quinones, but  
American referee Kari Seitz said the keeper moved forward before 
the ball was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Rustad another kick, which she sent off the post to  
her right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a horrible way to lose, but we have to deal with it,''  
the teen-ager said. ``I was happy when I let it go. I had it in my 
mind that it was going in the net. And it didn't. It was an inch 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second chances can be good and they can be bad. You can see  
how they can be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico made its next two attempts to move into the gold medal  
game against the United States.

	 *WOUNDED KNEE:* Jordie McTavish, who replaced Steve Nash of the  
Dallas Mavericks on Canada's Pan Ams basketball team, dislocated 
his right knee in a game with Argentina. McTavish had 11 points and 
nine assists heading into the final minute of the game. He drove to 
the basket and tumbled to the ground in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	With McTavish gone, the Canadians are down to their third-string  
point guard, Sherman Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played really well tonight,'' Hamilton said of McTavish.  
``We've seen him progress all summer. This is a real sad 
situation.''

	Clinton Trumpets Welfare Changes  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton gave his welfare reform plan a  
boost today, saying the nation now has the smallest percentage of 
people on public assistance rolls since 1967. Clinton called 
welfare recipients ``people who are good for the bottom line,'' and 
urged business leaders to hire more of them. Clinton also urged 
Republican leaders in Congress to resist using $4.2 billion in 
unspent federal welfare funds for other purposes, saying the money 
could go toward reducing welfare rolls even further.

	Utah Man Pleads Guilty in Olympics Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Salt Lake City businessman agreed today to  
plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax violation in connection with the 
2002 Olympic Games, the first criminal case in the federal probe of 
a bribery scandal. The Justice Department said the plea stemmed 
from a scheme in which David E. Simmons helped the son of an 
International Olympic Committee member obtain lawful permanent 
resident status by offering the son a fraudulent job at his 
company, the government said. The father had a vote on which city 
would get the 2002 Winter Olympics. Salt Lake City was awarded the 
Games.

	Pilots, NTSB Make More Rest Request

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline pilots made their case before Congress  
today for reduced work periods. Current federal rules say pilots 
may not fly more than eight hours and must receive at least eight 
hours of rest in a 24-hour period. The pilots want to increase the 
rest period to at least 10 hours. The Federal Aviation 
Administration agrees, but also wants to increase the pilots' 
flight time to 10 hours, and all flying would have to be done 
within a 14-hour window. The FAA argues the airlines would get more 
flight time from the pilots in any given day, and the pilots would 
get more rest.

	Zapruder Heirs To Get $16M for Film

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arbitrators compromised today on the  
compensation for the family of Abraham Zapruder for his home movie 
of John F. Kennedy's assassination, awarding Zapruder's heirs $16 
million, less than the $30 million they sought, but more than the 
government's $1 million offer. A government panel decided two years 
ago that the film was the property of the people of the United 
States. And under the Constitution, that meant that the Zapruder 
family had to be fairly compensated. The Justice Department says 
the resolution of this dispute will ensure that the film ``will be 
protected for scholarly and research uses.''

after she allegedly threatened a policeman with a screwdriver is 
suing the city and police department. Richard Mitchell's civil 
rights lawsuit contends that his frail, mentally ill mother posed 
no threat to the officers when she was killed May 21. Margaret 
Mitchell, 54, had been pushing a shopping cart down trendy La Brea 
Avenue when two officers stopped her and asked if the cart was 
stolen. Police said the woman then thrust a screwdriver at one of 
the officers, who fell to one knee and fired a shot into her chest.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Soccer an Obstacle for Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Make no mistake, Mexico is happy to be in the  
finals of the Confederations Cup. It is not so happy about the 
prospect of playing Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is Brazil's strength that FIFA president Sepp Blatter said  
Tuesday the Brazilians have enough quality players to field three 
top national teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going with the best we have, with our most experienced  
players,'' Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente said. ``We are going to go 
with everything from the very beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he summed up what Mexico has to do: ``Have a very good  
defense and a better attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil dominated its group in Guadalajara, defeating Germany  
4-0, the United States 1-0, New Zealand 2-1 and Saudi Arabia 8-2 in 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico led its group with less than satisfying victories over  
Saudi Arabia (5-1), Bolivia (1-0) and a tie with Egypt (2-2). The 
Mexicans edged the United States 1-0 in overtime in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil came to the Cup without some of its top players after  
winning the America Cup in June. But it had more than enough young 
stars, led by Ronaldinho, to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldinho has scored six goals so far and is tied for the  
tournament lead with Marzouk Al Otaibi of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldinho said Tuesday the expected crowd of 100,000 at Azteca  
Stadium will put a lot of pressure on Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the team that makes fewer mistakes will win,'' he  
said. ``It will be a pretty final and Brazil will come out a 
winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico will miss experienced striker and top scorer Luis  
Hernandez, who has yet to recover from a muscle pull and has played 
only 25 minutes during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be replaced by Jose Manuel Abundis. Another youngster  
who will see action is Rafael Marquez, who on Tuesday was sold to 
Monaco of the French League for an estimated $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapuente said he will not disclose his lineup until the last  
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender Evanilson Ferreira, injured against Saudi Arabia  
Sunday, is a doubtful starter for Brazil and will be replaced by 
Flavio Conceicao. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Blatter called the Confederations Cup a success,  
with an average attendance of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only problem was the behavior of the Egyptian team  
during its first-round game with Saudi Arabia when three of its 
players were expelled. Egypt lost 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	One player was suspended for one game and the others for two.  
The Egyptian team might face sanctions.

<HEADLINE> McGwire's 500th Home Run Ball Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The speculation has begun on how much Mark  
McGwire's 500th home run ball might be worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Tuesday's game with San Diego, McGwire needed two  
homers to reach 500. He would be only the 16th player to reach the 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The person who comes up with it will be holding a baseball worth  
an estimated $100,000 for starters. 
</P>
<P>
	But this figure pales in comparison to last season's  
record-setting 70th home run ball. That ball brought more than $3 
million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorabilia dealer Michael Barnes, who helped sell McGwire's  
70th home run ball last season, is working on the idea of a cash 
advance for the right to auction the 500th ball in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the problems last season was that we had to weigh all  
these upfront offers, money, royalties, annuities, before deciding 
on a public auction,'' Barnes said. ``One of the benefits this time 
around is, I've stayed in contact with all the underbidders from 
the 70th home run ball auction, and this is the next big thing on 
the horizon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes believes the baseball might bring as much as $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been almost a year since Paul Ozersky, a 26-year-old  
researcher at Washington University's Genome Sequencing Center, 
became a millionaire thanks to the 70th home run ball. Some of the 
money he made with the ball he is giving back to three charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who paid more than $3 million for that ball was Canadian  
comic book, toy and video tycoon, Todd McFarlane. He called the 
McGwire 70th home run ball ``the big boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane bought nine home run baseballs from last season,  
including McGwire's first, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sammy 
Sosa's 33rd, which broke the record for the number of homers in a 
month. He also bought Sosa's 61st and 66th home run balls.

<HEADLINE> Mercer to Denver, Fortson to Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Celtics and Denver Nuggets completed a major  
six-player deal that sends guard Ron Mercer from Boston to Denver 
for power forward Danny Fortson. 
</P>
<P>
	Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius go with Mercer to Denver for  
Fortson, Eric Washington, and Eric Williams, who began his career 
in Boston. The Celtics will also receive a first-round draft choice 
in one of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mercer and Fortson were up for contract extensions this  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, who played for Celtics coach Rick Pitino at Kentucky,  
averaged 17 points per game last year and is considered an emerging 
star. The Celtics began exploring the trade market last month after 
Mercer said there was a ``huge difference'' between the Celtics 
initial offer and what he was asking on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino said the addition of the 6-foot-6, 260-pound Fortson  
changes the Celtics from an offensive, finesse-oriented team, to a 
``tough-minded'' club, and solidifies the Celtics low post game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to shore up our front court,'' he said. ``We've done  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino said the team would not have moved Mercer if not for his  
contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' Pitino said. ``I could  
not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer wanted as a 
basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson was fourth in the league in rebounding with a 11.6 per  
game average last year, his third in the league. Fortson also 
averaged 11 points per game. Fortson came to Denver by a trade 
after being picked by Milwaukee in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal brings Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. Williams, a fourth year player, 
averaged 15 points per game for the Celtics in 1996-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams left the Celtics under a cloud, with Pitino questioning  
his work ethic. But today Pitino said he was convinced Williams had 
changed his ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made a 360-degree turn about in all departments,'' he  
said. ``Now we're getting back a ballplayer that has matured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams contract, the 
maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics also announced the signing of free agent guard Wayne  
Turner today. Pitino said he envisions Turner, a Boston native who 
played for Kentucky, as a third guard on the Celtics.

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels designated catcher  
Charlie O'Brien for assignment on Monday and called up catcher Ben 
Molina from Triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who spent seven weeks on the disabled list because of a

<P>
	Molina, 25, played 65 games for Edmonton this season and batted  
.286 with seven homers and 41 RBIs. He appeared in two games last

May 1993.

<HEADLINE> Feds Owed $49B in Unpaid Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is owed nearly $50 billion in  
unpaid payroll taxes and has little chance of collecting it all, a 
congressional audit has found. Poor record-keeping by the Internal 
Revenue Service is partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said the agency would use the  
audit to make ``what near-term improvements we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.8 million businesses owed $49 billion in cumulative  
unpaid payroll taxes as of Sept. 30, 1998, according to the General 
Accounting Office audit released Monday by the House Government 
Reform Committee's government management panel. The sum includes 
about $19 billion in unpaid taxes and $30 billion in penalties and 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The $49 billion figure also represents just under one-fourth --  
22 percent -- of the $222 billion in taxes owed the IRS as of 
September 1998, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also has levied $15 billion in additional penalties  
against 185,000 people for withholding but not forwarding the 
payroll taxes -- which help pay for Social Security and Medicare 
benefits -- to the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more than 18,000 people in this group received  
federal benefits worth $212 million, including Social Security and 
retirement payments, despite their $2 billion in payroll tax debt, 
the audit found. Others received vendor payments and loans. Federal 
law does not bar businesses or individuals from collecting federal 
payments or loans while they owe payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutz said it was unlikely that all of the outstanding payroll  
tax payments would be recovered. Many of the businesses are defunct 
or do not have the money to pay or the IRS cannot find them, IRS 
records reviewed for the audit show. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the offenders were small businesses in labor-intensive  
industries with few assets, such as construction companies and 
restaurants, Kutz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated no more than 9 cents on the dollar eventually would  
be collected. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors contribute to the problem, including  
technological and other operational weaknesses at the IRS, Kutz 
said. The agency has no assurance that its records are accurate 
because it keeps separate databases for businesses and individuals 
on systems that cannot communicate with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayer education and programs to highlight delinquency  
problems before they become serious also have been ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal law also can hinder the IRS' ability to  
collect, and the agency's criminal division will not prosecute 
taxpayers who fail to pay payroll taxes unless fraud is clearly 
evident, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rossotti said the IRS would use the report to make  
improvements, he cautioned subcommittee members against looking for 
a quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be misleading everyone to believe this problem can be  
solved by anything we could do short of revamping this process,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 102,000-employee agency is implementing changes required by  
a 1998 restructuring law. It also plans next summer to begin 
withholding up to 15 percent of a delinquent taxpayer's federal 
benefits, as authorized by separate legislation.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Sanders Return Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders will not return to the  
Dallas Cowboys until September, and even that may be a bit 
optimistic, team owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we won't see him in a preseason game,'' Jones said,  
confirming for the first time what had long been suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is in training camp but not practicing with the team as  
he rehabilitates his left big toe. He underwent surgery to fix an 
extreme case of turf toe in April. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no estimate of when the All-Pro cornerback might  
suit up until Tuesday, when Jones said: ``I see him really trying 
to push himself sometime in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones also noted that if Sanders sits for all of  
September, he would miss only two games because Dallas has an early 
bye-week. The Cowboys' third game is Oct. 3 against division rival 
Arizona in Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Deion misses only two ballgames, then we've hit a home  
run,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' injury kept him out of five games last year and limited  
him in two others. The Cowboys were 8-3 in games he played and 2-3 
without him. He returned for the first-round playoff loss to the 
Cardinals and played in the Pro Bowl, but was still in pain two 
months later and opted for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing training camp and preseason games is nothing new for  
Sanders, who earlier in his career didn't start playing football 
until he finished the major league baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he doesn't expect the layoff to be a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than his rehabilitation on his toe, Deion is going to be  
in football shape by September,'' Jones said. ``We're not going to 
push anything anyway. It's going to have to be obvious to himself 
and to everybody that he cannot in any way be compromised.''

<HEADLINE> WWF Plans To Sell Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- For years, pro wrestling fans have loved  
the body slams, pile drivers and outrageous stunts of the World 
Wrestling Federation. Now, the WWF is hoping its antics will 
attract investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stamford-based company is planning to raise $172.5 million  
in an initial public offering, according to documents filed Tuesday 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the IPO have not yet been determined. The company  
said it will apply to have the shares listed on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market under the proposed ticker symbol WWFE. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they expect investors will snap up the company's  
shares, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF's Monday night cable television program, ``RAW is WAR,''  
is wildly popular, drawing about 6 million viewers each week. 
Millions more tune in to monthly pay-per-view matches that cost 
about $30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrestling is all about fans' devotion, and it will make the  
fans more devoted to the product and more loyal if they buy 
stock,'' said Dave Meltzer, who publishes the Wrestling Observer 
newsletter in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, publisher of the Pro Wrestling Torch Weekly, said  
even people who are not fans of the muscle-bound wrestlers and 
their salacious story lines may want to invest in the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the WWF -- even though it's something of an outlandish  
company in terms of the product it promotes -- can be evaluated just 
as any other IPO should be. It's got a track record like any other 
company,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the SEC, the company listed profits of $56  
million and revenues of $251.5 million in the fiscal year that 
ended April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said 5 million households purchased its pay-per-view  
programs in the past fiscal year, bringing in revenues of $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the WWF said it plans to use proceeds from the  
offering for working capital and other business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering is being managed by Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc.,  
Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Wit Capital 
Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF has had a spate of bad publicity recently, most stemming  
from the death of Owen Hart, a wrestler known as The Blue Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart fell to his death May 23 during a stunt for a show in  
Kansas City, Mo. His widow and children have filed a wrongful death 
lawsuit against the WWF, the city and 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Sable, the former women's champion of the WWF, filed a $110  
million lawsuit against her former employer in June. She said she 
was degraded in a campaign to sell WWF merchandise and charged that 
professional wrestling has become increasingly ``obscene, 
titillating, vulgar and unsafe.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Makes Small Stock Fraud 'Sweep' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities and Exchange Commission officials  
announced Tuesday their second nationwide sweep against 
small-company stock fraud, a success tempered by worries over a 
legislative proposal that could reduce the SEC's budget and hamper 
future enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly would cut into our ability to bring cases,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker said at a news conference at 
which he announced enforcement actions against 82 people and 
companies in 26 cases of alleged stock fraud that bilked investors 
of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee proposal, approved last week,  
includes $324 million in funding next year for the SEC -- less than 
the agency's requested $361 million and its current operating 
budget of $337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House is expected to vote on the legislation this week  
before Congress adjourns for its summer recess. Parallel 
legislation already approved by the Senate would give the SEC 
$370.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fraud sweep, conducted last September, cracked down on  
41 people and companies that allegedly fleeced investors of more 
than $25 million in small-company stock manipulation schemes 
involving bogus medical breakthroughs, phony hotel renovations and 
online shopping, among other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Another SEC action in October targeted investment fraud over the  
Internet by people promoting small-company stocks who don't 
disclose they are paid to do so. The so-called microcap stocks are 
cheap, high-risk securities which usually are traded legitimately 
but have become a breeding ground for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, only four of the 26 cases involved the Internet,  
which allegedly was used to disseminate false information about 
companies to lure investors to their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The people and companies targeted in the new sweep raked in some  
$12.5 million in illegal gains, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current sweep includes a gamut of small-stock fraud cases,  
such as stock-price manipulation schemes, sales of unregistered 
stocks and ``boiler room'' frauds in which brokers make 
high-pressure, unsolicited phone calls to people to sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the cases are a California airline whose planes never took  
off, husband and wife officers of a company who allegedly stole 
$900,000 in stock proceeds for vacations in Hawaii and Europe, and 
a Bolivian mining company accused of buying mineral properties in a 
sham transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's actions against the 82 people and companies included  
seeking civil injunctions, barring individuals from the securities 
industry and imposing sanctions against accountants and attorneys 
who participated. No fines were imposed. Some of the cases have 
been settled, with the companies and individuals involved neither 
admitting to nor denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new SEC actions are another victory in the war against  
(small-stock) fraud,'' said Peter Hildreth, president of the North 
American Securities Administrators Association, which represents 
state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we can't let down our guard,'' Hildreth added. ``Some of  
these predators are moving on to or starting up smaller firms, 
hoping to fly beneath the regulators' radar screens.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Violence Among Teens Is Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Despite concerns over school shootings in recent  
years, violent acts by American high school students declined 
between 1991 and 1997, researchers reported in a study released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found a significant drop in the number of students who  
said they got into fights or carried weapons. The decline was 
steeper for girls than it was for boys. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on data collected through the Youth Risk  
Behavior Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are similar to the results of other recent national  
surveys. But the report's authors warned against interpreting them 
too optimistically. They wrote that rates of youth homicide and 
other violence are still at ``historically high levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that in 1991, 42.5 percent of high school  
students said they had been in a fight in the previous year, but 
the figure was 36.6 percent in 1997. And in 1991, 26.1 percent said 
they had carried a weapon in the previous month, but the rate 
dropped to 18.3 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Indicted for Mailing Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Three people from Northern Ireland  
and a another from the Irish Republic have been indicted on federal 
charges they bought guns in Florida and mailed them to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men, one of whom is allegedly connected to the Irish  
Republican Army, are accused of violating the Arms Export Control 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men bought 44 handguns from a Boynton Beach gun dealer and  
the group then mailed 15 of the weapons, without export licenses or 
proper authorization, to different addresses in Ireland, according 
to an indictment handed down Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Named in the indictment were Siobhan Browne, an Irish citizen  
living in south Florida; and Anthony Smyth, Conor Anthony Claxton 
and Martin Mullan, all citizens of the United Kingdom and Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal prosecutor said Claxton admitted involvement with the  
IRA, but Claxton's attorney denied the claim and authorities have 
acknowledged they have not confirmed if the men are affiliated with 
IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	All four were charged with conspiracy to export firearms without  
a license or approval, exporting the guns without export licenses 
or written approval, and using the Postal Service to illegally 
export the handguns.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Robert Brooks Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- After suffering a crippling knee injury  
three years ago, Robert Brooks knew he would have to live with 
pain. He just didn't realize how much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers wide receiver retired Monday after a  
seven-year career cut short by the knee injury and the resulting 
problems caused by overcompensating for it. After one day of 
training camp workouts Friday, he knew the pain was too much to 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put up the facade any more of being a tough guy,''  
Brooks said. ``I think I've done that long enough. It's allowed me 
to play in this game longer than I think anybody expected me to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks never became the superstar many thought he would. He said  
his knees, back and hamstrings could no longer withstand the 
punishment of pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can fool a lot of people, but you can't fool yourself,''  
he said. ``I'm 29 years old, and after a practice, I feel like I'm 
50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Favre, who was Brooks' quarterback his entire career,  
called Brooks ``the picture-perfect receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't the fastest, he wasn't the tallest, he couldn't jump  
the highest and he didn't have the best hands, but he did 
everything he was asked to do well,'' Favre said. ``I could count 
on him on every play. You have to rely on each other, and Robert 
was one of those guys you could rely on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' injury problems began in October 1996, when he tore both  
the ACL and the patellar tendon in his right knee on the first 
offensive play of a game against San Francisco. Such a catastrophic 
injury would have ended many careers, but Brooks surprised team 
doctors by returning for the 1997 season and catching 60 passes for 
1,010 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brooks said his gimpy knee caused him to overwork his other  
joints, leading to chronic back pain. He had arthroscopic surgery 
during training camp last year for a herniated disc, and he had a 
similar operation Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought about retiring then, but reconsidered after talking  
with coach Ray Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the feeling as if they were counting on me,''  
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks retires as the Packers' career leader in postseason  
catches and receiving yards. He is the seventh-leading receiver in 
the club's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	His career followed the arc of the Packers' franchise rebirth,  
and he was one of the team's most popular players during its run to 
consecutive NFC championships and a league title. Brooks originated 
the ``Lambeau Leap,'' the Packers' trademark jump into the Lambeau 
Field stands to celebrate a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert has meant a great deal to this organization and to me  
personally,'' offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said. ``If he 
couldn't perform at the level he wanted to, then I understand 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't cover it up any more,'' Brooks said. ``I found  
myself missing so many practices and taking so much medication just 
to practice. When you get to that point, I think it's time to call 
it quits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was drafted out of South Carolina in 1992, the same year  
coach Mike Holmgren and Lewis were hired. In 1995, Brooks caught 
102 passes for a team-record 1,497 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But the next three seasons he had just 114 catches for 1,774  
yards while missing 16 games with injuries. He had 31 receptions 
for 420 yards in 12 games last season while playing in he what 
called ``almost constant pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks participated in a team minicamp this summer and said he  
was in the best shape of his life. But when he dropped several 
balls during his first day of practice Friday at training camp, it 
was obvious something was still wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure leaves the Packers alarmingly short of depth at  
wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's top receiver, All-Pro Antonio Freeman, is in the  
midst of a contract dispute. Freeman's agent, Joel Segal, did not 
return a phone call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey Bradford, Bill Schroeder, Derrick Mayes and an assortment  
of free agents and rookies are left to be Favre's targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that concerns me a great deal,'' Lewis said. ``But  
we'll get Antonio in here and some of our young guys will step up. 
We have a fine group of receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' first exhibition game is Aug. 14 against the New  
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Andre Reed, Buffalo's leading career receiver and one of its few  
remaining links to the Bills' four Super Bowl appearances, ended a 
holdout by signing a three-year contract that includes a one-year 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal sweetened the pot considerably for Reed, who got a  
$1.8 million signing bonus. Reed agreed to a deal for $2.2 million 
this season, $900,000 more than his contract was due to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	Keith Byars, the New York Jets' starting fullback last season,  
has re-signed a one-year contract with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	An All-Pro with the Philadelphia Eagles, Byars will step back  
into his starting role in the Jets offense, a hybrid fullback-tight 
end spot. Serving primarily as a blocker for running back Curtis 
Martin, Byars rushed for 34 yards on four carries last year, adding 
258 yards and three touchdowns on 26 catches. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver David Boston, Arizona's top pick in the draft,  
reached a contract agreement that will pay him $7 million over four 
years, including a $3.8 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, who broke 11 school records in three seasons at Ohio  
State, is expected to be fully recovered from a fractured left 
shoulder, an injury that occurred during a Cardinals' minicamp on 
May 2. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago signed first-round draft pick Cade McNown to a  
seven-year deal that includes a $6.1 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback's agent, Tom Condon, said the deal could be  
worth $22 million with incentives and the signing bonus. McNown was 
the 12th pick overall in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Raiders    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Rashaan Salaam, attempting a comeback with the  
Raiders, says an addiction to marijuana made him withdrawn, caused 
him to fumble and nearly ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't a social person. I was just an outcast,'' he told  
ESPN. ``All I wanted to do was go home and do what I wanted to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, who won the Heisman Trophy at Colorado in 1994, was  
plagued by fumbles with the Chicago Bears, losing 14 in 31 games. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis had surgery on  
his left knee Monday, but is expected back for the team's season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who re-injured his left knee during private preseason  
workouts nearly two weeks ago in St. Louis, felt some discomfort in 
the knee Monday after a hard workout the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Harold Green, waived by Atlanta in February, signed  
with Atlanta and was on the field Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Green played in six regular-season and all three postseason  
games for Atlanta last year. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Browns    	
</P>
<P>
	John Dutton, a quarterback who broke his foot last week in  
training camp, was placed on the waived-injured list by the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is not picked up by another NFL team by today, he will be  
placed on Cleveland's injured reserve list. Dutton, competing for 
the team's third-string quarterback spot, broke a bone in his left 
foot last week and will be in a cast for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Vikings rookie defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, the  
29th overall draft pick, skipped Monday afternoon's practice, and 
team officials did not know why. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said the absence was unexcused,  
but that nobody knew why Underwood left. A team official said 
Underwood was neither ill nor injured. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans will be without backup running back Rodney  
Thomas at least two weeks following arthroscopic surgery on his 
right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas injured his right ankle at practice Sunday, and an MRI  
showed loose particles in the ankle. Thomas rushed for 100 yards on 
24 carries last season when he missed five games with an injured 
hamstring.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nick Anderson, the last original member of the Orlando Magic,  
appears headed to the Sacramento Kings, and Ron Mercer will be 
playing for the Denver Nuggets instead of the Boston Celtics next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf, meanwhile, have joined the  
Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of player movement picked up Monday and today on the  
second and third days since the expiration of a one-month 
moratorium on NBA trades and free agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was set to be traded to Sacramento for Tariq  
Abdul-Wahad, and Mercer was sent to Denver in a six-player trade 
announced today. Boston also sent Popeye Jones and Dwayne 
Schintzius to Denver for Danny Fortson, Eric Washington, Eric 
Williams and a first-round draft choice in one of the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers signed Schrempf for $4.2 million over two years,  
beating out the Utah Jazz. Portland also convinced Jermaine O'Neal 
to turn down what he said was a one-year, $9 million-$10 million 
offer elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Oakley was in Los Angeles to speak to the Lakers, even  
as the Toronto Raptors had an offer worth about $6 million annually 
on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no movement on the Penny Hardaway or Mitch  
Richmond trade fronts, while the other two big-ticket free agents -- 
Terrell Brandon and Vin Baker -- appeared almost certain to remain 
with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Rogers agreed to terms with the Phoenix Suns, Michael  
Curry moved from Milwaukee to the Pistons, Jud Buechler chose to 
stay in Detroit and Jelani McCoy re-signed with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento, after scheduling a news conference to announce the  
re-signings of Jon Barry and Scot Pollard, suddenly called it off. 
General manager Geoff Petrie instead worked out a trade sending 
Tariq Abdul-Wahad to the Orlando Magic for Anderson. The deal was 
likely to be completed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics coach Rick Pitino said the addition of the bruising  
6-foot-6, 260-pound Fortson, the fourth-leading rebounder in the 
NBA last season, changes the Celtics from an offensive, 
finesse-oriented team, to a ``tough-minded'' club. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to shore up our frontcourt,'' he said. ``We've done  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino said the team would not have moved Mercer -- who also  
played for Pitino at Kentucky -- if not for his contract demands. 
The Celtics also announced the signing of free agent guard Wayne 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Trail Blazers-Hawks four-player deal, Rider and Jim  
Jackson were sent to Atlanta for Smith and Ed Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent trade sending Jackson from Atlanta to the Los  
Angeles Clippers for free agent Lorenzen Wright was being 
discussed, but Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said the teams 
``were not even close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to add depth to our frontcourt, depending on  
how heavy a price it would be on the rest of our roster,'' Babcock 
said. ``We didn't make this trade with a plan to move one of these 
players on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a particularly busy day for the Blazers, who increased  
their offer to the 20-year-old O'Neal. O'Neal got a four-year 
contract. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers agreed to take the $2 million mid-level exception from  
the Suns, who have already re-signed Clifford Robinson and remain 
in the hunt for Hardaway. The contract is for three years, with the 
final season at the player's option. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry took the Pistons' five-year, $12 million offer over a  
four-year, $10 million offer from Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler signed a one-year deal with a player option for a  
second year using the team's $1.1 million exception, said his 
agent, Mark Bartelstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, insulted by Seattle's $1.1 million offer, decided to  
move to Portland for two years at $4.2 million. His final choices 
were Portland and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's saved all his money, he just wants to win a  
championship,'' said his agent, Tony Dutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf also drew interest from the San Antonio Spurs, but told  
them he preferred to remain closer to his family in Seattle. The 
36-year-old spent the past five season with the Sonics, who are 
courting Shandon Anderson and Cedric Ceballos as his replacement. 
Seattle also expressed interest in Rick Fox, but he is expected to 
return to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio reportedly was close to an agreement with Lamond  
Murray of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics also were waiting to hear from the Wizards regarding  
a possible trade for Richmond, who has reportedly been offered $30 
million for three years to stay in Washington. Seattle would like 
to acquire him in a sign-and-trade deal involving Hersey Hawkins 
and another player, but the Sonics also could try to trade Hawkins 
to a third team to clear enough cap room to sign Richmond as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today that the Seattle  
SuperSonics will attempt to lure free-agent forward Gary Trent from 
the Dallas Mavericks with a three-year-contract worth $11.28 
million 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's agent was to meet with the Sonics, and Brandon's agent  
was working with the Timberwolves to complete a deal that would 
keep the point guard in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutt, who also represents Nick Van Exel, was meeting with  
Nuggets executives in Denver on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're close in some areas, not so close in other areas,'' Dutt  
said. ``Hopefully, if we each move in some areas, maybe we can 
finish this afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles to meet with the Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have offered Oakley a three-year contract believed  
to be worth about $18 million, and the Hawks could still make a 
slightly smaller offer if they are unable to work out a deal with 
the Clippers for Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's future remained uncertain, with the Magic hoping to  
get a better offer from Phoenix in a sign-and-trade deal and the 
Lakers also trying to put together a package that would satisfy the 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Suns or Lakers can't pull off a trade and Hardaway does  
not return to Orlando, his best option would be to sign with the 
Raptors or Clippers -- the only teams with enough salary cap room to 
give him a lucrative contract starting at $9.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The strangely silent Chicago Bulls also have loads of cap room,  
but Hardaway apparently does not want to play there.

<HEADLINE> New Study on Shroud of Turin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Shroud of Turin is much older than some  
scientists believe, according to researchers who used pollen and 
plant images to conclude it dates from Jerusalem before the eighth 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gives a boost to those who believe the shroud is the  
burial cloth of Jesus and contradicts a 1988 examination by 
scientists who said the shroud was made between 1260 and 1390. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the researchers said the cloth originated in the  
Jerusalem area, also contradicting the 1988 study which concluded 
it came from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The shroud's age is implied by pollen grains found on it that  
match those on another cloth associated with Jesus Christ, botany 
professor Avinoam Danin of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said 
Monday during the International Botanical Congress here. 
</P>
<P>
	The other cloth has been kept in the same location since the  
eighth century, and its known history is even longer, traceable to 
the first century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shroud of Turin is a linen cloth about 13 feet long and 3  
feet wide that has been kept in the city of Turin, Italy, since 
1578. It bears the image of a man with wounds similar to those 
suffered by Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	The shroud also contains pollen grains and faint images of  
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have identified by images and by pollen grains species on  
the shroud restricted to the vicinity of Jerusalem,'' Danin said 
Monday, reiterating the findings released in June. ``The sayings 
that the shroud is from European origin can't hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis of the floral images and a separate analysis of the  
pollen grains by botanist Uri Baruch identified a combination of 
plant species that could be found only in March and April in the 
region of Jerusalem, Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danin identified a high density of pollen of the tumbleweed  
Gundelia tournefortii. The analysis also found the bean caper. The 
two species coexist in a limited area, Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination of flowers can be found in only one region of  
the world,'' he said. ``The evidence clearly points to a floral 
grouping from the area surrounding Jerusalem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An image of the Gundelia tournefortii can be seen near the image  
of the man's shoulder. Some experts have suggested that the plant 
was used for the ``crown of thorns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two pollen grains of the species were also found on the Sudarium  
of Oviedo, believed to be the burial face cloth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Danin, who has done extensive study on plants in Jerusalem, said  
the pollen grains are native to the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Sudarium of Oviedo has resided in the Cathedral of  
Oviedo in Spain since the eighth century, Danin said that the 
matching pollen grains push the shroud's date to a similar age. 
Both cloths also carry type AB blood stains in similar patterns, 
Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pollen association and the similarities in the blood  
stains in the two cloths provide clear evidence that the shroud 
originated before the eighth century,'' Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The location of the Sudarium of Oviedo has been documented since  
the first century. If it is found that the two cloths are linked, 
then the shroud could be even older, Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 study used carbon dating tests. Danin noted that the  
earlier study looked at only a single sample, while he used the 
entire piece of fabric.

<HEADLINE> Panel Unveils Transportation Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill proposed Tuesday would create a  
high-level office in the Transportation Department dedicated solely 
to truck and bus safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion piece of legislation would give the families of  
railroad disaster victims the same type of special help provided in 
a 1996 law to relatives of airline disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation  
Committee, said the committee will pass both measures by Thursday 
and send them to the full House for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a major safety crisis in trucking, but there is  
room for improvement,'' Shuster, R-Pa., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the aviation family assistance bill, he added:  
``That legislation has been a success in the aviation world, and 
hopefully we'll have similar success in the railroad industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999'' would create a Motor  
Carrier Administration within the Transportation Department to 
administer federal motor carrier safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	That work now is handled by the Office of Motor Carriers, an  
agency within the Federal Highway Administration, which itself is 
part of the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The motor carriers office has been criticized as being too cozy  
with the trucking industry. The committee hopes to bring special 
attention to truck and bus safety by spotlighting a new office, 
said Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, the Transportation 
Committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Rail Passenger Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1999,''  
meanwhile, would establish the National Transportation Safety Board 
as the point of contact within the government for families of 
railroad disaster victims. It would also prohibit lawyers from 
making unsolicited contact with victims or their families for 45 
days after a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department submitted its own highway and rail  
legislation Monday. There has been movement from Congress and the 
administration in both areas this year after 11 people were killed 
in the collision of an Amtrak train with a truck in Bourbonnais, 
Ill., and 22 in the crash of a charter bus in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Calls Lee's Claims 'Bunk' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Tuesday  
accused Wen Ho Lee, a government scientist suspected of giving 
China details about America's nuclear arsenal, of trying to use the 
``race card'' to defend his actions. He also said Lee's claim that 
top-secret weapons code work is often done on unclassified 
computers was ``pure bunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, was fired from  
his top-secret job at Los Alamos last March for security violations 
after being investigated on suspicion of providing China 
information in the 1980s about a key U.S. nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday, Lee suggested he was  
targeted in a three-year espionage investigation, because he was 
the only Asian-American in the weapons design group. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities needed a scapegoat, he said. ``They think I'm  
perfect for them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about that claim on Tuesday, Richardson reacted  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect unfairly tried to use the race card,'' Richardson  
said. ``He tried to portray himself as a victim after he massively 
violated our security system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any crime, although a federal  
grand jury in Albuquerque, N.M., reportedly is taking testimony in 
the case. His lawyer, Mark Holscher, did not return a telephone 
call to his office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	During his interview on ``60 Minutes,'' Lee categorically denied  
giving secrets to China or anyone else. He also claimed that 
weapons designers routinely use unclassified computers to work on 
sensitive weapons codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee admitted he had transferred top-secret computer codes -- a  
legacy of warhead development and testing -- from the highly secured 
computer system to his personal office computer, which is an 
unclassified system and linked to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do that routinely. ... It's a very common practice'' among  
the weapons designers, Lee insisted. He reportedly has told 
investigators that he made the transfers, dating back to 1995, to 
provide a ``backup'' for the codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson reacted sharply to that claim too.  
</P>
<P>
	``That is pure bunk,'' Richardson said. ``This `everybody does  
it' business is just a sorry excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has called Lee's transferring of codes from a secure  
computer to his office PC -- which came to light after Lee was fired 
when his computer was searched -- a ``massive violation of our 
security system'' although it has not been determined that any of 
the files ever left the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Alamos, nuclear weapons scientists with super-secret  
``Q'' clearances work in two totally independent computer systems. 
One contains top-secret nuclear weapons codes and can be used only 
by a small number of scientists with no outside access. The other 
system has fewer safeguards, can be penetrated from outside the lab 
by sophisticated hackers, and is not supposed to contain top-secret 
material. Material also could have been sent outside through the 
unsecured system, although tighter controls have been installed in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Los Alamos weapons scientists and managers, speaking on  
condition of not being identified, acknowledge that materials 
occasionally have been transferred from the secure system to the 
unsecured system. 
</P>
<P>
	But these transfers generally involved material that had been  
unclassified but was being used in the top-secret system. Even if 
there were no criminal intent, transferring top-secret codes to the 
unclassified system would be considered ``stupid'' and a momentous 
blunder, said one weapons scientist who has worked at Los Alamos 
for more than a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	The codes in question in the Lee case involved so-called  
``Legacy Codes'' that amount to an archived history of warhead 
development and testing over the years. While not a recipe for 
making nuclear bombs, the codes would provide valuable information 
about weapons development, scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Releases $55M for Cooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today released $55 million  
in federal aid to help residents of nine states cope with the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, provided under a program that is used more often to  
help low-income people pay for heat during the winter, may be used 
to buy air conditioners, fans and other relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois will get $15.9 million; Kentucky $7.7 million; Missouri  
$7.6 million; Indiana $7.1 million; Wisconsin $4.4 million; Iowa 
$3.4 million; Kansas $3.3 million; Minnesota $3 million; and 
Nebraska $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made as the president flew to Chicago,  
where he visited workers helping the elderly, lower income 
residents and other vulnerable people suffering from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been very, very tough. You've done a great job and I am  
profoundly grateful,'' he told the aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton especially encouraged elderly people with air  
conditioners to turn their units on and not worry about high 
electric bills because assistance is available. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should never have to worry in this country about  
risking their lives because they can't pay their power bills,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management Meets Low Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc., whose stock price shrunk  
in half last month in the wake of two separate warnings of reduced 
earnings, met lowered expectations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 1 trash hauler earned $371.8 million after  
special items, or 58 cents a share, compared with $243.2 million, 
or 41 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts initially had Houston-based Waste Management earning 78  
cents per share, then lowered their estimate to 67 cents after the 
company's July 6 warning that trash collection revenues were much 
lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the company issued a second warning that revised  
accounting procedures and even worse income than first thought 
would depress earnings to between 58-60 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management's share price, which had peaked at $60 in May,  
plummeted into the $25-$26 range in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Waste Management fell $1.25 to $24.18 3/4 or 4.9  
percent in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management also said Tuesday that an internal audit might  
cause it to restate first-quarter results. The company singled out 
$95 million reported as operating income that instead should have 
been calculated as non-recurring items. 
</P>
<P>
	A revised first-quarter report could reduce earnings to 52 cents  
a share from 61 cents. Analysts at the time had expected 62 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter results excluded a one-time expense of $49.3  
million, or 8 cents a share, on pre-tax charges, costs related to 
merger activity and the early retirement of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew 2.6 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.25 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite healthy profits, investors have punished Waste  
Management because earnings initially were expected to be at least 
$100 million better. The company has blamed poor forecasting and 
its chief financial officer took another position within the 
company last month. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Waste Management earned  
$755.4 million, or $1.25 per share, compared to $442.3 million, or 
77 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month revenues rose to $6.41 billion from $6.22 billion in  
1998.

<HEADLINE> Child-Abuse Deaths Underreported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of young children who die at the hands  
of parents or other caregivers is underreported by nearly 60 
percent, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on an analysis of North Carolina records,  
but researchers said the results reflect the situation nationwide 
because all states use the same system to classify deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Caregivers commit 85 percent of the homicides of children 10 and  
under, and strangers are the killers only 3 percent of the time, 
said Dr. Marcia E. Herman-Giddens, lead author of the study, 
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, we as a society have not cared enough to do what we  
need to do to get accurate data on child abuse homicides,'' she 
said. ``If you don't have good data about the problem, good 
numbers, you can't possibly begin to do anything about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman-Giddens, who teaches maternal and child health at the  
University of North Carolina, said the problem is that all states 
use the International Classification of Diseases to record deaths, 
and the system's specifications are flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, three children who are stabbed to death would not  
be listed as abuse victims because the classification system says 
abuse deaths result from a string of events, not an isolated 
episode, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study counted child abuse deaths if they resulted from a  
single episode such as a shooting or from a string of events, and 
came at the hands of caregivers -- including babysitters and 
boyfriends of mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	With that system in mind, the researchers analyzed records from  
medical examiners, police and other sources on the 259 homicides of 
children 10 and younger in North Carolina from 1985 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, the state's system underreported the number of deaths  
from battering or abuse by 58.7 percent, the researchers said. 
Biological parents committed 64 percent of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Translated to a national scale, the study suggests that 6,500  
more children than national statistics reflect were victims of 
homicide due to abuse from 1985 through 1996. The researchers 
estimated that in 1996, 835 children died at the hands of 
caregivers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Johnson, president of Prevent Child Abuse America, which  
was not involved in the study, said it gives credibility to what 
some experts have been saying for years -- that twice as many 
children are abused as reports indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman-Giddens said death certificates need to be redesigned to  
accommodate information related to abuse, and medical examiners and 
coroners need better training to recognize such deaths.

</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Abdel Wahab al-Bayati, a renowned Iraqi  
writer who revolutionized Arabic poetry while spending half his 
life in exile, died Tuesday of a heart attack in Damascus. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Bayati sought refuge in Jordan after quitting his diplomatic  
post in Madrid, Spain, in disgust following Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Saddam Hussein's government stripped him of his  
citizenship after he visited Saudi Arabia to participate in a 
cultural festival. 
</P>
<P>
	After his graduation from Baghdad University in 1950, al-Bayati  
became a teacher, but was soon dismissed for his leftist political 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, he went into exile, first to Syria and then to the  
Soviet Union and Egypt. He returned to Iraq after the 1958 anti- 
monarchy coup, but later fled again after disagreements with the 
next government. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned after the 1968 coup, but fled a few years later when  
the regime began a brutal campaign against leftists. In 1980, 
Saddam assigned him to Iraq's diplomatic mission in Madrid in an 
attempt to win him over to his side. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Bayati was one of the first Arab poets who broke away from  
classical forms of poetry and started what later became known as 
free verse.

<P>
	WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Russell Inslee Clark Jr., former  
president of the prestigious Horace Mann School in New York and 
Yale admissions dean, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yale graduate, Clark became dean of the school's Trumbell  
College in 1963. He was Yale's dean of admissions from 1965 to 
1969, successfully pushing for the admission of women. He also 
lectured in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
	He became headmaster of Horace Mann in 1970. During a period of  
rapid change, he eliminated the traditional dress code of jacket 
and tie, oversaw the prep school's merger with Barnard School in 
1973 and pushed for the admission of girls, which began in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	He was promoted to president in 1981, putting him in charge of  
Horace Mann's four campuses in New York and Connecticut. During his 
tenure, the school's enrollment increased from 600 to 1,640, its 
staff more than doubled from 125 to 300 and its annual budget grew 
from $1 million to $15 million.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Gawthrop  
III, whose cases included one involving a law firm accused of 
firing a young associate with the AIDS virus, died Sunday of 
cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 1994 case ended in a settlement, Gawthrop wrote the  
first opinion that people who show no symptoms of AIDS can still be 
considered disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had striking similarities to the one depicted in the  
Academy Award-winning movie ``Philadelphia,'' which was released in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other notable cases in Gawthrop's court were the 1996  
sentencing of five police officers who pleaded guilty in a 
corruption scandal; the 1996 racketeering and bribery trial of 
former Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa.; and the lawsuit brought by 
parents against the Chester-Upland School District, in which he 
appointed a special master to implement education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Chester County Common Pleas Court in 1978.  
Former President Reagan nominated him to the federal bench in 1987.

</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Alberto Gironella, a leading Mexican  
surrealist painter and promoter of literature and the arts, died 
Monday after a long illness. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Details surrounding the death of Gironella, a gruff Bohemian who  
fiercely protected his privacy, were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper La Jornada on Tuesday, which he helped found in  
1984, published a front-page photo, but no story. The photo caption 
said he died Monday and that his body was immediately cremated 
according to his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend, Homero Aridjis, president of the international  
writers' organization PEN International, said Gironella had been 
suffering from terminal bone cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gironella painted his own surrealist versions of subjects as  
diverse as Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican Revolution leader, and 
Madonna, the singer, as well as his own interpretations of such 
famous classical paintings as Spaniard Diego Velazquez's ``Las 
Meninas'' and works by the Spanish painter Goya. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote poetry for a while and a novel, ``Tiburcio Esquila,''  
which was never published. Frustrated, he turned to painting and 
was immediately successful. In 1960, he was awarded a prize at the 
Paris Biennial for Young Painters. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years later, Gironella and many younger artists broke  
away from the politically inspired surrealist masters, such as the 
Communist muralists David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera, who 
concentrated on depicting the poverty and suffering of Mexico's 
working classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger artists insisted that art should not necessarily be  
political and artists should be freer to invent and fantasize and 
not be subjected to the constraints of what the older ones called 
``social conscience.''

<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, a  
chain-smoking general who led a coup in 1991 that toppled 
Thailand's civilian government, ushering in the country's last 
period of military rule, died Monday of lung cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloodless takeover led by Sunthorn and other senior officers  
ended a year later, shortly after troops gunned down some 50 
pro-democracy demonstrators in the streets of Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunthorn had since lived in obscurity. Like other figures behind  
the so-called National Peacekeeping Council that embodied the coup, 
he went unpunished for deposing Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan 
and for his alleged role in the massacre known as Bloody May. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover in 1991 was the last in a score of coups or  
attempted coups since Thailand ended absolute monarchy in 1932. The 
target was the four-year-old government led by Chatichai, which was 
notorious for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Pledging to clean up politics, the generals set up the National  
Peacekeeping Council with Sunthorn, supreme armed forces commander, 
as chairman. But he was generally seen as a figurehead, with real 
power in the hands of Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander.

	BAYTOWN, Texas (AP) -- Jim Kyle, a columnist for The Baytown Sun  
whose career in newspapers spanned more than a half-century, died 
Saturday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle, an award-winning journalist, wrote a humorous column that  
began in The Sun in 1966. His last column was published July 11. 
</P>
<P>
	He previously worked at newspapers in Odessa, Wichita Falls and  
Indianapolis. He had dined with President Reagan, landed on the 
aircraft carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, rode the USS San 
Jacinto from Mississippi to Houston and covered Pope John Paul II's 
visit to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle, who also had worked as a circulation manager for The Sun,  
covered the Indianapolis 500 for 38 consecutive years. 
</P>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sister Mary Linscott, who led the Congregation of  
the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, an international religious 
order with 4,000 teachers on four continents, died June 14 in 
Liverpool, according to The Times of London. She was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Linscott worked in both England and Vatican City as she rose  
through the Catholic Church, achieving a position and level of 
responsibility rare for a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Linscott first was exposed to the Notre Dame Congregation  
through her high school teachers. The Congregation was founded in 
1586 in Napoleonic France and today is working under many different 
educational systems. 
</P>
<P>
	She entered the Notre Dame de Namur novitiate in 1945.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, she became superior general of the Notre Dame  
Congregation, a position normally held by a Belgian or a French 
women. She then was elected president of the Union of International 
Superiors General in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Linscott initially was responsible for dealing only with the  
religious communities of women, but in 1985 she was promoted and 
given the same responsibility for men.

<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Robert H. Mollohan, a nine-term  
congressman and father of U.S. Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., died 
Tuesday of cancer. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Mollohan died at Washington (D.C.) Hospital Center.  
</P>
<P>
	Mollohan was elected to the U.S. House in 1952 along with future  
U.S. senator and friend Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). 
</P>
<P>
	Mollohan served two terms in Congress before running for West  
Virginia governor in 1956. He defeated four others in the 
Democratic primary but lost to Republican Cecil Underwood, who 
became the youngest governor in state history. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, Mollohan lost to Arch A. Moore Jr. in his bid to return  
to Congress. When Moore became governor in 1968, Mollohan won the 
U.S. House seat and served until his retirement in 1982, the same 
year Alan Mollohan was elected to the first of nine consecutive 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the elder Mollohan's major initiatives was securing the  
Pratt &AMP; Whitney aircraft facility at Bridgeport's Benedum Airport. 
He also was instrumental in passage of a federal Emergency Medical 
Services Act.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Yitzhak Rafael, a former legislator and  
government minister who helped bring hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants to Israel in its early years, died Tuesday after a long 
illness. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael, who came to Israel from Poland in 1935, headed the  
immigration department in the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency in 
the nation's early years and oversaw waves of immigration from 
1948-1953. 
</P>
<P>
	He made ``brave decisions at a young age,'' National Religious  
Party lawmaker Yigal Bibi told The Associated Press, crediting 
Rafael with refusing to limit Jewish immigration despite the strain 
on the new state's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael was religious affairs minister from 1974-1977 and served  
seven terms as a lawmaker from the National Religious Party. After 
retiring from public life, he wrote and published religious and 
Zionist writings as head of a Jerusalem institute affiliated with 
the party. In 1981, he published an autobiography, ``You Didn't 
Find the Light by Chance.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Climb on Crop News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures continued their steep  
climb Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government 
sharply lowered its assessment of crop conditions in major growing 
states. Wheat futures retreated 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in corn and soybeans ignored forecasts for beneficial  
showers to fall in the next 10 days over major growing areas as 
they digested the U.S. Agriculture Department's weekly crop update. 
The USDA reported conditions worsened in Illinois and Indiana in 
the past week under hot, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops in Ohio and Eastern states also were suffering under  
severe drought conditions. The unexpected turn in the weather 
during a growing season that has generally been beneficial to crop 
development now has analysts revising downward their fall 
production figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated after the government reported an  
improvement in spring wheat conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 11 cents to $2.87 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 1/4 cents to $2.30 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/4 cents to $1.17 a bushel; November soybeans rose 15 1/4 cents to 
$4.78 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 0.43 cent to 64.27 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.50 cent to 76.32 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 0.25 cent to 49.70 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
jumped 4.5 cents to 59.62 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Speaks Out on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Venturing into foreign policy, former Vice  
President Dan Quayle said Tuesday that the United States should pay 
more attention to Asian affairs, including developing a stronger 
relationship with democratic India. 
</P>
<P>
	In a National Press Club speech, the Republican presidential  
contender said American foreign policy has been tilted toward 
Europe, but the rise of Asia makes it imperative that the United 
States pay more attention to that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asia is much more important today than it was a generation  
ago,'' Quayle said. ``We do have to treat Asia economically, 
politically, militarily and diplomatically as we do Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle contrasted his foreign policy experience with that of  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who leads all Republican presidential 
candidates in the polls and in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``On day one, I'll be ready to be president,'' Quayle said. ``I  
don't believe we need another president who has inexperience when 
it comes to foreign policy. There's only so much you can get from 
briefings and briefers and crash courses when it comes to foreign 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president said he eventually wanted to bring  
China into the World Trade Organization and see the country move 
toward democracy. But he warned that some experts liken China to 
Germany of 100 years ago, which fought two world wars before 
becoming a democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is a huge challenge to us,'' Quayle said. ``I do not  
believe, as some in my party do, that China is the enemy. I view 
China as a huge opportunity. I want to see China become prosperous. 
I also want to see China become democratic, not just to engage 
China, but to change China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, he said, want to be respected as a world power,  
want control of Taiwan, and want the United States out of Asia. 
While China should be treated as a major player in the world and 
the United States should help resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully, 
Washington should make it clear that it plans to remain a power in 
the region, Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides reinforcing its alliances with South Korea and Japan,  
the United States also should develop a closer relationship with 
India, the world's most populous democracy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new opportunity,'' Quayle said. ``It would send a very  
strong message that we will stay in the Pacific for the long 
haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle also called for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv  
to Jerusalem and criticized the Clinton administration for 
appearing to back prime minister candidates from the more liberal 
Labor Party rather the more conservative Likud. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president in the past has tried to inject himself into  
Israeli prime minister politics, indicating that he can work with 
one better than the other,'' Quayle said. ``Look, Israel's a 
democracy. We will work with the prime minister of Israel, 
period.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Withdraws From Delaware Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Republicans have withdrawn from next  
year's Delaware presidential primary, saying it's not worth feuding 
with New Hampshire over an event that major candidates will 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire officials, upset that Delaware's primary was  
scheduled just four days after their first-in-the-nation event, 
persuaded candidates not to campaign in the First State. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware GOP Chairman Basil Battaglia said Monday, the deadline  
for opting out, that Republicans are studying options such as 
having a caucus vote to select a presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``To continue with a primary that almost every major candidate  
in both parties is boycotting accomplishes very little,'' Battaglia 
said. ``Under current law, it is very possible the current 
front-runner won't even be on our ballot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the Republican front-runner.  
</P>
<P>
	Delaware Democrats plan to proceed with a primary, Chairman  
Richard Bayard said.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Makes 'Blair Witch' Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The makers of the ``The Blair Witch  
Project'' have been sued by a man who says he was cheated out of 
credit for the film and deserves some of the millions earned by the 
hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Barber, an Orlando filmmaker, said that his company paid for  
much of the movie's preproduction costs and that he should have 
been listed as a producer or executive producer in the credits. He 
also claims that director Dan Myrick and Myrick's girlfriend broke 
into his office and took documents, a master copy of the film and 
other tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber is suing Myrick -- one of the film's two directors --  
Myrick's girlfriend, Kristal Jordan, and producer Greg Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	John Marshall Oden, an attorney for all three defendants, denied  
the theft allegation and called the lawsuit an attempt at 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber filed his lawsuit in June 1998, long before ``Blair  
Witch'' became one of this summer's biggest surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie has made more than $36 million. Barber is seeking a  
percentage of the movie's gross -- and he claims the percentage 
eventually could be worth at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants have filed a countersuit against Barber, alleging  
he tried to interfere with their agreement with Artisan 
Entertainment, the film's distributor, by seeking an injunction in 
California to stop the movie's release. The injunction was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' purports to be the story of three college-age  
filmmakers who disappear in the Maryland woods while trying to make 
a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch. Five University of 
Central Florida graduates spent $60,000 to shoot the film.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today voted 54-44 to reject a  
Democrat-backed $11 billion farm economy bailout bill. The

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- State-run Yugoslav media and senior  
government officials intensified their campaign against the 
opposition, and accused the West of trying to put President 
Slobodan Milosevic's opponents in power. The stepped-up effort came 
after independent opposition figures released a platform calling 
for a transitional government to replace Milosevic. President 
Clinton and other Western leaders have said Serbia will get no 
substantial reconstruction aid as long as Milosevic is in power.

seven-month program included 2,000 guardsmen who built three 
medical clinics and four schools, dug four wells and repaired a 
bridge and 15 miles of highway damaged by Hurricane Mitch last 
fall. Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people and left more

utility bills. Since July 19, the midsummer heat wave has killed at

million. In 1997, the film was declared to be the property of the

Major league baseball replaced the 22, beginning Sept. 2, after 
they submitted their resignations as a tool to start negotiations

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Battie Pleads in Cop Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Battie of the Boston Celtics pleaded Tuesday  
to ``sufficient facts'' in a case in which he was accused of 
dragging a police officer behind his car. 
</P>
<P>
	While not an admission of guilt, the plea acknowledges the case  
would have been made against him, had it moved forward, according 
to Jim Borghesani, spokesman for the Suffolk County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Municipal court judge Mark Summerville continued the case  
without a finding for a year. If Battie is arrested during that 
time, the case against him can be reopened, Borghesani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie, 23, was arrested during the early morning hours of April  
17 in front of the Cosmopolitan Club near the FleetCenter. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Battie refused to identify himself or move his car,  
despite several requests by an officer. When the officer tried to 
arrest him, Battie allegedly drove off while the officer's arm was 
caught in the driver's window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie stopped the car only after the officer drew his gun,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Battie's lawyer, Robert Keefe, was not immediately  
returned.

<HEADLINE> Probe Captured Asteroid Science Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft that failed to get  
close-up pictures during its flyby of an asteroid last week 
captured enough science data to determine the rock's makeup and 
raise questions about its past, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe Asteroid Braille may have once been part of a  
larger asteroid, Vesta, which is also cruising through the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 flew within 16 miles of Braille, a peanut-shaped  
object about 1.3 miles long. The July 26 flyby was the closest ever 
by a spacecraft -- twice the distance of a jetliner cruising above 
the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the probe's camera was not aimed accurately enough to  
take pictures at the closest point of the encounter, it did capture 
two fuzzy images and analyzed the rock's spectrum after the 
spacecraft reoriented itself about 15 minutes after the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's often said a picture is worth a thousand words, but today  
under this circumstance a spectrum is worth a thousand pictures,'' 
said Robert Nelson, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Data returned from the spacecraft's spectrometer indicate that  
Braille is made up of igneous rock, suggesting that at some point 
it melted and cooled. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesta, the second-largest known asteroid, also has a similar  
composition, and scientists believe that Braille may have once been 
part of Vesta. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple explanation is that ``Vesta was a victim of a  
collision of some sort and that it spewed off chips of the old 
rock,'' said Bonnie Buratti, a member of the mission's science 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope indicate Vesta, which  
is about 325 miles across, has a large impact crater on its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will continue to run computer models to find out how  
Braille could have traveled so far. Braille, between the orbit of 
Earth and Mars, is about 117 million miles from Earth. Vesta, 
between Mars and Jupiter, is 219 million miles away.

<HEADLINE> Gore Recalls Dad and Civil Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, recalling his father's  
fights with bigots spewing the ``N-word,'' told the Progressive 
National Baptist Convention: ``I want to create a future where 
nobody knows that term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While convention president C. Mackey Daniels introduced the  
campaigning Democrat as ``President Al Gore, one of the greatest 
leaders of all time,'' Gore said he was speaking Tuesday as 
``someone who is a child of the Kingdom and a person of strong 
faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He juiced up his standard campaign speech with Biblical  
references and a preacher's cadence. Many in the audience of black 
religious activists leapt to their feet when Gore said school 
districts should ``recruit more African-American teachers as role 
models for these boys and girls to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government should help parents with after-school care so young  
people can be safe and productive, ``without going home to the 
'Jerry Springer Show' or some other trashy program,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president cast the Democrats' fight with Republicans in  
Congress over tax cuts in stark class-warfare terms: The GOP 
leadership wants ``a risky tax scheme aimed at those at the top -- 
who already have much -- at the expense of our economy just at the 
time when it's starting to work for those at the bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at length of his father, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore  
Sr., who died last December, and his battle through the 1940s, 50s 
and 60s for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He supported the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and lost his next  
re-election. But his conscience won and he taught me that was more 
important than any election.''

<HEADLINE> Brown Widow Sees Congressional Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The widow of Rep. George E. Brown has  
decided to run for his seat, setting the stage for a tough 
Democratic primary in a campaign that will likely draw national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Macias Brown, 54, was expected to announce her candidacy  
as early as today, said Art Torres, chairman of the California 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 21 election and likely November runoff will be closely  
watched as a bellwether one year before the 2000 congressional 
races, when Democrats will try to break the GOP's slim hold in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The race will feature at least two Hispanic Democratic  
contenders in a Southern California district where the electorate 
is 27 percent Hispanic and growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was the oldest living member of the House when he died  
July 15 following an infection he developed after heart surgery. He 
was 79 and had been elected to the House 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was the third California congressman to die in office  
since October 1997. The other two widows -- Republican Mary Bono and 
Democrat Lois Capps -- captured their late husbands' seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running against a widow is always very difficult, because  
there's a sympathy factor,'' said Mike Madrid, political director 
for the state GOP when it fielded Tom Bordonaro against Capps, the 
widow of Democratic Rep. Walt Capps, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown's leading Democratic opponent is Joe Baca, who  
alienated himself from Brown supporters by publicly mulling a run 
against the congressman in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown's candidacy further splinters the Democratic vote and  
virtually eliminates the possibility a Democrat will win a majority 
in the primary. Another Democrat, Donald Hubner, also plans to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans likely to run are attorney and real estate  
businessman Elia Pirozzi, who lost to Brown last year; Linda Wilde, 
a Superior Court judge who lost in 1996 to Brown; and businessman 
John Corry.

<HEADLINE> Report: Angolan Rebels Massacre 46 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Eyewitnesses said Angola's UNITA rebels  
drove 50 villagers from their homes in a northern town, fatally 
shot them and dumped their bodies in a nearby river, the Portuguese 
news agency Lusa reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre is alleged to have taken place early Sunday in  
Quipacassa, Lusa said. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness, Mateus Sacaia, said the operation began at dawn  
when guerrillas shot 46 civilians who had recently returned to 
their homes from Malanje. They then hurled the bodies in the Cuanza 
River, Lusa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent verification of the report was not possible, and the  
UNITA leadership could not be contacted for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last week claimed to have retaken Kangandala from  
the rebels, but UNITA disputed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels have also denied responsibility for several mass  
graves containing hundreds of bodies, reportedly unearthed near the 
central highland city of Kuito. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a two-decade war flared again in December after four years  
of relative peace, the rebels have gained control over more than 
half the vast country, while the government remained set on 
defending major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Government troops on Monday repelled a rebel attack targeting  
fuel depots owned by the state oil company Sonangol in the central 
city of Huambo, the state-controlled daily Jornal de Angola 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that 10 rebels were killed in the clash.  
There was no mention of government casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between the government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym  
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, first 
erupted after the country in southwest Africa gained independence 
from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> SEC Makes Small Stock Fraud 'Sweep' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators announced  
enforcement actions today against 82 people and companies in 26 
cases of alleged stock fraud that bilked investors of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	As officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission announced  
the agency's second nationwide ``sweep'' against fraud involving 
small-company stocks, they also worried that a proposal by a key 
House committee that would reduce the SEC's budget could hamper 
their enforcement efforts if it became law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly would cut into our ability to bring cases,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest fraud sweep differed from the first, conducted last  
October, which cracked down on investment fraud over the Internet 
by people promoting small-company stocks who don't disclose they 
are paid to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, only four of the 26 cases involved the Internet,  
which allegedly was used to disseminate false information about 
companies to lure investors to their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The people and companies targeted in the new sweep raked in some  
$12.5 million in illegal gains, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current sweep includes a gamut of small-stock fraud cases,  
such as stock-price manipulation schemes, sales of unregistered 
stocks and ``boiler room'' frauds in which brokers make 
high-pressure, unsolicited phone calls to people to sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's actions against the 82 people and companies included  
seeking civil injunctions, barring individuals from the securities 
industry and imposing sanctions against accountants and attorneys 
who participated. No fines were imposed. Some of the cases have 
been settled, with the companies and individuals involved neither 
admitting to nor denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker also warned that a House Appropriations Committee  
proposal could have ``serious consequences'' for the SEC's 
fraud-fighting efforts. The proposal, approved last week, includes 
$324 million in funding next year for the SEC -- less than the 
agency's requested $351 million and its current operating budget of 
$337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House is expected to vote on the legislation this week  
before Congress adjourns for its summer recess. Parallel 
legislation already approved by the Senate would give the SEC 
$370.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Suspension Cut by Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry persuaded commissioner Bud  
Selig to cut his drug suspension short by a week. Next, he has to 
prove to the New York Yankees that he can play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's 120-day suspension for his arrest on solicitation  
and drug charges April 14 was reduced Monday, making him eligible 
to play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling good and I'm ready to get on with my life,''  
Strawberry said in Tampa, Fla. ``I'm starting to get into the frame 
of mind of playing. I'm looking forward to it. I'm ready to get 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's penalty was originally scheduled to run through  
Aug. 11. Selig decided to shorten the suspension after reviewing 
medical records and speaking to Strawberry twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing out of this for me was, it allowed the time off  
to really take care of myself physically and mentally,'' said 
Strawberry, who hasn't played since learning last Oct. 1 that he 
had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the suspension lifted and returning to the Yankees  
lineup for the first time in 10 months are different tasks. 
Strawberry's first priority is to prove at Triple-A Columbus that 
his surgically repaired left knee is healthy enough to play the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chili Davis entrenched at designated hitter, Strawberry  
will have to be able to play left field to get into the lineup 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to find out how the knee is going to hold out,  
whether he can play the outfield,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
think it's too far ahead right now. We all know what he brings to 
the table as an offensive threat, so it's tempting. But let's not 
get too excited until we see how his knee is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry is expected to play Wednesday night against Norfolk.  
Torre said Strawberry will need at least one week, probably more, 
before he will be ready to return to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been working out at the Yankees' minor league  
complex in Tampa since July 9. His batting practice performances 
have shown that the majestic left-handed swing that has hit 332 
career homers hasn't deserted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he gets the chance to do it in the minors. After waiting for  
a ruling from Selig since July 22, Strawberry isn't concerned about 
how long it will take to return to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too far ahead,'' Strawberry said. ``I really haven't  
thought about that. I'm just taking it day by day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who was suspended 60 days for testing positive for  
cocaine in 1995, admitted last month that an alcohol relapse 
contributed to his arrest. He has been attending Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings in Tampa, while working out. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played in a game since the final week of the 1998  
season, before surgery for colon cancer forced him to miss the 
playoffs and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been gone so long and we know everything he's been  
through,'' Davis said. ``To see him actually rise above everything 
else and come back, I know that's going to be uplifting for me. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was one of the most popular Yankees in the clubhouse  
before the cancer and suspension. And his teammates aren't worried 
that his return could disrupt the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a positive influence,'' Derek Jeter said. ``I don't see  
how Darryl could be a distraction. He's all about the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's availability has been a recurring theme around the  
Yankees for the past five seasons. He joined the Yankees on Aug. 4, 
1995, after spending four weeks in the minors following his first 
drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically and was not brought back at the start of  
1996. After a stint in the independent Northern League, Strawberry 
was brought back to New York in July 1996 and helped the Yankees 
win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only 11 games in an injury-plagued 1997. He made his  
biggest contributions last season, hitting 24 homers in 295 at-bats 
before being diagnosed with colon cancer during last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected return this season was delayed by chemotherapy  
treatments and then the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a unique organization,'' Torre said. ``Billy Martin  
came back five times. ... Distractions are always there. It's how 
you handle them that matters.''

Strawberry said in Tampa, Fla. ``I'm starting to get into the frame 
of mind of playing. I'm looking forward to it. I'm ready to get 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's penalty was originally scheduled to run through  
Aug. 11. Selig decided to shorten the suspension after reviewing 
medical records and speaking to Strawberry twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing out of this for me was, it allowed the time off  
to really take care of myself physically and mentally,'' said 
Strawberry, who hasn't played since learning last Oct. 1 that he 
had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the suspension lifted and returning to the Yankees  
lineup for the first time in 10 months are different tasks. 
Strawberry's first priority is to prove at Triple-A Columbus that 
his surgically repaired left knee is healthy enough to play the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chili Davis entrenched at designated hitter, Strawberry  
will have to be able to play left field to get into the lineup 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to find out how the knee is going to hold out,  
whether he can play the outfield,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
think it's too far ahead right now. We all know what he brings to 
the table as an offensive threat, so it's tempting. But let's not 
get too excited until we see how his knee is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry is expected to play Wednesday night against Norfolk.  
Torre said Strawberry will need at least one week, probably more, 
before he will be ready to return to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been working out at the Yankees' minor league  
complex in Tampa since July 9. His batting practice performances 
have shown that the majestic left-handed swing that has hit 332 
career homers hasn't deserted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he gets the chance to do it in the minors. After waiting for  
a ruling from Selig since July 22, Strawberry isn't concerned about 
how long it will take to return to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too far ahead,'' Strawberry said. ``I really haven't  
thought about that. I'm just taking it day by day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who was suspended 60 days for testing positive for  
cocaine in 1995, admitted last month that an alcohol relapse 
contributed to his arrest. He has been attending Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings in Tampa, while working out. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played in a game since the final week of the 1998  
season, before surgery for colon cancer forced him to miss the 
playoffs and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been gone so long and we know everything he's been  
through,'' Davis said. ``To see him actually rise above everything 
else and come back, I know that's going to be uplifting for me. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was one of the most popular Yankees in the clubhouse  
before the cancer and suspension. And his teammates aren't worried 
that his return could disrupt the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a positive influence,'' Derek Jeter said. ``I don't see  
how Darryl could be a distraction. He's all about the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's availability has been a recurring theme around the  
Yankees for the past five seasons. He joined the Yankees on Aug. 4, 
1995, after spending four weeks in the minors following his first 
drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically and was not brought back at the start of  
1996. After a stint in the independent Northern League, Strawberry 
was brought back to New York in July 1996 and helped the Yankees 
win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only 11 games in an injury-plagued 1997. He made his  
biggest contributions last season, hitting 24 homers in 295 at-bats 
before being diagnosed with colon cancer during last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected return this season was delayed by chemotherapy  
treatments and then the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a unique organization,'' Torre said. ``Billy Martin  
came back five times. ... Distractions are always there. It's how 
you handle them that matters.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Study of Vaccine Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many American children are experiencing  
reactions to vaccines for the problem to ignored by the government, 
according to Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who says his grandchildren 
are among those who have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, chairman of the House committee on government reform,  
said at a hearing Tuesday that there were reports last year of more 
than 11,000 cases of children getting sick after inoculations. Many 
of their ailments were minor, yet some required hospitalization, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said most American children are required to get 22 shots  
by the time they start school and ``some have described the current 
mandating of an increasing number of vaccines to children to be a 
good intention gone too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his grandchildren are among the youngsters who have  
developed illnesses after getting their shots. Burton said his 
granddaughter had to be hospitalized within hours of receiving a 
Hepatitis B vaccine, and his grandson became autistic after getting 
the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call that a coincidence, but I think it is more,''  
said Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	Later he added: ``We are going to be beating on this issue as  
long as I am chairman of this committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., ranking minority member of the  
committee, chided Burton for not having doctors who have studied 
vaccines for years and experts from vaccine manufacturers testify 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deeply regret that these groups are not here today to  
provide us with balanced and informed testimony,'' said Waxman. 
``That's what a hearing is supposed to be all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several citizens testified at the hearing about how their  
children became ill after getting vaccinations. Other witnesses, 
however, talked about relatives who were harmed because vaccines 
were not used and their family members contracted serious disease. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher, lead witness at the  
hearing, defended the use of mandatory childhood inoculations. He 
said children exempted from getting shots put others at risk of 
contracting diseases such as measles, whooping cough, Hepatitis B, 
mumps and chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher said vaccines and a vigorous program of inoculation have  
saved millions of lives. In 1943, before there was a vaccine for 
whopping cough, 190,000 American children got the disease and 3,500 
died, he said. That compares with only 5,000 cases and five deaths 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon general said Mississippi and West Virginia are the  
only two states where children are absolutely required to get 
vaccinations before school. The other 48 states, Satcher said, 
allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent take the religious exemption, said Satcher.  
</P>
<P>
	Since some parents now are reluctant to get shots for their  
children, Burton asked if immunization would work if it was 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``When children are not immunized, outbreaks (of disease)  
occur,'' said Satcher. ``If states didn't have rules (requiring 
shots) for getting into school, then many would get sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that when immunizations were not done recently in  
Russia, there were 2,000 cases of diphtheria, an uncommon disease 
in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher, however, acknowledged that vaccines are not ``100  
percent safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have risks,'' he said. ``A small percentage of children  
do suffer injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher said the Public Health Service has the toughest vaccine  
controls in the world, but there were still children who would 
react in unusual ways to vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vaccines are very safe and effective,'' he said, ``but they  
are not perfect.''

<HEADLINE> Supervisor Keeps His Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTCALM TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Residents voted Tuesday not to  
recall the township supervisor, who had been accused of being drunk 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	An unofficial vote that still had to be confirmed by county  
officials was 364-131 against the recall of Supervisor Bob Lewis, 
the township clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top complaint on the petition calling for Lewis' removal was  
that he ``conducted regular township meetings while visibly under 
the influence of alcohol.'' It also said he denounced other 
officials in Montcalm, a farming community 150 miles northwest of 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has denied being drunk on the job.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has divided our community,'' he said after the vote.  
``Now we have to heal -- roll up our sleeves and get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The election was one of dozens of recall elections around  
Michigan this year. A bill that would limit them is pending in the 
state Legislature.

<HEADLINE> McFarland Agrees to Bucs Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Anthony McFarland  
agreed to terms with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Tuesday, ending a 
three-day training camp holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said the six-foot, 300-pound  
defensive tackle from LSU would arrive in town to sign the deal 
Tuesday night and practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland was the first defensive lineman selected in the draft  
and 15th pick overall. His contract is believed to be worth more 
than $6 million over five years, including a $4 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us basically 48 hours longer than it should have,''  
said McKay, who described himself as perplexed as well as 
disappointed when negotiations failed to produce an agreement to 
get McFarland into camp on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Bernard, the player's New Orleans-based agent, said Monday  
that less than $200,000 was at issue in the stalemate that kept 
McFarland away from the team's first four practices at the 
University of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive line is one of the strongest areas of the club, so  
the Bucs aren't counting on the rookie, who led LSU with eight 
sacks last season, to become an immediate starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, coach Tony Dungy envisions him backing up both Warren  
Sapp and Brad Culpepper to keep fresh tackles on the field as much 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said it's difficult to say how much missing the first two  
days of camp will affect McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always like to say that when someone's not here that  
there's a disadvantage, but I wouldn't say it's the end of the 
world. We've had a lot worse than this,'' McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have had him day one. Again, the nice  
thing is he doesn't have to come in here and start, so he can work 
his way at his own pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy said it will take McFarland a few days to catch up  
physically, but that he should be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing is being off track with everyone else,'' the  
coach said. ``You come into camp physically in pretty good shape, 
go down hill for a couple of days and come back. Mentally, things 
go and then you come back. Everybody else has hit that already, and 
he's going to be following. But that goes away after a while.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Tires of Stats, Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is tiring of stats and milestones,  
but a big one is coming up. He's just two homers from the 500 home 
run club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fascination with numbers started when rotisserie baseball  
became big probably 10 years ago,'' McGwire said. ``There's stats 
coming out of the woodwork that nobody ever knew about that I think 
sometimes blow things way out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has set a few of those lately, such as most homers over  
a four- and five-year period. Last month he broke Joe Adcock's NL 
record with 16 homers in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hit 221 homers since 1996 and 259 since 1995, both records,  
naturally. He's second on the career list for homers by a first 
baseman with 483, 10 behind Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost assuredly will break Babe Ruth's record of reaching  
500 in the fewest at-bats, since he's at 5,478 and Ruth needed 
5,801. 
</P>
<P>
	His reaction? Statistics are for geeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only stats you look at with power hitters are driving in  
runs and hitting home runs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire entered Tuesday night's game in a sprint for 500, having  
hit 14 homers in 18 games, including No. 498 against San Diego on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acts as if there's no special incentive, even though only  
15 players have reached 500, and all are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to feel,'' he said. ``It's going to happen one  
day. I don't know when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He feels the same way about Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 hits,  
which is being played out in front of him the next three days. 
Gwynn got his 2,995th hit, a two-run single in the ninth inning, in 
the Cardinals' 6-5 victory Monday, but McGwire said he and Gwynn 
didn't discuss their parallel chases at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much is there to talk about?'' McGwire said. ``There's no  
reason to talk about 500 until you get there and there's no reason 
to talk about 3,000 until he gets to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a level you reach. People have done it before, so  
it's just a milestone he's going to reach. What day, what hour, 
what minute, it's just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way McGwire is going, he'll get to 500 very soon. After a  
slow start, he was only four homers off his record 70-homer pace of 
last year and chances for him reaching his milestone before Gwynn 
appeared good. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cardinals began a seven-game homestand Friday, McGwire  
needed six homers and Gwynn needed nine hits, and McGwire said he 
basically had no chance of getting there first. Evidence to the 
contrary, he's sticking to that prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting hits is a little bit easier than hitting home runs,  
believe me,'' McGwire said. ``But you guys write it like it's easy. 
I think people take me for granted because I hit them in such 
streaks. They don't realize how tough it is.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After an initial downturn, European stocks closed  
higher Monday, boosted by receeding fears of a U.S. interest rate 
increase this month. 
</P>
<P>
	With little European corporate news, traders said the main issue  
was a key reading on the U.S. economy and what impact it might have 
when Federal Reserve officials meet on Aug. 24 to decide on the 
central bank's rate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	A monthly survey of factory executives showed that manufacturing  
activity wasn't as brisk as expected during July. If the economy is 
slower than people thought, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may not 
push for another boost in rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets are bouncing from one economic number to another,  
all the while worried about short-term interest rates,'' said 
Richard Batty, European equities strategist at HSBC Markets in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed up  
0.41 points at 301.69, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which 
tracks 297 companies in countries that joined the euro single 
currency, was down 0.57 points at 311.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished down 5.18 points at  
3633.44, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was up 5.95 points at 3629.86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Insurance index was virtually unchanged.  
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was up 0.5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC 40 index was 0.1 percent lower, Milan's MIBtel  
index rose 1.0 percent, and Madrid's IBEX-35 index was up 0.1 
percent. London's FTSE 100 index was up 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A widely-watched indicator of future economic  
activity rose 0.3 points in June, chalking up gains in eight out of 
the past nine months and signaling that the U.S. economy could be 
in its longest expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private New York-based economic research  
group, reported today that its index of leading indicators stood at 
107.7 in June, up from 107.4 in May. The index also rose by the 
same amount in May. The last decline, in April, was 0.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at The  
Conference Board, said that while the economic expansion is 
``firmly on track,'' concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates could roil financial markets and create some 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of current economic activity rose  
by 0.4 points in June, while its lagging index decreased by 
0.4 1/8pomts. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the ten indicators that make up the leading index rose  
in June. The most significant increases came in manufacturers' new 
orders of consumer goods and materials, money supply, and the 
difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six months ended June 30, the leading index rose 1.2  
pointw and seven of the 10 components advanced, the Conference 
Board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several components of the leading indicators index gave details  
about the growing economy. Manufacturers took in $166.4 million of 
new orders in June, up from $162.3 million in May. Money supply 
rose to $3.962 billion from $3.947 billion. And the difference, or 
spread, between the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds and the 
overnight Federal Reserve lending rate rose to 1.14 percent from 
0.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a sign that the labor market may not be heating up  
enough to push wages higher, the average number of hours worked per 
week by production workers was 41.7, unchanged from May. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall index is calculated from a base of 100, set in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets had little immediate reaction to the  
report.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House overwhelmingly approved a $12.6  
billion foreign aid bill on Tuesday that would slash many 
international programs championed by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Next come negotiations with the Senate and then a likely veto  
confrontation with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The 385-35 House vote far exceeded the two-thirds margin that  
would be needed to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But many House Democrats hinted they might support a veto if  
budget negotiators don't find more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to vote `aye' to move the bill along,'' said Rep. Nancy  
Pelosi of California, senior Democrat on the Appropriations 
Committee's foreign operations panel. But she complained that it 
contains ``too little money to work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pelosi and other Democrats said they hoped some of the  
program levels could be raised in negotiations with the Senate, it 
won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee will be named to iron out  
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's $12.7 billion version, passed June 30, is also veto  
threatened. It also slashes many international aid programs while 
providing unrequested money for a Kosovo security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Senate and House measures would cut funds for the Peace  
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure, in addition, would deny any U.S. funds for  
foreign organizations that perform abortions or engage in lobbying 
activities that change the abortion laws of foreign countries. It 
would also freeze funds for international family planning 
assistance at $385 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final vote on the bill after three days of debate,  
the House approved, by voice vote, an amendment by Rep. Tom 
Tancredo, R-Colo., cutting $2.3 million from the U.N. World 
Heritage Fund and the U.S. Biosphere Program, shifting the money to 
child survival and disease programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Members debated late into the night Monday, rejecting cuts in  
the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House bill would cut President Clinton's aid  
request by $1.9 billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and 
spending in the current fiscal year by $715 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials warned that the cuts, as well as the  
restrictive abortion language, could lead to a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $7.4 billion for economic aid, $3.6  
billion for military assistance, $1.1 billion for international 
agencies and $595.5 million for export assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Payment of dues to the United Nations, money for U.S. diplomacy  
and other foreign affairs funding is in separate legislation not 
yet approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also includes the first funding cut for the U.S.  
Army School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Ga. The school has 
been criticized for human rights abuses committed by some of its 
graduates in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would sharply reduce aid to the former Soviet republics  
and would chop aid to Russia by 50 percent unless it ends nuclear 
and ballistic missile cooperation with Iran. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Asks For Another Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Attorneys for retired Pittsburgh Penguins star  
Mario Lemieux have asked a judge for a third delay in closing the 
sale of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux needs more time to finalize settlement agreements with  
investors, attorney Douglas Campbell said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz scheduled a hearing on  
the extension request for Thursday. That's the deadline Markovitz 
had set for the closing after attorneys twice requested extensions 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's investors, who have placed $50 million in an escrow  
account to buy the team, won't release their money until the 
settlements are wrapped up, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the remaining issues should be resolved by next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux still must work out a Civic Arena managerial contract  
for the team with Philadelphia-based landlord SMG Inc. The team 
filed for bankruptcy in October. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, National Hockey League senior vice president of  
legal affairs, said the delays should not be cause for concern. He 
described the NHL's review of the sale as ``substantially 
complete.''

	Pilots, NTSB Make More Rest Request  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline pilots made their case before Congress  
today for reduced work periods. Current federal rules say pilots 
may not fly more than eight hours and must receive at least eight 
hours of rest in a 24-hour period. The pilots want to increase the 
rest period to at least 10 hours. The Federal Aviation 
Administration agrees, but also wants to increase the pilots' 
flight time to 10 hours, and all flying would have to be done 
within a 14-hour window. The FAA argues the airlines would get more 
flight time from the pilots in any given day, and the pilots would 
get more rest.

	Zapruder Heirs To Get $16M for Film  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The family of the man who took the famous home  
movie of John F. Kennedy's assassination says a $16 million payment 
from the government is fair. The Zapruder family sought $30 million 
for Abraham Zapruder's film, but arbitrators ruled $16 million 
would be the compensation. An assassination panel decided two years 
ago that the film was the property of the people of the United 
States, meaning the Zapruder family had to be compensated. The 
government offered $1 million. The Justice Department says the 
resolution of this dispute will ensure that the film ``will be 
protected for scholarly and research uses.''

items will help them win big prizes. The bill, passed 93-0

no purchase is necessary to enter or win a sweepstakes. Violators

	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The United Nations is sending a medical  
team to Sudan to check out rebel claims that the government dropped 
chemical or biological bombs on two towns held by southern rebels, 
a senior U.N. official said today. The team will leave tomorrow and 
will camp outside the towns of Kaaya and Lainya in Western 
Equatoria province, where the Sudanese air force allegedly dropped 
the bombs on July 23, officials said. A Sudanese rebel spokesman 
said since the bombing ``almost all pregnant women have aborted or 
are gravely ill'' and goats, sheep, cats, dogs and birds are dying 
in large numbers.

Democrats. But Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declined to tell 
the Senate Agriculture Committee how much help he thought farmers 
needed, deciding not to choose between the Democrats' plan and a 
GOP proposal for nearly $7 billion in aid. A worldwide glut of 
grain has kept commodity prices low for the second year in a row, 
and USDA projects that net farm income will dip to $43.8 billion 
this year, about 4 percent off the average for the decade.

Roque, is seeking unspecified damages. The only defendant named is 
the Republic of Cuba. The lawsuit asserts that Martinez never would 
have married Roque had she known that he was using the marriage 
``as a mere pretext to carry out his spy mission for a terrorist 
state.'' Because of the deception, the suit says, sex between the 
pair constituted sexual battery.

from a scheme in which David E. Simmons helped the son of an 
International Olympic Committee member obtain lawful permanent 
resident status by offering the son a fraudulent job at his 
company, the government said. The father had a vote on which city 
would get the 2002 Winter Olympics. Salt Lake City was awarded the 
Games.

<HEADLINE> Source: MLS Chief To Be Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Doug Logan will be removed as commissioner of Major League  
Soccer in the second shakeup of senior management at the league in 
six months, a soccer source said. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS is expected to replace Logan with Don Garber, the senior  
vice president and managing director of NFL International, perhaps 
as soon as Wednesday, according to the source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The league scheduled a news conference for Wednesday in New York  
to make a ``significant announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan, who has been the league's only commissioner in its 3 1-2  
years, is fluent in Spanish and has aggressively marketed MLS to 
Hispanics, overseeing the acquisition of several Latin and South 
American players. 
</P>
<P>
	No team has folded or been moved since the MLS began play in  
1996, and Logan oversaw its expansion to Chicago and Miami, 
bringing the league to 12 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	However, flat television ratings have plagued the league since  
the beginning of its second year, and it is still well below the 
average crowd of 17,406 it achieved in its first season. Some team 
officials have grumbled privately about Logan, particularly 
following his dismissal of deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was not in his office Tuesday and MLS canceled his weekly  
conference call with reporters. No reason was given. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not commenting on the matter at the present time,''  
league spokesman Dan Courtemanche said. ``However, we do expect to 
have further details within the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan's impending ouster was first reported Tuesday by The  
Washington Post, also citing unidentified sources. His contract 
with league runs through the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Logan, who was born in Glen Ridge, N.J., and  
grew up in Cuba, was recruited by MLS after nearly 20 years in 
entertainment management and promotion, including seven years with 
Ogden Entertainment and three more with OCESA in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	After 15 years with the NFL, the 41-year-old Garber was  
appointed to his post at NFL International in October 1996, with 
the responsibility of promoting interest in American football 
worldwide. Among his duties are management of NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had predicted a 15 percent increase in average attendance  
from the league's first year to the second. But attendance actually 
fell from 17,406 to 14,619, a 16 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	It further fell to 14,312 last season but has rebounded to  
15,174 through this past weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati has been a major figure in American soccer for more than  
a decade, including having a key role in the organizing committee 
of the 1994 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation and the formation 
of MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	His removal before the start of the season angered many in the  
league. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was his decision last year to unilaterally exercise the  
league's option to renew the contract New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati reportedly did not consult with MetroStars management,  
which angered Stuart Subotnick, one of the club's two 
investor-operators. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operates under a ``single-entity'' concept in which  
companies invest in the league and receive the rights to operate a 
club. The league contracts with all the players, assigns the major 
stars to clubs in the name of competitive balance and gate 
attraction, and pays them from a central fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the salaries the league negotiates with the players,  
each team must stay under a $1.7 million salary cap.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Charge Unfair Labor Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With unemployment less than a month away for  
one-third of its members, the umpires' union filed an unfair labor 
practice charge Tuesday against the American and National leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners in turn filed a grievance against the umpires, saying  
their mass resignations violated their labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Many labor lawyers say the National Labor Relations Board is  
more likely to rule for the owners than the umpires. To the 
individual umpires about to lose their jobs, the legal maneuvers 
may be their final hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to work as hard as I can to save my job,'' said a  
visibly angry Bill Hohn, one of the 22 umpires notified last week 
that baseball had accepted their resignations, which are effective 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires want the NLRB to issue a complaint against owners that  
the agency could use to seek an injunction in federal court to 
prevent baseball from getting rid of the 22. The board is expected 
to decide on the charge in 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the umpires contend the July 14 decision to submit  
their mass resignations was ``protected concerted action'' under 
federal labor law and did not violate the provision in their labor 
contract stating ``there shall be no strike nor other concerted 
work stoppage.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how that could sit in the parameters within the  
National Labor Relations Act,'' said Stanford law professor William 
Gould, the NLRB's former chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball's first statement since the controversy began,  
commissioner Bud Selig, AL president Gene Budig and NL president 
Len Coleman said the charge had no merit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leagues will vigorously contest each and every  
allegation,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires held their news conference in a room at the Official  
All-Star Cafe filled with player jerseys. A sign of their plight 
was the absence of any umpire memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the guys out there charging $6 for a beer, charging  
$5 for a hot dog,'' said Ed Montague, one of the NL umpires who is 
keeping his job. ``We're not the guys who raised World Series 
tickets from $75 to $150. But we're the ones who get beat on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, fearful that baseball would lock them out next year,  
hoped the mass resignations would force owners to negotiate an 
agreement to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. The move 
backfired when 13 umpires didn't quit and another 14 withdrew their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 new umps from the minors, effective Sept.  
1, and accepted the resignations of the 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires contend baseball induced many of their colleagues to  
withdraw their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unlawful for the leagues to convert these into  
discharges,'' said Susan Davis, the umpires' new lawyer. ``It's 
illegal to punish people who stood up for their union and in a 
retaliatory manner pick and choose who you chip. They went one by 
one and picked them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires contend Selig made ``unilateral changes in  
significant terms and conditions of their employment'' late last 
year, shifting authority over the umpires from the league 
presidents to the commissioner's office. The union also says it was 
illegal for owners to change the strike zone without their 
participation and say they feared owners would get rid of 20 umps. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the split between AL and NL umps, six NL umps  
attended the news conference but just one from the AL. Of the 27 
umps who broke with the union by not quitting or withdrawing their 
resignations before July 25, 23 were from the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger toward the AL umps and toward the replacements filled the  
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel totally betrayed by the umpires who left the union,  
quit my family, put us in this position,'' Hohn said. ``They just 
turned their backs on us. You want to go through the next century 
with these kinds of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montague's wife, Marcia, wrote an angry letter last week to  
Denise Hirschbeck, the wife of AL ump John Hirschbeck, who has been 
organizing umpires opposed to union head Richie Phillips.	   ``My wife felt and wrote this from her heart,'' Montague said. 
``She did not write this with hatred toward Denise Hirschbeck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Coble, the only AL umpire at the news conference, says he  
never resigned. The AL says he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at home caring for my wife, who was undergoing  
chemotherapy,'' he said. ``Because of this family crisis, I didn't 
attend the union meeting and didn't know that any resignations had 
been submitted until several days later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, the president of the minor league umpires said  
they fired Phillips as their negotiator Monday before he quit, a 
charge Phillips denies. The minor leaguers were upset Phillips 
failed to ask the NLRB to hold an election to certify their union, 
and during a telephone poll Friday and Saturday they decided to 
seek another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Richie Phillips that,'' International League ump Mike  
Billing said. ``He told me that was fine with him because he was 
resigning anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires supporting Phillips and those opposed are vying for the  
support of the 25 minor leaguers who become permanent major league 
umpires on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want a head count in our league of the new guys they  
hired to see if they could count on knocking Richie out or not,'' 
Angel Hernandez said.

<HEADLINE> Police Brace for Neo-Nazi Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police in the nation's capital said Tuesday  
they are braced for a neo-Nazi rally and counterdemonstrations 
scheduled Saturday in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Park Police said Tuesday they expect about 300 people to  
participate in the American Nationalist Party-sponsored four-block 
march along Pennsylvania Avenue to Lafayette Park and about 500 
counterdemonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Michael Radzilowski of the Special Operations Division  
of the Metropolitan Police Department, said his entire unit will be 
working Saturday. Overall, Assistant Police Chief Terrence Gainer 
estimated 80 percent of the capitol city's force would be on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Police expect to have 500 to 600 officers on duty.  
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina-based white supremacist group received police  
permits for the march, followed by a rally in the park and 
demonstration afterwards in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also have issued permits for a counterdemonstration  
billed as a ``vigil against hate'' planned by the American Jewish 
Congress, the NAACP and other civil rights and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're preparing for trouble,'' said Commander Radzilowski.  
</P>
<P>
	Similar confrontations in the past have ended in violence and  
arrests. In 1990, a Ku Klux Klan march to the U.S. Capitol ended 
with more than 30 arrests. Eight years earlier, a Klan rally ended 
with rioting and looting by some of those who were 
counterdemonstrating against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had no choice but to issue the permits. ``They  
can't deny permits, because they don't like what they're saying. 
They'd just sue us,'' said Quintin Peterson, a D.C. police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	On its Internet site, the ANP said the aim of the march is ``to  
take back our nation from the criminals who have cheated their way 
into Washington.'' It also said it welcomed participation from any 
``white person who would like to build a better world for our 
youth'' but warned marchers to expect counterdemonstrators 
``shouting jeers and hurling objects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mayor Anthony Williams said plans are afoot for what  
he called ``a peaceful rally'' Saturday at the Lincoln Memorial 
several blocks from the White House.

<HEADLINE> Indians DL Gooden, Activate Wright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians placed Dwight Gooden on the  
15-day disabled list on Tuesday, a day after he pulled himself from 
a start with shoulder stiffness after just 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, 3-3 with a 5.81 ERA in 21 appearances, went on the  
disabled list to make room for Jaret Wright, who was activated from 
the DL in time to start Tuesday night's game against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really recovered from my last start,'' Gooden said.  
``I probably shouldn't have taken the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians now have five players on the disabled list,  
including regulars Travis Fryman, Sandy Alomar and Wilfredo 
Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who had pitched seven strong innings in his previous  
start, is eligible to come off the disabled list on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said Gooden was going to miss at least one  
start and perhaps two.

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Smith Aims for Super Bowl Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. -- There's one thing that could send Bruce Smith  
into retirement at the end of the 1999 season, but it's a good 
thing for Buffalo fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of the most dominant defensive players in NFL  
history, says he'll retire for sure after the season -- only if the 
Bills win the Super Bowl, something the team has failed to 
accomplish four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get to the Super Bowl and win, I will retire,'' Smith,  
36, said Tuesday. ``You'd better believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-time Pro Bowl selection who still carries the bittersweet  
memories of four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 1990s, 
Smith begins his 15th season with the health and optimism of a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some exciting new players and some who have been here  
a while and are ready to blossom,'' Smith said. ``And we have some 
older players who just seem to keep getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Count Smith among the latter.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Bills' all-time leader in sacks with 163 and second  
in the NFL behind Reggie White (192.5), entered training camp for 
the first time with no distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No contract disputes,'' Smith said. ``And the only pain I'm  
suffering from is old age. Fifteen years ago, you never could have 
told me that I would still be in this game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and White are the only two players to have recorded 10 or  
more sacks in 12 seasons; Smith had 10 last year. ``The older you 
get the harder it gets,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell Thurman Thomas, one of three Bills -- along with Smith  
and Andre Reed -- left from Marv Levy's Super Bowl teams. He says 
his friend still draws a crowd on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce is Bruce,'' Thomas said. ``They might say he's getting  
old and has lost a step or whatever, but you haven't lost that much 
of a step when people are still double- and triple-teaming you. 
That's out of respect; they know that he can still tear up an 
entire offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Bills struggled early, losing their first three  
games of the season. They rebounded with a strong finish before 
losing to Miami in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting off on a positive note and not being 0-3 or 0-4 is  
important,'' Smith said. ``If we get off on the right foot, we'll 
be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith serves on the board of directors for Operation Smile, a  
charity based in his hometown of Norfolk, Va., that helps poor 
children in developing nations who have facial disfigurements. The 
young patients have their cleft palates repaired free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	For 17 days in March, Smith watched and even assisted in  
surgeries in places such as Kenya and Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an overwhelming feeling to see that child look normal  
because a lot of times what happens in the community in the tribes 
over there, they're thought of as being outcasts. They shoo them 
away or don't pay any attention to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip put things in perspective for Smith, who has donated  
some of his own money to the charity. ``It kind of gets me a little 
emotional because we take so much for granted in this country. Over 
there, their average income is $30 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith draws inspiration also from father, George, who has been  
plagued by several ailments including emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wrote him off about six or seven years ago,''  
Smith said. ``They said he had six months to live, and my father's 
still hanging around. He's not in very good shape but he's still 
passing on knowledge and experiences and wisdom, and that's where I 
get my will to keep pushing on.''

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Smith Aims for Super Bowl Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. -- There's one thing that could send Bruce Smith  
into retirement at the end of the 1999 season, but it's a good 
thing for Buffalo fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of the most dominant defensive players in NFL  
history, says he'll retire for sure after the season -- only if the 
Bills win the Super Bowl, something the team has failed to 
accomplish four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get to the Super Bowl and win, I will retire,'' Smith,  
36, said Tuesday. ``You'd better believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-time Pro Bowl selection who still carries the bittersweet  
memories of four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 1990s, 
Smith begins his 15th season with the health and optimism of a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some exciting new players and some who have been here  
a while and are ready to blossom,'' Smith said. ``And we have some 
older players who just seem to keep getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Count Smith among the latter.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Bills' all-time leader in sacks with 163 and second  
in the NFL behind Reggie White (192.5), entered training camp for 
the first time with no distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No contract disputes,'' Smith said. ``And the only pain I'm  
suffering from is old age. Fifteen years ago, you never could have 
told me that I would still be in this game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and White are the only two players to have recorded 10 or  
more sacks in 12 seasons; Smith had 10 last year. ``The older you 
get the harder it gets,'' Smith said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House OKs More Snow Goose Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved legislation Monday to allow  
24 states to expand hunting of snow geese as they migrate north. If 
the bill becomes law, it would restore hunting rules that the 
government withdrew in response to a lawsuit by animal advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department said last February it would allow eased  
state hunting restrictions because the snow geese's soaring 
population growth threatened the Arctic tundra where they feed 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Humane Society of the United States sued, and the  
regulation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed by voice vote and now awaiting Senate  
action, essentially codifies the regulations announced in February. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, officials said an estimated 1.2 million birds were  
expected to be shot. Over the past three decades, the population of 
snow geese has exploded from 800,000 birds to an estimated 5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservation and hunting groups endorsed the plan on the  
grounds that dramatic action was needed to reduce the snow geese 
population. The birds annually migrate from the U.S. Gulf Coast 
area across the Great Plains to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	So many birds make the migration now, however, that they've  
destroyed thousands of acres of tundra and salt marsh in Canada's 
Hudson Bay area, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The geese are protected under the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty  
Act, but the Fish and Wildlife Service has authority to allow 
limited hunting as well as ban certain hunting techniques or types 
of guns that can be used. As part of its February regulation, the 
agency sought to ease some of the restrictions so more birds would 
be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	While it refused to block the regulation, the U.S. District  
Court ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct a detailed 
environmental impact statement that could take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``During that time the tundra will continue to be systematically  
destroyed, an acre at a time,'' Rep. Jim Saxon, R-N.J., said during 
debate on the bill when it was in committee. Saxon is a sponsor of 
the legislation and chairs the House Resources fisheries 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24 states where increased hunting would be allowed are  
Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Review Pesticides for Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is taking  
a fresh look at more than 40 risky pesticides to determine whether 
to restrict their use because they may be a threat to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Administrator Carol Browner announced Monday that the  
agency has reached agreements with manufacturers to stop the sale 
for most uses of one of the high-risk pesticides, methyl parathion, 
and to sharply curtail the use of another. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozens of pesticides under review, including a class of  
organophosphates used for decades on most fruits and vegetables, 
have been controversial because of concern that the residue levels 
the government deems acceptable pose risks to infants and children. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowable residue levels for many pesticides were set decades  
ago when the potential health impacts on infants and children were 
not taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said at a news conference that fruits and vegetables are  
safe and that children and adults alike should not stop eating 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of a diet that includes fruits and vegetables far  
outweigh the risks of pesticides,'' said Browner. However, she 
said, ``It is becoming increasingly clear that foods can be made 
even safer, especially for children,'' adding that ``today's 
technologies allow our farmers to use safer alternatives and safer 
approaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's intention to end the use of methyl parathion on fruits  
and vegetables and curtail the use of azinphos methyl was reported 
last week. The pesticides are widely used nationwide on such crops 
as apples, peaches, pears, grapes, carrots and certain beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner dismissed criticism that her agency is not going for  
enough even as she acknowledged that the EPA had not met its own 
deadlines in completing the pesticide reviews demanded by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with these pesticides ``has proven to be more difficult  
than we thought,'' Browner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the EPA delayed taking action because of  
pressure from agriculture interests.

<HEADLINE> Ralphs Inks Internet Promotion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ralphs food stores signed a cross-promotional  
deal with Checkout.com, the Internet entertainment site backed by 
former Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and former grocery magnate 
Ronald Burkle. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, scheduled to be formally announced today,  
Ralphs shoppers can get a discount on their next grocery bill if 
they buy music CDs or other merchandise from Checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general approach to getting customers on the Web has been  
to try and get them from Internet portals,'' said Richard Wolpert, 
the former Disney Online president who heads Internet ventures for 
Yucaipa Cos., the site's other major backer. ``We think there's 
going to be a much closer relationship between physical retailers 
and online retailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Checkout.com will debut today in limited form. Visitors will be  
able to buy games, CDs and videotapes and read reviews or news 
about celebrities, but will see only a portion of the news archives 
merchandise catalogues that will be available when the site 
formally opens later this summer, said Wolpert. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of functionality is going to be there,'' Wolpert  
said in an interview. ``We wanted to give people a sneak preview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ralphs deal also renews a link between the chain and  
Yucaipa, which owned Ralphs parent Fred Meyer Inc. until selling 
the business to Kroger for $8 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the sale, Yucaipa became Kroger's largest single  
shareholder and Yucaipa founder Ron Burkle got a seat on Kroger's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at this as a part of a very long relationship. This is  
probably the first of many things we are going to do with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ralphs promotion will include flyers that encourage  
customers to visit the chain's Web site at www.ralphs.com.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday morning  
as fear of joint Japan-U.S. intervention appeared to recede. Tokyo 
share prices dropped mainly on selling of export-oriented blue 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.04 yen at late morning, down 0.36 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
115.28 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 225.91 points,  
or 1.26 percent, to finish the morning session at 17,744.02. On 
Tuesday, the average closed up 144.23 points, or 0.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's decline came despite strong  
words hinting at dollar-buying intervention from Zembei Mizoguchi, 
director-general of the international bureau at Japan's Ministry of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will think of appropriate measures at every turn of  
events,'' Mizoguchi told reporters at the ministry Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear of intervention emerged after Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers agreed in 
phone talks Tuesday that they will maintain close ties on foreign 
exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that there has been no indication of any  
joint intervention since the two officials spoke the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the Bank of Japan has bought dollars to stop  
the yen's rise against the greenback, an action meant to help the 
country's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.02 yen, down  
from 123.08 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices fell as investors remained worried  
about the negative impact of the yen's strength on Japan's blue 
chip exporters, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar has  
weakened momentum in Japan's stock market,'' said Yoshihiko 
Kuroichi, an analyst at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of Japanese exporters when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Other morning losers were telecommunication issues, including  
the nation's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of NTT lost ground amid concerns about a glut in supply  
after the Finance Ministry announced Tuesday it will sell 952,000 
shares it holds in the telecommunications giant between 
mid-November and December, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move lower in Tokyo came despite a rise in the Dow Jones  
industrial average. On Wall Street, the Dow rose 31.35 points to 
close Tuesday at 10,677.31. But, the technology heavy Nasdaq Index 
fell 35.64 points to close at 2,587.99. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 15.05 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,466.94. 
The TOPIX closed up 13.37 points, or 0.91 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8900 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8800 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.23 yen from 99.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Watch Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan and the United States agree that rapid  
changes in foreign exchange rates can be harmful and are 
maintaining close contact about recent gains in the yen, Japan's 
finance minister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sudden changes in foreign exchange rates are undesirable, as  
they have an impact on the economy. In more ways than one, we are 
speaking with the U.S., and basically, we've agreed that sudden 
changes are undesirable. If necessary, we must respond,'' Finance 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the yen's recent rise against the dollar has been  
excessively strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa had spoken by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary  
Lawrence Summers about foreign exchange, the Finance Ministry said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said the two nations agreed to maintain close  
contact on foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman in Washington confirmed that Summers  
and Miyazawa spoke by phone about ``the current economic situations 
in the United States and Japan, including recent developments in 
exchange markets.'' The spokeswoman added that ``they agreed that 
their deputies would continue the discussions which have taken 
place over the past few weeks and that they would keep in close 
touch with each other on these matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa's comments, and news of his contact with Summers,  
helped reverse a sharp rise in the yen recently by raising 
expectations that Japan might step into markets to drive its 
currency lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.40 yen Tuesday afternoon, up 1.36 from  
yesterday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 114.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has risen against the dollar over the last several weeks  
as growing optimism about the prospects for economic recovery in 
Japan has brought of a flood of foreign cash into Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell from more than 120 yen last month to below 114  
yen on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial authorities and executives worry that a  
strong yen could wipe out overseas profits for Japanese companies. 
A stronger yen forces Japan's exporters to raise prices abroad or 
face lower earnings when overseas revenue is converted into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has spent an estimated $30 billion over the last two  
months trying to drive its currency lower by flooding the market 
with yen, but traders have said authorities have been less active 
in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Robert Gawthrop Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Gawthrop  
III, whose cases included one involving a law firm accused of 
firing a young associate with the AIDS virus, has died after a long 
battle with cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 1994 case ended in a settlement, Gawthrop wrote the  
first opinion that people who show no symptoms of AIDS can still be 
considered disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had striking similarities to the one depicted in the  
Academy Award-winning movie ``Philadelphia,'' which was released in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other notable cases in Gawthrop's court were the 1996  
sentencing of five police officers who pleaded guilty in a 
corruption scandal; the 1996 racketeering and bribery trial of 
former Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa.; and the lawsuit brought by 
parents against the Chester-Upland School District, in which he 
appointed a special master to implement education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gawthrop graduated from Amherst College in 1964 and enlisted in  
the Army, serving in Korea before returning to civilian life in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He received a law degree from Dickinson University in 1970 and  
was elected to the Chester County Common Pleas Court in 1978. 
Former President Reagan nominated him to the federal bench in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Gawthrop, who died Sunday, was known outside of court for  
performing in all 14 Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, both 
regionally and with companies in England.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Makes 'Blair Witch' Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The makers of the surprise hit horror movie  
``The Blair Witch Project'' are being sued by a former partner who 
says he was cheated out of a credit on the film and deserves some 
of the millions of dollars the movie is reaping. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Barber, an Orlando filmmaker, said that his company paid for  
much of the movie's preproduction costs and that he should have 
been listed as a producer or executive producer in the credits. He 
also claims that director Dan Myrick and Myrick's girlfriend broke 
into his office and took documents, a master copy of the film and 
other tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber is suing Myrick -- one of the film's two directors --  
Myrick's girlfriend, Kristal Jordan, and producer Greg Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	John Marshall Oden, an attorney for all three defendants, denied  
the theft allegation and called the lawsuit an attempt at 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barber filed his lawsuit in June 1998, long before ``Blair  
Witch'' became one of this summer's biggest surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie has made more than $36 million. Barber is seeking a  
percentage of the movie's gross -- and he claims the percentage 
eventually could be worth at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants have filed a countersuit against Barber, alleging  
he tried to interfere with their agreement with Artisan 
Entertainment, the film's distributor, by seeking an injunction in 
California to stop the movie's release. The injunction was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' purports to be the story of three college-age  
filmmakers who disappear in the Maryland woods while trying to make 
a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch. Five University of 
Central Florida graduates spent $60,000 to shoot the film.

<HEADLINE> 4 Racing for Golden League Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Four track stars will be trying to  
stay in the race for the $1 million Golden League jackpot at 
Wednesday's Herculis meet. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the world championships in Seville less than three  
weeks away, there will be more attention than ever on events at the 
Stade Louis II stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation offers the  
million-dollar purse for those who win at all seven Golden League 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Kipketer, Bernard Barmasai, Marion Jones and Gabriela  
Szabo won at the three previous meet in Oslo, Rome and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, one of three who shared last year's jackpot, and Kipketer  
seem to be at their best. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to be in top form every race in the 200  
meters, to get sub 22 seconds each time, but I am not far away from 
my very best form,'' Jones told a news conference. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Republicans Agree on $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans reached agreement Tuesday night on  
a plan to cut personal income tax rates and provide relief from the 
marriage penalty as they sculpted a $792 billion measure President 
Clinton has vowed to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every income taxpayer in America will get relief in this  
bill,'' Rep. Bill Archer, the chief House tax-writer, said as GOP 
negotiators wrapped up two intense days of negotiations on the item 
that sits atop their legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate compromise measure, salted with breaks for  
education, health care, corporations and other interests, ``is the 
biggest tax relief bill for the American people since 1981,'' added 
the Texas Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
proposal calls for a gradual cut of 1 percentage point in each 
personal income tax rate. The 15 percent tax bracket would go to 14 
percent, for example, and the 39.6 percent bracket would become 
38.6 percent. That means the percentage reduction would be greater 
at lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, the Republican bill would  
gradually raise the standard deduction for couples until it is 
double the deduction for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, lawmakers decided to widen the current 15 percent  
bracket for couples so it would apply to some income that currently 
is taxed at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders hope to push the measure to final passage by week's  
end, the next step in a veto clash that both the majority party and 
Clinton seem eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic critics contend the bill would shortchange Social  
Security, Medicare and other vital domestic programs, and could 
threaten a return of soaring budget deficits. Clinton has 
threatened a veto numerous times in recent weeks, and there is no 
doubt that Democrats in Congress would supply the votes to sustain 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said the final measure would cut the  
personal capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 18 percent and 
from 10 percent to 8 percent, and then adjust the rates annually to 
discount the effects of inflation. There would be no cut in the 
corporate capital gains tax. The estate tax would be eliminated 
gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, said contribution limits to individual retirement 
accounts would rise gradually from $2,000 to $5,000 annually. He 
added that the self-employed would be permitted to deduct the 
entire cost of their health insurance premiums, as would employees 
who work for firms that don't offer health insurance. Other 
officials said medical savings accounts, tax-deductible accounts 
set aside for health-related costs, would be more readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth also said the bill contains a provision mandating that  
money from pre-paid state tuition plans be paid out to students 
tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, taxpayers who care for elderly relatives in their  
homes would be eligible for tax breaks, and insurance premiums for 
long-term care would be partially tax-deductible for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the broad-based relief would total roughly $400  
billion over the next decade. The provisions designed to offset the 
marriage penalty would save taxpayers another $100 billion, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bow to GOP moderates in the House, the final compromise  
will include a provision making each annual installment of the tax 
rate reductions dependent on a decline in the government's cost of 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials cautioned that some minor adjustments were likely in  
the bill, as aides draft precise language that can fit without 
exceeding the $792 billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Precise details were unlikely to be available until Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	For two days, senior Republicans and aides shuttled in and out  
of these bargaining sessions, and others were consulted by phone. 
But there was no place for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the  
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, invited himself briefly 
into the closed-door GOP deliberations in a bit of political 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like having two Christmas lists, and you select the best  
from each list knowing that Santa is not coming,'' he said in a 
reference to Clinton's promised veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., were  
pressing to have the compromise passed through the House and Senate 
by week's end, to permit rank-and-file lawmakers to trumpet the 
advantages of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	Only when lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day would  
the bill be sent to the White House for Clinton's expected veto, 
although some Republicans practically taunted Clinton to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not give up on the possibility that he will sign (tax  
cuts). But if he vetoes them, we think he'll find he's disappointed 
the American people,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Clinton ``is a man who will disappoint everyone in  
his life except his pollster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters that ``maybe the president will conclude at  
some point that he needs to work with us.'' For now, he added, ``I 
just don't see it happening, so we have to go forward with doing 
what we think is right for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats oppose a bill of the  
magnitude favored by Republicans, saying it would shortchange 
Social Security and Medicare and lead to deep spending cuts in 
other domestic programs including education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has repeatedly termed the GOP proposals risky and said  
that because they rely on anticipated surpluses, the tax cuts could 
return the nation to a new era of deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, there remained scattered signs of a desire to  
compromise before the bill goes to the White House. Sen. Olympia 
Snowe, R-Maine, released a letter to Lott urging that a final 
House-Senate deal be held up in hopes there could be a 
``negotiated, bipartisan agreement ... achieved in September that 
ultimately addresses a variety of needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, other Republicans expressed similar sentiments, but  
there was no immediate indication they were having an impact on the 
leaders' strategy.

<HEADLINE> EU Regulators To OK Global One Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union antitrust regulators  
said Tuesday they intend to clear Global One -- a joint venture 
created by Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint -- to provide 
full telecommunications services within the 15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission approved the joint venture after its was  
created in 1996, but imposed a number of conditions reflecting the 
lack of competition in a sector then dominated by national 
monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the EU executive said the liberalization of the  
market since then prompted it to lift the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission said it was waiting to hear comment from  
``interested parties'' before taking a formal decision, but added 
it intended to allow the venture ``to provide all 
telecommunications services, including voice telephony, in all the 
EU member states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Global One's president and chief executive officer, Gary Forsee,  
resigned last month following published reports that the venture 
was failing and could be dissolved. Company officials denied the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One was formed in 1996 to offer large multinational  
corporations complete, integrated telecommunications services 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations within the venture have been strained by Deutsche  
Telekom's ill-fated attempt to take over Telecom Italia. Since that 
bid failed in May, there has been intense speculation that the 
German company is seeking new international partners.

<HEADLINE> New Speaker Raises $1.6M in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the help of several top Washington  
lobbyists, new House Speaker Dennis Hastert raised more than $1.5 
million for his political committees during the first six months of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms representing such major companies as Citigroup, General  
Electric and Microsoft held fund-raisers for Hastert, helping him 
to raise even more money than his predecessor, Rep. Newt Gingrich, 
did during his first six months as speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert reported that he raised $593,502 for his re-election  
committee and $964,801 for his Keep Our Majority Political Action 
Committee. He uses the latter to make contributions to other 
candidates and pay for his own political travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been finding folks who like the Republican agenda and  
think it's important to retain a Republican majority,'' Hastert 
spokesman John Feehery said. ``That's who's he's appealing to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined total outdistanced that of Gingrich, R-Ga., who  
during his first six months as House speaker in 1995 raised 
$885,000 for his campaign and had not yet started a leadership PAC 
like Hastert. When Gingrich formed his Monday Morning PAC in July 
1995, he raised $460,798 during its first six months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years before Hastert became speaker, his leadership  
PAC raised just $130,602. At that time, he held a lesser leadership 
position in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., raised more than half the money from political  
action committees, the donating arms of special interest groups, 
according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The health care industry, fighting proposed new federal  
regulations on managed care, led the way with $140,000 in 
contributions. Telephone companies also were major backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's success is not as much a product of hard work as it is  
a reflection of the clout he wields as speaker, said Larry 
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, 
a nonpartisan group that studies political fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funny things happen when you get power,'' Makinson said. ``It  
seems to attract money like magnets attract iron filings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those holding fund-raisers for the speaker was America's  
Community Bankers, which also gave $2,000. In July, the House 
passed legislation that would allow banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies to merge, overturning Depression-era 
prohibitions on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Others raising money for the speaker included several Washington  
lobbying firms: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Members of the firm headed by former Republican National  
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, whose clients include CBS, 
Microsoft and Philip Morris, contributed $3,500 and spent $1,103 on 
fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The lobbying firm of R. Duffy Wall, headed by former Rep. Bill  
Brewster, D-Okla., counts clients such as Bell Atlantic, the gun 
manufacturer Beretta, and Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Besides helping raise money, members of the firm Washington  
Counsel contributed $12,500 to Hastert's leadership PAC. Clients 
include American Express, General Electric and the National Cable 
Television Association.

<HEADLINE> Portland Acquires Detlef Schrempf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers completed a  
busy day of deals Monday by landing free agent forward Detlef 
Schrempf, hours after trading Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson to 
Atlanta for veteran guard Steve Smith and Ed Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the trade, which had been rumored for a couple of weeks,  
Portland re-signed 20-year-old Jermaine O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just brought two guys to the roster today that are  
all-stars,'' Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt 
said. ``We did not have an all-star going into today. But they're 
not worried about their individual stats or awards. They've been 
there, done that. These guys are playing for one reason -- to try to 
win an NBA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, a three-time all-star, averaged 15.0 points and 7.4  
rebounds last season, both second-highest on the Sonics, while 
Smith, who made the 1998 all-star team, has career averages of 17.4 
points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, 36, signed a two-year contract with Portland after  
turning down Seattle's reported one-year, $1 million offer. The 
Blazers can use the middle-class salary-cap exception of $4.2 
million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, who played the last six seasons in Seattle, had been  
courted by Utah and San Antonio. The Spurs had the most money to 
offer him -- $2.6 million -- because of an injury exception the 
league made for Sean Elliott, who needs a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schrempf reportedly chose Portland to stay close to his  
Seattle-area home and his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people may insist that my decision not to re-sign with  
the Sonics was motivated by money, but the reality is that the 
decision was based purely on issues of fairness and loyalty,'' 
Schrempf said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	By trading Smith, 30, the Hawks would end a commitment of $36  
million over the next four seasons to a player who missed 14 games 
last season with bruised knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, 28, will make $5.4 million next season in the final year  
of a $25.5 million rookie contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 29, will get $3 million over the next two seasons.  
Gray, 23, was Atlanta's first-round draft pick out of California in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider is among the most heavily fined and suspended players in  
the NBA. He was suspended three games last season and 12 overall 
during three seasons in Portland for violations ranging from 
flagrant fouls to spitting on fans. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, the youngest among the league's 156 free agents, signed  
a four-year contract. As per its policy, the team did not disclose 
terms of the deal, but O'Neal said he turned down a one-year offer 
of $9 million-$10 million from another team to stay in Portland. 
His agent, Arn Tellem, did not immediately return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here for the next 10-15 years,'' O'Neal said at a  
news conference. ``So hopefully I'll play to my potential the next 
two to three years, and then we can talk about some extensions, but 
overall I really want to be here. I want them to retire my jersey 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, a 6-foot-11, 226-pound center-forward, is a strong  
rebounder with good leaping ability. But playing behind Blazers 
center Arvydas Sabonis and power forwards Rasheed Wallace and Brian 
Grant, he hasn't gotten much opportunity to shine. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal averaged just 2.6 points last season, and just 1.6 points  
in Portland's playoff drive to the Western Conference finals. Over 
three seasons, he has averaged 3.9 points, 3.0 rebounds and 11.3 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Blazers think he can live up to the expectations they  
had when they selected him with the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft 
out of Eau Claire High School in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're even more excited now than we were three years ago,''  
Whitsitt said. ``He's continued to improve each year. He's earned 
time on a very talented roster. There's no question Jermaine has 
not even reached his potential and will continue to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal's warm and fuzzy news conference came just two days after  
he called the Blazers' initial offer -- reportedly a seven-year deal 
worth $30 million -- ``almost a smack in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal arrived in Portland from Columbia late Sunday night to  
work out details on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he decided to re-sign for four years instead of  
seven -- the maximum allowed under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement -- to make sure everything is ``totally right between 
myself and the organization.''

<HEADLINE> Hurt CART Driver To Be Out 8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Christian Fittipaldi, knocked unconscious in a  
crash during testing at Gateway International Raceway, remained in 
a St. Louis hospital Tuesday and will be sidelined for at least 
eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Brazilian hit the wall in turn one on the  
Madison, Ill., oval on Monday and was unconscious between five and 
10 minutes. He regained consciousness while being transported to a 
local hospital and was then airlifted to St. Louis University 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary tests on Tuesday indicated that the nephew of  
longtime racing star Emerson Fittipaldi has a subdural hematoma -- a 
collection of blood -- on the left side of his head, according to 
Dr. Jaimie Henderson, assistant professor of neurosurgery at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hematoma is very small and not causing any pressure on the  
brain at this time, and that is not expected to change,'' Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the hematoma is stabilized, Fittipaldi is expected to be  
transported to Miami, where he lives. Henderson said that could be 
as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Olvey, CART director of medical affairs, said the  
earliest return for Fittipaldi to his Champ Car would be eight 
weeks, meaning he would miss five races, beginning with Sunday's 
Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman-Haas Racing announced Tuesday that Roberto Moreno would  
replace Fittipaldi for the Detroit event. Moreno, also from Brazil, 
has made a specialty of subbing for injured drivers in recent 
years. He has driven the last eight CART races for PacWest 
Motorsports Group while Mark Blundell recuperated from a broken 
collarbone. Blundell is scheduled to return to his car this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third time Moreno has replaced Fittipaldi in the  
Newman-Haas car. Fittipaldi missed six events in 1997 after 
breaking his leg in a crash in Australia, then missed a race last 
year in Milwaukee after suffering a concussion in a crash during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi was on the way to the best season of his five-year  
CART career. He won his first pole at Rio de Janeiro in May, earned 
his first CART victory on July 11 in Elkhart Lake, Wis., and was 
fourth in the season standings. He trails series leader Juan 
Montoya by 28 points.

<HEADLINE> AP Protests Use of Photos by Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- State police said today that they will  
continue to post several Associated Press photographs in their 
cyberspace investigation of crimes at Woodstock '99, despite 
demands from AP that the photos be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police posted 14 photographs on their Web site last week,  
including 10 used without permission that were shot by AP 
photographers. The AP protested Monday, as soon as it learned of 
the unauthorized use. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Jamie Mills said today that the photographs will remain on  
the Internet site. She also said police have received 40 e-mail 
messages in their probe, but wouldn't discuss what information was 
provided in the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos show concertgoers breaking into pay phones, tearing  
down a 3-mile-long ``Peace Wall,'' looting a vendor's truck and 
robbing a cash machine. Police officials have asked the public for 
any additional photos and details of the identities of people 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Boyle, chief of the AP's New York City bureau, discussed the  
site with various state police officials Monday, and denied them 
permission to use the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two concerns -- violation of copyright and the  
journalistic separation from law enforcement,'' Boyle said 
</P>
<P>
	A letter faxed to state police Monday night from Robert  
Penchina, a lawyer representing the AP, stated: ``We demand that 
the state police immediately cease and desist from any and all acts 
infringing on AP's copyrights, including but not limited to 
removing all AP photos from the state police Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the AP photos were posted their Web page on Friday.  
Glenn Valle, chief counsel for the state police, said his review 
indicated use of the photos was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that we're violating the copyright or  
infringing on the copyright in this manner,'' Valle said. ``It was 
material that was already published. It's like walking around with 
the front page of the (New York) Daily News asking, 'Do you 
recognize this guy?''

<HEADLINE> Dems, GOP Play Acting in Tax Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to get their tax act together to take  
it on the road, congressional Republicans are negotiating on terms 
for nearly $800 billion in cuts over the next 10 years, so that 
they can pass it and shelve it. That way, President Clinton's 
certain veto won't happen while Congress is on vacation and he has 
the stage to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from Washington, all this play acting doesn't make sense to  
people who wonder why Congress and the White House aren't seeking 
terms on which they can agree rather than collide. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an arena bounded by politics and long-rehearsed arguments  
about tax rates and government spending, it sounds sensible, at 
least to the debaters. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been around the tax track before. In prior rounds over  
the past five years, Clinton has used vetoes and the threat of them 
to push his budget terms, to his and Democratic advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	He's made issues of Social Security and Medicare financing -- and  
now the expansion of the latter to cover prescription drugs. In the 
1999 round, he also argues that reducing the national debt is more 
important than a giant tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an article of Republican faith that when the party  
campaigns for tax cuts, it wins elections, that the money ought to 
go back to taxpayers and not into the hands of Washington 
bureaucrats who think they know better how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
	That essentially sums up the endless hours of speechmaking on  
tax cuts and government priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas says the real argument has  
more to do with federal spending than with cutting taxes. That 
sounds a lot like one of the rationales of Ronald Reagan's tax 
cutting economic policy nearly 20 years ago, which was that if the 
government didn't get the money, it couldn't spend it on programs 
his Republican administration wanted to undo anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, on ABC, said that the Republicans and the White House are  
``much further apart than the public understands.'' Perhaps, but 
people do understand that the Republican Congress is going to pass 
something, Clinton is going to veto it, and both sides are going to 
argue that they were right. At least people who are paying 
attention to the whole business. 
</P>
<P>
	What they think about it depends on whether the question is put  
on GOP terms or Democratic terms. A Pew Research Center poll showed 
a 3-1 preference for spending over tax cuts, when the money was 
designated for programs dealing with education, the environment, 
health care, crime and defense. But the choice was nearly reversed 
when it was an option between a tax cut and ``new federal 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue now are House and Senate bills for 10-year tax cuts,  
totaling $792 billion in each version, but with differing 
provisions on what would be cut. One feature of both measures: 
Neither would cut taxes until the year after next. About 80 percent 
of the projected cuts wouldn't happen until after 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are trying to blend those bills into one they  
can get approved by the House by Wednesday or Thursday, and the 
Senate Friday, before Congress recesses for a month's summer break. 
</P>
<P>
	That final version would be set aside until after Labor Day,  
then sent to Clinton, who said he will veto it as excessive. The 
Republicans can't muster the two-thirds votes it would take to 
override him. But they could spend the recess telling voters about 
their tax cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the president said, we need to do first things first --  
that's Social Security and Medicare,'' White House Press Secretary 
Joe Lockhart said Monday. The Republicans insist there's surplus 
enough to cover that and their tax cuts. The White House says not. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed about $250 billion worth of tax cuts over  
10 years, for retirement savings, education tax breaks and other 
aims. The administration is willing to negotiate up a bit, but not 
to anything approaching the Republican measures. 
</P>
<P>
	So the lines are set. Neither side can win outright. Neither  
side can afford to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the  
Budget Committee, said there ought to be a grand compromise, but 
that it would have to include a very major tax cut. But to 
Clinton's Democrats, that would be capitulation, not compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said the alternative is gridlock, and it would be the  
Democrats' fault. 
</P>
<P>
	They will say not, and blame Republicans.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> DuBose Family Wants Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The family of a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers  
linebacker who was killed by police officers has initiated an 
independent autopsy and investigation into the shooting after 
witnesses indicated the athlete may have been shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Demetrius DuBose, 28, was shot several times by police officers  
July 24 after he allegedly charged at officers with nunchakus, a 
martial arts weapon that he took away from an officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	But preliminary findings of the family's investigation show  
DuBose was initially calm and cooperated with officers' 
investigation of a burglary call until they began to ``intimidate 
and harass'' him, likely because he was black, said H.J. Sims of 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the police first arrived the gentleman was patient for  
about five to 10 minutes,'' Sims said Monday. ``It was only after 
they tried to place him in handcuffs that the unprofessionalism of 
police allowed the situation to escalate and prompted the gentleman 
to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego City Councilmen George Stevens and Byron Wear are  
calling for a thorough investigation into the shooting to allay any 
concerns that it was unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose had been arrested three times in the past year.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest was June 14, when California Highway Patrol officers  
found DuBose ``very dazed, very confused'' in his car parked on the 
side of a highway near Mammoth Lakes, said Mono County prosecutor 
Tim Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting field sobriety tests and observing ``white  
powdery substance dripping from his nose,'' officers determined he 
was under the influence of PCP, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose became increasingly agitated as the investigation went  
on, but officers were able to get him handcuffed, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose also was reportedly under the influence of an unknown  
drug Feb. 3, when he allegedly forced his way into a Mammoth Lakes 
restaurant after being denied entrance several times, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, DuBose was arrested in South Bend, Ind., after  
he became belligerent at a nightclub. When an off-duty police 
officer ordered him to leave, DuBose allegedly grabbed a pipe from 
an overhead sprinkler system -- flooding the club with some 1,600 
gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens noted some people have said 6-foot-2-DuBose was bending  
over when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others have said he was turning away. I would hope the autopsy  
would show where the first shot entered,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego police Chief David Bejarano said he welcomes outside  
input and expects an internal investigation to be completed within 
two weeks. Results, which will include toxicology results, will be 
turned over to the district attorney's office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers claim DuBose resisted officers' attempts to question  
him and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or other 
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Services Widen Web Search Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine quickly digging up a Web site devoted to  
research on a rare disease. Or easily locating a scientific paper 
for your college thesis. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to hard-to-find information on the Internet,  
chances are improving that a few typed keywords may immediately 
locate what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Internet search services, including ExciteAtHome and  
Lycos, say they are dramatically widening their scope to encompass 
more of the 800 million Web sites on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves follow a recent study showing that most search engines  
let people scour just a fraction of the Net, excluding lesser known 
sites and the torrents of fresh information added daily to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While broader searches may clutter some Internet users with  
needless information, the services insist they are working harder 
to organize search results so that top-listed sites match what 
people are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely good that the search engines are getting  
bigger -- with a big caveat that bigger doesn't necessarily mean 
better,'' said Danny Sullivan, the London-based editor of 
searchenginewatch.com, a Web site that tracks the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, broader searches are more likely to benefit those who  
conduct in-depth research, such as scientists and journalists, 
rather than casual Web users just looking to buy books or CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, the journal Nature published a study showing  
that search engines cover a shrinking fraction of Web pages and 
take a long time to list new sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, by NEC Research Institute, offered fresh bragging  
rights to those Web destinations with search engines that ranked 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	Better search power is a good way to draw more visitors. Twice  
as many people have been using Northern Light, the top-ranked 
search engine in the study, since the Nature report was published, 
said Susan Stearns, director of marketing for Northern Light 
Technology LLC, based in Cambridge, Mass. ``People recognize that 
comprehensiveness is important,'' Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while offering more comprehensive searches is one way to  
lure more visitors to a site, it's no guarantee. The most visited 
network of Web sites, Yahoo!, ranked only No. 8 in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome Corp. unveiled a new version of its search tool on  
Tuesday, saying it will index up to 300 million Web pages, or more 
than a third of the Internet's public sites -- up from just 6 
percent. In addition, the service uses a more thorough method of 
sifting through Web sites to decide which to include in its index. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped service, which will be available by the middle of  
this month, comes after a year-and-a-half of research, said Kris 
Carpenter, director of search services for ExciteAtHome, insisting 
the timing of the launch was unrelated to the study's release. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, a day before the Excite announcement, a Norwegian  
company named Fast Search &AMP; Transfer unveiled a service that checks 
200 million Web pages. The service also organizes information so 
that users aren't bogged down by lots of irrelevant material, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos plans to introduce a more comprehensive search by the end  
of the year, said executive vice president Ron Sege. But Sege 
played down the importance of broader searches, saying that the 
important thing is how well a company chooses the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The service upgrades come amid pressure from investors for  
search companies to boost traffic to their Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Government Pays Off $113.8B of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government paid off a record $113.8  
billion of the national debt in the April-June quarter and expects 
to pay another $11 billion in debt this quarter, the Treasury 
Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement of a portion of the $5.5 trillion in national debt is  
occurring because of record budget surpluses, now estimated by the 
Clinton administration to total $5.9 trillion over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both President Clinton and congressional Republicans have  
pledged to use two-thirds of those surpluses to shore up the Social 
Security trust fund by paying down the national debt. But they are 
fighting over use of the remainder: Republicans want large tax 
cuts, which Clinton considers fiscally irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The net debt reduction this fiscal year will amount to more than  
$87 billion, Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House. 
He called it the ``largest deficit reduction in America's 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debt reduction for this year and last year, the first with a  
budget surplus in 29 years, will total $142 billion, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debt reduction brings tangible benefits to American's working  
families through lower interest rates,'' Clinton said. He estimated 
an American family with a $100,000 mortgage would save more than 
$2,000 annually in lower interest payments because of the lower 
mortgage rates resulting from lower government borrowing demands. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing its borrowing needs for the current quarter, the  
Treasury Department said Monday it expects to pay off $11 billion 
in debt coming due. That figure was in line with an earlier 
projection of a debt reduction of $10 billion for the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	During the April-June quarter, the $113.8 billion of national  
debt that Treasury said the government paid off was a slightly 
smaller amount than an earlier estimate of $116 billion. The 
revision was attributed to lower-than-expected tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	From October to December, the first quarter of the government's  
fiscal year 1999, net government borrowing was $24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once rare, reductions in federal debt are becoming increasingly  
commonplace as a result of the return of annual federal budget 
surpluses after 28 consecutive years of deficit, 1969 through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in its midyear economic forecast,  
projected that the surplus, which totaled $69.2 billion in 1998, 
will climb to $98.8 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30, and will total $142.5 billion in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Begins Gun Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado has again begun checking the backgrounds  
of gun buyers, taking over the task from the federal government 
following the shooting deaths of three young girls by their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens signed an executive order mandating the change  
Sunday. The instant background checks had been performed by the FBI 
since April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has more complete and detailed information on  
restrictions, including restraining orders, which will help prevent 
those people who have criminal histories from legally purchasing 
firearms,'' said Inspector Pete Mang of the Colorado Bureau of 
Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	By 5 p.m. Sunday, the CBI had reviewed 68 requests and rejected  
eight bids to buy guns, two of which it said would not have been 
denied by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	One request was denied because of a restraining order, the other  
because of a felony charge which the FBI check would not have 
caught because the potential buyer was not fingerprinted at the 
time of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch is the result of the June 22 slayings by Simon  
Gonzales, who purchased a handgun from a federally-licensed dealer 
only hours before he killed his three daughters as they slept. He 
died in a shootout with Castle Rock police. 
</P>
<P>
	It was later discovered that his estranged wife had filed a  
restraining order against him, something the federal checks did not 
uncover and that could have prevented the gun purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado system still has loopholes, Mang said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gun sellers who are not federally licensed, including private  
sellers who frequent gun shows, are not required to do background 
checks. Neither are individuals who sell guns privately. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone wants to buy a gun illegally, it is easy to do  
so,'' Mang said. ``But this provides another level of protection, 
and that might prevent someone else from slipping through the 
cracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado began handgun-buyer background checks in 1995,  
expanding it to rifles and shotguns in November. State lawmakers 
killed the program, saying it duplicated FBI efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The next logical step, according to David Winkler, would be to  
extend the regulation to gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old said he and a friend walked into a recent gun  
show and purchased a TEC-DC9, the same weapon used by the teen-age 
gunmen in the April 20 massacre at Littleton's Columbine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just proves how important it is to end unrestricted  
anonymous purchases, to have any gun purchase cleared with law 
enforcement,'' said Winkler, who is a member of Safe Alternatives 
to the Firearms Epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz Recalls Child Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 child seats that  
automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when installed, 
saying a flaw might keep the bags turned on -- a potential danger to 
small children. 
</P>
<P>
	The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas  
in the seat cushion. Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are 
supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and 
turn off the passenger air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed  
forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the 
passenger air bag might not turn off as designed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers would know the system was not working only because an  
``air bag off'' light would stay dark. Mercedes-Benz said there 
have been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no 
reports of accidents or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recommended the seats not be used and that children  
sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes dealers will exchange the seats for free. The recall  
does not affect Toddler seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety experts say that small infants ride in rear-facing child  
seats, but also strongly recommend that rear-facing infant seats 
never be placed in front of an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since  
1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

<HEADLINE> Watts Threatened To Resign As Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican Conference Chairman J.C.  
Watts of Oklahoma threatened to resign his leadership post last 
week, complaining that GOP Whip Tom DeLay was usurping his job 
crafting communications strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Watts') view was that if J.C. Watts and Tom DeLay are not  
working together, neither of them will be successful at their 
leadership jobs,'' Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., one of Watts' 
allies, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous officials close to both men said Watts, the first black  
member of the GOP leadership since Republicans took control of 
Congress in 1995, became furious last Thursday when DeLay handed 
out a packet on communications strategy during a meeting of House 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications strategy traditionally has fallen within the  
purview of those holding Watt's title, the No. 4 position in the 
House GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Watts confronted House Speaker Dennis Hastert and  
threatened to resign as conference chairman, according to GOP 
leadership officials familiar with the events. Hastert, R-Ill., 
stepped in to stop the squabble, these officials said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, whose job as the No. 2 official in the GOP leadership is  
to marshal votes for Republican legislation, insists he was only 
trying to help, according to his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had we foreseen this (action) would have caused this much  
tension, we would have never done it in the first place,'' said 
DeLay spokesman Mike Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, through his spokesman, declined to comment directly on  
the dispute. Watts issued a statement calling the brouhaha a 
``family'' matter and Hoekstra said that Watts was ``disappointed'' 
that it had become public. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to DeLay said he was only responding to Watts'  
call for more coordination during a meeting between the men two 
days earlier that had been requested by Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the Watts-DeLay meeting, a group of conservative  
lawmakers told DeLay that they had not been working with Watts on 
communications, according to these officials, who demanded 
anonymity. DeLay then drew up a strategy to present to the 
conference meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide to DeLay called Watts' office the night before the  
conference meeting and left a message saying that Watts' office 
should call back if ``there's a problem,'' DeLay's allies say. They 
said no one from Watts' office called back. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials close to Watts said his office did respond to the call  
from DeLay's office, and requested a copy of DeLay's packet but it 
never arrived. DeLay's office said it never received such a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts has expressed frustration before about being usurped by  
other GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has, there has been some of that,'' Watts told The Hill,  
a Capitol Hill newspaper, in an interview several weeks ago when 
asked if his communications strategy effort was being undermined by 
another leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you where it comes from,'' Watts told The Hill.  
``I have my thoughts. But I'm bigger than that. I'll let those 
people play those games and empire-building.''

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is poised to keep growing at  
least through the first half of 2000, leaving it on track for 
achieving the longest expansion ever, according to a key gauge of 
future activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said today that its Index of Leading  
Economic Indicators, which is designed to help spot turning points 
in the economy, rose 0.3 in June to 107.7. That matched the May 
increase and brought gains in the indicator to eight out of the 
past nine months. The last decline, in April, was 0.1 
</P>
<P>
	The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106  
months, from February 1962 until December 1969. The current 
expansion, which began in March 1991, would match the record if it 
continues through January 2000 and pass it if it lasts until 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expansion is firmly on track,'' said Michael Boldin,  
director of business cycle research at the Conference Board. But 
because of concerns that the Federal Reserve may raise interest 
rates again to fight inflation ``some volatility can be expected in 
the second half of 1999,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets had little reaction to the report by the  
business-financed research group based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that, if anything, it confirmed that the economy  
is growing at a slow and steady pace of about 2.7 percent annually, 
which should not meaningfully accelerate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's figures came as investors were trying to predict  
whether the Fed would raise short-term interest rates for a second 
time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank increased rates by a quarter point on June 30  
in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Its chairman, Alan 
Greenspan, has warned it is prepared to act quickly again on any 
signs of rekindled inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that Tuesday's report did not signal that  
inflation is in danger of getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank ``may have to come in and do a small adjustment  
in rates,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One 
Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``But this report is not 
telling the Fed that there's any kind of panic here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index rose  
in June. The most significant increases came in manufacturers' new 
orders of consumer goods and materials, in money supply, and in the 
difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a sign that the labor market may not be heating up  
enough to push up wages -- a key component of the inflation picture 
-- the average number of hours worked per week by production workers 
-- was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of current economic activity rose  
by 0.4 to 124.6 in June. But its lagging index decreased by 0.4 to 
108. The indexes are calculated from a base of 100, set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, the three composite indexes and their  
components show a very health economy,'' the Conference Board 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, noted that other recent reports show that economic growth is 
slowing. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that economic 
growth has slowed to an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second 
quarter from 4.3 percent in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A report Monday from an organization of industrial executives  
suggested manufacturing growth has slowed. And while Americans' 
wages and benefits surged in the second quarter by the largest 
amount since 1991, Thayer noted that help-wanted advertising is at 
its lowest level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Thayer said, higher long-term interest rates should  
brake the economy even further. Thirty-year mortgages topped 8 
percent this week for the first time in more than two years. That 
should further slow the housing market, which is already reporting 
a sharp drop in new construction and refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chan said the next important clue to the pace of growth in the  
economy will be provided Friday with a report on the July 
unemployment rate. Until then, he said, ``I think the economy is 
steady as she goes.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Tips for Avoiding Stock Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips for investors from the Securities and Exchange Commission  
for avoiding stock fraud. Before investing in small-company stocks, 
the SEC advises: 
</P>
<P>
	--Be aware that many small companies do not file periodic reports  
with the SEC, making it difficult to get information about their 
management, products, services and finances. 
</P>
<P>
	--Call your state securities regulator and ask whether the broker  
and his or her firm are licensed and if there's a record of 
investor complaints or fraud against them. To locate your state 
regulator, call the North American Securities Administrators 
Association at 202-737-0900 or go to its Web site at www.nasaa.org. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check independently the truth of every statement about the  
company, especially those made in press releases or newsletters and 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't fall for promises of quick profits or guaranteed returns  
on investments, or be pressured into investing before doing 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get a free copy of the SEC brochure, ``Microcap Stock: A Guide  
for Investors,'' available at the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov 
or by calling 1-800-732-0330.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Agree on Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan and the United States agree that rapid  
changes in foreign exchange rates can be harmful and are 
maintaining close contact about recent gains in the yen, Japan's 
finance minister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sudden changes in foreign exchange rates are undesirable, as  
they have an impact on the economy. In more ways than one, we are 
speaking with the U.S., and basically, we've agreed that sudden 
changes are undesirable. If necessary, we must respond,'' Finance 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the yen's recent rise against the dollar has been  
excessively strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa had spoken by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary  
Lawrence Summers about foreign exchange, the Finance Ministry said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said the two nations agreed to maintain close  
contact on foreign exchange policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman said Summers and  
Miyazawa pledged close cooperation on currency exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa's comments, and news of his contact with Summers,  
helped reverse a sharp rise in the yen recently by raising 
expectations that Japan might step into markets to drive its 
currency lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.40 yen Tuesday afternoon, up 1.36 from  
yesterday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 114.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has risen against the dollar over the last several weeks  
as growing optimism about the prospects for economic recovery in 
Japan has brought of a flood of foreign cash into Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell from more than 120 yen last month to below 114  
yen on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial authorities and executives worry that a  
strong yen could wipe out overseas profits for Japanese companies. 
A stronger yen forces Japan's exporters to raise prices abroad or 
face lower earnings when overseas revenue is converted into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has spent an estimated $30 billion over the last two  
months trying to drive its currency lower by flooding the market 
with yen, but traders have said authorities have been less active 
in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lowers Grain Import Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia expects to import 8.6 million tons of grain  
in 1999, about half as much as previously estimated, a top 
agriculture official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture officials had said Russia would need to import at  
least 15 million tons of grain this year. But that was before grain 
harvest forecasts were increased t0 60 tons from about 50 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the imported grain will be fodder for livestock, First  
Deputy Agriculture and Food Minister Anatoly Mikhalev said, 
according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for this year's crop harvest have fluctuated  
substantially, but officials say their current estimates are more 
accurate now that the harvest is under way. About 20 percent of the 
crop has been brought in so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mikhalev said that forecasts for other crops were not  
promising. Without providing figures, he predicted that harvests of 
corn, potatoes and cotton would be low.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Tires of Stats, Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is tiring of stats and milestones,  
but a big one is coming up. He's just two homers from the 500 home 
run club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fascination with numbers started when rotisserie baseball  
became big probably 10 years ago,'' McGwire said. ``There's stats 
coming out of the woodwork that nobody ever knew about that I think 
sometimes blow things way out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has set a few of those lately, such as most homers over  
a four- and five-year period. Last month he broke Joe Adcock's NL 
record with 16 homers in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hit 221 homers since 1996 and 259 since 1995, both records,  
naturally. He's second on the career list for homers by a first 
baseman with 483, 10 behind Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost assuredly will break Babe Ruth's record of reaching  
500 in the fewest at-bats, since he's at 5,478 and Ruth needed 
5,801. 
</P>
<P>
	His reaction? Statistics are for geeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only stats you look at with power hitters are driving in  
runs and hitting home runs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire entered Tuesday night's game in a sprint for 500, having  
hit 14 homers in 18 games, including No. 498 against San Diego on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acts as if there's no special incentive, even though only  
15 players have reached 500, and all are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to feel,'' he said. ``It's going to happen one  
day. I don't know when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He feels the same way about Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 hits,  
which is being played out in front of him the next three days. 
Gwynn got his 2,995th hit, a two-run single in the ninth inning, in 
the Cardinals' 6-5 victory Monday, but McGwire said he and Gwynn 
didn't discuss their parallel chases at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much is there to talk about?'' McGwire said. ``There's no  
reason to talk about 500 until you get there and there's no reason 
to talk about 3,000 until he gets to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a level you reach. People have done it before, so  
it's just a milestone he's going to reach. What day, what hour, 
what minute, it's just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way McGwire is going, he'll get to 500 very soon. After a  
slow start, he was only four homers off his record 70-homer pace of 
last year and chances for him reaching his milestone before Gwynn 
appeared good. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cardinals began a seven-game homestand Friday, McGwire  
needed six homers and Gwynn needed nine hits, and McGwire said he 
basically had no chance of getting there first. Evidence to the 
contrary, he's sticking to that prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting hits is a little bit easier than hitting home runs,  
believe me,'' McGwire said. ``But you guys write it like it's easy. 
I think people take me for granted because I hit them in such 
streaks. They don't realize how tough it is.''

<HEADLINE> Leading Indicators Report Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Conference Board releases its report on the  
Leading Economic Indicators for June at 10 a.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure in May rose 0.3 points from 107.1 to 107.4.  
</P>
<P>
	The index is intended to spot growth trends three to six months  
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, the nation's manufacturers reported a slowing of  
growth in July with only modest increases in prices of raw 
materials, easing Wall Street fears of an overheating economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Monday by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management indicated that the U.S. manufacturing sector 
grew in July for the sixth straight month, but not as strongly as 
in the previous month and below analysts' predictions. Price 
increases also were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures, which suggest that a second-quarter slowing of the  
overall economy's growth is continuing into the third quarter, 
sparked a rally in the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated he is  
poised to raise interest rates for a second time this year on signs 
of a re-emergence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report put a damper on any plan by the Fed to immediately  
raise interest rates,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn at Wells 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Jordan, an analyst with Banc One Investment Advisors,  
noted that the manufacturing figures, which followed last week's 
report that the nation's economic growth slowed to 2.3 percent in 
the second quarter, ``are part of a pattern indicating the economy 
is starting to moderate.'' This, he said, ``will keep the Federal 
Reserve from being too aggressive about interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers group, which represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for industry, said its monthly index 
of manufacturing activity registered 53.4 percent in July, compared 
with 57 percent in June. Figures above 50 percent indicate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic analysts had predicted an index reading of 56 in July.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey results are watched closely because they are the  
first national reading for July on U.S. manufacturing performance, 
a key sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported construction  
spending rebounded slightly in June, rising 0.5 percent, after 
falling for two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of $699.4 billion, following drops of 1.4 percent in both May 
and in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that the purchasing managers' report indicated  
that growth in manufacturing was slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are seeing some cooling off in the economy,'' said  
Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. ``Manufacturing certainly isn't overheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said that ``keeping the lid'' on growth was the strength  
of the dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive, as well 
as strong import competition. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that production and new orders were up, though the rate  
of growth slowed. The new orders index registered 54.4 percent in 
July, compared with 61.7 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very soft,'' Thayer said. ``It suggests manufacturing  
is likely to be moderate going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's price index, at 54.7 percent in July compared with  
53.5 percent in June, marked the third consecutive month with a 
price reading above 50 percent. Some analysts had expected it to 
exceed 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 industries represented in the survey indicated  
they were paying higher prices for raw materials during July, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The employment index, meanwhile, fell to 49.6 percent in July  
from 51.9 percent in June. Employment in the manufacturing industry 
has been declining for nearly a year.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Sign Slegr to 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Defenseman Jiri Slegr agreed to a $2.3  
million, two-year contract Tuesday, becoming the first player to 
sign with the Pittsburgh Penguins since Mario Lemieux was approved 
as owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux was awarded the team in federal bankruptcy court June  
24, but may not close on the deal until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Slegr had eight goals and 32 assists the last two seasons, with  
a plus-24 rating that ranked third on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been very good for us, very dependable,'' general manager  
Craig Patrick said. ``We're very happy to have him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins still have five players eligible for salary  
arbitration, and must sign them within two weeks to avoid 
arbitration hearings. Also unsigned are Martin Straka, Alexei 
Kovalev, Matthew Barnaby, Ian Moran and Robert Lang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get these guys signed,'' said Patrick, who is  
working with a $30 million budget prepared by Lemieux's staff -- a 
$6 million increase from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that boost will be wiped out by Jaromir Jagr's salary,  
which jumps from $4.9 million to $10.4 million, or more than 
one-third of the Penguins' payroll.

<HEADLINE> Officials Declare Drought Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLES TOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Terry Dunn's sweet corn crop is a  
total loss, his hay crop half its usual yield. His field corn is 
not worth harvesting. The chickens' eggs are smaller than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on Dunn's 122-acre farm that federal officials chose to  
declare West Virginia and parts of five neighboring states 
agricultural disaster areas Monday -- the latest step as the 
region's terrible drought grows more severe each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I had the worst-looking crops,'' Dunn said of his  
chance to host a tour by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. 
``It's a dubious honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After picking a few sickly, 3- to 4-inch ears of corn from a  
field of dry, knee-high stalks, Glickman issued the declaration for 
89 counties in Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and 
West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, which likely will be expanded in the coming days,  
makes farmers who have lost at least 30 percent of a crop eligible 
for low-interest federal loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drought is like an insidious cancer. It's slow, it infects and  
it's harder to deal with as a disaster,'' Glickman said. ``Farm 
prices are the lowest in a decade, and this drought couldn't have 
come at a worse time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hottest Julys on record has also had a horrendous  
human cost: more than 200 heat-related deaths in 20 states since 
July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought gripping the mid-Atlantic area is already the  
third-worst this century and could surpass the droughts of 1929 and 
1966 to become the most devastating, scientists with the U.S. 
Geological Survey said Monday. Some of the region's soil hasn't 
been this dry since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a crisis here. Together we're going to try to do  
emergency assistance for the farmers and long-term policy that will 
help reverse this trend,'' Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rural wells and underground aquifers, already low from a winter  
with little snow or rain, are continuing to run dry. That will hurt 
farmers again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	From Boston to Miami, rainfall in some areas is 50 percent to 80  
percent below normal. The dry weather has been felt from tree 
nurseries in the Northeast to fruit orchards in Florida. The arid 
weather has sucked the life out of crops, wilting limbs and 
dropping fruit to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In Galway, N.Y., Christmas tree farmer Dave Eaton has lost about  
70 percent of this season's plantings, some 15,000 trees at a cost 
of $1 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman issued a drought warning  
Monday, clearing the way for state officials to assert control over 
the state's water supply. People should conserve now or face 
possible mandatory restrictions later, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To preserve hay for the winter, many West Virginia livestock  
growers are selling cattle early at prices their fathers and 
grandfathers got 30 to 40 years ago, Sen. Robert C. Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia Democrat is sponsoring an amendment to a $9.9  
billion farm-spending bill that would give livestock farmers $150 
million in grants to help cover the mounting losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said he would lobby for Byrd's measure. And in  
Washington, President Clinton said he would work with Congress to 
provide $10 billion in drought relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We provide emergency assistance for disasters around the  
world, and there's no reason we shouldn't provide comparable 
assistance for people here at home,'' he said. ``And we will do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aid may come too late for some.  
</P>
<P>
	This year may be the last for up to 10 percent of West  
Virginia's 21,000 farmers, state Agriculture Secretary Gus Douglass 
said. Statewide, farm losses so far have surpassed $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would need about 15 inches of rain to make up for the loss,  
but the damage is already done,'' Douglass said. He said one farmer 
he saw wept as he was forced to sell his cows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks, it just comes down to one single word, and that is  
survival. One of the best examples of American rural culture is 
being destroyed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn Harshman knows that all too well.  
</P>
<P>
	After examining shin-high soybeans -- they should be more than 3  
feet tall by now -- the third-generation farmer said he wasn't sure 
his 800-acre grain and cattle business would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at the point where if they want to know what I'm going to  
do next year, I honestly don't know,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Introduce Jim Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jim Jackson is expected to be with Atlanta this  
fall despite rumors that his stay could be only a temporary one 
with the Hawks, who are looking to upgrade their front court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a 6-foot-6 guard who backed up Isaiah Rider last season  
with the Portland Trail Blazers, was dealt to the Hawks on Monday 
along with Rider in exchange for guard Steve Smith, who led Atlanta 
in scoring, and little-used guard Ed Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not make this trade with Portland to move either  
player,'' Atlanta general manager Pete Babcock said during a news 
conference Tuesday at the Hawks' offices introducing Jackson to the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock made the statement despite their interest in free agent  
center-forward Lorenzen Wright, who played with the Los Angeles 
Clippers last season but has said he will not return there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret Lorenzen Wright was in town today. We met with  
him and he's a very attractive free agent,'' Babcock said. ``The 
Clippers are very interested in Jim Jackson, but we told them no. 
It's too high a price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still maintaining an interest in Lorenzen Wright, but  
not at the price of giving up Jim Jackson,'' Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson believes he'll be a Hawk when the season opens and,  
despite playing behind Ryder last season at Portland, will get more 
playing time with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love it. It doesn't matter to me. I pride myself on being  
a basketball player,'' said Jackson, who is expected to also play 
some small forward. ``I don't care where I play as long as I'm on 
the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock said starting positions will be won or lost in training  
camp, with the decisions being made by coach Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very confident that Jim Jackson is a bona fide starter  
in the NBA. He's proved that in his career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's also proved he's willing to sacrifice for the good of the  
team and that's what we're looking for,'' Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 29, who averaged a career-low 8.4 points last season,  
signed a three-year, $6 million free agent contract with Portland 
prior to last season. He has averaged 17.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 
4 assists during his seven years in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock said the Hawks were looking for more scoring and to run  
more, which will be possible with Jackson and Ryder as well as the 
addition of their No. 1 draft pick, point guard Jason Terry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more athletic, got more scoring punch and will be able  
to run a more effective up tempo game now,'' Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a situation last year where I didn't start for the  
first time in my career,'' Jackson said. ``I had to make a 
sacrifice. I made that adjustment. It wasn't easy, but I adjusted 
and it paid off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers made it to the third round of the playoffs before  
being knocked out 4-0 by eventual NBA champion San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who finished second in the Central Division to  
Indiana, were swept by the New York Knicks in the second round of 
the playoffs. They have not made it beyond the second round since 
moving to Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson began his NBA career with the Dallas Mavericks, who  
selected him with the fourth overall pick in the 1992 draft after 
an outstanding career at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 4 1/2 years in Dallas before being traded three times in  
1997-98 -- first to New Jersey in a nine-player trade, then to 
Philadelphia on draft day in the deal that sent Keith Van Horn to 
the Nets and finally to Golden State along with Clarence 
Weatherspoon for Joe Smith and Brian Shaw.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Anderson Still Holding Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- A personal plea from coach Dan Reeves  
wasn't enough to end Jamal Anderson's holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves reached Anderson by telephone Saturday at his home in  
Salt Lake City, where the Pro Bowl running back has remained during 
the first week of training camp while haggling with the Atlanta 
Falcons over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his  
deal, is seeking a five-year contract with an $8 million signing 
bonus. The Falcons have offered a $7 million bonus and at least $1 
million less in guaranteed money over the life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him why we felt the way we did as far as our offer was  
concerned and tried to understand where he's coming from,'' Reeves 
said. ``It was just a conversation to touch base and see if 
something could be done to get him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently not. Anderson wasn't on hand for Tuesday's two  
workouts and is now facing at least $30,000 in fines -- the maximum 
$5,000 per day -- even if he reports by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would get here when it's 85,'' Reeves said. ``I  
wasn't sure if he was talking about $85 million or 85 degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harold Richardson, who has handled negotiations  
for the Falcons, has had only one conversation with Anderson's 
agent since Friday, when California-based Jim Sims departed on a 
two-week vacation to Europe.

<HEADLINE> PBS List Exposes It to Bias Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When conservative producer Lionel Chetwynd  
approached PBS with an idea for a public affairs series in the 
early '90s, he was wary of his reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in with some trepidation and a chip on my shoulder,  
believing it was one big left-wing cabal. What we discovered is the 
system strives to be politically neutral,'' said Chetwynd, whose 
``National Desk'' series has become a PBS regular. 
</P>
<P>
	Chetwynd is the kind of friendly witness public broadcasting may  
need. Five years after PBS successfully battled the effort of a 
newly Republican-controlled Congress to cut or eliminate its 
funding, the service is in the soup again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, some of its own offspring helped to put it there. At  
least two dozen of the 349 PBS stations nationwide, including many 
major outlets, have engaged in swapping lists of potential donors 
with political groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, the groups were as diverse as the Democratic National  
Committee and Country Club Republicans. And PBS, which contends the 
exchanges were handled by outside list brokers, not station 
insiders, says the swaps were wrong and are being halted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the controversy represents, at the least, a careless move  
for a service that has long been the target of complaints of 
partisanship and has been forced to defend the very existence of 
public-supported TV in a free-market society. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who had introduced a proposal to  
authorize increased funding for the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, withdrew it. He and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
have asked for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether perceptions of political bias are legitimate or not, PBS  
had an obligation to be sensitive to such concerns or ``suffer the 
consequences,'' Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Ervin S. Duggan, president and chief executive officer,  
PBS seemed to have become more politically inclusive, Tauzin said. 
But, he said, the list exchanges call into question its programming 
as well as its management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were the changes they made only superficial, designed to  
overcome perception and not reality? That's a serious question. I 
suppose we're going to have to get into it,'' Tauzin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan said he is prepared to respond to those seeking to  
connect PBS on-air efforts with its stations' fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a non sequitur. Anyone who sees a connection between this  
and the editorial process simply doesn't understand how public 
television works,'' Duggan said. ``The burden of proof is on them 
to show that there's a bias. It does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``No organization like ours has any right to opinions of our  
own. We invite people onto our air who are of all opinions, and we 
have to be scrupulous that all opinions are heard and seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PBS cites polling data to bolster its claims of neutrality: In a  
1998-99 survey of leaders in government, business, medicine and 
other fields, three PBS programs were top-rated for credibility and 
objectivity, including ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer,'' 
``Washington Week in Review'' and ``Wall Street Week with Louis 
Rukeyser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a September 1998 phone poll of 1,000 households conducted for  
PBS, 38 percent said public television was ``mostly unbiased'' (25 
percent answered ``Don't know''). The survey found viewers who 
believed the service leans left or right were nearly evenly 
divided. No margin of error was given. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to critics, the picture is much the same, Duggan  
said: ``We get attacked from both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the liberal watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in  
Media released a study that said PBS news and public affairs 
programming has a ``persistent elite bias'' and gives big business 
and government officials more air time than ``citizen activists'' 
or members of the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	(PBS pointed to its armful of journalism awards and called the  
survey's methodology flawed.) 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, conservatives have even fewer kind words for PBS.  
In 1995, Republican lawmakers cited PBS' alleged liberal bias in 
their anti-funding arguments. The picture has changed but not 
improved, say critics on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our usual complaint with PBS and NPR (National Public Radio)  
was bias by commission. Now it's by omission,'' said Tim Graham, 
director of media analysis for the conservative Media Research 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing up sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme  
Court nominee Clarence Thomas was typical of past PBS 
transgressions, Graham said. These days, he argued, PBS avoids 
controversy by fielding softball shows. 
</P>
<P>
	'' 'Frontline was doing a lot of shows critical of the Reagan  
administration. Now they're doing stories about Hillary Clinton's 
college class,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is inherent, he said. ``Conservatives don't believe  
that government should be in the business of broadcasting. 
Therefore, who works in public broadcasting? Not those who don't 
believe it should exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is PBS' existence, not mailing lists, that is at the heart of  
the current debate, contends Bill Moyers, whose public affairs 
shows are a longtime public broadcasting staple. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of right-wing, ideological opponents of public  
broadcasting who would use some of the good things we do, and some 
of the dumb mistakes we make, to club public broadcasting. Every 
time they try, they get defeated -- not by public television, but by 
the people public television serves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great disservice to the public if a regrettable  
oversight (by the PBS stations) were sensationalized and used as 
political ammunition against a service the public greatly 
appreciates,'' Moyers said.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Beat U.S. for Baseball Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The Cubans came to the top of their  
dugout steps in the top of the ninth, dancing to a drum beat in the 
stands, ready to unfurl four of their nation's flags, ready to 
celebrate yet another baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When a 5-1 victory over the United States was secured, so was  
the gold medal in the Pan American Games, and the Cubans rushed the 
field in jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to overcome any distractions caused by numerous  
defections from their athletic teams, including one of their own, 
relief pitcher Danys Baez after Sunday's semifinal win over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cuban team is a very good, but not an unbeatable team by  
any means. It's disappointing, but we accomplished a lot here,'' 
said U.S. manager Buddy Bell, whose hastily assembled team clinched 
an Olympic berth the night before by beating Mexico in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba got two homers from long-ball star Orestes Kindelan -- the  
career home run leader in the country's history with 430 before the 
tourament -- and an overpowering pitching performance by Jose 
Contreras on one day's rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't communicate with them all that well, but they  
conducted themselves professionally,'' U.S. third baseman Jason 
Hardtke said. ``They were the team to beat. We beat them once, but 
then we came up short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan was 3-for-25 in the tournament before hitting a two-out  
homer in the fourth off starter Brad Penny for a 1-0 lead. The next 
batter, Gabriel Pierre, followed with another homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan homered again, a two-run shot, in the sixth. And the  
United States could manage just one run on a double by Milton 
Bradley and RBI single by Marcus Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras, who pitched six innings in a quarterfinal win over  
the Dominican Rebublic, struck out 13 in eight innings, including 
eight straight early in the game. The Cubans won their eighth 
straight Pan Ams gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is their best pitcher,'' Bell said. ``The guy is a horse,  
too, but he can't do that all the time -- or he shouldn't be able 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they don't care about anybody's health over there,  
which is a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat Cuba in the preliminary rounds 10-5.  
Canada also defeated the Cubans in the round robin before losing in 
the semifinals. Canada, despite the best record in the tournament, 
6-1, got only a bronze medal and no trip to the Olympics. The 
Canadians beat Mexico 9-2 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Cuba's problems mounted. Cuban officials  
denounced organizers for lax security that led to defections and 
disappearances that have plagued the team. They also criticized 
officials for failing to stop a demonstrator from disrupting 
Sunday's semifinal victory over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 19-year-old Baez left the team, telling a Miami  
television station he was headed for south Florida, the Cubans 
insisted that organizers tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' a statement from the Cuban 
delegation said. ``From now on we will react with full energy to 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports agent Joe Cubas, who has helped many Cubans defect to the  
United States, said in a release Monday that Baez sought asylum in 
Canada after the semifinal win. Baez told Miami television station 
WSCV 51 via telephone, ``I want to tell the people of Miami that 
another Cuban in search of freedom is about to become part of the 
people of Miami. Wait for me over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's departure brought to eight the number of Cubans to leave  
during the games. Runner Michal Ortiz, an unidentified female 
artistic gymnast and a soccer goalkeeper -- the goalies here were 
Rene Castro and Rodney Valdes -- also left the team on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian roller hockey goalkeeper Steve Vezina apologized for  
testing positive for three banned substances, costing his team a 
gold medal. At a news conference in Saint-Adele, Quebec, Vezina 
said, ``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete 
that represents Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't soothe teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined the chance of a lifetime for nine guys,'' Kerr said.  
``I know he's my teammate and I should be sticking up for him. I 
know I, along with nine other guys, we're clean. We did it the way 
we were supposed to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juana Rosario of the Dominican Republic, winner of the women's  
high jump, failed her drug test, a games officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's men's volleyball team beat Brazil in five sets for the  
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team closed in on 200 medals, upping its total to 188,  
74 gold. Canada is next at 111, 33 gold, followed by Cuba with 96, 
39 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women's soccer team advanced to the gold medal game  
by beating Costa Rica 2-0. Marcia Wallis and Kim Patrick scored for 
the Americans, who outshot Costa Rica 22-0 in the second half and 
34-1 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico beat Canada in a shootout for the other spot in the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age tennis star Alexandra Stevenson got her first test,  
needing a third-set tiebreaker to edge Renata Kolbovic of Canada 
7-6 (9-7), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women played their best basketball game so far, but  
couldn't hold a 16-point lead and lost to Brazil 77-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans collected one gold, by Ed Moses in the 100-meter  
breaststroke in games record time (1:00.99), and four silvers in 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the U.S. swim team was assured of not collecting a medal  
in an individual event for the first time since 1955 when Jarod 
Schroeder and Sabir Muhammad failed to qualify for the final of the 
men's 100 butterfly. Schroeder finished 11th overall in the 
preliminaries at 55.89 and Muhammad was 17th at 57.20. Only the top 
eight make the final. 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Chile 2-0, the U.S. women's field hockey team made  
the final game. If it wins that over Argentina, it goes to the 
Sydney Games.

<HEADLINE> Michael Douglas, Zeta-Jones Dating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are  
dating but they aren't engaged to marry -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A London tabloid reported this week that an engagement party is  
planned for Sept. 25, but Douglas publicist Allen Burry said today 
the newspaper apparently confused information about a joint 
birthday party planned that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took it another step and made more out of it than there  
really is,'' Burry said, adding the couple was indeed ``an item'' 
and that they ``do date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both actors' birthday is Sept. 25. Every year, Douglas has a  
party with people who share his birthday, including Barbara Walters 
and Christopher Reeve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when they found out Catherine also shared the  
birthday, they invited her to the party but she was filming and 
couldn't make it,'' Burry said. ``This year, she's going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether an engagement announcement was possible at that  
time, Burry said, ``Well, September's a long way away.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Find Ogden Pleasant Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Jeff Ogden was a decent high school  
football player, but not good enough to be given a college 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden ended up walking on at Division I-AA Eastern Washington  
and becoming a pretty decent receiver, but not good enough to get 
drafted by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Ogden is having the last laugh. He's in his second  
training camp with the Dallas Cowboys and this time he's focusing 
on moving up the depth chart rather than worrying about making the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking a more aggressive, more proactive approach to  
improving the team,'' Ogden said. ``Last year, there were some 
times where I didn't improve the team. I was just kind of a guy who 
could fill in. This year, I'm actually trying to make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In only a week of practices he's already impressed coach Chan  
Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he carries himself, his confidence, his hands -- every  
aspect of his game has improved,'' Gailey said. ``He doesn't even 
look like the same person who first stepped on our field last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden was one of 10 players trying to win the final receiver's  
job last summer. He outlasted the others by showing quick feet and 
sure hands in practice, then backing it up in preseason games. 
Ogden caught seven passes for 126 yards, good for a team-best 
average of 18 yards per reception. 
</P>
<P>
	In the regular season, Ogden contributed mostly on special  
teams, although he also caught eight passes for 63 yards. His most 
memorable game was Nov. 22 in Seattle when he caught four passes 
for 26 yards and ran 12 yards on an end round while playing in 
front of friends and family in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Some would call the 6-foot, 190-pound Ogden an overachiever. It  
may be more accurate to say people have simply underestimated his 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden has been winning inspirational awards since his high  
school days in Snohomish, Wash. He had a slow start to his college 
career then broke out as senior with 57 catches for 1,148 yards and 
13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten NFL teams invited him to training camp. He picked Dallas,  
and the Cowboys are glad he did. Receivers coach Dwain Painter 
already has told Ogden to be prepared to fill any of the five 
receiver roles in the playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is because I can play a few different  
positions,'' Ogden said. ``That's going to be a burden put on me, 
but it's one I gladly accept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began this camp working out with rookies and newcomers  
instead of going through veteran drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a long ways to go,'' he said. ``I've just got to  
keep working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogden's goal now is to move up to the No. 3 receiver behind  
Michael Irvin and Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail. His experience in 
Gailey's complicated offense gives him a head start over newcomer 
James McKnight and rookies Wane McGarity and MarTay Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes to me now on the field, where last year I was  
more into the book, memorizing things,'' he said. ``I'm learning a 
lot more about how to get open, how to be alone when the ball gets 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken Gailey long to notice. And the coach's praise is  
adding to Ogden's confidence.

<HEADLINE> St. Paul Cos. To Cut 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The St. Paul Cos. plans to cut about  
1,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce expenses by $100 million 
next year in the highly competitive insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cuts will be identified in the third quarter and  
will be completed by the end of this year, the company announced 
today. The St. Paul expects to take a related charge in the third 
quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a further step to position The St. Paul to succeed in  
the fiercely competitive property-casualty insurance industry,'' 
said Douglas Leatherdale, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a hard look at how we improve our profitability  
and our service to customers,'' Leatherdale said. ``These efforts 
are not taken lightly and are not optional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company will provide severance pay for affected employees  
and will help them find other jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new layoffs are separate from actions associated with the  
company's pending sale of its personal insurance operations to 
MetLife Auto and Home. 
</P>
<P>
	That sale, announced on July 12, is expected to result in the  
transfer of approximately 1,700 personal insurance employees to 
MetLife and the elimination of 500 to 600 jobs. These reductions 
will cut expenses by approximately $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest cuts also follow the elimination of 2,000 jobs in the  
merger with Baltimore-based insurer USF&AMP;G that closed in April 
1998. That merger is expected to save $260 million for The St. Paul 
by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Paul-based insurer, which had 1998 revenues of $9.1  
billion, provides property-liability insurance, reinsurance and 
life insurance products and services worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects $11 Billion Farm Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Tuesday rejected a  
Democrat-backed $11 billion bailout of the farm economy in favor of 
a smaller Republican package. But lawmakers said they hoped to work 
out a bipartisan compromise later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's bipartisan recognition that there's a disaster out  
there,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate defeated the Democratic plan  
54-44 after Democrats narrowly failed, 51-47, to kill the $7 
billion GOP emergency farm package. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the Republican plan was then put off while  
Democrats and Republicans tried to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides had reason to work out a deal before lawmakers leave  
for a month-long recess. Democrats don't want to be held 
responsible for killing an aid package, and farm-state Republicans 
worry that conservatives may desert the GOP plan. It's also 
possible for a senator to block the aid on procedural grounds 
because it would exceed annual spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers ``are telling their senators that they want action, they  
want votes, some indication that something will happen,'' said 
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, one of the Republicans negotiating with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., offered a $7.75 billion  
proposal containing disaster assistance not in the original 
Republican plan. Democrats said the GOP package wouldn't help many 
of the farmers who need it most, including drought-stricken growers 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore endorsed the $11 billion Democratic  
proposal earlier Tuesday, even as the Clinton administration was 
officially dodging the question of how much it thinks is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declined to tell the Senate  
Agriculture Committee how much help he thinks farmers need. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be in a position of saying you have to spend  
'x' dollars or 'y' dollars,'' Glickman said. Pressed as to whether 
the president would veto the GOP plan, he said, ``I'm not looking 
for a fight, if that's your bottom-line question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's move rankled Republicans, who fear they would lose a  
bidding war with President Clinton. During last fall's 
congressional campaigns, Republicans proposed $4 billion in farm 
aid only to have the president veto the package and force them to 
add $2 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing to show compassion with other people's  
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has depressed commodity prices low for  
the second year in a row, and USDA projects that net farm income 
will dip to $43.8 billion this year, about 4 percent below the 
inflation-adjusted average for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drought has parched crops from New York to Virginia.  
Although the drought isn't likely to push commodity prices up, it 
has galvanized support for farm assistance among East Coast 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen this before and it shouldn't surprise us. Whenever  
commodity prices fall and there's a certain amount of dislocation 
among some producers, then there's going to be a political 
response,'' said Kevin Kliesen, an economist with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers themselves have mixed opinions about what Congress  
should do. While there's widespread support for some kind of 
assistance, there's disagreement about the best way to deliver the 
aid or how much growers need. And there is concern that some 
growers will use the cash to bid up farm rents to expand their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	And some farmers ``don't want any payment at all for fear of  
what it may do. Others need it right now,'' said Edward 
Wiederstein, a grain and hog producer who is president of the Iowa 
Farm Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Head of Horace Mann School Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Russell Inslee Clark Jr., former  
president of the prestigious Horace Mann School in New York and 
Yale admissions dean, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark suffered a head injury in a fall last month while working  
as a counselor at a summer camp in Westport, N.Y. Complications 
developed and he died at Gaylord Hospital, Horace Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yale graduate, Clark became dean of the school's Trumbell  
College in 1963. He was Yale's dean of admissions from 1965 to 
1969, successfully pushing for the admission of women. He also 
lectured in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
	He became headmaster of Horace Mann in 1970. During a period of  
rapid change, he eliminated the traditional dress code of jacket 
and tie, oversaw the prep school's merger with Barnard School in 
1973 and pushed for the admission of girls, which began in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	He was promoted to president in 1981, putting him in charge of  
Horace Mann's four campuses in New York and Connecticut. During his 
tenure, the school's enrollment increased from 600 to 1,640, its 
staff more than doubled from 125 to 300 and its annual budget grew 
from $1 million to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark also taught courses on government and was Horace Mann's  
baseball coach from 1975-91. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by two brothers.

<HEADLINE> New Study on Drug Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The drug education program D.A.R.E.,  
widely used at schools across the country, has little effect on 
whether children use drugs, alcohol or cigarettes, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald R. Lynam and other researchers at the University of  
Kentucky tracked more than 1,000 students in Fayette County who 
participated in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program in the 
sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were re-evaluated at age 20, 10 years after their  
involvement with the program. 
</P>
<P>
	D.A.R.E. resulted in some initial improvements in the students'  
attitudes about drug use, the researchers said. But those changes 
failed to last, and they did not influence the decisions the 
students made. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Inglewood, Calif.-based DARE America for comment Monday  
were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynam said the results of the study, published in the August  
issue of the American Psychological Association's Journal of 
Consulting and Clinical Psychology, replicate the findings of 
several other recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's surprising how widespread D.A.R.E. is given the  
lack of hard data suggesting it is effective,'' said Lynam, who 
noted that the study was conducted on the earliest version of 
D.A.R.E. and modifications have been made to the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	D.A.R.E. was started in 1983 in Los Angeles. An officer teaches  
17 lessons in the classroom, usually for an hour a week. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of U.S. school districts have the programs. But  
in the last few years, cities across the country, including 
Seattle, Houston, Omaha, Neb., and Rochester, N.Y., have dropped 
D.A.R.E. in the wake of critical studies. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason D.A.R.E. might not be effective, Lynam said, is that  
it emphasizes the role of peer pressure in drug use. He said many 
youths might be motivated by other factors, such as curiosity or 
thrill-seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	And D.A.R.E. may teach children drug resistance skills years  
before they need them, he said. While the program was administered 
in the sixth grade, most drug use begins in high school.

	GAISAL, India (AP) -- At least 257 bodies have been removed from  
the mangled wreckage of two trains that collided yesterday in a 
remote section of northeast India. About 50 more people were 
thought to be inside three smashed train cars, but authorities 
feared that none could have survived. Railway officials said one of 
the trains was on the wrong track for unknown reasons. Railway 
Minister Nitish Kumar said today the accident was caused by

arraigned tomorrow at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, the U.N. 
court announced today. Radomir Kovac, 38, was arrested yesterday by 
NATO troops serving in the international Stabilization Force in 
Bosnia and flown to the tribunal's detention unit in a suburb of 
The Hague. Kovac faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if 
convicted of either charge. He is one of eight Serbs accused of

customers by not disclosing the full terms and costs of their 
trips. The Transportation Department is taking action against two 
other operators. Between July of 1998 and 1999, the FTC received 
nearly 2,500 travel-related complaints worth more than $610,000 in 
alleged consumer losses. Of those complaints, nearly a third were 
against companies based in Florida. The American Society of Travel 
Agents, for instance, estimates that $8 billion to $10 billion is 
lost a year because of travel scams.

	`Good' Cholesterol Gene Discovered  
</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Researchers have identified a gene that  
regulates the level of so-called good cholesterol in the body. 
Flaws in the gene, known as ABC1, prevent the production of a 
protein that the body needs to rinse excess bad cholesterol and 
other fats out of cells and the bloodstream. The gene was 
discovered by researchers looking for the cause of Tangier disease, 
an extremely rare inherited illness in which the body produces 
virtually none of the good cholesterol, HDL. Without it, the level 
of the bad cholesterol, LDL, and other fats that contribute to 
heart attacks and clogged arteries rise unchecked.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Up 3.17 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today after a strong  
opening as interest rate concerns kept investors on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
just 3.17 at 10,649.13, dropping back from an earlier gain of more 
than 60 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 7.58 at 1,320.47, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 34.98 at 2,588.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise rates later this  
month in an effort to cool off the economy held most stocks back. 
The Conference Board provided the latest hint that the nation's 
unbridled economic growth is continuing, announcing that its index 
of leading indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its May 
increase. The index is used to forecast economic trends for the 
coming three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates has rattled stocks and bonds in the  
past week, dragging stock indexes well below the record highs of 
mid-July. Today, bond prices slipped once more, sending the yield 
on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.13 percent, up from 6.12 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks are attempting to do battle within an investment  
climate that is not reacting favorably to bonds and is showing no 
concrete or consistent means of leadership,'' said Brian G. Belski, 
chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	A report that ExciteAtHome may be acquired by Yahoo! for a price  
greater than ExciteAtHome's $17 billion market value stimulated 
some early buying in Internet and telecommunications companies. 
Shares of ExciteAtHome slipped back, however, when the company's 
president denied the rumors, falling 5/8 to 42 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse  
First Boston, said in a report that online brokerages may 
experience their first-ever decline in trading volume in the third 
quarter. Shares of ETrade fell 4 to 25, and Charles Schwab fell 4 
1/16 to 38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 328.53 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.47 at 621.87, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.48 at 784.16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 5.21 at  
437.42.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- The United States defeated Saudi  
Arabia 2-0 Tuesday to take third place in soccer's Confederations 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory capped a strong performance in the tournament by the  
U.S. team, which defeated Germany 2-0 and came close to tying 
Brazil -- the favorite against Mexico in Wednesday's finals -- in a 
1-0 match. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia's Abdullah Bin Shehan knocked a pass into the U.S.  
goal with his arm at the 23-minute mark, and officials quickly 
disallowed the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult match,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena said.  
``Saudi Arabia was a very tough adversary. It was a hard-fought 
match and we are pleased with the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. opened the scoring at 26 minutes on a break by forward  
Paul Bravo, who beat defensemen and Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Al 
Deayea to slice a clean shot into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. played most of the second period down one player, after  
Matt McKeon was ejected at the 64-minute mark on penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian McBride headed a pass into the Saudi goal in the 79th  
minute mark to seal the U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. squad allowed the Saudi's very few shots and kept the  
quicker Saudi forwards from penetrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy because this tournament is worth a lot, since  
it's our first semifinal finish in an international cup,'' Saudi 
coach Milan Macala said.

<HEADLINE> Cards OF Bragg Is on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Darren Bragg was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday with a twisted right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known whether the injury, which occurred Monday night  
when Bragg tried to avoid a collision with J.D. Drew, will require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's a problem there, and they're discussing the  
next move,'' manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals called up utility player Craig Paquette, acquired  
on the trade deadline from the New York Mets, from Triple-A 
Memphis. Paquette played for La Russa in Oakland from 1993-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of defensive ability and he's got a nice  
swing,'' La Russa said. ``If he connects, he's got extra-base 
pop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette was overjoyed about the trade, which sent Shawon  
Dunston to the Mets. He said he was New York's insurance policy in 
case third baseman Robin Ventura or first baseman John Olerud got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at their careers, how many things have happened to  
them?'' Paquette said. ``Ventura's been on the DL once and Olerud's 
never been on the DL, so there wasn't much opportunity there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette, who can play first, third and the outfield, had been  
playing for the U.S. team in the Pan American Games. He has a 
career .232 average in six major league seasons with 55 homers and 
195 RBIs in 426 games, and was batting .272 with 15 homers and 54 
RBIs in 70 games for Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Another injured Cardinals player, outfielder Eric Davis,  
attempted to swing off a tee after taking two days off with 
soreness. Davis has been on the disabled list since June 30 with a 
partially torn rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured making a diving catch to help save teammate Jose  
Jimenez's no-hitter June 25. Davis took about 20 swings on 
consecutive days Friday and Saturday then had to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get frustrated,'' Davis said. ``I'm disappointed.''  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, batting .257 with five homer and 30 RBIs in 58 games,  
expects to make a decision on the rest of the season soon. 
Rehabbing hasn't been very effective thus far. Two-and-a-half weeks 
ago, he had zero range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either we're going to have to get it taken care of or rehab it  
and just decide to play,'' Davis said. ``I haven't given up on this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play, I need to play, this team needs me to play.  
It's what I came here for.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Wants $11 Million Tax Refund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- City schools would be hit hard if IBM  
wins a lawsuit that could mean a property tax refund of as much as 
$11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based electronics giant claims Santa Clara County  
over-assessed three of the company's properties in San Jose by more 
than $1 billion between 1990 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CEO of IBM ... has given a lot of speeches about the poor  
state of public education, but through a technicality, IBM is now 
attempting to get a tax refund that would directly impact in a big 
way schools,'' county tax assessor Larry Stone said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commitment to education is indisputable,'' countered IBM  
spokesman Kevin McKee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, filed Friday in Santa Clara County Superior  
Court, the company argues the county overvalued its main San Jose 
campus and two other locations during the early-'90s recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The county said IBM isn't entitled to money back because it  
didn't appeal the assessment within the legal time limit -- between 
July 2 and Sept. 15 of the year in question. IBM did not ask for a 
specific dollar amount to be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone also said the county was worried that if IBM prevails,  
other companies will file similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have to be time frames and limits,'' said Stone, who  
estimated the impact at $11 million based on similar cases. ``We 
can't leave ourselves open forever for tax refunds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM asked for a reassessment of its land holdings after a recent  
query from county auditors about the company's estimate of the 
value of equipment and non-real estate assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The county turned the company down, prompting the suit, in which  
IBM asks that the value of the property for the years at issue be 
cut from about $2.8 billion to about $1.7 billion, on which it paid 
approximately $28 million in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools, which get about 65 percent of local property taxes,  
would be most seriously impacted, and two districts -- the 
12,000-student Oak Grove School District and the 23,000-student 
East Side Union High School District -- would take the hardest hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy Childers, deputy superintendent of the Oak Grove district,  
is worried that a $1 billion loss in local property valuations 
could force small taxpayers to carry more of the cost of a 
modernization program at his district in south San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned,'' Childers said, pointing out that IBM  
is one of the companies complaining about education in California 
at the same time it's seeking the refund. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't have it both ways,'' Stone said. ``This really is a  
double standard.''

<HEADLINE> Gore's Chief of Staff Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's chief of staff has  
resigned to pursue a more lucrative career with a private law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest personnel change under campaign chairman Tony  
Coelho, chief of staff Ron Klain will be replaced by Gore's chief 
White House counsel and fellow Tennessean, Charles Burson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always valued and will continue to value Ron's  
intelligence, loyalty and acumen,'' Gore said Monday in a 
statement. ``I'm not letting him go completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burson is a former Tennessee attorney general. Klain has  
accepted a partnership in the Washington office of the Los 
Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny &AMP; Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Klain allies said Monday that the friction between him and  
Coelho when the former congressman first took over Gore's 
presidential campaign in May had been smoothed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got several offers. He can't afford to turn it down,''  
Coelho said. ``He and I, over the last eight weeks, developed a 
close relationship. I asked him to stay but I understand'' his 
decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	From his law office, Klain will serve as ``an uncompensated  
senior strategist'' and participate in regular campaign strategy 
meetings and ``take on special assignments'' from Coelho, Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As chief of staff, Burson will oversee the dozens of personnel  
who work at the White House for the office of the vice president, 
which encompasses Tipper Gore's staff as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have known Charles and his family for more than 30 years. My  
parents were friends with his parents,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Alaskans Lose Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE (AP) -- Internet Alaska customers statewide lost access  
to the Internet for up to six hours Monday when an electrical spike 
shut down equipment in Anchorage, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem occurred at Anchorage Telephone Utility's north wire  
center, where Internet Alaska leases space. A momentary loss of 
electricity caused a power spike at the wire center and an ATU 
backup battery burst under the sudden load, said Mike Method, ATU's 
account manager for Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had smoke and sizzle for about a second, which is all it  
takes to lose equipment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet Alaska spokeswoman Holly Lind said the power loss  
scrambled data. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like turning your computer off and not saving anything,''  
she said. The service shut down at 1:50 p.m. and was restored by 
about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Lind declined to say how many customers lost service, but the  
company's entire statewide system was affected.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Honors JFK Jr. in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Deep in the Jerusalem hills, trees were planted  
Tuesday in memory of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his 
sister-in-law in a forest named for his father. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli tradition of honoring someone's memory by  
planting a tree, three oak saplings were placed in the rocky soil 
next to a white stone marker with the names of Kennedy, his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	The three died when Kennedy's single-engine plane crashed off  
Martha's Vineyard on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees were planted by visiting Americans and Jewish National  
Fund officials on a sloping hillside next to a memorial for 
President Kennedy, designed as a tree stump to symbolize a life cut 
down before its time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, JFK Jr., his wife and sister-in-law were also  
remembered in a memorial Mass on Tuesday attended by the city's 
mayor, Francesco Rutelli, and U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foglietta. 
About 20 people attended the service in Santa Susanna, a Roman 
Catholic church frequented by Americans in the city.

<HEADLINE> Boilermakers Mourn Tiffany Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue's 1999 national championship women's basketball team was  
a family. Tiffany Young's death hit the members hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very tight Purdue family, and this is a devastating  
loss,'' said her former coach Carolyn Peck, now with the WNBA's 
Orlando Miracle. ``Tiffany's smile could brighten up a room and she 
will be physically missed, but she will always be a part of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers program was reeling Monday as news spread of  
Young's death in a traffic accident over the weekend when the car 
she was in was struck by a drunk driver. The 5-foot-11 guard played 
a reserve role on Purdue's national championship team, and players 
and coaches remembered her as a special presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany was an extremely integral member of our team and will  
be dearly missed,'' player Katie Douglas said. ``She will be missed 
as a teammate, but more so as a friend who was always there to give 
love and support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young started all 33 of Purdue's games during her sophomore  
season, but was relegated to reserve duty last year with the 
emergence of Douglas in a three-guard lineup that included 
Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs. The senior averaged 3.3 
points and 1.5 rebounds in her career with the Boilermakers, 
including 2.1 points last season, when she played sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
	During the national championship game, Young held hands with  
White-McCarty on the Purdue bench after she sprained her ankle and 
missed the last four minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed when I heard the tragic news of Tiffany's  
death, and I am still at a loss for words to describe how I feel 
about her being gone,'' said White-McCarty, now with the WNBA's 
Charlotte Sting. ``She was such a good person, with nothing but 
love in her heart for everybody, and she cannot be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young died Saturday night after visiting the family of her  
boyfriend, Neil Sinclair, in Gary, Ind. Sinclair, who was driving, 
was in the intensive care unit at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The other driver, Arnold Eaton, 33, of Great Lakes, Ill., had a  
blood-alcohol content of 0.30 percent and sustained minor injuries 
in the crash, police said. He was being held on a $10,000 bond by 
the Lake County Sheriff's Department on a charge of operating while 
intoxicated resulting in death. His two passengers were 
hospitalized in stable condition with numerous broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is to be buried Thursday in her hometown of Hillsboro,  
Ala., and Purdue spokeswoman Kathleen Offer said the school was 
working on plans for a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Purdue family has lost a child, but Tiffany will always  
remain in our hearts. We will carry her love for each of us, and 
she will be our guardian angel into the future,'' assistant coach 
Kerry Cremeans said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Endorses Democrat Farm Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore raised the political  
stakes over emergency farm aid today by endorsing a $11 billion 
assistance package proposed by Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's move, which could help his presidential prospects in  
Iowa, rankled Republicans, who fear getting into a bidding war with 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers out there are really hurting badly. ... Many are now  
saying this could turn out to be the worst crisis our farmers have 
ever experienced,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore was speaking in the Capitol, Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman declined to tell the Senate Agriculture Committee how much 
help he thought farmers needed. He said he saw good things in both 
the Democratic proposal and a GOP plan that would cost $4 billion 
less. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be in a position of saying you have to spend  
'x' dollars or 'y' dollars,'' Glickman said. Asked whether the 
president would veto the GOP plan, he said, ``I'm not looking for a 
fight, if that's your bottom-line question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Gore's endorsement of the Democratic proposal, the  
committee's chairman, Sen. Dick Lugar, told Glickman, ``I'm not 
clear where the locus of authority is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Republicans proposed a $4 billion aid package only to  
have it vetoed by President Clinton. In the end, Congress approved 
$6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said Monday the GOP package would  
``provide a wide range of benefits to producers who are eligible 
for ... assistance because of economic disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar, R-Ind., suggested that $2 billion to $3 billion in aid  
may be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	But farm groups say that far more than that will be needed to  
prevent thousands of producers from going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats proposed $10.8 billion in aid Monday, while  
Republicans countered with a $6.7 billion plan. The money would be 
added to an annual spending bill for the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silently and quietly, American farmers and ranchers are losing  
their businesses. They are at the end of their rope,'' said Sen. 
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote was expected after separate meetings of  
Democratic and GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has kept commodity prices low for the  
second year in a row, and USDA projects that net farm income will 
dip to $43.8 billion this year, about 4 percent off the average for 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan includes nearly $6 billion in extra crop  
subsidies, $2.3 billion in disaster aid, and $1.4 billion in 
emergency trade provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the GOP package would go toward doubling the annual  
``market transition'' payments that farmers receive from the 
government under the 1996 farm bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Republicans even offered a proposal of their own this  
week was a recognition of how potent a political issue the farm 
economy has become. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders had argued that it was too early to know how  
much help farmers will need this fall and they had pressed the 
Clinton administration without success to offer its own proposal. 
The emergency label on the extra aid lets Congress ignore required 
spending limits and pay for items with the anticipated federal 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But several farm-state GOP senators have argued that it was  
important for the Senate to take some action before lawmakers start 
their long summer recess next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders put off until Wednesday a debate over the way the  
government regulates dairy prices. A proposal by New England 
lawmakers would bar USDA from going forward with an overhaul of the 
pricing system and also allow their states to continue fixing milk 
prices for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from the upper Midwest have threatened to filibuster  
the spending bill over the issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hoops Catch on in Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Halfway through the basketball  
competition in the Pan-American Games, the United States teams are 
starting to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
	They're getting used to the nuances of the international game  
and the way it's officiated. They're adjusting to life in the 
athletes village. And they've learned that while they may not be 
reviled, they aren't the fan favorites, either. 
</P>
<P>
	That became clear when the men beat Brazil 73-71. As Brazil  
mounted a late comeback, the fans who had stayed after Canada's 
game took up the Brazilians' cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's us against the world. Nobody is rooting for us,'' forward  
Travis Williams said. ``The fans want us to autograph their 
pennants and flags and programs, but once the game starts, they're 
against us. They might cheer a dunk, but that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men, an all-star team from the Continental Basketball  
Association, are 2-0 and should beat the Dominican Republic (1-1) 
in the final round of pool play on Wednesday. That would clinch 
first place for the Americans in their pool. The top two advance to 
the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	The women (2-2), who play Canada in their last preliminary game  
on Wednesday, have clinched a berth in the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
	A 95-64 loss to Cuba on Saturday was the worst ever by an  
American women's team in Pan Am play, but the Americans turned it 
around in the last two games and are coming off the best effort so 
far, a 77-72 loss to unbeaten Brazil in which they led by 16 points 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us four games to finally show what kind of team we  
are,'' guard Edwina Brown said. ``The previous games, we were 
playing like the other team. We were trying to beat them at their 
game instead of playing our own game. So I think we've learned to 
go out and play our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That game is running, and the Americans, a young team with  
little international experience, had their fast break operating at 
peak efficiency until the Brazilians slowed them with a zone 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased with our progression,'' said Fortner, whose team  
has averaged 82 points in the last two games after averaging 63.5 
in the first two. ``I think this team played (Brazil) like they're 
capable of playing. That was a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and Cuba will finish 1-2 in the preliminary rounds, so  
the United States would have to beat at least one and probably both 
to win the gold medal. Fortner would like to have that chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we played Cuba again, we would play them better,'' she  
said. ``At least we would have that experience under our belt and I 
don't think we'd let that happen to us again. If we played Brazil 
again, I think we would feel like we could beat them. I think it 
would be a very good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men held on against Brazil after two of their best inside  
players, Mikki Moore and Byron Houston, fouled out. Players go out 
with five fouls in international play. They're given six in the 
CBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games are a good adjustment for our guys to learn to  
play with two fouls,'' said U.S. coach Mo McHone, who coaches the 
CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce. ``When you foul out with five, that one 
foul is a huge difference. We as coaches have got to adjust to that 
in our substituting. We've got to get back to that international 
mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHone said his players also must understand that these games  
are going to be called differently than American pro games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing for us is we have to get used to playing  
against those European patterns. Our players just aren't used to 
all those moving screens,'' McHone said. ``You can't do that in the 
CBA. But our guys are making the adjustment. They're doing a nice 
job.''

<HEADLINE> McNown Joins Bears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- With the defense digging in along the  
goal line, Cade McNown handed the ball to Aaron Stecker and watched 
him go, sweeping left around the pile of players and into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	As Stecker scored, McNown whooped and threw up his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	OK, so it's not the Super Bowl. It's not even a real game. But  
after signing his contract 11 days into camp and somewhat of an 
adventurous trip here -- don't ask about the toll booth -- McNown 
couldn't help being a little excited about Tuesday's practice, his 
first with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking in, I just felt really good about getting together  
with my teammates and finally seeing them. I don't know if they 
could have cared less to see me, but I really am excited about 
this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first practice went pretty well,'' he said. ``It's good to  
get out there, get in pads and get things running. Get the mind 
going again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, ended his holdout Monday with a  
contract that could pay him up to $22 million over five years. The 
initial deal is for seven years and $15 million, but the last two 
years are voidable and he can make an additional $7 million in 
performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived late Monday after a solo drive from Chicago that  
included several wrong turns and a slight mishap when he discovered 
he didn't have any change for a toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's from Los Angeles. I figured he'd find his way up to  
Platteville,'' coach Dick Jauron said, smiling. ``It's good to have 
him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though McNown missed the nastiest part of training camp, when  
temperatures climbed into the high 90s and the humidity made it 
feel like it was over 100 degrees, his teammates aren't holding 
anything against the rookie. Sure, he's already been warned he'll 
have to sing at dinner some night -- yes, he does know the UCLA 
fight song -- but that's the roughest treatment he'll get. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates were quick to welcome him Tuesday and congratulate  
him. As he left the field after his first practice, he walked with 
Shane Matthews, whose time as the Bears' No. 1 quarterback is now 
almost done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I'm trying to come out here and prove something  
right away,'' McNown said. ``I just need to learn, and everybody 
knows that. I think most of these guys are concerned with bettering 
themselves. They're not thinking about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown can take some of the credit for his warm-and-fuzzy  
welcome. When Curtis Enis arrived at camp last year after his 
holdout, he was out of shape and way behind, and it took weeks for 
him to learn the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, on the other hand, hired a personal trainer and worked  
out twice a day. He studied his playbook, memorizing what of the 
offense he learned during minicamps. By the time he took the field 
Tuesday morning, he looked like he'd been doing this for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a couple of dropped balls, but his throws looked  
sharper and harder than the other three quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course he's not going to be as sharp as everyone wants him  
to be, but he had a couple of passes where he looked sharp,'' 
receiver Curtis Conway said. ``It's going to take some time, but I 
don't think it's going to be a situation where he's not going to 
catch on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks coach John Shoop agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He already knows where the guys are going to be, what the  
routes are. He understands those things,'' Shoop said. ``The 
hardest thing is going to be identifying the different defenses and 
how those routes might adjust or his reads might adjust to those 
defenses. ... He'll do great with those, he really will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown is the first to admit he's got a lot to learn, and Jauron  
said the rookie probably won't play in Saturday's exhibition game 
against the Indianapolis Colts. But there are still more than five 
weeks until the season opens, and that's a lot of time for McNown 
to move into the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	This is, after all, the guy who leads the Pac-10 in total  
offense (11,285 yards), who set UCLA records with 10 300-yard 
passing games and 68 career passing touchdowns and led the Bruins 
on a 20-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that the draft does is, it gives you a foot in  
the door. It's what you do once you're inside that counts,'' he 
said. ``The college part of my life is over. Most of the people in 
Chicago, most of the people around the country, haven't seen me 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking to make an impact with the Bears, and I'm starting  
now.''

<HEADLINE> Adult Film Stars Sue Charlie Sheen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two adult film stars have filed a lawsuit  
against Charlie Sheen and his bodyguard for an alleged assault at 
the movie star's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin Siemen, whose stage name is Charlisse L'Amour, and  
Christina Lee Stramaglia, who performs as Teri Star, contend they 
were roughed up by Curtis Hunt on July 26 after they arrived at the 
door of Sheen's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sieman alleges that she was summoned to the home by Sheen,  
but when she and Miss Stramaglia arrived, there was no response. 
</P>
<P>
	She then hopped over the fence and was punched in the face by  
Hunt, the lawsuit alleges. Miss Stramaglia said she was also 
assaulted by Hunt after hopping the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor's attorney, Zia Modabber, called the lawsuit  
``completely frivolous'' on Tuesday. Modabber said they filed the 
suit Friday after Sheen obtained a restraining order against them 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Sheen and Mr. Hunt strongly deny these allegations and  
plan to vigorously defend themselves in court,'' Modabber said.

<HEADLINE> FTC Cites Five Travel Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state authorities announced  
actions against 25 travel companies Tuesday accused of luring 
consumers with flashy vacation offers and failing to disclose the 
full terms and costs of their trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission filed suit against five businesses  
asking that they stop their deceptive practices and seeking refunds 
for bilked consumers. Two other restitution orders have been filed 
on behalf of the Transportation Department, and an additional 20 
companies face charges by state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Between July of 1998 and 1999, the FTC received nearly 2,500  
travel-related complaints worth more than $610,000 in alleged 
consumer losses. Of those complaints, nearly a third were against 
companies based in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem may be much more pervasive. The American Society  
of Travel Agents, for instance, estimates that $8 billion to $10 
billion is lost a year because of travel scams. 
</P>
<P>
	While travel scams are always a problem, ``they proliferate when  
demand is high for certain types of travel,'' says Dina Long, 
spokeswoman for the society. 
</P>
<P>
	At this time of year, consumers receive faxes touting special,  
cheap cruise tickets even when the ship line does not give 
discounts, Long says. 
</P>
<P>
	The approaching millennium celebration already is proving a gold  
mine for opportunists to exploit travelers who are willing to pay 
higher than premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are coming out of the woodwork with offers that are too  
good to be true,'' Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five companies targeted by the FTC are First Impressions  
Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; All Around Travel Club Inc. of 
Lauderdale Lakes, Fla.; ASQ Inc. of Las Vegas; Cerkvenik-Anderson 
Travel of Phoenix; and American International Travel Services Inc. 
of Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerkvenik-Anderson's general counsel, Brian Burt, denied the  
charges and said the commission was ``painting with a broad brush'' 
in including the business in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left with other companies were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Kuhaupt of Mesquite, Texas, expected a ``nice  
adventure'' after reviewing the glitzy promotional videos and 
brochures provided by American International Travel Service for her 
week-long Caribbean vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she got hassled for refusing to attend a promotional  
meeting for time-share condos, was told she would have to pay extra 
for a cabin aboard her ``cruise'' ship to the Bahamas and 
discovered her hotel food and drink vouchers were only valid at 
certain times of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told a little bit of truth and covered up the rest to  
make it look like something it was not,'' said Kuhaupt. 
</P>
<P>
	In one typical travel scam, consumers receive a fancy-looking  
travel certificate in the mail claiming that they have won a free 
hotel stay. When travelers call to claim their prize, they may have 
to pay the price of a plane ticket at a huge markup. A similar scam 
involves trips in which consumers must tour a time-share condo 
while on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Internet sites and print advertisements urge consumers to  
become a travel agent overnight, so they can reap the benefits of 
discounted industry fares. The problem is that the travel agent 
credentials -- which can cost as much as $495 -- are fake and won't 
be recognized by companies. Consumers who use them also are 
committing fraud.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Charles Oakley got the Hollywood treatment from the Los Angeles  
Lakers on Tuesday, lunch with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and 
a tour of the new arena from Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Mercer was shipped from Boston to Denver, Bo Outlaw  
re-signed with Orlando and Derek Fisher landed a seven-year 
contract from the Lakers, who are trying to convince Oakley to play 
power forward for them for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is demanding $8.5 million annually for three years from  
the Toronto Raptors, who have offered $5.5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what people in Toronto are saying, the Raptors  
haven't increased their offer,'' said Oakley's agent, Billy 
Diamond, who accompanied the veteran power forward during his 
afternoon of courtship with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer was traded from the Celtics to the Nuggets in a  
six-player deal that also sent Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius 
to Denver for Danny Fortson, Eric Washington, Eric Williams and a 
first-round draft choice in one of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a 6-foot-7 forward who ranked fourth in the NBA in  
rebounding last season, is going into the final season of his 
three-year rookie contract -- just like Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston did not want to meet Mercer's asking price, which was  
believed to be in excess of $50 million for a six-year extension. 
Mercer can be a free agent next year, and indicated he wouldn't 
re-sign with Boston if he wasn't given an extension this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' coach Rick Pitino  
said. ``I could not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer 
wanted as a basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outlaw, Orlando's wiry 6-foot-8 forward, re-signed with the  
Magic for one year and $2 million. He said he turned down more 
lucrative offers elsewhere to remain in Orlando. Outlaw will have 
full Larry Bird rights next summer, meaning the Magic will be able 
to exceed the salary cap to re-sign him again. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who split time with Derek Harper at point guard last  
season for the Lakers, signed a seven-year contract worth about $24 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacramento Kings re-signed guard Jon Barry and forward Scot  
Pollard. They also acquired guard Nick Anderson from Orlando for 
guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad and a future first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry got a three-year contract and Pollard signed for two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is being courted by several teams seeking to add an  
experienced big body along the front line. He has been in Los 
Angeles since last weekend, attending Magic Johnson's charity game, 
playing golf with Lakers representatives an finally going through 
the team's full court press Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	So eager are the Lakers to convince Oakley to sign that O'Neal  
and Bryant, not the best of friends during their three seasons 
together in Los Angeles, agreed to have lunch together with Oakley 
and Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley later joined West and general manager Mitch Kupchak for a  
tour of the team's new practice facility and the Staples center, 
which will replace the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, who plays center and power forward, averaged 11.0  
points and 11.6 rebounds per game last year. His playing time 
increased considerably after rookie Raef LaFrentz went down early 
in the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, the sixth pick overall in the 1997 draft, averaged 17  
points per game last season with 2.5 assists and 3.8 rebounds. The 
6-foot-7, 210-pound Mercer was an NBA All-Rookie Team selection in 
1997-98 when he averaged 15.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal sends Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. Williams averaged 15 points per game 
for the Celtics in 1996-1997. Last year in Denver, Williams 
averaged 7.3 points and 2.1 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams' contract 
this year, the maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics also announced the signing of free agent guard Wayne  
Turner, a Boston native who played for Kentucky, as a third guard 
for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets waived center Rony Seikaly, who played just 18 games  
over 1 1/2 with New Jersey because of injuries. New Jersey still owes 
Seikaly $4.5 million for the final season of his contract. The 
34-year-old was hampered by ankle and foot injuries during the 1999 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Isiah Thomas agreed to buy a majority stake of the Continental  
Basketball Association for about $10 million. Thomas, a 12-time 
All-Star and former part-owner and general manager of the Toronto 
Raptors, wants to reorganize the nine separately owned teams into a 
single entity with players signing contracts with the league, not 
the individual teams. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The players' union refused to comment to a report in the  
Charlotte Observer than director Billy Hunter is being given a 
six-year, $12 million contract. Hunter made less than $1 million a 
year while negotiating the collective bargaining agreement.

<HEADLINE> Start Date for Eagles' McNabb Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- As Troy Vincent so aptly put it,  
Philadelphia Eagles camp has been mostly about one person so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan, Donovan, Donovan, Donovan, Donovan,'' Vincent said  
when asked one of the dozens of questions posed about Donovan 
McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that McNabb finally is signed and in camp, the most obvious  
question is: When will he start? 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of many important questions facing the Eagles,  
trying to climb from beneath the wreckage of last year's 3-13 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new coach Andy Reid named Doug Pederson the starter  
long ago, some estimates have McNabb, the second overall pick in 
the draft, winning the job as early as Week 4. As the projection 
goes, the Eagles figure to be 0-3 by then and facing the New York 
Giants on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Why then? Well, the Cowboys visit Philadelphia the following  
week. After what happened on Monday Night Football against Dallas 
last year -- a 34-0 national embarrassment -- that might be too much 
of a pressure-cooker to throw McNabb into for his first start. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb clearly has the strongest arm and the most potential of  
the four quarterbacks in camp. Though the Eagles could do worse -- 
and have -- than begin the season with McNabb as the starter, it is 
a delicate topic given the coach's commitment to Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even going to touch that one,'' receiver Charles  
Johnson said. ``Everyone knows the deal, even Donovan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listing the rest of the questions would give McNabb's 32-page  
contract a serious challenge for longest document of training camp. 
Here are just a few: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Is Reid the right coach?  
</P>
<P>
	The answer may not be known for a couple of years, and the  
Eagles' record this season shouldn't entirely be held against him. 
There are simply too many players still around from last year's 
deplorable team. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reid has made a definite impression on the players and those  
following the team. He is incredibly organized, energetic and 
demanding. He pushed the team through grueling two-a-days last week 
in the middle of a relentless heat wave. He takes such an active 
role during practices that he already is drawing comparisons to 
Dick Vermeil. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Eagles are a bad team again, it won't be for lack of  
trying -- or preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I found out in those first six practices is,'' Reid  
said, ``that's a tough group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Who's going to catch the ball?  
</P>
<P>
	This is a major concern for the Eagles, who are perhaps  
instituting the most aggressive passing offense ever seen in 
Philadelphia. As Johnson puts it, ``This offense isn't going to go 
anywhere unless we catch the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are counting on Johnson, a secondary receiver in  
Pittsburgh last season, to step into the No. 1 role. Torrance Small 
will be asked to expand on the big-play potential he showed in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, Johnson brings a reputation for dropping balls  
with him from Pittsburgh, and he's exhibited that tendency in 
practice so far. If too many passes are dropped, the Eagles' best 
offseason move may end up being the signing of punter Sean Landeta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Who will call the plays?  
</P>
<P>
	Reid says he will call offensive plays instead of offensive  
coordinator Rod Dowhower, a respected, experienced assistant. 
Either way, it has to be an improvement over last year, when 
play-calling duties were stripped from offensive coordinator Dana 
Bible and given to assistant Bill Musgrave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles had the worst offense in the NFL last season,  
prompting this sign to be displayed at Veterans Stadium: ``We may 
have a Bible, but we don't have a prayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- If Jeremiah Trotter is good enough to start at middle  
linebacker, why did the Eagles draft Barry Gardner? 
</P>
<P>
	Good question, although Gardner has looked sensational in  
practice the past few days. But Trotter, who never won the starting 
job under Ray Rhodes, has made so much progress that Reid may have 
to start both of them -- perhaps moving Trotter to outsider 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	If they'd known that, the Eagles might have filled a need at  
wide receiver with their second-round pick instead of taking 
Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What will their record be?  
</P>
<P>
	All the ingredients are in place for a new beginning. The Eagles  
have a new coach, a new philosophy, a franchise quarterback and 
reason for optimism. They also have the luxury of a last-place 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, many believe they still have last-place talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play every game as hard as we can, we're going  
to be competitive and we plan to win,'' said Tom Modrak, director 
of football operations. ``There isn't another team in the league 
that doesn't have the same plan.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Comment on Boyd's Billboard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- The billboard along westbound  
Interstate 94 in this Macomb County community features the Detroit 
Lions logo, the surly visage of linebacker Stephen Boyd and the 
caption, ``I stayed here to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In your face, ex-Lion Barry Sanders?  
</P>
<P>
	Not at all, Lions marketing director Steve Harms said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was not in response to Barry's leaving at all,'' he said.  
``In the aftermath of Barry's retirement, though, I could see some 
people asking about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The billboards featuring Boyd, quarterback Charlie Batch, wide  
receiver Herman Moore and defensive end Robert Porcher, went up 
about a month ago in the Detroit area, Harms said. 
</P>

	Boyd's statement reflects his decision to stay with Detroit

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Recalls Doll Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 71,000 dolls that come with bathtub  
accessories were recalled today by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission because the toys pose a choking risk to young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Bathtub Baby -- a vinyl doll that comes with a blue plastic  
bathtub, a fish-shaped strainer and a small pink ball -- was sold at 
Toys R Us stores from October 1998 until last month. After 
inspecting the toy, the commission determined the ball was too 
small for children under 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners should immediately return the doll set for a refund. Toys  
R Us sold Bathtub Baby for about $2.

<HEADLINE> TV Helicopter Spots Women Adrift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A mother and daughter adrift overnight were plucked  
from the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday morning after they were spotted 
by the crew of a news helicopter, and said they were grateful to be 
alive despite jellyfish stings and hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Goodwyn, 50, and Vicky Goodwyn, 32, were still wearing  
their orange life jackets and crying with relief during their 
rescue, which was aired live on a midday Miami news show. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been floating in relatively calm waters for almost 20  
hours, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Their 15-foot pleasure 
boat took on water Monday at about 3:30 p.m. then sank off Elliott 
Key, about 20 miles southeast of Miami in or near Biscayne National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boat just took on a wave real quick,'' Anna Goodwyn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Hernandez, 32, had been on the boat with his girlfriend  
and her mother, but left them in a bid to swim the 11 miles back to 
shore. He was rescued by a passing boater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very worried to leave them alone,'' Hernandez said.  
``I'm lucky they saved me, I really am lucky. Thank God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first the three tied themselves together, and Hernandez later  
tried to make it to shore to get help. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother and daughter were spotted Tuesday by a news  
helicopter from WTVJ-TV, which notified the Coast Guard. They were 
taken from the water by a park ranger in a patrol boat called in by 
the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were spotted at about 11 a.m. and the station  
broadcast live shots of the women bobbing in the water, one crying 
with relief and waving at the helicopter, the other appearing weak 
and barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
	They apparently suffered from hypothermia, exposure and  
jellyfish stings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The waves come into your mouth so strong that you can't  
breathe,'' Anna Goodwyn said as she was brought ashore and 
airlifted to Mercy Hospital. Her daughter and Hernandez were taken 
to the bayside hospital by a park patrol boat. 
</P>
<P>
	All three were later listed as stable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never go back out there again, ever,'' Vicky Goodwyn  
said.

<HEADLINE> 9 States Get $55M for Power Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton offered $55 million Tuesday to  
help low-income people in nine states pay their electricity bills 
or buy cooling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the money would help encourage older people to  
run air conditioners during the withering heat wave without fear of 
high utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by Mayor Richard Daley, the president greeted workers  
from the Chicago Housing Authority and other municipal agencies, 
many of whom went door-to-door in the city's high-rise apartment 
buildings to check on elderly people and get them to cooling 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here mostly to just say thank you,'' Clinton told about  
200 people gathered in a gymnasium at a local park. ``You've done a 
great job, and I am profoundly grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois had the highest number of heat-related deaths, with  
officials reporting 99 deaths, up from 80 on Sunday. Missouri 
reported 44 deaths. Both states received a share of the money 
Clinton announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it will be enough,'' Clinton said. ``We probably  
haven't seen the last of the heat for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he knew many victims of the ``blast-furnace heat'' were  
older people who sat at home with their fans or air conditioners 
off, worried that they couldn't pay their electric bills with their 
fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the elderly to take advantage of the money being  
offered under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, either 
by seeking help with their utility bills or accepting free fans and 
window-unit air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Send for something to keep you alive,'' Clinton said. ``People  
should never have to worry in this country about risking their 
lives because they can't pay their power bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the LIHEAP grants Clinton announced Tuesday, Illinois will  
get $15.9 million, Kentucky $7.7 million, Missouri $7.6 million, 
Indiana $7.1 million, Wisconsin $4.4 million, Iowa $3.4 million, 
Kansas $3.3 million, Minnesota $3 million and Nebraska $2.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler temperatures brought some relief Monday to the scorching  
heat that has struck much of the Midwest and East, but the death 
toll kept rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide total since July 19 is at least 218 deaths  
attributed to the heat.

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Denies Yahoo! Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome Corp. denied a report that the  
company is in merger talks with Yahoo!, though it acknowledged 
Tuesday the two Internet companies have talked about a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the second-largest Web search and directory destination,  
has held discussions over the last six weeks to acquire 
ExciteAtHome, the No. 6 destination, for more than $17 billion, 
according to an article published Monday on BusinessWeek Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, which cited an anonymous source, said Yahoo! might  
consider buying ExciteAtHome and spinning off the AtHome high-speed 
Internet access business, known as ``broadband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ExciteAtHome president George Bell, speaking at a technology  
conference, told reporters, ``There is no truth to the rumors about 
acquisition discussions,'' adding, ``We've had talks with Yahoo and 
AOL about getting on the start page of a very powerful broadband 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Yahoo! spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market  
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of ExciteAtHome, which had risen 14 percent in morning  
trading, tumbled on Bell's comments. ExciteAtHome's stock was rose 
43 3/4 cents to $43.37 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Yahoo! fell $6.93 3/4 to $125.37 1/2, also on the Nasdaq.  
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome is discussing a partnership that would make Yahoo!,  
America Online Inc., or perhaps another Internet service company 
the initial page ExciteAt Home's customers would see when they go 
onto the Internet, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome was created earlier this year by the merger of  
Excite, an Internet search and directory service, and AtHome, which 
operates a network of fiber-optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal with Yahoo!, however, would likely hurt the Excite  
business since Excite and Yahoo! are direct competitors.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Brown's Widow To Run for Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The widow of Rep. George E. Brown  
plans to run for her late husband's seat, setting up a tough 
Democratic primary battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Macias Brown, 54, plans to announce her candidacy  
Wednesday, said Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Her entry into the nationally watched race will pit two Hispanic  
Democrats against each other in a Southern California district that 
is increasingly Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also force Mrs. Brown's leading Democratic opponent,  
Sen. Joe Baca, to campaign against the widow of a popular 
congressman. Brown was the oldest member of the House at 79. He was 
elected 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The race comes a year before the November 2000 elections, when  
Republicans will try to retain their slim majority in the House. 
The national Republican and Democratic parties are likely to pour 
large sums into the race.

<HEADLINE> High Jumper Flunks Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Juana Rosario Arrendel of the  
Dominican Republic, winner of the women's high jump at the Pan 
American Games, failed a drug test, organizers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario Arrendel was quoted in the Dominican Republic as denying  
she used the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol and said the test 
may have picked up a decongestant she used before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six years in athletics, I have never used substances to  
enhance my performance,'' she said in remarks published today in 
the newspaper La Informacion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Martinez, a baseball player from Mexico, refused to take a  
drug test Monday, Pan Ams officials also said. Organizers said that 
was tantamount to a positive test. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan American Sports Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana  
was asked about four-time men's high jump champion and world 
record-holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba failing a drug test. While 
Rana refused to speak about Sotomayor specficially, he did mention 
that a third athlete's A test had come back positive. But until his 
B sample is examined, no name will be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario, who won the gold medal with a leap of 6 feet, 4 inches,  
is the Dominican's only gold medalist at the games so far. The 
Dominican Republic also has won one silver and one bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second drug case at these games. Steve Vezina, the  
goalkeeper for Canada's in-line roller hockey team which beat the 
United States 7-6 in the title game, tested positive for stimulants 
and steroids. Canada was stripped of the gold, which was awarded to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Dominicans being stripped of Rosario's medal,  
Argentina's Solange Witteveen, the runner-up, gets the gold. The 
silver goes to Brazil's Luciane Dambacher, and the bronze to 
Canada's Nicole Forrester.

<HEADLINE> DuBose Family Wants Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Relatives of a former pro football player  
killed by police officers have started their own investigation 
after witnesses said the athlete may have been shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Demetrius DuBose, 28, a former linebacker for the Tampa Bay  
Buccaneers, was shot several times by two officers on July 24, 
after he allegedly charged at them with a martial arts weapon he 
took from an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief David Bejarano said his department's investigation  
is expected to be completed within two weeks, and the results will 
be turned over to prosecutors. He said he welcomes outside comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's preliminary findings show DuBose was calm and  
cooperated with officers' investigation of a burglary report until 
they began to ``intimidate and harass'' him, said H.J. Sims of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only after they tried to place him in handcuffs that  
the unprofessionalism of police allowed the situation to escalate 
and prompted the gentleman to run,'' Sims said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego City Councilman George Stevens said some witnesses  
said DuBose was bending over when he was shot and others said he 
was turning away. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers claim DuBose resisted attempts to question him and  
appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Sims 
said DuBose had drank a beer earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers who shot DuBose have been removed from field work  
pending the investigation. Their names have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose had been arrested three times in the past year on  
suspicion of drug use or disorderly conduct. Two arrests were in 
California and one was at a nightclub in South Bend, Ind.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates May Curb Housing Boom / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --The rising cost of a home mortgage is expected to  
rein in the prolonged U.S. housing boom, as potential homeowners 
balk at rates that climbed above 8 percent Tuesday for the first 
time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of a housing slowdown could ripple throughout the  
domestic economy, starting with the thriving business for home 
construction and eventually spreading into the manufacturing and 
retail sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Construction will be the first area to be impacted, followed  
by sales of household goods,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at 
First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. He predicted a 
10 percent to 20 percent dropoff in the number of home sales during 
the fall buying season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitner said the expected ripple effect is significant because  
home construction and household goods are the only U.S. 
manufacturing sectors that have experienced growth in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of existing single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million units in June, the 
highest level ever, according to the National Association of 
Realtors. Comparable increases were seen across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance, however, followed two consecutive months of  
sales declines and exceeded many analysts' expectations. Housing 
experts said the increase was likely caused by home buyers who 
jumped into the market as mortgage rates began to accelerate toward 
8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first consumers to feel the pinch will be first-time  
homebuyers, said Ed Phillips, executive vice president of the 
Homebuilders Association of Georgia. ``It will impact the people 
that need housing the most, the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HSH Associates, a financial publisher that surveys mortgage  
lenders, said Tuesday the average lending rate had climbed to 8.07 
percent, up from a two-year low of 6.85 percent in September 1998. 
The weekly survey by mortgage company Freddie Mac, released 
Thursday, is expected to show a similar level. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump to an 8 percent mortgage rate has stemmed primarily  
from a similar rise in the interest rates of 10-year U.S. Treasury 
bonds. The two rates generally mirror one anothers' movements 
because most mortgages are resold as investment products known as 
mortgage-backed securities, which compete for investment dollars 
with various types of bonds, including the 10-year Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury bond rates have climbed on fears that inflation is on  
the rise, and that the Federal Reserve Bank will increase interest 
rates across the board to stem a surge in the prices of consumer 
goods. Higher interest rates tend to reduce consumer spending, and, 
consequently, the costs of goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, some in the home buying and building businesses  
believe too much is being made of the 8 percent benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Lurie, with the Southern Arizona Home Builders Association  
in Tucson, Ariz., said the higher mortgage rates will undoubtedly 
discourage potential home buyers who are struggling to put the 
financing together. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who have benefitted from the prolonged strength of the  
domestic economy shouldn't be deterred, he said. ``We've seen seven 
strong economic years. Many people have made some money, and now 
they can build a house,'' Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8 percent figure is more of a psychological benchmark than  
an economic one because home buyers had grown accustomed to 
relatively low mortgage rates, said Adrian Skiles, a mortgage 
broker with Atlanta Mortgage Group. Ten years ago, he recalled, 
mortgage rates were in the double digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many metropolitan areas around the country, Atlanta has  
seen its housing market boom throughout the 1990s. Skiles said the 
growth is expected to continue because people relocating to the 
area for new jobs will need to buy a house regardless of rising 
mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The business for mortgage refinancings, however, is expected to  
virtually disappear in the wake of the rate increase. Refinancing 
is an option for current homeowners who want to reduce their 
mortgage payments. But experts said the cost and effort to 
refinance won't be worth it if the rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Others see a potential silver lining to the rate increase.  
</P>
<P>
	``The housing market has been extremely strong, and this could  
put a brake on the rising cost of housing,'' said Jeremy Siegel, a 
professor of finance at the Wharton School, adding that an easing 
demand for new homes will push prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes hand in hand with (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan  
Greenspan's goal of slowing the economy.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Intensity Steps Up in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) -- At the Crouse Cafe, where the meatloaf  
special was $4.95, Gary Bauer talked heatedly about U.S. dues to 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of blocks away at a library, Alan Keyes enlisted block  
captains in his ``Iowa Sacred Honor Guard'' as he spoke to 24 
supporters about ``issues that address the moral decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were among six Republican presidential contenders who  
crisscrossed Iowa on Tuesday in search of backers willing to show 
up at the Aug. 14 straw poll in Ames, an event into which campaigns 
are throwing money, workers, energy and candidate time. 
</P>
<P>
	Though nothing real is at stake in the straw poll, there's a ton  
of symbolism and the candidates are treating it with all the 
grimness of armed combat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're doing it one on one, meeting with people in  
the way they're used to in Iowa,'' said former cabinet secretary 
Elizabeth Dole. ``I don't think people want to substitute that 
retail politicking for 30-second spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eating meatloaf all over Iowa,'' said Bauer.  
</P>
<P>
	There's absolutely no doubt the candidates are fighting it out.  
Publisher Steve Forbes had stops in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids on 
Tuesday, while commentator Pat Buchanan was in the state and Utah 
Sen. Orrin Hatch was wrapping up a five-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really the beginning of the winnowing factor,'' said Bob  
Haus, who runs the state for Forbes. ``It's separating the wheat 
from the chaff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses early next year launch the presidential  
nominating season, and with a large and varied field of GOP 
candidates many are eager for a measurement of how they are doing. 
The straw poll offers such a measure, albeit a limited one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It decides absolutely nothing, but it has tremendous symbolic  
value put on it by the candidates and the press,'' said Drake 
University political science professor Dennis Goldford. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argue the event is an organizational test that's important  
in a state where precinct caucuses demand organizational prowess at 
a much higher level than in a state holding a traditional primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The straw poll basically only represents a test of how many  
people you can get to show up at that event, yet showing up is what 
it's all about,'' said Keyes, who said he plans three events a day 
every day until the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Haus said Forbes' bus would rumble through 77 of the state's 99  
counties, building toward the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're putting a substantial ground effort into the field,''  
said Haus. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush upped the ante, when he said he would  
not only compete in the straw poll, but would play to win. With a 
big lead in the polls and in money, that enhanced the straw's 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've really raised the stakes on this thing,'' said Haus.  
</P>
<P>
	The event promises to be a spectacle, with each campaign  
erecting giant tents and tossing celebrity-laden parties for 
backers. Bush spent $43,000 just to rent a space near the 
auditorium for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush is simply running a traditional organizational  
effort building to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just doing the standard straw poll attendee  
identification,'' said spokesman Eric Woolson. 
</P>
<P>
	The intensity is a boon for the Republican Party, which is  
getting $25 for every ticket and party officials are gloating about 
the hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think it was a brilliant media strategy on our  
part,'' said GOP executive director Dee Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 400 or so press credentials, several foreign  
embassies have sent word they'll have delegations on hand to 
witness this rather bizarre part of an election process that will 
culminate with selection of the next leader of the free world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a 20-person delegation from Mozambique,'' Finance  
Director Sara Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled to speak are Keyes, Dan Quayle, Hatch, Bauer, Forbes,  
Bush, Mrs. Dole, Buchanan and Lamar Alexander, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Arizona Sen. John McCain has chosen to bypass the event.

<HEADLINE> Heat Breaks, But Death Toll Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cooler temperatures brought some relief Monday to  
the scorching heat that has struck much of the Midwest and East, 
but the death toll kept rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide total since July 19 is at least 218 deaths  
attributed to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	After almost two weeks of unbearable temperatures, most  
Chicagoans are returning to normal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing the best I could last week, but I was tired of the  
whole situation,'' said Samuel Mensah, who spends his days parking 
cars on a sizzling asphalt lot downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a day after the heat finally broke, Midway Airport  
reached a high of 81 degrees -- 23 degrees lower than Friday's high 
temperature of 104 degrees there. Temperatures in central Illinois 
were around 80 degrees Monday, and southern Illinois was a few 
degrees warmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths were reported in 20 states and many shared a tragic  
thread: People most at risk from the heat were often the ones who 
wouldn't -- or couldn't -- wrap themselves in the icy blast of an air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois officials reported that the hot weather has contributed  
to the deaths of 99 people, up from 80 on Sunday. The state with 
the next highest total is Missouri, with 44. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a woman driving home after a night of drinking left  
her car at a gas station and forgot her 8-month-old son inside. The 
child died Sunday and the woman was charged in his death and faces 
up to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, federal officials declared West Virginia and parts of  
Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia disaster areas 
because of drought.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Memorial Design Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The staff of the National Capital Planning  
Commission today approved a design for a memorial to 
Japanese-Americans in a small park near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission approval could come at a meeting scheduled Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	A 15-foot statue of cranes struggling to fly through barbed wire  
will dominate the three-quarter-acre plot. The cranes symbolize the 
115,000 Japanese-Americans interned in camps on the West Coast 
during World War II. The Supreme Court upheld the action, but it 
has been repudiated by postwar presidents and Congress has voted to 
compensate those interned. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument also will memorialize Japanese-Americans who served  
in the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The design ... provides an appropriate form for conveying the  
memorial's story and message,'' the staff evaluation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital's Fine Arts Commission already has approved the  
design. But it had reservations about the number of inscriptions to 
be placed on the 7-foot granite wall that will surround the central 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, who inspired India's nonviolent  
resistance to British rule, also won approval from the commission 
staff. It will consist of a statue in a small park facing the 
Indian Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue, the capital's ``Embassy 
Row.''

<HEADLINE> '20/20' Helps ABC in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a quick review of ABC's four top rated  
prime-time programs last week: ``20/20,'' ``20/20,'' ``20/20'' and 
``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine's Friday, Sunday, Monday and Wednesday editions  
each drew higher Nielsen Media Research ratings than anything put 
on the air by ABC's entertainment division last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ``20/20'' drew the biggest audience, and was topped in  
Nielsen's prime-time standings for the week only by a ``Frasier'' 
rerun on NBC. Friday's ``20/20'' featured a Barbara Walters 
interview with tennis star Alexandra Stevenson and her mother, 
Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
	The best the entertainment division could do was a movie rerun,  
``A Kidnapping in the Family,'' which ranked No. 23 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive signs for ABC News didn't extend to its summer  
replacement series, ``Nightline in Primetime: Brave New World.'' 
The offbeat news show that examines concepts like speed and 
technology finished No. 76 in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other ABC specials, an entertainment show from Ford's  
Theatre and a review of the Paris fashion collections, fared even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week with a 6.5 rating and 12 share. NBC had a 6.2  
rating and 12 share, ABC was at 5.5 and 10, and Fox had a 4.6 
rating and 9 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share. Struggling UPN was at 1.4 and 3, while Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.4 and 16. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.2 rating and 16 
share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 26-Aug. 1, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.6; ``20/20-Friday,'' 
ABC, 8.5; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Undue Influence, Part 1,'' CBS, 8.5; 
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.4; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.2; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.1; ``ER,'' 
NBC, 8.1; ``Dateline NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 8.0; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
8.0.

<HEADLINE> Nine West To Eliminate 1,900 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jones Apparel Group Inc. will eliminate about  
1,900 jobs and close three factories as it looks to reduce costs in 
its newly acquired Nine West footwear and accessories division. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, which designs and markets apparel under well-known labels  
such as Jones New York, Saville and Evan-Picone labels, bought Nine 
West in June in a $1.5 billion deal that created one of the biggest 
clothing and shoe companies in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Tuesday that it would close Nine West factories in  
Kentucky, Indiana, and the Dominican Republic. Like Jones does with 
its clothing lines, it will contract out production of its shoes to 
outside manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jones will close Nine West's administrative office  
in St. Louis and will merge those operations into Jones' 
headquarters in Bristol, Pa., and Nine West's headquarters in White 
Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	About 550 employees in the United States and 1,170 in the  
Dominican Republic will be affected as a result of the factory 
closings. About 190 jobs will be cut when the St. Louis office 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 12 percent of Nine West's total  
workforce of 15,600 people. Jones Apparel employs an additional 
9,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings are expected to be completed by the end of this  
year. Beginning in 2000, Jones expects to save about $7 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were difficult decisions, however, as we integrate the  
Jones and Nine West businesses into today's globally competitive 
women's apparel and footwear markets, it is imperative that we 
maximize worldwide sourcing capabilities and reduce costs,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Jones slipped  
1.5 percent, or by 50 cents, to $32.93 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Wallace, Austin Pick Alabama Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Gerald Wallace, rated one of the top  
high school prospects in the country, ended the recruiting battle 
Tuesday by announcing he will attend Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, a 6-foot-6 forward from Childersburg, Ala., was joined  
in committing to Alabama by Mario Austin, a teammate on his AAU 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this summer, Wallace was hardly known outside of Alabama.  
But some impressive performances at several AAU tournaments drew 
numerous scholarship offers and comparisons to Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw (Michael) Jordan at the end of his junior season, I  
wrote that he had the best combination of skills, intangibles and 
athletic ability I've ever seen in a wing guard,'' Brick Oettinger, 
who writes a recruiting column for The Sporting News, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was in early 1980. It's taken 19 years since I've written  
those words again -- except Wallace is a wing forward,'' Oettinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, a slasher and leaper with 3-point shooting range, said  
he chose Alabama over Alabama-Birmingham, Auburn, Duke, North 
Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi State, Florida, Florida State and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Austin, a 6-9, 265-pound forward from Sumter County, had  
been promoting themselves to colleges as a package deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the players I've played with, (Mario) is the best,''  
Wallace has said. ``He knows what I'm thinking and I know what he 
is thinking. We can make the pass and the plays without even 
looking at each other, because we know where each other is going to 
be.''

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Author Willie Morris Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- For author Willie Morris, home was more  
than just a place: It was a concept that cropped up in his titles 
and echoed through his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am an American writer who happens to have come from the  
South,'' he said in 1997. ``I've tried to put the South into the 
larger American perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who died Monday after suffering a heart attack, had  
nearly finished his latest work, a project with his son about his 
home state's history and future. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was from a generation that had lived through Mississippi  
that was at its worst, but he had come to peace with his 
homeland,'' said David Rae Morris, a freelance photojournalist who 
lives in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who developed what he called a ``good ole boy'' love for  
the South, grew up in Yazoo City, the small town that would become 
the focal point for many of his stories. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work, ``North Toward Home,'' he described Yazoo City as  
``on the edge of the delta, straddling that memorable divide where 
the hills end and flat land begins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, with more than a dozen books to his credit, had a  
wide-ranging career as a journalist, editor and novelist. Among his 
books are ``North Toward Home,'' ``New York Days'' and ``Terrains 
of the Heart and Other Essays on Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. William Winter said Morris' legacy is that of a  
``storyteller who was an interpreter of life in the state and this 
part of the county for the rest of country and the rest of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris became associate editor of Harper's Magazine in 1963, and  
in 1967, the 33-year-old Morris became the youngest editor in chief 
of the nation's oldest magazine. He left Harper's in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought that magazine kicking and screaming into the  
present. With his love of words and very considerable charm he'd 
taken an archaic magazine and made it an exciting magazine that was 
on the cutting edge,'' said writer David Halberstam, recruited by 
Morris at Harper's. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Mississippi, serving as writer-in-residence at  
the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he wrote ``The 
Courting of Marcus Dupree'' (1983), based on a standout football 
player. In 1996, he was the winner of the Richard Wright Medal for 
Literary Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie was able to walk in the company of the most preeminent  
writers in the world and compete on equal terms with anyone, but it 
was here in Mississippi he derived the greatest satisfaction,'' 
Gov. Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest published book was ``The Ghosts of Medgar Evers,'' a  
1998 work about the history of the production of the film ``Ghosts 
of Mississippi,'' a film on the 1963 assassination of the civil 
rights figure and the conviction of Byron De La Beckwith for the 
murder in his third trial 30 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Ellen Douglas said Morris ``lived his life on his own  
terms and came back to the South because that's where he wanted to 
be, and he lived a rich, full life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Rae Morris said his dad felt special about Mississippi.  
</P>
<P>
	``He always liked to quote Truman Capote, who would say  
everybody comes home soon or later, even if in a box. He said he 
didn't want to wait that long,'' the younger Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is survived by his wife.

<HEADLINE> Fisher Signs Multiyear Lakers Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Spurning offers for more money  
elsewhere, Los Angeles guard Derek Fisher agreed to re-sign with 
his team Tuesday in a seven-year deal worth about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 24, who became a free agent after three years with the  
Lakers, made the announcement at the University of Arkansas at 
Little Rock, where he played college ball. He was expected to sign 
the contract within the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said he was closer to leaving the Lakers than some  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I'd go somewhere, but the last few days have been  
really tough on me,'' the 6-foot-1, 200-pound guard said. ``I think 
the Lakers just thought I'd go to the highest bidder, which wasn't 
exactly right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's signing puts to rest rumors that had Orlando Magic  
guard Penny Hardaway going to Los Angeles. Because of the supposed 
Lakers' interest, Fisher said it was difficult to plan his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frightening because you don't know where you're going to  
spend the next six or seven year of your life,'' said Fisher, whose 
family accompanied him. ``For a while, I wasn't sure if the Lakers 
wanted me around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other teams had shown interest in Fisher, said his agent,  
Elbert Crawford. Indiana, San Antonio and Toronto showed the most 
interest before Fisher finalized the contract with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were offers out there for more money than I'm getting  
now,'' said Fisher, who was the 24th player picked in the 1996 NBA 
draft. In his final year at UALR, Fisher was the Sun Belt 
Conference Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Fisher averaged 5.9 points a game in 50 games -- 21 of  
which he started. Fisher was second on the team with 3.9 assists 
per game and 1.2 steals per game. During his career, Fisher has 
averaged 5.1 points and 3.1 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to distribute the basketball ultimately was the  
reason the free agent was able to sign with the Lakers, Fisher 
said. He wondered if Shaquille O'Neal had spoken with Lakers 
executive Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the big fella (O'Neal) stepped up and said the right  
things to people,'' Fisher said. ``I know they want me to keep 
getting him the ball, and I'm sure he wants it.''

<HEADLINE> Barton's Children Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Having already lost his daughter and  
wife to violence, Bill Spivey was overcome at the thought of having 
to bury his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Spivey broke down in tears Monday and appeared to stagger with  
grief at the White Columns Chapel while saying goodbye to Matthew 
and Mychelle Barton, who were killed Wednesday by their father, 
Mark O. Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a suspect in the death of Debra Spivey Barton and Eloise  
Powell Spivey six years ago, also killed his second wife, Leigh 
Ann, before opening fire at two brokerage offices in Atlanta on 
Thursday, leaving another nine dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Kenneth Hennesy told Spivey and 300 other friends and  
family members that they shouldn't question why the children were 
gone. He urged them to take comfort in the fact that they had gone 
on to something better. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the chapel, teddy bears and inscriptions ``Gone to be  
with Momma'' decorated the pulpit. Mourners recalled how Matthew, 
11, loved baseball and Mychelle, 8, was an active Girl Scout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to remind you how your lives have been enriched just by  
knowing them,'' Hennesy said. ``Sometimes the answers are not there 
for the understanding of man, but there for us when we get to 
heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was suspected but never charged in the murder of his  
mother-in-law and first wife -- the children's mother -- six years 
ago. The women's bodies were found hacked to death in a camper in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Barton's two youngest victims was one of three  
held Monday. Two more were scheduled for today, for day traders 
Edward Quinn and Joe Dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, services were held for Kevin Dial, 36, a manager at  
Momentum Securities and one of the first to die in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial's sister, Sherri Dial read a letter from her brother  
written a day before his death that vowed that he would live life 
to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure you're with Elvis, having cocktails, trying to  
convince God to let (John) Belushi visit,'' Ms. Dial said, speaking 
of her brother and drawing chuckles from mourners. ``And I think 
he'll probably do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, a memorial service was held  
for Russell Brown, a 42-year-old day trader at Momentum Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in his life, he finally found something he  
loved in day trading -- he would have done it 24 hours a day if 
possible,'' Brown's fiancee Patti Balon told those attending the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss ... his laugh, his little smirk, the way he walked,  
his hugs -- those hugs that meant it had been awhile since you'd 
seen each other and he was so glad to see you,'' said family friend 
Ray Chase.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Basks in Welfare Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton basked in the testimonials of  
businesses and former welfare recipients who are helping the 
welfare rolls plummet. But many of their stories offered reminders 
of the problems that remain in trying to make welfare reform 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As pleased as we are, we have to do more,'' the president told  
participants in a national conference Tuesday of the Welfare to 
Work Partnership, a group Clinton helped launch in the months after 
he signed the 1996 overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was particularly concerned that people  
leaving welfare may be improperly losing their Medicaid and food 
stamp benefits. He guessed that they simply don't realize they 
remain eligible. ``We have to work on that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of Tuesday's session with some 350 business leaders and  
former welfare recipients was decidedly upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes people with the courage to say, 'I'm going to change  
my life,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced that a record number of welfare recipients are  
now working even as they collect benefits, and released new figures 
showing the percent of Americans on assistance at a 32-year low. 
Experts credit a combination of tough new rules and the strong 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The president listened as much he talked, rotating his chair to  
hear one hand-picked person after another speak under the bright 
lights of what resembled a TV talk-show set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can go out and conquer just about anything,''  
said Consuelo McGlond, who was hired last November as an overnight 
telephone operator at a Loews hotel in Miami after 10 years on and 
off welfare. ``It has given me loads of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the welfare overhaul became law nearly three years ago,  
Clinton has constantly urged businesses to hire people off the 
rolls, hoping to prove wrong those critics who said there would 
never been enough jobs for the millions of families on assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Welfare to Work Partnership has held rallies in 17 cities  
around the country and persuaded some 12,000 companies to join, 
each pledging to hire at least one person off the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Its pitch has been that hiring people from welfare is good for  
businesses that need workers in an economy with low unemployment. 
And many employers -- including the federal government -- have found 
that retention rates are higher among former recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sounded the same theme Tuesday: ``Welfare recipients can  
be a rich pool of untapped talent, people who are good for the 
bottom line,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how many of the partnership's businesses have  
actually hired people, but there has been an injection of positive 
thinking about welfare among many of the country's largest 
companies. Rather than shunning people on welfare, they are 
bragging about their programs to hire them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put ourselves in the shoes of a welfare recipient  
moving to work,'' said Bill McDermott, who proudly reported that 
his company, Xerox, was one of the first 100 to sign up. So far, he 
said, Xerox has hired 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many of the success stories pointed to remaining  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS, for instance, worked with the city of Philadelphia to  
extend bus routes out to its remote facility. But many suburban 
jobs around the country remain out of reach for people who live in 
the inner cities and often do not own cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware Gov. Tom Carper told of his state's effort to get the  
fathers of children on welfare to work, but there are still many 
dads who earn very little and are not able to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged as much.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are problems out there,'' he said. ``But we also  
know that there are good people who wish to go to work and ought to 
have the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Chicago, Clinton met for 45 minutes with AFL-CIO  
President John Sweeney and the labor federation's executive 
council. They discussed the federal budget, Medicare, a minimum 
wage increase and next year's election, said White House spokesman 
Barry Toiv.

<HEADLINE> Disgraced Runner Johnson Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson met  
with top officials from track and field's world governing body 
Tuesday in a last-ditch bid for reinstatement before his fate is 
decided at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian runner and his advisers faced the International  
Amateur Athletics Federation subcommittee set up to examine his 
reinstatement application. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-man group, led by IAAF General-Secretary Istvan  
Gyulai, will recommend to the body's council whether or not to 
allow the runner back into competition. 
</P>
<P>
	If the council, which meets in Seville on Aug. 17, decides  
against Johnson it will be the end of the road: there is no 
possibility of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson is confident of a comeback and even at 37 is  
dreaming of a return to the very top. 
</P>
<P>
	``My day will come. I have to clear my name and I hope to be in  
the Olympics next year,'' he told The Associated Press after the 
meeting. ``Things will be OK in a few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His hopes rest on the high-level subcommittee's assessment of  
his advisers' case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, it met for one-hour with John Thresher, president of  
Athletics Canada, which supports the runner's reinstatement, before 
a two-hour dialogue with Johnson and his team. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The runner's lawyer, Gary Boyd, said Johnson wasn't given the  
right to a full appeal after a 1993 positive drugs test, and there 
is a question of how his urine sample was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	It is alleged that the sample was held by a courier for 19  
hours, during which time it could have been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, at that time Johnson was taking an over-the-counter  
vitamin supplement, called AnimalPak. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said that the drug's manufacturer has acknowledged that  
AnimalPak could have distorted Johnson's sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't want to get Ben off on a technicality,'' said  
Maurice Chrobotek, Johnson's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter  
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for life after the second positive test in  
1993.

<HEADLINE> Gunshot Injuries Cost $2.3B Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The cost of treating the nation's gunshot victims  
in a recent year was $2.3 billion and the government paid half the 
bill, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is an estimate of what the nation spent treating  
gunshot victims in 1994, based on data from hospitals in Maryland 
and New York that year, from South Carolina emergency rooms in 1997 
and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been concerned that a lot of folks don't see gun  
violence as their problem, they see it as someone else's problem,'' 
said one of the researchers, Philip Cook, director of the Sanford 
Institute of Public Policy at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The costs are shared by everyone through government payment.  
In that sense, we all have a stake in reducing gun violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This has not been lost on many cities and counties -- at least 23  
are pursuing gun makers in court to recover money spent treating 
gunshot victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The study published in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association looked at the costs hospitals incurred treating almost 
135,000 gunshot injuries, including fatal ones. The average cost 
per injury was $17,000. When a victim was hospitalized, the average 
lifetime cost jumped to $35,000, the researchers estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher not involved in the study said it was a solid  
analysis of the limited data that is available. Mark Cohen, a 
Vanderbilt University economist who does research in this area, 
said the breakdown of who bears the costs of gunshot wounds is the 
study's most valuable component. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, mostly through Medicaid and Medicare payments,  
paid $1.1 billion of the total cost, the study found. Private 
insurers covered 18 percent of the cost, and victims picked up 
another 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers speculated that victims' costs are often passed  
on to other patients because many victims can't afford treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seemingly high numbers, Cohen said the costs are  
small when compared to the $1 trillion spent on medical care 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you did away with gunshot injuries, would you reduce  
medical costs?'' Cohen said. ``Not by much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said fraud is more costly to hospitals than gunshot wounds.

<HEADLINE> Mattel To Sell Barbie Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc. will launch a line of computers tied  
to its popular Barbie and Hot Wheel brands, the latest move by the 
world's largest toymaker to expand its high-tech offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel announced Tuesday it has signed a licensing agreement  
with Patriot Computers to produce brightly colored PCs for $599 -- 
including the central processing unit, monitor and 20 software 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computers will go on sale Sept. 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``The whole toy industry is moving toward technology and this is  
just the latest example of that,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy 
consultant. ``These computers pair Mattel's best-known brands with 
a very affordable PC. That's bound to attract buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's entrance into the computer market comes as the El  
Segundo, Calif.-based company aggressively pursues opportunities 
outside traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets -- 
which children today seem more interested in playing with than 
dolls and action figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Mattel has seen tremendous growth in its lineup  
of software and CD-ROMs, while demand of its Barbie dolls have been 
on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Mattel Media accounted for six of the top 10  
best-selling software titles focusing on personal enrichment, 
according to research firm PC Data. Mattel Media includes products 
from The Learning Company, an educational software firm that Mattel 
acquired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	While its software sales are strong, Mattel hopes its new  
computers will help it grab a piece of the fast-expanding cheap PC 
market. Almost 71 percent of all PCs purchased retail in June sold 
for under $1,000, compared with 46 percent of sales in the same 
month a year ago, PC Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making technology affordable for the masses,'' said  
Cynthia Neiman, vice president of marketing for Mattel Media. 
``Where else can you get a computer, monitor and software for under 
$600?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its low prices, Mattel is targeting not only those families  
buying their first computer, but also those looking to buy a second 
home PC. According to ZD InfoBeads, a research firm in La Jolla, 
Calif., 65 percent of U.S. households with children own a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, consumers have a powerful computer for all of  
the household activities, and want a cheaper computer for a 
specific member of the family, like the kids,'' said Matt Sargent, 
an analyst at ZD InfoBeads. ``This fits perfectly into that 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each full-sized computer will include a 333 MHz Intel Celeron  
processor, 15-inch monitor, 56K modem, a 3-gigabyte hard drive and 
a Windows 98 operating system. While it is hardly the most powerful 
computer on the market today, analysts said it rivals that of other 
PCs in its price range, such as the popular eMachines and Compaq 
Computer's low-end model. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barbie PC comes in silver with pink and purple flowers. It  
features 20 entertainment and educational software titles, 
including the Barbie Riding Club CD-ROM, Barbie Cool Looks Fashion 
Designer CD-ROM and Compton's Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also includes the popular Barbie digital camera, a  
Barbie mouse and a CD holder. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue and gold Hot Wheels PC comes with 20 titles such as Hot  
Wheels Stunt Track Driver, Hot Wheels Customer Car Designer and 
Compton's 3D World Atlas. The package also includes a Hot Wheels 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said the library of software loaded on each PC has a  
retail value of approximately $500. Copies of the software will 
also be provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computers will be sold exclusively through Patriot, a  
privately held Canadian direct-seller of computers, and two Web 
sites, at www.barbiepc.com and www.hotwheelspc.com. The computers 
will not be available in stores.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Olympic Bid Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A businessman pleaded guilty Tuesday to  
misdemeanor tax fraud in the first criminal case arising out of the 
selection of Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Simmons admitted helping the son of a powerful  
International Olympic Committee member from South Korea obtain 
lawful permanent resident status by setting up a sham job at his 
now-defunct company, Keystone Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to filing a fraudulent tax return, which  
carries a maximum prison term of one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Simmons said he used fake contracts and phony  
invoices to conceal the fact that John Kim's salary was being paid 
by the Salt Lake City Olympic Bid Committee. The goal, he said, was 
to win support for the city's quest for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purported salary was not genuine,'' Simmons told U.S.  
Magistrate Ronald N. Boyce in a voice barely above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's court papers said the scheme began in the  
summer of 1990 with an agreement between Simmons and an officer of 
the committee working to bring the Olympics to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The government didn't identify the committee official, but  
Simmons said the deal was arranged by Tom Welch, the committee's 
president. Welch has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The son's name was not disclosed by the Justice Department, but  
a Salt Lake Olympic Committee ethics report filed last winter said 
Simmons helped set up the job for John Kim, the son of IOC member 
Kim Un-yong. The report identified Kim by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to John Kim's New York office went unanswered. A  
spokesman for the Kim family, William Schechter, said he had not 
heard of the Justice Department's action and had no immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, a member of the IOC's ruling executive board and  
president of an international confederation of Olympic sports, has 
consistently denied any wrongdoing in the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's own investigation slapped him with a ``severe  
warning'' but stopped short of harsher sanctions in the inquiry 
that led to an unprecedented 10 expulsions or resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons is the first to be charged in the ongoing investigation,  
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch went on from the bid committee to become president of the  
city's Olympic organizing committee, until he resigned in the wake 
of spouse-abuse charges in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the IOC member's relative was hired as the  
marketing manager for Asian operations in 1990. He remained on 
Keystone's payroll until October 1992, though he stopped coming to 
Keystone's New York City office and was not performing work for 
Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
	The relative's salary, according to government documents, began  
at $50,000 a year and was raised on May 1, 1992, to $70,383 a year. 
The government said most of nearly $200,000 paid out by Keystone 
came from the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons agreed to cooperate fully with the investigation, which  
was begun last December and now involves the Justice Department, 
the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Beat U.S. for Baseball Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The Cubans came to the top of their  
dugout steps in the top of the ninth, dancing to a drum beat in the 
stands, ready to unfurl four of their nation's flags, ready to 
celebrate yet another baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
	When a 5-1 victory over the United States was secured, so was  
the gold medal in the Pan American Games, and the Cubans rushed the 
field in jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were able to overcome any distractions caused by numerous  
defections from their athletic teams, including one of their own, 
relief pitcher Danys Baez after Sunday's semifinal win over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cuban team is a very good, but not an unbeatable team by  
any means. It's disappointing, but we accomplished a lot here,'' 
said U.S. manager Buddy Bell, whose hastily assembled team clinched 
an Olympic berth the night before by beating Mexico in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba got two homers from long-ball star Orestes Kindelan -- the  
career home run leader in the country's history with 430 before the 
tourament -- and an overpowering pitching performance by Jose 
Contreras on one day's rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't communicate with them all that well, but they  
conducted themselves professionally,'' U.S. third baseman Jason 
Hardtke said. ``They were the team to beat. We beat them once, but 
then we came up short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan was 3-for-25 in the tournament before hitting a two-out  
homer in the fourth off starter Brad Penny for a 1-0 lead. The next 
batter, Gabriel Pierre, followed with another homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan homered again, a two-run shot, in the sixth. And the  
United States could manage just one run on a double by Milton 
Bradley and RBI single by Marcus Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras, who pitched six innings in a quarterfinal win over  
the Dominican Rebublic, struck out 13 in eight innings, including 
eight straight early in the game. The Cubans won their eighth 
straight Pan Ams gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is their best pitcher,'' Bell said. ``The guy is a horse,  
too, but he can't do that all the time -- or he shouldn't be able 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they don't care about anybody's health over there,  
which is a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat Cuba in the preliminary rounds 10-5.  
Canada also defeated the Cubans in the round robin before losing in 
the semifinals. Canada, despite the best record in the tournament, 
6-1, got only a bronze medal and no trip to the Olympics. The 
Canadians beat Mexico 9-2 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Cuba's problems mounted. Cuban officials  
denounced organizers for lax security that led to defections and 
disappearances that have plagued the team. They also criticized 
officials for failing to stop a demonstrator from disrupting 
Sunday's semifinal victory over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 19-year-old Baez left the team, telling a Miami  
television station he was headed for south Florida, the Cubans 
insisted that organizers tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' a statement from the Cuban 
delegation said. ``From now on we will react with full energy to 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports agent Joe Cubas, who has helped many Cubans defect to the  
United States, said in a release Monday that Baez sought asylum in 
Canada after the semifinal win. Baez told Miami television station 
WSCV 51 via telephone, ``I want to tell the people of Miami that 
another Cuban in search of freedom is about to become part of the 
people of Miami. Wait for me over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's departure brought to eight the number of Cubans to leave  
during the games. Runner Michal Ortiz, an unidentified female 
artistic gymnast and a soccer goalkeeper -- the goalies here were 
Rene Castro and Rodney Valdes -- also left the team on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian roller hockey goalkeeper Steve Vezina apologized for  
testing positive for three banned substances, costing his team a 
gold medal. At a news conference in Saint-Adele, Quebec, Vezina 
said, ``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete 
that represents Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't soothe teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined the chance of a lifetime for nine guys,'' Kerr said.  
``I know he's my teammate and I should be sticking up for him. I 
know I, along with nine other guys, we're clean. We did it the way 
we were supposed to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juana Rosario of the Dominican Republic, winner of the women's  
high jump, failed her drug test, a games officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's men's volleyball team beat Brazil in five sets for the  
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team closed in on 200 medals, upping its total to 188,  
74 gold. Canada is next at 111, 33 gold, followed by Cuba with 96, 
39 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The American women's soccer team advanced to the gold medal game  
by beating Costa Rica 2-0. Marcia Wallis and Kim Patrick scored for 
the Americans, who outshot Costa Rica 22-0 in the second half and 
34-1 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico beat Canada in a shootout for the other spot in the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age tennis star Alexandra Stevenson got her first test,  
needing a third-set tiebreaker to edge Renata Kolbovic of Canada 
7-6 (9-7), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women played their best basketball game so far, but  
couldn't hold a 16-point lead and lost to Brazil 77-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans collected one gold, by Ed Moses in the 100-meter  
breaststroke in games record time (1:00.99), and four silvers in 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the U.S. swim team was assured of not collecting a medal  
in an individual event for the first time since 1955 when Jarod 
Schroeder and Sabir Muhammad failed to qualify for the final of the 
men's 100 butterfly. Schroeder finished 11th overall in the 
preliminaries at 55.89 and Muhammad was 17th at 57.20. Only the top 
eight make the final. 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Chile 2-0, the U.S. women's field hockey team made  
the final game. If it wins that over Argentina, it goes to the 
Sydney Games.

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Forty-four years -- and over.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1955, United States swimmers failed to  
get at least one medal in an individual event at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	That was assured earlier in Tuesday when Jarod Schroeder of  
Morrison, Ill., and Sabir Muhammad of Atlanta failed to qualify for 
the final of the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	The focal point of the games, however, once again was on drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican Republic, winner of the  
women's high jump, was stripped of her medal for failing a drug 
test. Organizers also said another athlete's A test had come back 
positive, but no action will be taken and the name will not be 
released unless the B sample turns out to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
	But a physician from the Cuban delegation traveled to Montreal  
to examine the urine samples. While rumors swirled that the athlete 
is four-time Pan Ams high jump champion and world record-holder 
Javier Sotomayor, Dr. Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra journeyed to the 
testing facility in Montreal, sources close to the Cuban team said. 
The sources, who asked not to be identified, would not say if 
Sotomayor is the athlete -- or if it is even a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the sources emphasized, a key medical officer of the  
delegation would not be sent on such an assignment if the drug test 
did not involve a leading Cuban athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans brought their medals total to 199, 76 gold, while  
Canada has 121, 37 gold. Cuba is third with 106, 45 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. failures in the butterfly typified the Americans' lack  
of success in the pool so far. For the second straight day, the 
U.S. team won only one gold in five events, in the men's 800 
freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada collected three golds for the second day in a row and  
Venezuela got the other gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you saw this morning were two guys who didn't have the  
best swims of their lives,'' Muhammad, the American record-holder 
in the 50 and 100 short-course butterfly events, said. ``Basically 
we were out there doing our best to go fast and it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked. It was the worst dive I've ever had in a swim  
race. I went four meters on my dive, straight down. Usually my dive 
is shallower than that. That was just a fluke. The rest of the swim 
I was just trying to catch up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder was just as disconsolate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very disappointing,'' he said. ``To put in all the work  
that we did ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to make some adjustments before next year (for the  
Olympics). I felt good in warmups and I felt good all week. It just 
didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was slow out of the blocks. I think I was the last into the  
water. I tried to force the issue. I wasn't very efficient on my 
stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder was 11th overall in the prelims at 55.89, Muhammad was  
17th at 57.20. Only the top eight qualify for the final. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Americans failed to win a medal in an  
individual event was 1955, when they finished sixth and eighth in 
the men's 200 backstroke. The only other time they missed in an 
individual event was in 1951 in the men's 1,500 freestyle, when 
they were fourth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the men's 400 relay team failed to medal when it was  
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Adam Messner, Dan Phillips, Devin Howard and Scott  
Tucker gave the Americans their lone gold Tuesday night. Tucker, 
with a gutty anchor leg, held off Brazil's Gustavo Borges as the 
U.S. team posted a time of 7 minutes, 22.29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the Americans won two silvers and two bronzes.  
</P>
<P>
	Annemieke McReynolds of Wildwood, Ga., and Katie Yevak of  
Emporia, Kan., gave the U.S. a 2-3 finish in the women's 200 
breaststroke behind Canada's Lauren Van Oosten, who led all the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Donnelly of Sarasota, Fla., who set a career-best in  
winning his preliminary heat in the men's 400 individual medley, 
bettered that with 4:17.86 in the final, but it wasn't good enough 
to beat Canada's Curtis Myden. 
</P>
<P>
	Myden, Canada's swimmer of the year from 1994-97, cut more than  
three seconds off the Pan Ams record and more than a half-second 
off his national record in winning at 4:15.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Talor Bendel of Fort Mitchell, Ky., got the other U.S. medal,  
finishing third in the women's 200 freestyle behind Jessica Deglau 
of Canada and Janella Atkinson of Jamaica. Bendel led through the 
first 150 meters before yielding ground in the final 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I would have to go out fast to stay up with the rest of  
the field, then have a good last half,'' Bendel said. ``It just 
wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got tired.''  
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Sanchez gave Venezuela its first gold ever in the 100  
butterfly with a games record of 53.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Henderson of Commack, N.Y., pitched her second perfect  
game of the softball competition, beating the Bahamas 12-0 in five 
innings. She fanned 13 of 15 batters.

	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- For author Willie Morris, home was more

	``I am an American writer who happens to have come from the  
South,'' he said in 1997. ``I've tried to put the South into the 
larger American perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who died Monday after suffering a heart attack, had  
nearly finished his latest work, a project with his son about his 
home state's history and future. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was from a generation that had lived through Mississippi  
that was at its worst, but he had come to peace with his 
homeland,'' said David Rae Morris, a freelance photojournalist who 
lives in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who developed what he called a ``good ole boy'' love for  
the South, grew up in Yazoo City, the small town that would become 
the focal point for many of his stories. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work, ``North Toward Home,'' he described Yazoo City as  
``on the edge of the delta, straddling that memorable divide where 
the hills end and flat land begins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, with more than a dozen books to his credit, had a  
wide-ranging career as a journalist, editor and novelist. Among his 
books are ``North Toward Home,'' ``New York Days'' and ``Terrains 
of the Heart and Other Essays on Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. William Winter said Morris' legacy is that of a  
``storyteller who was an interpreter of life in the state and this 
part of the county for the rest of country and the rest of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris became associate editor of Harper's Magazine in 1963, and  
in 1967, the 33-year-old Morris became the youngest editor in chief 
of the nation's oldest magazine. He left Harper's in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought that magazine kicking and screaming into the  
present. With his love of words and very considerable charm he'd 
taken an archaic magazine and made it an exciting magazine that was 
on the cutting edge,'' said writer David Halberstam, recruited by 
Morris at Harper's. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Mississippi, serving as writer-in-residence at  
the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he wrote ``The 
Courting of Marcus Dupree'' (1983), based on a standout football 
player. In 1996, he was the winner of the Richard Wright Medal for 
Literary Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie was able to walk in the company of the most preeminent  
writers in the world and compete on equal terms with anyone, but it 
was here in Mississippi he derived the greatest satisfaction,'' 
Gov. Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest published book was ``The Ghosts of Medgar Evers,'' a  
1998 work about the history of the production of the film ``Ghosts 
of Mississippi,'' a film on the 1963 assassination of the civil 
rights figure and the conviction of Byron De La Beckwith for the 
murder in his third trial 30 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Author Ellen Douglas said Morris ``lived his life on his own  
terms and came back to the South because that's where he wanted to 
be, and he lived a rich, full life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Rae Morris said his dad felt special about Mississippi.  
</P>
<P>
	``He always liked to quote Truman Capote, who would say  
everybody comes home soon or later, even if in a box. He said he 
didn't want to wait that long,'' the younger Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is survived by his wife.

<HEADLINE> Kings Re-Sign Barry, Pollard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings re-signed guard  
Jon Barry and forward-center Scot Pollard to multiyear contracts on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kings vice president Geoff Petrie said both had been ``very  
important players for us during our playoff run last season and 
will be key members of our team as we look to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry got a three-year contract and Pollard signed for two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, 30, has averaged 4.4 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.8 assists  
in his seven-year NBA career. In 43 games last season, he averaged 
five points, a career-high 2.2 rebounds, a career-high 2.6 assists, 
1.23 steals, in 17.1 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played in the league for seven years, and I can honestly  
say this is the most fun I've had,'' Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised management for ``keeping a team together that did a  
great job last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First signed as a free agent by the Kings midway through last  
season, the 6-foot-11, 265-pound Pollard averaged 5.1 points, 5.1 
rebounds 1.13 blocks, and 16.2 minutes in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard, 24, who was drafted by Detroit out of Kansas with the  
19th overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, started five games for 
injured Chris Webber during the Kings' drive for the playoffs. He 
averaged 11.2 points, and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollard acknowledged that he'd received ``a couple offers that  
were attractive,'' but added that he didn't want to leave 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great place to live. It's a great place to play.''

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Collection Hits 5th Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Collector Barry Halper smiled proudly as  
strollers stopped by Bergdorf Goodman's Men's Store windows on 
Fifth Avenue Tuesday to gawk at some of his baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Over here was Babe Ruth's luggage and polo cap, over there was  
Joe DiMaggio's jersey and jacket. All of it was mixed in with 
Bergdorf's fashionable suits and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, probably the premier collector of baseball  
paraphernalia, is using Sotheby's to auction off much of the 
material he has assembled over the last half century. And Sotheby's 
is using Bergdorf's windows to display a portion of the items. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the volume of material, more than 100,000 pieces in  
the largest privately owned collection of memorabilia in the world, 
the auction will last a week, Sept. 23-29. The Bergdorf window 
display will be in place until Aug. 16, a sort of appetizer for the 
main course. 
</P>
<P>
	One window is dedicated to Ruth items, another for DiMaggio.  
There is an early baseball window, and another window that includes 
a turnstile from Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the store there are smaller displays for Willie Mays,  
Jackie Robinson and Pete Rose jerseys, caps and spikes. Another 
includes a picture of normally docile Lou Gehrig arguing ewith an 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifetime's work,'' Halper said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Halper said he was not emotional about auctioning it.  
That's because about 20 percent of the collection has been 
purchased by major league baseball and will be on permanent display 
at the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's there forever,'' Halper said. ``I can rest easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, when it came to packing up the rest of his collection for  
Sotheby's, Halper discovered it wasn't so easy to part with some of 
his treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a Ruth contract and I said, `You can't have this.'  
Then I pulled back a Gehrig contract,'' he said. ``One of my kids 
said if I kept pulling things back, it wasn't going to be much of 
an auction. So I put it all back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he kept were the items he prized the most like personally  
signed pictures from DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, who became close 
friends over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there were the Ruth bathroom items, which Halper  
acquired from the Babe's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all have the initals `GHR,' '' Halper said. ``There's a  
hand-held mirror, a shoebrush, a hairbrush and comb, a toothbrush. 
And there was the good luck charm, a nail file. I'd hold it in my 
hand when I watched Yankees games and when they were in a tight 
spot, I'd rub the initials for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife asked if I really thought that helped.''  
</P>
<P>
	Halper just shrugged. He doesn't know, but just in case, he's  
keeping the nail file around.

<HEADLINE> Graf May Play Wimbledon Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD (AP) -- Steffi Graf, winner of 22 Grand Slam titles,  
said it was ``mistake'' when she announced she had played her final 
matches at both Wimbledon and the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, playing in the TIG Classic, said she may have been too  
emotional in deciding not to play again in two of tennis' four 
Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mistake,'' Graf was quoted as saying in Tuesday's San  
Diego Union-Tribune. ``That's the way I felt, and that was my 
immediate response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, defeated Martina Hingis in an emotional three-set  
final at Paris. Moments after leaving the court, Graf told NBC 
Sports that she had played her last French Open match. 
</P>
<P>
	She then made the same pronouncement about Wimbledon after  
losing in the British grass-court championship in the finals to 
Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying she felt pressure to make a statement at Wimbledon, Graf  
said, ``I wish it would have turned out differently.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Agree on $793B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans reached general agreement Tuesday  
night on a plan to cut personal income tax rates and provide relief 
from the marriage penalty as they sculpted a $792 billion measure 
expected to trigger a veto showdown with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deed is done,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said  
after two marathon days of closed-door House-Senate negotiations on 
the item that tops the Republican legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
proposal calls for a gradual cut of 1 percentage point in each 
personal income tax rate. The 15 percent tax bracket would go to 14 
percent, for example, and the 39.6 percent bracket would become 
38.6 percent. That means the percentage reduction would be greater 
at lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, the Republican bill would  
gradually raise the standard deduction for couples until it is 
double the deduction for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, lawmakers decided to widen the current 15 percent  
bracket for couples so it would apply to some income that currently 
is taxed at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders hope to push the measure to final passage by week's  
end, the next step in a veto clash that both the majority party and 
President Clinton seem eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said the final measure would cut the  
personal capital gains tax rate, and then adjust the rates annually 
to discount the effects of inflation. There would be no cut in the 
corporate capital gains tax. The estate tax would be eliminated 
gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	Contribution limits to individual retirement accounts would  
rise. The self-employed would be permitted to deduct the entire 
cost of their health insurance premiums. Medical savings accounts, 
tax-deductible accounts set aside for health-related costs, would 
be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, taxpayers who care for elderly relatives in their  
homes would be eligible for tax credits, and insurance premiums for 
long-term care would be partially tax-deductible for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the broad-based relief would total roughly $400  
billion over the next decade. The provisions designed to offset the 
marriage penalty would save taxpayers another $100 billion, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bow to GOP moderates in the House, the final compromise  
will include a provision making each annual installment of the tax 
rate reductions dependent on a decline in the government's cost of 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials cautioned that some minor adjustments were likely in  
the bill, as aides draft precise language that can fit without 
exceeding the $792 billion price tag.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 65 As Nasdaq Climbs 7 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as takeover  
speculation lifted Internet stocks and buyers returned cautiously 
to a battered market, hoping to find bargain stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 65.22 at 10,711.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, although their gains  
were slim. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.16 at 1,333.21, 
and the Nasdaq composite index was up 7.77 at 2,631.40. 
</P>
<P>
	A report that ExciteAtHome may be acquired by Yahoo! for a price  
greater than ExciteAtHome's $17 billion market value stimulated 
some buying in Internet and telecommunications companies. 
ExciteAtHome rose 4 41/64 to 47 37/64, while Yahoo! slipped 9/16 to 
131 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the broader market, concerns about higher interest rates  
continue to hold most stocks lower amid light volume. Traders have 
become increasingly convinced in the past week that the Federal 
Reserve will raise rates later this month in an effort to cool off 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the Conference Board provided that latest hint  
that the nation's unbridled economic growth is continuing. The 
private New York-based economic research group said its index of 
leading indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its May 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey measures economic trends for the coming three to six  
months, providing analysts with the latest suggestion that 
continued growth will encourage the Fed to raise interest rates to 
prevent inflation from encroaching on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 81.1 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.54 at 626.88, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.83 at 787.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.81 percent.  
European indexes were slightly lower. Germany's DAX index was down 
0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent in afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Online Banking Risks Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the inherent risks of Internet  
banking, nearly half the banks, thrifts and credit unions in a 
survey hadn't taken all the necessary steps to limit risks, 
according to a report by congressional investigators released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But they noted they found no financial losses or security  
breaches in online banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of financial institutions offering Internet banking  
has nearly tripled over the past year, and more than 6 million 
Americans go online to transfer money between accounts, pay bills, 
check account or investment balances and apply for loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers are concerned about the safety and security of  
online banking and the possibility that consumers could lose money 
or have their financial privacy breached by hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American banking system has proven capable of providing  
full security and privacy,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., 
chairman of the House Banking subcommittee on monetary policy. 
``Our challenge is making sure the current rush to technology does 
not outpace that proven ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new report by the General Accounting Office, Congress'  
investigative arm, concludes that Internet banking is by nature 
riskier than conventional banking. The GAO's review of banking 
regulators' examinations of 81 financial institutions found that 35 
of them, about 44 percent, hadn't taken all the risk-limiting steps 
regulators have said are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released at a hearing of Bachus' subcommittee.  
</P>
<P>
	It found, for example, that the boards of directors of some  
financial institutions had failed to approve strategic plans for 
Internet banking, and some institutions lacked policies and 
procedures covering online operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that despite these deficiencies, the review --  
conducted from April 1998 to May 1999 -- didn't turn up any 
financial losses or security breaches in online banking. However, 
the GAO auditors said, the sample of bank examinations reviewed was 
too small to support strong conclusions about the banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatively few examinations have been conducted because Internet  
banking is fairly new and examiners have focused on the banking 
industry's efforts to solve the Year 2000 computer problem, the GAO 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, federal regulators reported Monday  
that 99 percent of the nation's federally insured banks, thrifts 
and credit unions have successfully completed preparations for the 
millennial date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Many major U.S. banks now offer Internet banking, supplementing  
their traditional branch services. In addition, there has been a 
recent push toward virtual, branchless banking, with online 
brokerage firm ETrade acquiring Telebanc Financial for $1.6 billion 
and Bank One launching WingspanBank.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, even with the explosive growth of electronic commerce and  
online investing, most consumers are still somewhat hesitant about 
conducting financial transactions on the Internet, and even more so 
when it comes to managing their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a June report by investment firm Goldman Sachs,  
only as many as 4 percent of U.S. households currently use online 
banking products. That number is expected to jump to about 20 
percent by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Robust Again in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- July was another strong month for U.S. sales of  
cars and light trucks, as consumers took advantage of deep summer 
discounts and kept the industry on pace to break its 13-year-old 
annual sales record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports of the death of the sales boom are exaggerated,''  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. declared Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With most major automakers' July reports in, total industry  
sales were up about 21 percent compared with July 1998. But the 
comparison was skewed by the United Auto Workers strikes that all 
but halted North American production at General Motors Corp. last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, GM posted the biggest percentage gain -- up 63  
percent. But the biggest automaker still managed to carve out only 
28 percent of the U.S. market, significantly below its target for 
the year of more than 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That troubled Wall Street analysts because GM added more  
discounts last month in an effort to boost its share. Much of this 
extended boom in sales is due to heavy spending by automakers on 
rebates, discount leases and finance rates that have caused 
transaction prices on some models to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM is not putting enough money on the table to get to their 30  
percent market share target,'' said David Garrity of Dresdner 
Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG did especially well, with sales up 10 percent  
on robust demand for its Jeep and Dodge sport utility vehicles and 
Dodge Ram pickups. Most Asian and European automakers also had 
impressive gains. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Ford Motor Co. posted only a 1 percent increase on the  
strength of a 10 percent improvement in car sales, excluding Jaguar 
and Volvo. Its truck sales were off 4 percent from a year ago -- its 
first decline in that category after 14 consecutive months of 
record year-over-year increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford blamed the strikes for an unusual 13 percent drop in sales  
of the F-series line of pickups, the nation's best-selling vehicle. 
Ford says it had record F-series sales in July 1998 because the 
strikes, combined with retooling to produce redesigned '99 models, 
severely depleted GM pickup inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we pretty much were the fox in the chicken coop,''  
Ford spokesman George Pipas said. ``The availability of GM trucks 
last year, particularly their full-size pickups, was not at full 
strength. I would not be surprised to see lower F-series sales in 
August as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ford's truck numbers in general were a little soft,'' Healy  
said. ``I think it's primarily that they feasted off GM last year 
to a degree. But there's also not a lot new in the Ford truck line 
versus a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's big SUVs, the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, also were  
down last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 118 Ford Excursion SUVs, the largest passenger truck  
on the market, were sold last month. Sales of the 2000 model are 
expected to become more of a factor as production is ramped up. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it had its best July ever for SUVs and trucks overall.  
Its retail sales numbers, which exclude purchases by business and 
government fleets, were at their highest July level in a decade. 
Despite that, competitors claimed more of the increase in industry 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's redesigned full-size SUVs, led by the Chevrolet  
Suburban, hold the promise to significantly boost GM's share and 
profits. But production of those 2000 models is not expected to hit 
full speed until the fourth quarter, Garrity said. 
</P>
<P>
	At DaimlerChrysler, excluding Mercedes-Benz, car sales were off  
15 percent, but were more than offset by a 20 percent increase in 
truck sales. Jeep Grand Cherokee sales increased 62 percent, while 
the Ram pickup set an all-time monthly record with sales up 29 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automakers shared in the buying frenzy, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. also posted their  
second-best U.S. sales months. Toyota's sales improved 14 percent, 
with a 13 percent gain in sales of the best-selling Camry sedan 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co.'s U.S. rebound continued, with the automaker  
reporting an 8 percent sales increase boosted by healthy demand for 
its pickups and SUVs, including its new Xterra SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's sales also were up 8 percent, with strong demand for its  
redesigned Odyssey minivan and a 14 percent improvement in Accord 
sedan sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring another strike or economic catastrophe, the industry is  
expected to easily surpass the 1986 sales record of about 16.1 
million vehicles set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to start rewriting the record books,'' said Dick  
Colliver, executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co.

<HEADLINE> Michael Douglas Is Still Not Engaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are  
dating but they aren't engaged to marry -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A London tabloid reported this week that an engagement party is  
planned for Sept. 25, but Douglas publicist Allen Burry said 
Tuesday the newspaper apparently confused information about a joint 
birthday party planned that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took it another step and made more out of it than there  
really is,'' Burry said, adding the couple was indeed ``an item'' 
and that they ``do date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both actors' birthday is Sept. 25. Every year, Douglas has a  
party with people who share his birthday, including Barbara Walters 
and Christopher Reeve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when they found out Catherine also shared the  
birthday, they invited her to the party but she was filming and 
couldn't make it,'' Burry said. ``This year, she's going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether an engagement announcement was possible at that  
time, Burry said, ``Well, September's a long way away.''

<HEADLINE> Plan To Buy ABS Global Disclosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEFOREST, Wis. (AP) -- Britain's leading producer of cattle semen  
announced plans Tuesday to buy a Wisconsin biotechnology company 
that gained national attention for successfully cloning a calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Genus PLC of Crewe, England will buy ABS Global from Protein  
Genetics for an undisclosed price. The purchase includes ABS 
headquarters in DeForest, offices in England and facilities in 
Brazil and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale does not include Infigen, the research division that  
cloned a black-and-white Holstein calf named Gene. Infigen was spun 
off following the calf cloning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	ABS Global spokesman Joseph Thompson said the company had been  
pursuing a merger, sale or purchase for several years to improve 
its competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an industry that's sorely in need of consolidation,''  
Thompson said. ``Right now, there's just a huge oversupply of 
product out there -- it's very hard to make a profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABS acquisition is expected to elevate Genus's  
cattle-breeding operations to worldwide status and give it a 
world-class genetics operation. 
</P>
<P>
	ABS ``is recognized by dairy and beef producers all around the  
world for a consistently high quality product lineup and for its 
technological and marketing innovations,'' said Genus chief 
executive Richard Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said no changes were expected in the location of ABS  
headquarters, its name or employment levels in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Protein Genetics Inc. bought ABS in 1994 for $39 million.

<HEADLINE> Cheever Contrite After Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Aside from saying he's sorry, there isn't  
much Eddie Cheever can do to make amends for the darkest moment of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, all he can do is wait to see how the Indy Racing League  
will deal with his attack on rookie Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, angry and frustrated, set out to simply speak to  
Harrington. He wound up manhandling him. A day after the 
confrontation at Dover Downs International Speedway, Cheever was 
filled with regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``My actions were inexcusable,'' he said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Indianapolis 500 champion walked down pit road after  
the Indy Racing League's MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200 to where Harrington 
was seated. Profanities were exchanged, and Cheever admits he 
grabbed Harrington by his racing uniform and lifted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington did not accuse Cheever of going for his throat, but  
said his hands wound up there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got scratches on my neck,'' Harrington, the IRL's  
rookie points leader, said by phone from Pennsylvania, where he was 
attending a picnic for sponsor CertainTeed. 
</P>
<P>
	IRL spokesman Ron Green said Cheever's postrace conduct was  
being scrutinized, and the league might soon have a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever said he wouldn't be surprised by a fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am profoundly embarrassed by what I did,'' he said from  
Indianapolis, where he will compete Friday in the closing event of 
the International Race of Champions series. ``In 25 years of 
racing, I've never had words with anybody that got past the point 
of a discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington conceded that some drivers complained to the IRL  
about his tactics, which he said were being misinterpreted as 
blocking. He also said the league mentioned to him that he was 
shown a blue flag, which he accepted as information the leaders 
were approaching from behind rather than a signal to move over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was set up to run on the bottom of the track, and I  
maintained my line throughout the race,'' he said. ``Behind them 
were some cars I was racing for position, and the leaders could go 
around me on the high side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he criticized Cheever for ``unprofessional conduct''  
for his actions after the race, Harrington insists he bears no 
animosity. He says he is sorry if anyone thought he was blocking, 
and he could have misunderstood the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to put it behind me and get on to the next race,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, 17th in the points standings, is recovering from  
injuries to both legs from a crash during practice nearly two 
months ago in Fort Worth, Texas. He must use crutches or a cane. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking his Infiniti-powered Dallara from the 19th starting  
position to eighth in just 56 of 200 laps, Cheever crashed. He was 
tapped in the rear by rookie John Hollansworth as Cheever and the 
cars immediately in front of him, including Harrington's, slowed in 
heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, who also owns his car, had an accident with Sunday's  
race winner, Greg Ray, a year earlier in the same spot. Robby 
Unser, then driving for Team Cheever, also wrecked in 1998. Cheever 
said that trip to Dover Downs cost him $800,000 of the $1.4 million 
he earned for winning the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident Sunday relegated Cheever to a 21st-place finish. He  
dropped a spot to seventh in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cheever was walking toward Harrington, Unser decided to join  
him. Witnesses said others in the area stepped in to end the 
discord and quoted Unser as telling Harrington: ``It isn't over 
yet. This is just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Unser nor representatives of his Team Pelfrey in  
Indianapolis responded Monday to a voice-mail message.

<HEADLINE> WWF Plans To Sell Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The World Wrestling Federation is hoping  
investors will be drawn to the body slams, pile drivers and 
outrageous stunts that have thrilled pro wrestling fans for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stamford-based company is planning to raise $172.5 million  
in an initial public offering, according to documents filed Tuesday 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the IPO have not yet been determined. The company  
said it will apply to have the shares listed on the Nasdaq under 
the proposed ticker symbol WWFE. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they expect investors will snap up the company's  
shares, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF's Monday night cable television program, ``RAW is WAR,''  
is wildly popular, drawing about 6 million viewers each week. 
Millions more tune in to monthly pay-per-view matches that cost 
about $30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wrestling is all about fans' devotion, and it will make the  
fans more devoted to the product and more loyal if they buy 
stock,'' said Dave Meltzer, who publishes the Wrestling Observer 
newsletter in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller, publisher of the Pro Wrestling Torch Weekly, said  
even people who are not fans of the muscle-bound wrestlers and 
salacious story lines may want to invest in the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
	Some recent story lines have include a wrestling pimp with a  
stable of hookers and a beer-swilling, bird-flipping champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the WWF -- even though it's something of an outlandish  
company in terms of the product it promotes -- can be evaluated just 
as any other IPO should be. It's got a track record like any other 
company,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the SEC, the company listed profits of $56  
million and revenues of $251.5 million in fiscal year 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said 5 million households purchased its pay-per-view  
programs in fiscal '99, bringing in revenues of $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the WWF said it plans to use proceeds from the  
offering for working capital and other business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering is being managed by Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc.,  
Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Wit Capital 
Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF has had a spate of bad publicity recently, most stemming  
from the death of Owen Hart, a wrestler known as The Blue Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart fell to his death May 23 during a stunt for a show in  
Kansas City, Mo. His widow and children have filed a wrongful death 
lawsuit against the WWF, the city and 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Sable, the former women's champion of the WWF, filed a $110  
million lawsuit against her former employer in June. She said she 
was degraded by being asked to participate in a lesbian story line 
and appear in titillating photographs in an effort to sell WWF 
merchandise.

<HEADLINE> Khmer Rouge Trial To Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Lawmakers from Cambodia's top two  
political parties agreed Tuesday on legislation that will allow a 
three-year delay of a genocide tribunal for Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior legislators from Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party  
and junior coalition partner FUNCINPEC said after a meeting that 
both sides support a draft law that will avoid a Sept. 9 deadline 
on a trial for jailed guerrilla chief Ta Mok. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval of the bill is almost assured as the two parties  
control all but 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly. A simple 
majority is needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The objective of the draft law is to seek justice for all  
victims of the genocide regime,'' FUNCINPEC member Monh Saphan said 
of the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge government, when an estimated 1.7 
million people died of starvation, overwork, disease or systematic 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition politicians and human rights groups have bitterly  
opposed the measure, fearing the law could be used to lock up Hun 
Sen's political opponents without trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ta Mok, one of two Khmer Rouge arrested for their role in the  
genocide, was captured by the Cambodian army on March 6 and charged 
three days later under legislation that outlawed the guerrilla 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge was seen as a holding tactic while Cambodia and the  
United Nations negotiated formation of a genocide tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the talks have proceeded slowly, and under Cambodian law a  
suspect must face trial within six months of being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen called Saturday for the legislature to support an  
amendment proposed by his party that would allow a pretrial 
detention period of up to five years if a suspect is charged with 
genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	FUNCINPEC, led by assembly speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh,  
initially balked, but then submitted a counterproposal Tuesday: an 
entirely new law that shortens the deadline for holding a trial to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling party lawmakers approved the bill, which Monh Saphan said  
should reach the full assembly next week.

	Republicans Agree on $792B Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After shuttling in and out of bargaining  
sessions for two days, Republicans reached general agreement 
Tuesday night on a $792 billion plan to cut personal income tax 
rates and provide relief from the marriage penalty. Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott said, ``The deed is done,'' however, the measure 
is expected to trigger a veto showdown with the White House, which 
says the bill would shortchange Social Security and Medicare and 
lead to deep spending cuts in other domestic programs including 
education and health care. GOP officials, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the proposal calls for a gradual cut of 1 
percentage point in each personal income tax rate.

	Flight Delayed Over Security Threat  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal agents delayed the takeoff of a 6 p.m.  
Delta Air Lines flight to Turkey on Tuesday for four hours after 
receiving word that one of the passengers may have been a security 
threat. All of the passengers on the direct flight to Istanbul were 
asked to get off the plane as a security sweep was conducted. 
Passengers were asked to identify their luggage, which had been 
removed from the plane. Seven passengers were questioned, and one 
man detained. The FBI had received information about the man 
earlier in the day as ``a potential threat to national security.'' 
The man was not under arrest, but not free to go.

	Gunshot Injuries Cost $2.3B Per Year  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study found the cost of treating the  
nation's gunshot victims in a recent year was $2.3 billion -- with 
the government footing half the bill. The $2.3 billion figure is an 
estimate of what the nation spent treating gunshot victims in 1994, 
based on data from hospitals in Maryland and New York that year, 
from South Carolina emergency rooms in 1997 and other sources. The 
average cost per injury was $17,000. When a victim was 
hospitalized, the average lifetime cost jumped to $35,000, the 
researchers estimated. This has not been lost on many cities and 
counties -- at least 23 are pursuing gun makers in court to recover 
money spent treating gunshot victims.

	Yugoslav Media Campaign Intensifies

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The speaker of Serbia's parliament  
accused NATO Tuesday of being behind opposition street protests as 
state-run Yugoslav media and senior government officials 
intensified their campaign against the opposition, accusing the 
West of trying to put President Slobodan Milosevic's opponents in 
power. Dragan Tomic said the Western alliance was ``still trying to 
conquer the Serb people'' by demanding democratic changes in Serbia 
and trying to provoke unrest.

	Clinton Gives $55M in Relief  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In the wake of a nationwide heat wave, President  
Clinton gave low income people in nine states some relief Tuesday, 
offering $55 million to help them pay electricity bills or buy 
cooling equipment. He said he hoped the money would help encourage 
older people to run air conditioners without fear of high utility 
bills. Since July 19, the midsummer heat wave has killed at least 
256, including 119 in Illinois. Joined by Mayor Richard Daley, 
Clinton thanked city workers in Chicago for helping to protect 
people from the heat.

	Sunscreens May Increase Cancer Risk  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People using stronger sunscreens increase  
their risk of skin cancer because they don't feel the effects of 
sunburn as quickly and spend more time outside, according to 
findings of a study being published Wednesday in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute. European researchers concluded that 
``sunscreens may encourage prolonged sun exposure because they 
delay sunburn,'' results they said help explain previous studies 
linking sunscreen use with higher skin cancer rates.

Nikkei Stock Average shed 225.91 points, or 1.26 percent, to finish 
the morning session at 17,744.02. In New York, the Dow was up 31.35

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Robin Ventura went 4-for-4 with a homer and  
three RBIs Tuesday night as the New York Mets regained sole 
possession of first place in the NL East with a 10-3 victory over 
the Milwaukee Brewers. The Mets, 15-4 since the All-Star break, 
moved a game in front of the Atlanta Braves, who lost to Pittsburgh 
7-1. Orel Hershiser (11-8) allowed three runs in 7 1-3 innings and 
Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs for New 
York.

<HEADLINE> Six Die in Big-Rig Desert Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BORON, Calif. (AP) -- Six people, including a family of four,  
were killed when three 7 1/2-ton concrete pipes fell from a truck and 
crushed two vehicles along a desert highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucker Richard Sommerville, 59, was booked for investigation of  
drunken driving shortly after the accident early Monday on Highway 
58, California Highway Patrol Officer Todd Weichers said. 
Sommerville was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	A family of four from Redlands was killed when their minivan  
struck the rolling pipes, police reported. A man and woman in a 
Chevrolet were also killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic was diverted around the site about 75 miles north of Los  
Angeles near Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommerville's truck was traveling west, pulling a flatbed  
trailer with the pipes when he entered a curve and straps 
restraining three concrete pipes weighing 15,000 pounds each 
snapped. The pipes were 30 feet long and 3 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pipes fell off the trailer and became airborne,'' Weichers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two vehicles in the eastbound lanes of the highway were struck  
by the pipes, killing all six occupants ``in a heartbeat,'' 
Weichers said.

<HEADLINE> DuBose Family Wants Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The family of a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers  
linebacker who was killed by police officers has initiated an 
independent autopsy and investigation into the shooting after 
witnesses indicated the athlete may have been shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Demetrius DuBose, 28, was shot several times by police officers  
July 24 after he allegedly charged at officers with nunchakus, a 
martial arts weapon that he took away from an officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	But preliminary findings of the family's investigation show  
DuBose was initially calm and cooperated with officers' 
investigation of a burglary call until they began to ``intimidate 
and harass'' him, likely because he was black, said H.J. Sims of 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the police first arrived the gentleman was patient for  
about five to 10 minutes,'' Sims said Monday. ``It was only after 
they tried to place him in handcuffs that the unprofessionalism of 
police allowed the situation to escalate and prompted the gentleman 
to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego City Councilmen George Stevens and Byron Wear are  
calling for a thorough investigation into the shooting to allay any 
concerns that it was unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose had been arrested three times in the past year.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest was June 14, when California Highway Patrol officers  
found DuBose ``very dazed, very confused'' in his car parked on the 
side of a highway near Mammoth Lakes, said Mono County prosecutor 
Tim Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting field sobriety tests and observing ``white  
powdery substance dripping from his nose,'' officers determined he 
was under the influence of PCP, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose became increasingly agitated as the investigation went  
on, but officers were able to get him handcuffed, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose also was reportedly under the influence of an unknown  
drug Feb. 3, when he allegedly forced his way into a Mammoth Lakes 
restaurant after being denied entrance several times, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, DuBose was arrested in South Bend, Ind., after  
he became belligerent at a nightclub. When an off-duty police 
officer ordered him to leave, DuBose allegedly grabbed a pipe from 
an overhead sprinkler system -- flooding the club with some 1,600 
gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens noted some people have said 6-foot-2-DuBose was bending  
over when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others have said he was turning away. I would hope the autopsy  
would show where the first shot entered,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego police Chief David Bejarano said he welcomes outside  
input and expects an internal investigation to be completed within 
two weeks. Results, which will include toxicology results, will be 
turned over to the district attorney's office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers claim DuBose resisted officers' attempts to question  
him and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or other 
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Place Bragg on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Darren Bragg was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday with a torn ligament in 
his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bragg, injured trying to avoid a collision with J.D. Drew,  
likely is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's a problem there, and they're discussing the  
next move,'' manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals called up utility player Craig Paquette, acquired  
on the trade deadline from the New York Mets, from Triple-A 
Memphis. Paquette, who played for La Russa in Oakland from 1993-95, 
went 2-for-4 with a homer, double and three RBIs in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of defensive ability and he's got a nice  
swing,'' La Russa said. ``If he connects, he's got extra-base 
pop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette was overjoyed about the trade, which sent Shawon  
Dunston to the Mets. He said he was New York's insurance policy in 
case third baseman Robin Ventura or first baseman John Olerud got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at their careers, how many things have happened to  
them?'' Paquette said. ``Ventura's been on the DL once and Olerud's 
never been on the DL, so there wasn't much opportunity there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette, who can play first, third and the outfield, had been  
playing for the U.S. team in the Pan American Games. He has a 
career .232 average in six major league seasons with 55 homers and 
195 RBIs in 426 games, and was batting .272 with 15 homers and 54 
RBIs in 70 games for Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Another injured Cardinals player, outfielder Eric Davis,  
attempted to swing off a tee after taking two days off with 
soreness. Davis has been on the disabled list since June 30 with a 
partially torn rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured making a diving catch to help save teammate Jose  
Jimenez's no-hitter June 25. Davis took about 20 swings on 
consecutive days Friday and Saturday then had to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get frustrated,'' Davis said. ``I'm disappointed.''  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, batting .257 with five homer and 30 RBIs in 58 games,  
expects to make a decision on the rest of the season soon. 
Rehabbing hasn't been very effective thus far. Two-and-a-half weeks 
ago, he had zero range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either we're going to have to get it taken care of or rehab it  
and just decide to play,'' Davis said. ``I haven't given up on this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play, I need to play, this team needs me to play.  
It's what I came here for.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Boast of Exposing Tax Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal officials say they have finally  
breached the secrecy surrounding banks in the Cayman Islands with 
the help of a former banker whose records exposed hundreds of U.S. 
citizens as tax cheats. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time banker, John M. Mathewson, 71, was sentenced Monday  
to probation on federal conspiracy and money laundering charges 
after prosecutors credited him for providing an unprecedented look 
at how Cayman banks operate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities said the case shows that the approximately 500  
banks in the British colony exist only to serve as illegal tax 
shelters for a mainly American clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cayman Islands are no longer the safe haven they once  
were,'' said a ranking FBI agent, Robert Jordan. ``This case 
enabled us to get on the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Mathewson's help, the U.S. government has recouped  
$50 million in back taxes and penalties, and can expect to get a 
total of $300 million, according to the former banker's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not confirm those figures, but Jordan said the  
FBI and the Internal Revenue Service are pursuing 1,500 potential 
cases around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although other countries, such as Switzerland, offer tax haven  
accounts, the Caymans and other Caribbean locations are favored by 
U.S. citizens because they are close. The Cayman Islands are 290 
miles south of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. citizens who maintain bank accounts in offshore tax havens  
must report the accounts to the IRS and pay U.S. taxes on income 
received from them. Bank secrecy laws in the Cayman Islands and 
other British colonies are under fire from London, which in March 
insisted they be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities stumbled on the Caymans case by accident while  
pursuing a nationwide investigation into a cable piracy operation, 
according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	When FBI agents arrested Mathewson in San Antonio in 1996, they  
found over a year's worth of computer records from the now-defunct 
Guardian Bank &AMP; Trust Limited of Grand Cayman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson, the bank's owner, immediately offered the records,  
leading to a continuing investigation that has so far brought cases 
in about 20 states, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carney said in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had about 2,000 depositors, and Mathewson dealt  
personally with each and prepared fake documents for shell 
corporations, invoices and other items to help conceal the true 
account holder and the extent of their business, said Paul 
Machalek, chief criminal investigator for the IRS in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Many depositors had legitimate income, including New Jersey  
businessman Mark Vicini, who pleaded guilty to concealing millions 
in Guardian, and Jeffrey Lavigne, a surgeon who treated hemorrhoids 
and advertised on New York City subways as ``M.D. Tush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson pleaded guilty in March 1997 to charges that included  
conspiracy, money laundering and aiding income tax evasions as part 
of plea bargains with federal prosecutors in Florida, New Jersey 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney urged U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner to give  
Mathewson a lenient sentence to acknowledge his cooperation, which 
included testifying to grand juries and obtaining computer software 
to decode bank computer tapes, which were encrypted. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying his cooperation ``has been unparalleled,'' Lechner  
sentenced Mathewson to five years' probation, with six months to be 
served under house arrest, a $30,000 fine and 500 hours of 
community service. He could have faced nearly five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Newest Jaguar Faces Big Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- By now, Lonnie Marts is well aware of  
how the business side of the NFL works. 
</P>
<P>
	But the newest member of the Jacksonville Jaguars has two kids  
and a pregnant wife who are having a difficult time dealing with 
all the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of moves that seems to define pro sports these days,  
the journeyman linebacker was released by the Tennessee Titans last 
Wednesday and signed by the Jaguars on Saturday. They were two 
little-noticed transactions that had a profound effect on four, 
soon to be five, lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you ever get used to it,'' said Marts, a  
nine-year veteran with his fourth team. ``My wife is pregnant, my 
kids are supposed to start school and I'm getting ready to go to 
camp and fight for a job. All of the sudden, I'm released. It's 
kind of a cutthroat business. But this sport throws curve balls at 
you, and you adjust on the run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marts' release from the Titans had the economics side of pro  
football written all over it. Tennessee needed to free money to 
sign its first-round draft pick, linebacker Jevon Kearse, and 
free-agent quarterback Neil O'Donnell. They parted with a 
mid-priced linebacker and hoped to re-sign him for less money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville stepped in with an offer after Bryce Paup went down  
with an injury, leaving the Jaguars too young and thin at the 
position for coach Tom Coughlin to stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lonnie Marts gains people's attention, lets everyone know  
we're very serious about making sure we have quality players at 
that spot,'' Coughlin said. ``There's competition there and 
wherever you have competition, you're going to have a good camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marts will make good money -- up to $1.1 million if all his  
incentives kick in -- but that won't make the emotional side of the 
move any easier on his growing family. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter is 6 years old, his son is 3 and his wife is six  
months' pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough, because the Jaguars called and I had to make a  
decision within two hours or so,'' Marts said. ``Then, you've got 
to explain to the children that we've got to move. We won't see our 
friends anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Marts, the Jaguars get a versatile player who has experience  
at all three linebacker positions. He started 15 games last season, 
made a career-high 85 tackles and led Tennessee's anemic pass rush 
with four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	His presence lets Jacksonville move Joel Smeenge back to his  
natural line position. It also gives the team the flexibility of 
moving Paup, once he's healthy, onto the line in certain situations 
and sticking Marts behind him at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy we've been very pleased with in the couple of  
practices we've had,'' Coughlin said. ``By the time this thing is 
over, we'll be very happy we have Lonnie Marts in our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marts hopes the move will be just as beneficial to him. He says  
the Jaguars give him something he hasn't had since his first years 
in Kansas City: good structure and a chance to win a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time since I've been with a quality  
organization,'' Marts said. ``Everybody here is in sync. Any player 
who is out of shape or doesn't care about winning isn't allowed on 
the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't thrilled with his situation in Tennessee, which made  
coming to Jacksonville a choice he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, Tennessee was in disarray,'' Marts said. ``To go from  
Tennessee to Jacksonville overnight is a big change right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more than one way.

	Leading Economic Indicators Rise  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A widely-watched indicator of future economic  
activity rose 0.3 points in June, chalking up gains in eight out of 
the past nine months and signaling that the U.S. economy could be 
in its longest expansion ever. The Conference Board, a private New 
York-based economic research group, reported today that its index 
of leading indicators stood at 107.7 in June, up from 107.4 in May. 
The index also rose by the same amount in May. The last decline, in 
April, was 0.1.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved lower today after a higher opening.  
Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 
2.21 at 10,643.75. Broader stock indicators were also lower. The 
Nasdaq composite index was down 28.97 at 2,594.66. A report that 
ExciteAtHome may be acquired by Yahoo! for a price greater than 
ExciteAtHome's $17 billion market value stimulated some buying in 
Internet and telecommunications companies. ExciteAtHome rose 4 
41/64 to 47 37/64, while Yahoo! slipped 9/16 to 131 3/4.

	Yahoo! May Buy Excite/AtHome  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Excite/AtHome may be on the market. BusinessWeek  
Online reports the company has held preliminary talks with Yahoo! 
over the past six weeks. The report cites sources who say they've 
been discussing a deal in which Yahoo! would pay an amount far 
greater than Excite/AtHome's current market value of $17 billion. 
But the sources say the talks are preliminary, and that much work 
remains to be done.

	Mazda Sells Loan Subsidiary to Ford  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. will sell its credit arm  
to Ford Motor Co.'s finance subsidiary for 8 billion yen, or $69 
million, Mazda said today. The deal, to be completed by the end of 
August, will make Mazda Credit Corp. a subsidiary of Ford Motor 
Credit Co., the world's largest auto finance firm. Mazda Credit 
provides loans for people who buy Mazda cars. The company has 
annual sales of about $87 million. Ford owns 33.4 percent of 
Hiroshima-based Mazda.

	Jones Apparel To Cut 1,900 Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jones Apparel Group Inc. will slash about 1,900  
jobs and close three factories in an attempt to reduce costs as it 
integrates leading footwear maker Nine West into its business. 
Jones, which is best known for its Jones New York, Saville and 
Evan-Picone labels, bought Nine West in June in a $1.5 billion deal 
that created one of the biggest clothing and shoe manufacturers in 
the country. Jones said today that it would close Nine West 
factories in Kentucky, Indiana, and the Dominican Republic. In 
addition, Jones will close Nine West's administrative office in St. 
Louis and will merge those operations into Jones' headquarters in 
Bristol, Pa., and Nine West's headquarters in White Plains, N.Y.

	St. Paul Cos. To Cut 1,000 Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The St. Paul Cos. plans to cut about  
1,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce expenses by $100 million 
next year in the highly competitive insurance industry. Most of the 
cuts will be identified in the third quarter and will be completed 
by the end of this year, the company announced today. The St. Paul 
expects to take a related charge in the third quarter of 1999. The 
company will provide severance pay for affected employees and will 
help them find other jobs, he said. The new layoffs are separate 
from actions associated with the company's pending sale of its 
personal insurance operations to MetLife Auto and Home.

	President of Money Store Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Templeton, president and chief  
executive of The Money Store consumer finance unit of First Union 
Corp., has resigned. First Union bought the consumer finance 
company last year for $2.1 billion. The unit hasn't added to 
earnings as the bank promised when the purchase was made and First 
Union has laid off hundreds of Money Store employees this year in 
companywide job cuts. First Union said yesterday that Money Store 
accounting changes would lower bank earnings this year by 8 cents 
to 12 cents a share.

	KLM Profit Slides 64 Percent

<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Profits at the Dutch flag carrier  
KLM tumbled 64 percent in its first fiscal quarter, excluding a 
one-time gain, a decline the company blamed on an overall slowdown 
in the global airline industry. Without the one-time gain of $433.8 
million on the sale of its stake in Galileo International, a global 
airline ticketing company, KLM earned $37.2 million compared to 
$102.4 million in the same period a year ago.

	Asian Stock Markets Close Higher  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher today,  
with the key index rising in Tokyo after two straight sessions of 
declines. The Japanese 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 144.23 
points, or 0.81 percent, to close at 17,969.93. The Jakarta Stock 
Exchange's Composite Index surged 22.473 points, or 3.8 percent, to 
618.986. In Taipei, the main index plunged more than 3 percent 
before buying by government funds erased most of the losses. The 
Taiwan market's key Weighted Stock Price Index slipped 20.75 
points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,175.19. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 
rose 38.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,473.84.

<HEADLINE>  Storm Kills At Least 35 in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Gales uprooted trees and flipped cars  
on a tourist island in South Korea today after three days of 
flooding farther north in the country left at least 35 people dead 
and 22 missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Floodwaters also inundated thousands of homes in the  
Philippines, where reservoirs in Manila spilled over today. One 
Manila suburb, Malabon, was 90 percent flooded, with water rising 
to shoulder-level in some parts, said city spokesman Abbi Balatbat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers swelled and rice fields became lakes amid persistent rain  
in parts of Asia, forcing people to flee low-lying areas, postpone 
air travel and escape from flooded homes carrying their 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's new storm in the Yellow Sea dumped 9 inches of rain and  
blew with 67 mph winds as it skirted South Korea's southern and 
western coasts. It was a setback to rescue workers who have 
struggled to feed and shelter thousands left homeless by heavy 
rains north of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the weekend, floods have forced tens of thousands to flee  
towns and villages between the South Korean capital and the border 
with North Korea, 35 miles away. A total 35 people have been 
killed, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of tourists were stranded on the resort island of  
Cheju, south of the Korean peninsula, after four domestic airliners 
hastily flew to Seoul early today to avoid damage, and hundreds of 
homes on the island were flooded when today's rains hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the new storm, things are going from bad to worse,''  
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said at a Cabinet meeting, 
according to a transcript of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a flooded area of Choonchun city, about 95 miles northeast of  
Seoul, a tour bus slid off a rain-slick road into a river, killing 
five people and injuring 31, rescue workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm hit land on North Korea late today, South Korean  
weather officials said. North Korean radio warned it could cause 
crop damage in the country's traditional breadbasket in the 
southwest and blow through the capital, Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, three days of monsoon rains have left at  
least 27 dead and six missing, and floodwaters were still rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said nine people were killed in landslides and 18  
drowned. Nearly 12,000 homes were flooded, forcing the evacuation 
of some 60,000 people in the central part of Luzon island, 
including the metropolitan area of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine President Joseph Estrada declared a state of  
emergency in the Manila area and three nearby provinces -- 
Pangasinan, Pampanga and Rizal -- opening the way for government 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Water spilled over the banks of La Mesa Dam, which provides  
water to the Manila region, and officials urged downstream 
residents to leave right away. 
</P>
<P>
	But hundreds of squatter families who live along river refused  
to move because of fears their shacks might be looted while they 
were gone, disaster officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The victims here are the poor people, the squatters,'' Estrada  
said. ``So that is my top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flooded streets, many waist-deep with muddy water, paralyzed  
traffic in metropolitan Manila, where schools were closed and 
financial markets suspended for the day. Some residents had to 
perch on rooftops to await rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The monsoon rains and winds were forecast to continue to batter  
the Philippines for several more days. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding in eastern Thailand, meanwhile, has killed at least  
five people and left at least 1,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground floor of the two-story Chanthaburi prison was under  
three feet of water today, forcing authorities to order an 
evacuation of 300 of the 1,200 inmates to relieve crowding. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates waded to buses and were driven to jail facilities in  
other, drier provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vietnam, 24 people have died and 25 others are still missing  
after downpours flooded parts of central provinces last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwestern Cambodia, police said today that about 200 yards  
of Route 4, a key highway, was underwater, halting traffic to and 
from Sihanoukville Port. 
</P>
<P>
	Floodwaters were receding on China's Yangtze River after  
rainfall eased. Heavy rains have hit many parts of central China 
this summer, forcing 140,000 military police to help out with flood 
fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	No reports were available on casualties or damage in recent  
days. But state-run media said 300 people have been killed in 
flooding throughout the summer.

<HEADLINE> Rory Kennedy Weds in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Rory Kennedy, whose wedding was called off  
after the death of her cousin John F. Kennedy Jr., was married in a 
private ceremony at the home of a Greek shipping magnate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy married Mark Bailey late Monday on the grounds of  
the family compound of shipowner Vardis Vardinoyiannis in the 
exclusive northern Athens suburb of Ekali, ``in a close family 
circle,'' Vardinoyiannis' office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	His office would not confirm or deny media reports that the  
couple had left on a honeymoon cruise aboard the Vardinoyiannis 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	Footage broadcast by the private Skai television channel showed  
distant images of a blond woman in a white wedding gown boarding a 
yacht, reportedly a Vardinoyiannis family motor cruiser, at 2 a.m. 
after getting out of a dark limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister Lauren  
Bessette were killed July 16 when their plane crashed en route to 
Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod for Ms. Kennedy's wedding. The 
wedding, which had been scheduled at the family compound in Hyannis 
Port, Mass., on July 17, was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The small number of guests at Monday night's ceremony reportedly  
included Ms. Kennedy's mother, Ethel Kennedy, as well as 
Vardinoyiannis and his wife, Marianna Vardinoyiannis, who are 
family friends. Their office declined to release a guest list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, 30, is the last of 11 children born to Ethel and  
the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. She was born after her father was 
assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Vardinoyiannis is the representative here of the  
Washington-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial foundation and is on 
the board of directors of the Special Olympics, which was founded 
by one of the bride's aunts, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vardinoyiannis compound, which covers a whole block in the  
leafy suburb, is surrounded by a nine-foot-high wall, and several 
guards kept media at a distance Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Candles lined the driveway leading to a reception area, while  
the sounds of Frank Sinatra music and the clinking of glasses could 
be heard coming from inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Skai, Ethel Kennedy was to return to the United  
States soon after the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ties between the Kennedys and the Vardinoyiannis family  
reportedly go back several years. In 1993, Mary Courtney Kennedy, 
an elder sister of the bride, married Paul Hill on the same yacht, 
the Varmar VE. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedys have been frequent guests on the Varmar VE -- most  
recently, Maria Shriver and her husband Arnold Schwarzenegger, who 
were reportedly on board last month. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Athens daily Eletheros Typos, Mr. and Mrs.  
Vardinoyiannis, who had been invited to the Hyannis Port wedding, 
suggested using the yacht for the ceremony to Ethel Kennedy after 
JFK Jr.'s death.

<HEADLINE> Boy Killed at Rainier National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHFORD, Wash. (AP) -- A 7-year-old boy on an annual parental  
visit was apparently killed by his father in a murder-suicide at 
Mount Rainier National Park, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Boyd's body was found around noon Monday about 50 yards  
downstream from the Christine Falls Bridge, on the mountain's south 
flank, and about 100 yards from where the body of his father, 
36-year-old Billy Boyd, was found late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Boyd, a carpenter from Tacoma, left a suicide note in his  
car parked near the bridge saying he intended to take his and his 
son's life, according to park spokeswoman Maria Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce County medical investigators have not determined how the  
boy and man died. The boy's body has not been positively identified 
yet, but officials believe it is Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign of trauma, no indication weapons were  
used,'' Park Ranger Randy Brooks said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say they believe the father jumped with his son --  
or he pushed him and then jumped -- from the 125-foot-high bridge 
into the icy stream which cascades through a rocky gorge, swollen 
by the melting snowpack. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they knew of no motive.  
</P>
<P>
	Boyd's son was paying his annual visit from Katy, Texas, under a  
custodial agreement with Boyd's former wife, but ``it did not 
appear there was anger related to the mother,'' Brooks said. The 
couple divorced six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members who read the suicide note said Billy Boyd felt  
deserted and wanted to kill himself. But he didn't want to leave 
his son behind, so the father planned to kill the boy, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials say Boyd had taken his son camping on Thursday.  
They were supposed to return Saturday and the boy was to fly home 
to his mother in Texas. She reported them missing Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' FB Crockett Breaks Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders will be without free  
agent fullback Zack Crockett from four to six weeks because of a 
broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders announced Tuesday that Crockett, a versatile running  
back and special teams player who split last season between 
Indianapolis and Jacksonville, broke a bone in his right foot 
during a special teams practice late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Crockett didn't regard it as serious until X-rays  
were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I twisted it when my foot got stuck in the ground,'' said  
Crockett, who signed a four-year, $45 million contract with Oakland 
in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate, but we hope to have him back as quickly as  
we can,'' said coach Jon Gruden, who had hoped to shore up the 
Raiders' short-yardage problems of last season with the 6-foot-2, 
245-pound Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a guy we were looking at in a lot of situations,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden said it is possible the Raiders will look for a temporary  
replacement outside the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the void will have to be filled with less experienced  
candidates in camp, including Jon Ritchie, who started at fullback 
as a rookie last year, Jermaine Williams, a second-year player; and 
Randy Jordan, a six-year veteran who rushed for 159 yards on 47 
carries last season as a reserve.

<HEADLINE> GOP OKs 'Marriage Penalty' Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans neared agreement Tuesday night on  
a plan to cut personal income tax rates and provide relief from the 
marriage penalty as they sculpted a $792 billion measure expected 
to trigger a veto showdown with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said negotiators for the House  
and Senate hoped for a general accord on tax cuts by day's end, 
adding, ``That's good for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
proposal being crafted behind closed doors called for a gradual cut 
of one percentage point in each personal income tax rate. The 15 
percent tax bracket would go to 14 percent, for example, and the 
39.6 percent bracket would become 38.6 percent. That means the 
percentage reduction would be greater at lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	To alleviate the marriage penalty, the Republican bill was  
expected gradually to raise the standard deduction for couples 
until it is double the level permitted for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, lawmakers were expected to propose widening the  
current 15 percent bracket for couples so it would apply to some 
income that currently is taxed at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders hope to push the measure to final passage by week's  
end, the next step in a veto clash that both the majority party and 
President Clinton seem eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said the final measure also was expected to  
provide a cut in the personal capital gains tax rate, and then to 
adjust the rates annually to discount the effects of inflation. 
There would be no cut in the corporate capital gains tax. The 
estate tax would be eliminated gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	Contribution limits to individual retirement accounts would  
rise. The self-employed would be permitted to deduct the entire 
cost of their health insurance premiums. Medical savings accounts, 
tax-deductible accounts set aside for health-related costs, would 
be more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, taxpayers who care for elderly relatives in their  
homes would be eligible for tax credits, and insurance premiums for 
long-term care would be partially tax-deductible for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Precise details were unavailable on these or numerous other  
provisions in the emerging compromise taking shape in private 
meetings in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Republicans and aides shuttled in and out, and others  
were consulted by phone, but there was no place for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. the senior Democrat on the  
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, invited himself briefly into 
the closed-door GOP deliberations in a bit of political theater. 
``It's like having two Christmas lists, and you select the best 
from each list knowing that Santa is not coming,'' he said in a 
reference to Clinton's promised veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., were  
pressing to have the compromise passed through the House and Senate 
by week's end, to permit rank-and-file lawmakers to trumpet the 
advantages of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	Only when lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day would  
the bill be sent to the White House for Clinton's expected veto, 
although some Republicans practically taunted Clinton to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not give up on the possibility that he will sign (tax  
cuts). But if he vetoes them, we think he'll find he's disappointed 
the American people,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Clinton ``is a man who will disappoint everyone in  
his life except his pollster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters that ``maybe the president will conclude at  
some point that he needs to work with us.'' For now, he added, ``I 
just don't see it happening, so we have to go forward with doing 
what we think is right for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats oppose a bill of the  
magnitude favored by Republicans, saying it would shortchange 
Social Security and Medicare and lead to deep spending cuts in 
other domestic programs including education and health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has repeatedly termed the GOP proposals risky and said  
that because they rely on anticipated surpluses, the tax cuts could 
return the nation to a new era of deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, there remained scattered signs of a desire to  
compromise before the bill goes to the White House for a veto. Sen. 
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, released a letter to Lott urging that a 
final House-Senate deal be held up in hopes there could be a 
``negotiated, bipartisan agreement ... achieved in September that 
ultimately addresses a variety of needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, other Republicans expressed similar sentiments, but  
there was no immediate indication they were having an impact on the 
leaders' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, senior Republicans were in contact with potential  
pockets of resistence to final passage. Moderate Republicans in the 
House, for example, were consulted about their demand that 
broad-based tax relief be made conditional on a reduction in the 
national debt or interest payments. One lawmaker, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said the party leaders suggested several 
possible alternatives for making the cuts conditional, but none 
involved the debt. The group decided to hold firm and was sending a 
letter to that effect to senior Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a narrow majority of 222-211 with one  
independent and one vacancy in the House, and a majority of 54-45 
with one independent in the Senate. If Democrats oppose the tax 
bill en masse, the GOP has little room for error on final votes.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Tests N.Y. Local Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is quietly offering local telephone service  
to some consumers in New York, becoming the second major 
long-distance company to enter that Bell Atlantic market this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Opting for a more gradual approach than MCI WorldCom, AT&AMP;T is  
looking to sign up just 6,000 of its 5 million New York customers 
at first, and only in the New York City area and Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said Tuesday it began calling up its long-distance  
customers in those markets on Monday evening, offering a fixed-rate 
package for local and long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	For $24.90 a month, an AT&AMP;T customer in New York can get 75  
hours of local calling time and long-distance service for an 
additional 10 cents per minute. Bell Atlantic mostly charges by the 
call in the New York City area and has varying flat-rate packages 
in other parts of the state, so price comparisons can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom introduced local service in New York back in  
February, offering a package of 100 calls for $14.99 a month in the 
New York City area and $19.99 in less densely populated areas where 
Bell Atlantic charges more to lease its lines. In early June, MCI 
WorldCom reported having 75,000 local customers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's maneuver, its first local offering to most New York  
consumers in 15 years, comes amid a bitter, state-by-state battle 
between long-distance providers and regional ``Baby Bell'' 
monopolies created by the government in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic and the other Bells have been pushing hard for  
government clearance to sell long-distance to their residential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	They insist that rivals can now easily lease the Bell wires  
connected to people's homes and sell local service -- the main goal 
of a 1996 law designed to spark competition and choice consumers 
now enjoy in long-distance calling. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint charge that the Bells are  
still too slow and unreliable in filling orders for customers 
wanting to switch their local service. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, despite the new initiative into New York and an  
existing one in Texas, the main thrust of AT&AMP;T's overall strategy 
is to provide telephone and Internet service through cable TV wires 
rather than the Bell networks. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has committed more than $100 billion to that plan, having  
decided that ownership of the connections to people's homes is 
preferrable to leasing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, AT&AMP;T has assembled a ``local'' network  
covering about 60 percent of the country, buying two of the 
nation's four biggest cable companies and partnering up with the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
	But, since it's unlikely that regulators would allow AT&AMP;T to  
create a national cable monopoly, the company will need to lease 
some Bell lines to reach consumers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Battle Over Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- What if they spent the budget surplus and then  
none appeared? 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his congressional Republican rivals stand  
a chance of learning the answer as they fight over what to do with 
$1 trillion in projected surpluses over the next decade. Here are 
some questions and answers about the huge, anticipated flow of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How big is the surplus supposed to be, and where does it come  
from? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Both the Congressional Budget Office and the White House's  
Office of Management and Budget anticipate surpluses totaling $2.9 
trillion over the next decade. Each says $1.9 trillion will come 
from Social Security, which is building up reserves for the 
retirement of the baby boomers. The remaining $1 trillion comes 
from the rest of the budget, they say, and it is this piece of the 
surplus that Clinton and Republicans are vying over. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Are these surplus estimates sound?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Analysts say the economic and technical assumptions CBO and  
OMB relied on seem largely solid. Yet everyone also concedes it is 
impossible to predict how the economy will behave, how many wars 
and hurricanes there will be, and the nature of political pressures 
on spending or taxes over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the projections have an immediate, significant  
flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO and OMB assume current laws will be obeyed, usually a  
prudent supposition. But in this case, they assume spending limits 
enacted in 1997 will be honored each of the next three years -- 
which no one believes will occur. The limits expire after 2002, and 
the budget agencies assume that spending will then grow along with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How significant is the erroneous assumption that spending  
limits will be honored? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Critics say it is crucial.  
</P>
<P>
	The spending limits clamp down on the one-third of the $1.8  
trillion budget that includes everything but automatic payments 
such as Social Security and interest on the national debt. The 
limits would gradually reduce spending in this portion of the 
budget through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers are showing an appetite to increase spending, not  
cut it. If spending simply grows at the rate of inflation, nearly 
$750 billion -- or three-fourths -- of the projected 10-year 
non-Social Security surpluses disappear, says the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning policy group. 
</P>
<P>
	If lawmakers also wind up approving so-called emergency spending  
at the same average rate as they have recently, nearly 90 percent 
of the $1 trillion surplus vanishes, the center says. Emergency 
spending is extra spending exempted from the spending limits but 
paid for from the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Have lawmakers obeyed the spending limits in the past?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No. So far in fiscal 1999, which began last Oct. 1, Clinton  
and Congress have approved $34 billion in emergency spending, all 
of which will come from the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about the coming year?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Lawmakers are threatening to use even more of the surplus in  
fiscal 2000 than they have for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have declared the $4.5 billion cost of the  
upcoming census an emergency, and used another $4.5 billion of the 
surplus for their proposed tax cut. Senate Republicans want $7 
billion in emergency farm aid while Democrats prefer $11 billion -- 
more surplus spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, final fiscal 2000 spending is expected to end up  
being far more than many of the GOP-written bills now call for 
following likely bargaining this fall with Clinton. In the most 
glaring example, the biggest bill of all -- a $300 billion measure 
financing health and education agencies -- is now nearly $20 billion 
below what Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Any other gimmicks?  
</P>
<P>
	A: House Republicans have ordered the Congressional Budget  
Office to use certain more favorable estimates by the White House 
budget office, for a savings of $15 billion. If CBO's more 
conservative estimates turn out to be right, that money will also 
come out of the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	And all of that excludes the costs of unforeseen natural  
disasters, and moves afoot to create prescription drug benefits and 
roll back some savings imposed on Medicare payments to nursing 
homes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So what would happen if they planned to use the surplus for  
tax cuts and spending but no surplus appeared? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Just like the bad old days left only two years ago, there  
would be a budget deficit. And once again, the politicians would be 
left to wrestle with how to get out of a deep fiscal hole.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Indicted for Mailing Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Three people from Northern Ireland  
and a another from the Irish Republic were indicted Tuesday on 
charges they bought guns in Florida and mailed them to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men, one of whom is allegedly connected to the Irish  
Republican Army, were indicted on charges of violating the Arms 
Export Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the defendants bought 44 handguns from a Boynton Beach  
gun dealer and the group then mailed 15 of the weapons, without 
export licenses or proper authorization, to different addresses in 
Ireland, according to a federal indictment handed down Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Named in the indictment were Siobhan Browne, an Irish citizen  
living in South Florida; and Anthony Smyth, Conor Anthony Claxton 
and Martin Mullan, all citizens of the United Kingdom and Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal prosecutor said Claxton admitted involvement with the  
Irish Republican Army, but Claxton's attorney denied the claim and 
authorities have acknowledged they have not confirmed if the men 
are affiliated with IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	All four were charged with conspiracy to export firearms without  
a license or approval, exporting the guns without export licenses 
or written approval, and using the U.S. Postal Service to illegally 
export the handguns.

<HEADLINE> Senate Fights Over Training Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A legislative fight over teacher training  
opened in the Senate Tuesday as Republicans introduced legislation 
to turn President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new teachers into 
grants for states to educate and hire teachers as they please. 
</P>
<P>
	States know best whether they need more teachers, better-trained  
teachers or a combination of the two, Senate Republicans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By focusing solely on classroom size, the Clinton  
administration fails to recognize that teacher quality, not 
classroom size, is the most important factor in determining student 
performance,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who is sponsoring 
legislation similar to a bill passed by the House last month, 
239-185. Clinton has said he would veto that measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after Republicans finished presenting the House's  
counterpart legislation, Senate Democrats accused the GOP of going 
back on what they said was a bipartisan agreement last year to 
reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican proposal forces communities to choose between  
spending funds on improving teacher quality or reducing class 
sizes,'' said Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. ``This is a false choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new teachers survived the  
year-end 1998 budget negotiations, but last month, 24 House 
Democrats joined majority Republicans Tuesday to convert the 
program into block grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the block grant legislation say it provides more  
``quality control'' over who is hired and how they are trained than 
Clinton's plan. But opponents say it represents less of a 
commitment to concentrate new teachers on lower grades, where class 
size matters most. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gregg, the Senate bill would require states and  
local government to set forth a plan for making districts and 
schools accountable for meeting performance standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate versions would authorize $2 billion  
annually for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest groups complained that the Senate bill holds districts,  
schools and teachers to lower standards on content knowledge and 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill represents a giant step backwards in the national  
effort to ensure that every American student has a fully qualified 
teacher,'' said Kati Haycock of The Education Trust, a 
Washington-based research and advocacy group promoting academic 
achievement.

<HEADLINE> Boilermakers Mourn Tiffany Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue's 1999 national championship women's basketball team was  
a family. Tiffany Young's death hit the members hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very tight Purdue family, and this is a devastating  
loss,'' said her former coach Carolyn Peck, now with the WNBA's 
Orlando Miracle. ``Tiffany's smile could brighten up a room and she 
will be physically missed, but she will always be a part of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers program was reeling Monday as news spread of  
Young's death in a traffic accident over the weekend when the car 
she was in was struck by a drunk driver. The 5-foot-11 guard played 
a reserve role on Purdue's national championship team, and players 
and coaches remembered her as a special presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany was an extremely integral member of our team and will  
be dearly missed,'' player Katie Douglas said. ``She will be missed 
as a teammate, but more so as a friend who was always there to give 
love and support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young started all 33 of Purdue's games during her sophomore  
season, but was relegated to reserve duty last year with the 
emergence of Douglas in a three-guard lineup that included 
Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs. The senior averaged 3.3 
points and 1.5 rebounds in her career with the Boilermakers, 
including 2.1 points last season, when she played sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
	During the national championship game, Young held hands with  
White-McCarty on the Purdue bench after she sprained her ankle and 
missed the last four minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed when I heard the tragic news of Tiffany's  
death, and I am still at a loss for words to describe how I feel 
about her being gone,'' said White-McCarty, now with the WNBA's 
Charlotte Sting. ``She was such a good person, with nothing but 
love in her heart for everybody, and she cannot be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young died Saturday night after visiting the family of her  
boyfriend, Neil Sinclair, in Gary, Ind. Sinclair, who was driving, 
was in the intensive care unit at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The other driver, Arnold Eaton, 33, of Great Lakes, Ill., had a  
blood-alcohol content of 0.30 percent and sustained minor injuries 
in the crash, police said. He was being held on a $10,000 bond by 
the Lake County Sheriff's Department on a charge of operating while 
intoxicated resulting in death. His two passengers were 
hospitalized in stable condition with numerous broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Young is to be buried Thursday in her hometown of Hillsboro,  
Ala., and Purdue spokeswoman Kathleen Offer said the school was 
working on plans for a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Purdue family has lost a child, but Tiffany will always  
remain in our hearts. We will carry her love for each of us, and 
she will be our guardian angel into the future,'' assistant coach 
Kerry Cremeans said.

<HEADLINE> Credit, Debit Cards Compared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Like most people, I have several credit cards that I use  
regularly. Should I consider getting a debit card, too? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Roughly four out of five American families use credit cards  
to purchase everything from groceries to gasoline. Many of those 
same families also are finding that debit cards can be as 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit cards let you charge purchases and pay for them later --  
with interest, of course, if the balance is not paid in full each 
month. With debit cards, the money for a purchase is subtracted 
immediately from your bank or brokerage accounts. That makes debit 
cards akin to paying with cash or a check. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an option that virtually all consumers should consider,''  
says Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation 
of America in Washington, D.C. ``It allows for sounder financial 
management because you can't spend what you don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans already have spent a lot more than they have. The  
Federal Reserve recently reported that consumer credit outstanding 
hit $1.34 trillion in May. And that figure doesn't even include 
mortgage debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Debit card use has been on the rise, too. VISA International,  
the world's largest card-processing system, says debit cards now 
account for nearly a quarter of its transaction volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that deal with debit cards -- which can be used to buy  
goods or to get cash from Automated Teller Machines -- emphasize 
their advantages over cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk about speed, convenience and security,'' says Tracy  
Connelly, a vice president at VISA USA, which processes Check Card 
debit cards for member banks. 
</P>
<P>
	She notes that debit card holders can buy gasoline at a service  
station or purchase groceries with the swipe of a card. ``You don't 
have to worry about carrying cash or making it to a cash machine,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An added advantage, she said, is that debit card transactions  
show up on your monthly bank statements, ``which helps in budget 
tracking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What if a debit card is lost? Most issuers limit a card holder's  
liability to the same $50 level applied to credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Hirschhorn, senior vice president for new products at Chase  
Manhattan Bank, says use of the bank's debit card has grown 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	She says people generally start at the grocery store and the gas  
station. ``Then they begin to realize it's accepted at department 
stores, drug stores, just about everywhere. We're even beginning to 
see use at some mail order houses and a number of Internet sites,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Chase has added a bonus: Debit card holders can  
earn frequent flyer miles on Continental Airlines each time they 
use their cards.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Makers Lose Money Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a quiet section of an otherwise busy  
Hughes Electronics Corp. assembly plant, a satellite intended to 
link cellular phone systems across Asia sits unfinished, a casualty 
of deteriorating relations between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has meant a $450 million loss for Hughes -- the  
lion's share of an estimated $500 million that tighter scrutiny of 
technology exports has cost U.S. satellite makers. 
</P>
<P>
	That could grow to more than $8 billion industry-wide over the  
next five years if the government bans satellite sales to China, 
according to the Washington-based Satellite Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials complain the crackdown on technology exports  
is creating a licensing logjam that has made it tough to do 
business even with U.S. allies. And, they say, China is taking its 
business to U.S. competitors, further hurting their bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hysteria over the Chinese situation has painted everybody  
with the same brush,'' said Douglas Heydon, president of Ariane 
Space Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the European space consortium 
Arianespace S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of non-U.S. customers are saying it's becoming too  
difficult to deal with U.S. manufacturers and they're seriously 
considering not doing it any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since March, Orbital Sciences of Dulles, Va., hasn't been able  
to exchange technical information with its Canadian subsidiary, 
MacDonald-Detweiler, about a $160 million satellite project for the 
Canadian Space Agency. The agency has hinted it may drop Orbital 
for a non-U.S. company. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Ariane projects also have been slowed because American  
companies are reluctant to share information with European 
customers, Heydon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, U.S. companies stand on the sidelines as China  
solicits bids elsewhere for new communication satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors likely to pick up the slack include Germany's  
DaimlerChrysler, French companies Alcatel and Aerospatiale Matra 
and Japan's Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been told the intention (of tighter controls) was not to  
stop selling satellites to China, but to deal with national 
security issues involved in the launch,'' said Clay Mowry, 
executive director of the Satellite Industry Association. ``We hope 
that's true. What you do is end up giving the market to other 
suppliers and not denying anyone communications ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is under investigation along with Loral Corp. by the  
Justice Department for allegedly helping China improve its 
ballistic missiles. Hughes took the loss on the cell phone 
satellite after the State Department raised concerns that this 
project also could benefit the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies contend they complied fully with export  
regulations, and that no information was transferred that would 
affect U.S. security. Hughes' satellite business remains strong 
with $4 billion in back orders. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Hughes-Loral investigation, U.S.-China  
relations have been damaged by the Democratic fund-raising scandal 
and congressional findings that Chinese spies have systematically 
stolen American nuclear weapons technology.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Robust Again in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Never has the auto industry enjoyed such a  
sustained cycle of healthy U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's sales of cars and light trucks are expected to  
easily exceed the record of about 16.1 million vehicles set in 
1986. That would be an unprecedented sixth consecutive year of 
strong sales. July's results reported Tuesday gave no indication of 
a slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nirvana,'' said James P. Holden, executive vice president  
of sale for DaimlerChrysler's U.S. operations. ``It's a competitive 
cycle that's good for the consumer and good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers last month took advantage of deep summer discounts to  
keep sales up. Industry sales increased 21 percent compared with 
July 1998, though the comparison was skewed by the United Auto 
Workers strikes that virtually halted North American production at 
General Motors Corp. last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, GM posted the biggest percentage gain -- up 63  
percent. But the biggest automaker managed to carve out only 28 
percent of the U.S. market, despite adding more discounts last 
month in an effort to boost its share. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM is not putting enough money on the table to get to their 30  
percent market share target,'' said David Garrity of Dresdner 
Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG did especially well last month, with sales up  
10 percent on robust demand for its Jeep and Dodge sport utility 
vehicles and Dodge Ram pickups. Most Asian and European automakers 
also had impressive gains. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Ford Motor Co. posted only a 1 percent increase on the  
strength of a 10 percent improvement in car sales, excluding Jaguar 
and Volvo. Its truck sales were off 4 percent from a year ago -- its 
first decline in that category after 14 consecutive months of 
record year-over-year increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford blamed the strikes for an unusual 13 percent drop in sales  
of the F-series line of pickups, the nation's best-selling vehicle. 
Ford says it had record F-series sales in July 1998 because the 
strikes, combined with retooling to produce redesigned '99 models, 
severely depleted GM pickup inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford's truck numbers in general were a little soft,'' said  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``I think it's 
primarily that they feasted off GM last year to a degree. But 
there's also not a lot new in the Ford truck line versus a year 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's big SUVs, the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, also were  
down last month. Meanwhile, the first 118 Ford Excursion SUVs, the 
largest passenger truck on the market, were sold last month. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it had its best July ever for SUVs and trucks overall.  
Its retail sales numbers, which exclude purchases by business and 
government fleets, were at their highest July level in a decade. 
Despite that, competitors claimed more of the increase in industry 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. also posted their  
second-best U.S. sales months. Toyota's sales improved 14 percent, 
with a 13 percent gain in sales of the best-selling Camry sedan 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co.'s U.S. rebound continued, with the automaker  
reporting an 8 percent sales increase boosted by healthy demand for 
its pickups and SUVs, including its new Xterra. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's sales also were up 8 percent, with strong demand for its  
redesigned Odyssey minivan and a 14 percent improvement in Accord 
sedan sales.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Most Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Tuesday amid signs Japan and the United States might work together 
to prevent too rapid a rebound by the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 115.28 yen,  
up from 114.22 yen at the same point on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro also lost ground against the dollar, falling to $1.0676  
from late Monday's $1.0683. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also drew support from another jump in U.S. interest  
rates in the Treasury bond market, which makes dollar-denominated 
investments more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese and U.S. officials confirmed Tuesday that they are  
maintaining close contact about the yen's rally, which could harm 
Japan's economic recovery by making its exports more expensive in 
other currencies. No specific response was outlined, but the 
countries could sell yen and buy dollars to counter the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've agreed that sudden changes are undesirable. If  
necessary, we must respond,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said 
Tuesday in parliament, adding that the yen's recent rise against 
the dollar has been excessively strong. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4968 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.4947 late Monday, and 1.4936 Canadian dollars, 
down from 1.5046. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.6205, up from $1.6173 a day  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8318  
German marks, up from 1.8308 late Monday; and 6.1425 French francs, 
up from 6.1387.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm Shabazz Detained 1 More Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- The grandson of Malcolm X who set a 1997  
fire that killed the civil rights leader's widow will spend at 
least another year in detention for escaping, a judge ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcom Shabazz, 14, pleaded guilty to the juvenile equivalent of  
third-degree escape, a misdemeanor. His sentence, which had been 
scheduled to end in February, was extended by the judge to a year 
from Tuesday -- in effect, a 6-month extension. 
</P>
<P>
	But as before, the sentence can be extended yearly until he is  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Shabazz was 12 when he set the fire that killed Betty Shabazz,  
his grandmother and a civil rights leader herself, in her Yonkers 
apartment. He was staying with her because his mother said she was 
having trouble handling him. Since then he has been in detention, 
but has run off three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malcolm is a troubled youngster who needs a lot of help,  
educationally, socially and mental health-wise,'' said Westchester 
County Attorney Alan Scheinkman, whose office prosecutes youthful 
offenders.

<HEADLINE> Court Postpones Trie Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The sentencing of presidential friend  
Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie on campaign finance violations was 
postponed Tuesday until Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's sentencing had been set for Aug. 12, but on Monday  
federal prosecutors said in a court filing that Trie's sentencing 
should be postponed at least six weeks so his cooperation as part 
of his plea agreement can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts involving campaign  
finance violations and pledged to cooperate in an investigation of 
campaign fund-raising. In return, prosecutors dropped indictments 
pending against him in Washington and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have recommended that Trie be given three years'  
probation.

<HEADLINE> House Backs States Power on Liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States would gain new power over shipments of  
liquor, beer and wine across their borders under a bill the House 
passed Tuesday aimed at cracking down on illegal sales to minors by 
Internet or direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents called it a ``power grab'' by wholesalers and  
distributors that do not want small wineries and breweries to be 
able to sell directly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 310-112 in favor of the bill and sent it to the  
Senate, which added a similar provision to the juvenile justice 
bill it passed in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, which has been the subject of heavy lobbying,  
would let state attorneys general go into federal court to stop 
illegal shipments of ``intoxicating liquors'' to residents. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bill would affect all alcohol products, winemakers  
eager to find new markets outside of distributorships led the fight 
against it. Wholesalers supported the bill as a way to maintain 
their control over distribution and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law gives states the right to regulate distribution and  
sales and 19 of them ban the direct shipment of alcoholic beverages 
to individuals from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states require alcohol producers to go through  
state-licensed wholesalers, who must go through retailers, who 
alone may sell to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But states are having a hard time enforcing the laws because  
they do not have jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants, the 
legislation's supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill only affects those people who break liquor laws,''  
said Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., a prime sponsor of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to halting illegal shipments to minors, the bill  
will help states track sales and collect taxes, said Rep. William 
Delahunt, D-Mass. Illegal shipments of alcoholic beverages cost 
states $600 million in revenue last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting that funding stream is a legitimate state  
objective,'' Delahunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill really protects wholesalers and  
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., who represents the state's  
wine-making Napa Valley, said Congress should be helping 
distributors cope with the growth in the number of small wineries, 
which increased from 375 in 1963 to 2,000 today. During the period, 
the number of distributors fell from 10,900 to 300, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the problem,'' Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., a winery owner, said direct  
mail and Internet sales help small wineries stay in business and 
satisfy consumer demand for their products since many wholesalers 
will not carry small lots of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bill was ``monopoly protection at its best.''  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also rejected criticisms that the proposal would  
hinder electronic commerce and do little to keep minors from buying 
liquor over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said there were ``numerous documented  
instances'' of minors using the Internet to buy alcohol. ``For 
anybody to claim otherwise, they are simply misleading this 
debate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., said he was ``unmoved'' by arguments  
that ``massive numbers of underage drinkers are searching the 
Internet for basement bargains of bottles of Bordeaux to binge with 
their friends on their parents' next night out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing this bill does is stop the illegal shipment of  
alcohol into states. Nothing more, nothing less,'' added 
Scarborough, the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also injected the gun control issue into the debate by  
offering amendments -- all of which were rejected -- to give state 
attorney generals the same right to use the federal courts to halt 
interstate shipments of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2031.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Left With Six Running Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- On the first day of training camp, Tyrone  
Wheatley said the Miami Dolphins' battle at running back would be a 
six-week marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	He lasted less than a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was released Tuesday by the Dolphins after a tentative  
performance in their first scrimmage Sunday, when he gained 18 
yards in seven carries. The move left Miami with six running backs 
to contend for a maximum of four roster spots, including the 
starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for Tyrone, we brought in a couple of rookies  
who are pretty talented,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-round draft choice Cecil Collins may pose the biggest  
threat to incumbent Karim Abdul-Jabbar. Collins, who played just 
six games in college because of drug and legal problems, scored on 
a 40-yard touchdown run in the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil showed that burst of speed everybody craves in their  
offense,'' guard Kevin Donnalley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other running backs in camp are top 1999 draft pick J.J.  
Johnson, top 1998 draft pick John Avery, veteran Bernie Parmalee 
and Canadian League export Juan Johnson. The early showings by 
Collins and J.J. Johnson made Wheatley expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyrone really had a great attitude and worked very hard in the  
offseason,'' coach Johnson said. ``Had we not brought in the young 
backs, Tyrone not only would still be on the team, I think he would 
have made our roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, 27, was the New York Giants' No. 1 draft pick in 1995.  
But he started only eight games for them in four seasons and 
carried just 14 times for 52 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami acquired Wheatley from New York in February for a  
seventh-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I heard, he didn't have good work habits in New  
York, but he worked extremely hard here,'' coach Johnson said. ``He 
has turned it around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Wheatley's agent, Joel Segal: ``We'll have other  
opportunities and find a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Wheatley's departure, a backfield logjam remains.  
</P>
<P>
	Parmalee and Avery have a good chance to make the team because  
of their value to special teams, and Juan Johnson will probably 
wind up on the practice squad. That leaves Collins, Abdul-Jabbar 
and J.J. Johnson to contend for two roster spots, with the loser 
likely to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The durable Abdul-Jabbar remains the favorite for the starting  
job, which he has held since his rookie year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got something special about him,'' coach Johnson said.  
``He's a fighter, and he has talent. The guy did rush for 3,000 
yards the past three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Abdul-Jabbar is widely regarded as part of the Dolphins'  
problem, rather than part of the solution. Despite Johnson's 
emphasis on upgrading the ground game last year, the Dolphins 
ranked 24th in the NFL in rushing. They were 29th in 1997 and 19th 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar's stiffest challenge may come from Collins, who was  
available in the fifth round of the draft only because of his 
problems off the field. He rushed for 63 yards in 13 carries in the 
scrimmage and showed the kind of breakaway ability Miami has lacked 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil Collins is a good player, and he's only going to get  
better,'' coach Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign of progress for Collins: The rookie was assigned a  
stall in the corner of the Dolphins' locker room last week, but he 
moved into Wheatley's old locker Tuesday next to the other running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get excited,'' Collins said, ``until I make  
that last roster.''

<HEADLINE> Jagger Hailed As 'Loving' Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The mother of Mick Jagger's newest child praises  
the rock star as a ``very loving father'' -- even though he has yet 
to meet the 4-month-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Hello! magazine, Brazilian model Luciana  
Morad spoke about her relationship with the Rolling Stones' lead 
singer and posed for photos with baby Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	British news reports said Ms. Morad's pregnancy was the last  
straw for Jerry Hall, who recently separated from Jagger after 22 
years for a reported multimillion-dollar settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mick is a very decent man and he loves all his children. He  
does not blame Lucas for being born,'' said Ms. Morad, 29. ``He is 
a very loving father and, as fathers go, Lucas couldn't be 
luckier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Results of a blood test last month proved Jagger was Lucas'  
father. Ms. Morad said the Stones' hectic world tour has so far 
prevented him from seeing his new son.

<HEADLINE> PBS To Launch Saturday Kids' Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS is trying to tap into the preschool  
audience with a Saturday morning lineup of six animated programs 
geared toward the under 5 set. 
</P>
<P>
	Books including Maurice Sendak's ``Seven Little Monsters'' and  
Rosemary Wells' ``Timothy Goes to School'' will be the basis for 
the programs, set to air in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted to extend the joy of reading to television,''  
John F. Wilson, PBS Programming Services senior vice president, 
told the Television Critics Association over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Children under 5 generally are ignored by commercial television,  
said Toper Taylor, president of Toronto-based Nelvana 
Communications Inc., producer of the PBS series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisers have no desire to sell to a preschool audience,''  
Taylor said, with most Saturday morning programs aimed at 6- to 
11-year-old children. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelvana will get international sales rights and also rely on  
production partners and corporate underwriters to finance the 
three-year, $40 million project. 
</P>
<P>
	Other books to be adapted for the series are ``George Shrinks''  
by William Joyce; ``Corduroy Bear'' by Don Freeman; ``Junior 
Kroll'' by Michael and Betty Paraskevas, and ``Elliot Moose'' by 
Andrea Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the series will become part of PBS's daily  
schedule. Also joining that lineup will be ``Dragon Tales.'' The 
animated series about a brother and sister and their adventures in 
Dragon Land debuts on Sept. 6 . 
</P>
<P>
	PBS also announced a new logo intended to give public television  
a more appealing image to children. The cartoon-style design 
features a grinning child -- alternatively a boy or girl -- to be 
used during children's programs, on the network's Web site and for 
the upcoming PBS Kids Channel. The 24-hour channel debuts in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Other announcements made by PBS during the Television Critics  
Association meeting: 
</P>
<P>
	-- LookSmart, an Internet directory and search tool, will  
underwrite ``Sesame Street'' and four other programs for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Writer-director Bruce Paltrow (``St. Elsewhere'') is joining  
the new ``PBS Hollywood Television'' series, which will feature 
drama and comedy, as executive producer for the first production. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fledgling venture PBS Records will release six new albums in  
the coming months, including four accompanying upcoming PBS shows.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slip Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell Tuesday, driven down again by  
persistent worries of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 15/32  
point, or $4.68 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, rose to 6.16 percent from late 
Monday's 6.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have fallen in the last four sessions days by continued  
concern by investors that interest rates will rise, hurting the 
value of their existing fixed-rate securities. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Strong Sunscreens May Up Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People using stronger sunscreens don't feel  
the effects of sunburn as quickly and spend more time outside, 
which increases their risk of skin cancer, according to a study 
that finds even the best prevention isn't foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
	The European researchers concluded that ``sunscreens may  
encourage prolonged sun exposure because they delay sunburn,'' 
results they said help explain previous studies linking sunscreen 
use with higher skin cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not due to the fact that sunscreens are bad. It's because  
people have a bad attitude, using sunscreens to increase the amount 
of time they spend in the sun,'' said Dr. Ferdy Lejeune, an author 
of the study being published Wednesday in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 87 French and Swiss college students, researchers  
gave half of them sunscreen with a protection factor of 10 and the 
other half with a factor of 30. The students, who weren't told 
which lotion they received, went on summer vacations and recorded 
the amount of time they spent in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of the stronger sunscreen spent 25 percent more time in  
the sun, mostly sunbathing, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah McElvain, 20, a sunbather at Georgetown Swimming Pool in  
Washington, daubs lotion with a protection factor of 15 on her 
face, chest and stomach. She uses lotion with a lesser factor on 
her arms and legs. She said she doubts the strength of the 
sunscreen affects the time she spends sunbathing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stubborn when it comes to the sun,'' McElvain said. ``It's  
horrible, it's bad for you, but at this point in my life a tan is 
considered attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Burrell, 46, of Washington, spends only an hour at a time  
sunbathing with sunscreen after learning a hard lesson. ``I used to 
put baby oil on and bake. When I started getting wrinkles, that 
changed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything my mother said would happen to my skin has  
happened,'' she lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	Although skin cancer is preventable, the incidence of melanoma  
in the United States increases 4 percent a year, according to the 
National Cancer Institute. Previous research also has shown that 
people who use sunscreen have increased incidence of melanoma and 
other skin cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lejeune said the students in the European study often waited  
until their skin turned red before rushing to the shade. Those 
unknowingly using the stronger sunscreen waited longer and had 
greater exposure to cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also noted that the students did not appear to  
use adequate amounts of the sunscreen, bringing back tubes with too 
much lotion. ``Our study participants should have consumed three to 
four times the quantities actually used,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said improper use of the sunblock didn't affect the overall  
findings, however. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published in December, the same researchers reported  
that a study of 631 European school children found those using the 
most sunscreen were most likely to have sun-caused moles, a sign 
that skin cancer might develop later in life. While the lotion 
itself did not cause moles, it may have made parents overconfident 
about how long their children could safely play outdoors, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Emmons, a researcher with the Dana-Farber Cancer  
Institute, cautioned that those who hear about the studies 
shouldn't conclude, ``Oh, well. I'm still going to get skin cancer, 
so why bother?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that people use sunscreen and apply it  
appropriately,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmons recommended that people also should avoid direct sunlight  
by staying in the shade and wearing hats and other protective 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and  
need more than just protective lotions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number one way that children are protected from the sun is  
using sunscreen,'' she said, ``and parents need to get with the 
program and start using other kinds of protections.''

<HEADLINE> Athlete Ends Sex Riff, Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWCASTLE, England (AP) -- An American mother of two had to prove  
to officials she was female before being allowed to compete in the 
World Veterans' Athletics Championships and then proved her ability 
by breaking a world record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Jager of Phoenix underwent an examination before setting a  
world mark for her age in the 200 meters Tuesday with a time of 
28.32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old mom had been accused of being a man over the  
weekend in a protest lodged by southern hemisphere competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are trying to make trouble with these ridiculous  
allegations,'' said Jager after the decision was announced over the 
public address system at Gateshead stadium. ``I am a mother of 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torsten Carlius, president of the World Association of Veteran  
Athletes, said tests had verified the athlete's sex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said organizers had taken advice from the International  
Amateur Athletic Federation and the tests were carried out within 
guidelines set down by the sport's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The protests questioning the gender of one female athlete has  
been dealt with through medical examination that has proved her 
gender as being female,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of sympathy with the lady. The situation is that  
she has been accused of something that was untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jager, who earlier won a bronze medal in the pentathlon, is a  
home help care nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	She took up track at the age of 50 and has won a number of  
medals in state and national competitions in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	She is also competing in the pole vault.  
</P>
<P>
	United States' team manager Sandy Pashkin said the athlete could  
put the ordeal behind her and continue to compete in the 
championships ``which is the reason why she is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 6,000 athletes from 74 nations have been taking part  
in the championships for women over 35 years of age and men over 
40. 
</P>
<P>
	Jager declined to comment after the 200 meters.

<HEADLINE> Hoopster Damon Bailey Plays On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Damon Bailey's name was etched in  
Indiana's rich basketball lore by the time he was an eighth-grader. 
Some 40,000 fans watched his final high school game, and thousands 
more tracked his every move in college. 
</P>
<P>
	True, Bailey's basketball career hasn't exactly soared since  
then, but it hasn't fizzled, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Now approaching 28, he's plying his trade in places like Fort  
Wayne, Sioux Falls and Moline, a decent player in a league full of 
decent players, all of them hoping for the same thing: a shot at 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	If it comes, Bailey says he'll seize it. If not, he'll move on,  
content with what he did accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you can really do is control your own game and control  
what you do,'' said Bailey, who's playing for the United States in 
the Pan American Games. ``Because you never know when it's going to 
happen or how many times it's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``So when you do get that chance, you've got to be ready, and  
that's what I've been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey got a taste of NBA life when he was taken by his  
homestate team, the Indiana Pacers, in the second round of the 1994 
draft. But he never saw a minute of action. He had surgery on both 
knees and spent the season on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, he hooked up with the Fort Wayne Fury of the  
Continental Basketball Association and has been there since, except 
for a brief sojourn with a professional team in France. 
</P>
<P>
	He did get a tryout with the Chicago Bulls before the lockout  
last summer, and he was signed by the Cleveland Cavaliers last 
January, only to be released three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Those disappointments have come after a high school and college  
career filled with success and fame. Indiana coach Bob Knight first 
raved about Bailey when the youngster was in the eighth grade. As a 
senior, Bailey led his Bedford North Lawrence team to the state 
championship at the Hoosier Dome, and he made it to the Final Four 
with Indiana in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the NBA page in this storybook remains blank.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not driving me nuts,'' Bailey said. ``I've been there. I  
know what it's like. It's why we all continue playing the game, 
because it's where we want to be. But I realize there's things that 
get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of good players in the CBA, not just myself,  
that aren't in the NBA just because there's no room. If you took 
the upper tier guys in the CBA and the lower tier guys in the NBA 
and switched them, nobody would know the difference. For whatever 
reason, those guys in the NBA have gotten that chance and have 
performed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey knows his time for that chance is running out. He  
understands there might not be much demand for a 28-year-old 
undersized shooting guard with two surgically repaired knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'm definitely getting older,'' he said. ``How much  
longer I continue to play, I don't know. Today, I enjoy playing the 
game. I may wake up tomorrow and not enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there's somebody out there wanting me, whether it's  
the NBA or CBA or overseas, wherever it is, I'll continue to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coach Mo McHone, who coaches the CBA's Sioux Falls  
Skyforce, likes having Bailey in the Pan Am Games because of his 
versatility. He can score against a zone or man-to-man defense, he 
can play point guard or shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bailey's NBA chances, McHone said he has something that  
any team needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's always a place for a guy who can shoot the  
basketball,'' McHone said. ``It's still the No. 1 fundamental in 
all the game, and here's a guy that's great at it. He's a little 
undersized for a 2-man in that league, but he's smart enough to 
play the one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any question that if he got the right situation,  
not only would he have a shot, I think he could make a 
contribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey has been a solid contributor for the Pan Ams team. He  
averaged 13.8 points in the team's five exhibition games and scored 
13 points in each of the first two games in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll play three more times in these games before returning  
home. Bailey will keep playing and see where it takes him, keeping 
in mind what he learned in his years with Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thing I took away is not to worry about whether or  
not I'm in the NBA, but just going out and having fun playing and 
working as hard as I can and becoming the best player I can,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's good enough to get to a certain level, great. If  
not, then hey, I didn't cheat myself.''

<HEADLINE> Jury To Hear Dr. Sam Sheppard Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For a third time, jurors will be asked to  
decide whether Dr. Sam Sheppard killed his wife in the 1954 slaying 
that helped inspire the movie and TV series ``The Fugitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ron Suster, who would have decided the case, on Monday  
granted a request for a jury trial made by lawyers who are 
defending the state in a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit brought by 
Sheppard's son, Sam Reese Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers wanted more than one person to analyze the massive  
amount of material that has been collected in the 45-year-old case. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard claims his father should not have spent 10  
years behind bars for the death of Marilyn Sheppard on July 4, 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard, who was pregnant with her second child, was  
beaten to death in her bedroom at the couple's home on the shore of 
Lake Erie. Her husband was convicted of murder but always insisted 
that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife while he was napping 
downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court later overturned the verdict, ruling the  
original trial judge didn't do enough to protect the jury from 
hearing the many media reports and comments about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966. He died in 1970 of  
liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, now 51, has been trying for years to clear his father's  
name. He and his legal team have found DNA samples and other 
evidence implicating the family's former window-washer, Richard 
Eberling. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberling died in prison last year. He was serving time for  
another murder. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sheppard to win the lawsuit, his father will have to be  
declared innocent of Mrs. Sheppard's murder. That's a stronger 
legal standard than the reasonable doubt needed to clear someone in 
a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard could collect an estimated $2 million if he succeeds.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant County Prosecutor Steve Dever said he was pleased with  
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``A group of people as opposed to a single individual can better  
analyze and evaluate the evidence,'' he said. ``We are comfortable 
the truth can be determined as best as it can under the history of 
this particular case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 18.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! May Buy ExciteAtHome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome Corp. denied a report that the  
company is in merger talks with Yahoo!, though it acknowledged 
Tuesday the two Internet companies have talked about a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the second-largest Web search and directory destination,  
has held discussions over the last six weeks to acquire 
ExciteAtHome, the No. 6 destination, for more than $17 billion, 
according to an article published Monday on BusinessWeek Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, which cited an anonymous source, said Yahoo! might  
consider buying ExciteAtHome and spinning off the AtHome high-speed 
Internet access business. 
</P>
<P>
	But ExciteAtHome president George Bell, speaking at a technology  
conference, told reporters, ``There is no truth to the rumors about 
acquisition discussions,'' adding, ``We've had talks with Yahoo and 
AOL about getting on the start page of a very powerful broadband 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Yahoo! spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market  
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of ExciteAtHome, which had risen 14 percent in morning  
trading, tumbled on Bell's comments. ExciteAtHome's stock ended the 
day up 43 3/4 cents at $43.37 1/2 on heavy volume on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Yahoo! closed down $6.93 3/4 at $125.37 1/2, also on the  
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome is discussing a partnership that would make Yahoo!,  
America Online Inc., or perhaps another Internet service company 
the initial page ExciteAt Home's customers would see when they go 
onto the Internet, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome was created earlier this year by the merger of  
Excite, an Internet search and directory service, and AtHome, which 
operates a network of fiber-optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal with Yahoo!, however, would likely hurt the Excite  
business since Excite and Yahoo! are direct competitors.

<HEADLINE> Casino Chips Showing Up in Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Hours after Detroit's first casino opened just  
steps from the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church, gambling chips 
began clattering in the collection plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Russell Kohler wouldn't say how big the jackpot is, but  
he planned to cash the chips in and use the money to help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just call it a pile,'' Kohler said Monday. ``Bring them  
over any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Gaming Control Board says the exchange is perfectly  
legal. It's done in other places -- in Las Vegas, many cab drivers 
accept chips as tips. 
</P>
<P>
	The MGM Grand Detroit opened in the Motor City on Thursday.  
Several Detroit ministers have spoken out against the legalization 
of gambling in Michigan and warned their parishioners not to be 
tempted by the illusion of easy money.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Driver's Pot Use Caused Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A bus driver's use of marijuana hours before  
the Mother's Day crash that killed 22 people was the main cause of 
the accident, according to a police report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A blood test showed Frank Bedell, 46, who died Sunday of a heart  
attack, took marijuana between two and six hours before his bus 
full of mostly elderly women veered off a highway and smashed into 
a concrete abutment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report listed Bedell's drug use as the main factor leading  
to the May 9 crash of the Custom Bus Charters bus -- the worst in 
New Orleans history. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ruled out other possible causes, such as mechanical  
failure. Bedell's extensive health problems, including heart 
disease and kidney failure, were discussed in detail but were not 
listed as contributing factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, forwarded to prosecutors last week before Bedell  
died, recommended that he be charged with vehicular homicide, 
first-degree vehicular negligent injuring, reckless operation of a 
vehicle and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's death ends any possibility of criminal prosecutions in  
the case, police said. They declined to elaborate on their 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report speaks for itself,'' Lt. Marlon Defillo said.  
</P>
<P>
	Custom Bus officials declined comment as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The report said the blood test also detected that Bedell had  
been taking Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication commonly used 
for allergies. People who take the medication are cautioned not to 
drive because it can cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision 
and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell denied being impaired and told police the accident  
happened when he veered to avoid a car he thought was going to 
cross into his lane. Bedell never spoke again to investigators 
before he died, on the advice of his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation discovered Bedell received treatment in a  
hospital emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood 
pressure 12 hours before the accident. Earlier that day, he 
underwent dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell previously had been diagnosed with congestive heart  
failure, a condition that should have prevented him from keeping 
his commercial driver's license, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell also was fired from two other bus companies after testing  
positive for marijuana use. Custom officials have said they called 
those companies for Bedell's references, but were never told about 
the positive drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The police report on Bedell shows the need for a national  
commercial driver database so bus companies can track drivers' drug 
test histories, said Victor Parra, chief executive officer of the 
United Motorcoach Association, a bus company trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have peoples' lives at stake and this accident was evidence  
of that,'' Parra said.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz Recalls Child Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child  
seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when 
installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags 
turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children  
in child seats near air bags. Safety experts recommend that small 
infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly 
recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of 
an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since  
1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas  
in the seat cushion. Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are 
supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and 
turn off the passenger air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed  
forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the 
passenger airbag might not turn off as designed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers would know the system was not working only because an  
``airbag off'' light would stay dark. Mercedes-Benz said there have 
been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports 
of accidents or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recommended the seats not be used and that children  
sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and  
Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would 
be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships. Mercedes dealers will 
exchange the seats for free. The recall does not affect Toddler 
seats.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Up; Energy Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures rocketed higher Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after government figures showed an unexpectedly 
large decline in crop conditions, which could reduce expected 
bumper harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork bellies futures jumped, while energy  
futures edged lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in corn and soybeans ignored forecasts for beneficial  
showers to fall in the next 10 days over major Midwestern growing 
areas as they digested the U.S. Agriculture Department's weekly 
crop update, which showed conditions worsened last week as crops 
baked under temperatures that topped 100 degrees in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops in Ohio and Eastern states were suffering severe drought  
conditions, while Illinois and Indiana row crops saw their fortunes 
reverse after weeks of nearly ideal weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpectedly poor crop showings came as a surprise to  
analysts who had been predicted bin-busting harvests for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA reported late Monday that the portion of the soybean  
crop nationwide rated as being in good to excellent condition 
tumbled to 57 percent from 65 percent a week earlier. In Illinois, 
crops in good to excellent condition plunged to 53 percent from 62 
percent, while they fell to 43 percent from 58 percent in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 13 percent of soybeans were in poor to very poor  
condition, up from 9 percent the previous week, the USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops fared better nationwide, with the good-to-excellent  
condition falling to 63 percent from 70 percent. But corn crop 
conditions in Illinois and Indiana also fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery rose 7 1/2 cents to $2.34 a bushel;  
November soybeans rose 13 3/4 cents to $4.77 a bushel. Those contracts 
represent the crop yet to be harvested. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork bellies futures jumped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
after the government snapped up nearly a fifth of the nation's 
frozen pork supply for donation to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA said it bought 110 million pounds, or 50,000 metric  
tons of hams, pork bellies used for making bacon and other pork 
products for shipment to the economically troubled country 
beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited purchase not only will help Russia but will  
help American producers by sharply reducing excess supply caused by 
large increases in the pork herd last year. 
</P>
<P>
	August pork bellies rose 4.50 cents to 59.62 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil and its products fell in lackluster trading on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange as investors squared positions ahead of 
weekly inventory data expected to show little change in U.S. 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the markets closed late Tuesday, the American  
Petroleum Institute reported an unexpected 1.944 million barrel 
increase, to 210.1 million barrels, in U.S. gasoline stocks in the 
week ended July 30. Crude oil inventories, meanwhile, showed a 
surprisingly steep decline of 4.996 million barrels, to 326.2 
million barrels, from the previous week's level. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude fell 15 cents to $20.30 a barrel; September  
heating oil fell 0.08 cent to 52.29 cents a gallon; September 
unleaded gasoline fell 0.07 cent to 63.02 cents a gallon; September 
natural gas rose 2.3 cents to $2.598 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Placed Back on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cal Ripken was placed on the disabled  
list Tuesday with a sore back, the second time this season the 
Baltimore Orioles' third baseman has been disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who had never been on the disabled list before this  
year, received a cortisone shot to relieve irritation in his lower 
back Tuesday. He went on the DL from April 18-May 13 with nerve 
irritation in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a recurrence of the previous injury,'' Orioles manager  
Ray Miller said before Baltimore's game Tuesday night against the 
Oakland Athletics. ``They say the best-case scenario is he'll be 
ready in 10 days. We were so thin already we had to put him on the 
DL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who played in 2,632 consecutive games until stopping the  
streak last year, is hitting .335 with 15 home runs and 47 RBIs. He 
is one homer away from 400 and 32 hits shy of 3,000 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned to Baltimore on Monday for an examination and  
was put on the disabled list retroactive to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fine, then he went to breakfast Sunday morning and said  
he just started getting spasms in his back,'' Miller said. ``It got 
worse all day and the next day. He said he wanted to see the 
doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles recalled third baseman Ryan Minor from Triple-A  
Rochester to take Ripken's place. Minor was batting .256 with 21 
homers and 67 RBI in 101 games with Rochester. He was 1-for-10 in 
four games with Baltimore in July.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Mixed; Dow Up 43.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today after a strong opening  
as interest rate concerns kept investors on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 43.70 at 10,689.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower after giving up early  
gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.04 at 1,328.09, and 
the Nasdaq composite index was down 16.84 at 2,606.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise rates later this  
month in an effort to cool off the economy held most stocks back. 
The Conference Board provided the latest hint that the nation's 
unbridled economic growth is continuing, announcing that its index 
of leading indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its May 
increase. The index is used to forecast economic trends for the 
coming three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	A report that ExciteAtHome may be acquired by Yahoo! for a price  
greater than ExciteAtHome's $17 billion market value stimulated 
some early buying in Internet and telecommunications companies. 
Shares of ExciteAtHome rose sharply, only to slip back when the 
company's chief executive officer denied the rumors. ExciteAtHome 
was up just 1/2 at 43 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse  
First Boston, said in a report that online brokerages may 
experience their first ever decline in trading volume in the third 
quarter. Shares of ETrade fell 3 9/16 to 25 7/16, and Charles 
Schwab fell 3 15/16 to 38 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 223.26 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.68 at 624.66, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.28 at 785.92. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 3.91 at  
438.72.

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Limit Weapons Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed and sent to the president  
Monday a bill that would make it illegal to distribute information 
about weapons of mass destruction if the intent of distribution was 
to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, passed by voice vote, violators could  
face up to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which the Senate passed last month, makes it  
illegal to teach or demonstrate the making or use of an explosive 
or a weapon of mass destruction or to distribute information about 
such weapons with the intent of furthering criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The original purpose of the legislation was to codify a  
government settlement with two corporations, but Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., succeeded in linking it to her provision to 
limit bomb-making material. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein noted that two youths responsible for the killings at  
Columbine High School in Colorado learned how to make bombs from 
information posted on the Internet. Hundreds of World Wide Web 
sites contain instructions on building bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version of a juvenile crime bill now being considered  
by House-Senate negotiators contains similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 606.

<HEADLINE>  Mercer to Denver, Fortson to Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino saw a tremendous  
upside in Ron Mercer, just as Denver Nuggets general manager Dan 
Issel did in Danny Fortson. 
</P>
<P>
	But both players posed signability problems for their respective  
teams, and so they were traded Tuesday in a six-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer went to Denver along with Popeye Jones and Dwayne  
Schintzius for Fortson, Eric Williams and Eric Washington. The 
Celtics also will receive a first-round draft choice in one of the 
next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets also announced on Tuesday they re-signed point guard  
Nick Van Exel and signed free-agent forward George McCloud. The 
Celtics, meanwhile, announced the signing of free-agent guard Wayne 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer and Fortson were the key players in the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	Pitino, who coached Mercer at Kentucky and during his first two  
years in the NBA, shares the league-wide consensus that Mercer is a 
future star. But after Mercer told Pitino what it would cost to 
re-sign him, the coach decided the Celtics couldn't afford his 
talents, bright future or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' Pitino said. ``I could  
not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer wanted as a 
basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics began shopping the 6-foot-7 Mercer last month after  
discovering how far apart they were on his new contract demands. 
Mercer, who averaged a career-high 17 points for Boston last 
season, can be a free agent next year, and indicated he wouldn't 
re-sign with Boston if he wasn't given an extension this summer, 
Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said Fortson, fourth in the NBA in rebounding last season  
at 11.6 per game and averaged 11.0 points, had the misfortune of 
being a power forward on a team that has Antonio McDyess. 
</P>
<P>
	``Danny had a tremendous year, and we certainly weren't thrilled  
about having to give him up,'' Issel said. ``He's good enough to be 
a starter in this league. He's going to want starter money when his 
contract is up after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's good, but he's not as good as Antonio.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fortson built his rebounding totals last season while playing  
out of position, at center after Raef LaFrentz went down with a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Though reluctant to give up Mercer, Pitino believes the imposing  
6-7, 260-pound Fortson is a good fit for the Celtics, who are 
trying to change their philosophy from one of offense-oriented 
finesse to a more ``tough-minded'' approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to shore up our front court,'' he said. ``We've done  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel agreed with Pitino's assessment, saying he thought Fortson  
would be a better player in the more physical Eastern Conference. 
``He has that wide body and he takes up a lot of space,'' Issel 
said. ``They probably let you play a little more physical in the 
East. That's one of the problems Danny had last year, getting in 
foul trouble so often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Issel believes Mercer is a perfect fit for the  
rebuilding Nuggets, who hope to deploy a running game next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron can get up and down the court,'' Issel said. ``He can  
defend, and he's bigger than most people think. He elevates on his 
jump shot, and he can shoot over any small forward. I think he has 
a chance to really be an outstanding player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mercer played mostly shooting guard for the Celtics,  
Issel projects him as a small forward in the Nuggets' system. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson came to Denver by trade after being picked by Milwaukee  
in the first round of the 1997 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, the sixth pick overall in the 1997 draft, was an NBA  
All-Rookie Team selection in 1997-98 when he averaged 15.3 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal sends Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. He averaged 15 points per game for 
the Celtics in 1996-97. After missing most of the next season in 
Denver with a knee injury, Williams averaged 7.3 points and 2.1 
rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino once questioned Williams' work ethic, but on Tuesday he  
said he was convinced Williams had changed his ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams' contract 
this year, the maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade for Jones and signing of Van Exel and McCloud give the  
young Nuggets ``some veterans who know how to win and know how to 
carry themselves professionally,'' Issel said.

<HEADLINE> President of Money Store Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Templeton, president and chief  
executive of The Money Store consumer finance unit of First Union 
Corp., has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union bought the consumer finance company last year for  
$2.1 billion. The unit hasn't added to earnings as the bank 
promised when the purchase was made and First Union has laid off 
hundreds of Money Store employees this year in companywide job 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union said Monday that Money Store accounting changes  
would lower bank earnings this year by 8 cents to 12 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``That particular investment had been a troublesome one for  
First Union for a long time,'' said bank analyst Charlie Peabody of 
Mitchell Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Templeton, 50, had worked at The Money Store since 1973.  
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Lica, spokeswoman for The Money Store's Sacramento,  
Calif., offices, said the company planned to provide details about 
Templeton's replacement later this week. Templeton replaced company 
founder Marc Turtletaub on May 21.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Good for Indie Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No big stars? Tiny budget? No problem. ``The  
Blair Witch Project'' is proving that a movie shot for $60,000 can 
still conjure up a monster hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Seemingly coming from nowhere, the horror film went into wide  
release over the weekend and took in $29.2 million -- second only to 
Julia Roberts and Richard Gere's ``Runaway Bride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's success has reminded a blockbuster-crazy movie  
industry that sometimes, the next best thing in the cinema doesn't 
follow the formulaic route. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no words to describe it,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a  
movie-industry analyst for Reel Source Inc. ``I'm at a loss for 
words on what this film has done for the whole industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in barely a third as many theaters as ``Runaway Bride,''  
``Blair Witch'' averaged $26,528 a screen, nearly 2.5 times that of 
the romantic comedy, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., 
which tracks ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	And while ``Runaway Bride'' took in $35.1 million, about half of  
its production costs, in just one weekend, ``Blair Witch'' has 
grossed $36.1 million -- 100 times what the filmmakers and their 
distributor spent to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps the industry, because it shows you there's a  
business out there,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th 
Century Fox. ``It kind of stops the complacency where everything 
has to have a big budget, and you have to get this person to 
star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick shot ``Blair  
Witch'' for about $60,000, while distributor Artisan Entertainment 
poured in $300,000 more for other production costs, said Amir 
Malin, Artisan president. 
</P>
<P>
	A fictional movie, ``Blair Witch'' presents itself as a  
documentary pieced together from video shot by three filmmakers who 
disappeared in the woods while hunting for a witch. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing has played on that ``mockumentary'' notion,  
leaving some moviegoers guessing about whether the horror story is 
real or imagined. Word-of-mouth reviews and the Internet helped 
fuel interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan bought ``Blair Witch'' for $1 million after the  
distributor's executives saw it at the Sundance film festival, 
Malin said. He said the company has spent $10 million on 
distribution and promotion, still relatively cheap by Hollywood 
blockbuster standards. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the movie expanding from 1,100 theaters to about 2,000  
next weekend, ``Blair Witch'' was expected to easily gross more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' could even become the most successful film ever  
in terms of return on initial investment, said Tom Borys, president 
of box-office tracker ACNielsen EDI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then, a small film does break through. But  
there's been nothing before of this magnitude,'' Borys said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood always searches for independent films that might have  
commercial appeal, but ``Blair Witch'' might make big studios 
``reexamine what they can do to find those gems,'' Borys said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' could become a franchise film for Artisan, whose  
previous best box-office performer was Wes Craven's ``Wishmaster.'' 
That film made $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan already has plan for a ``Blair Witch'' sequel, and the  
distributor is cleaning up on T-shirts, books and other merchandise 
related to the movie.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Cuba for 'Sham' Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A woman has sued Cuba, claiming it is responsible  
for sexual assaults committed by a man who married her only to 
serve his needs as a spy for the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ana Margarita Martinez, former wife of Juan Pablo Roque, filed  
the lawsuit Monday in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeking unspecified 
damages. The only defendant named is the Republic of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit asserts that Martinez never would have married Roque  
had she known that he was using the marriage ``as a mere pretext to 
carry out his spy mission for a terrorist state.'' Because of the 
deception, the suit says, sex between the pair constituted sexual 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba also was sued by the families of Brothers to the Rescue  
volunteers who were shot down by Fidel Castro's air force in 1996. 
A federal judge in Miami awarded the families more than $187.6 
million in damages. They're going after frozen Cuban assets for the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said she believes Roque married her merely to establish  
``cover'' as a family man. She has had the 11-month marriage 
annulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque in 1992 swam to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay and  
requested political asylum, saying he was a disenchanted Cuban air 
force major. He met Martinez in Miami that same year, and they 
married in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, 1996, Roque vanished from the home that he shared  
with Martinez and her two children. The next day, Cuban jets shot 
down the two planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, killing four. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque later appeared on Cuban television accusing Brothers to  
the Rescue -- which he had joined in 1994 -- of being a terrorist 
organization actively planning acts of sabotage on the island.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' Trades Revamp Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a single day, the Denver Nuggets completed a  
sweeping reorganization of their roster, keeping Nick Van Exel, 
trading for Ron Mercer and two other players, and signing George 
McCloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we're done making major trades, major changes,''  
general manager Dan Issel said Tuesday. ``There's only so many 
changes you can make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we certainly have stabilized ownership now (with  
Donald Sturm). Hopefully, we have stable management. I think what 
we need to do now is let these kids play together for two or three 
years and see what kind of basketball team we can come up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Nuggets sent forwards Danny Fortson and Eric  
Williams and guard Eric Washington to the Boston Celtics for 
forwards Ron Mercer and Popeye Jones and center Dwayne Schintzius. 
The Celtics also will receive a first-round draft choice in one of 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring more deals, the Nuggets will open the 1999-2000 season  
with Raef LaFrentz, almost fully recovered from reconstructive knee 
surgery, at center; Antonio McDyess and Mercer at forward, and Van 
Exel and Chauncey Billups at guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, Bryant Stith and Keon Clark figure to be key players off  
the bench, and draft choices James Posey and Chris Herren also 
should be factors, especially the 6-foot-8 Posey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be real hard to keep Posey off the  
floor,'' Issel said. ``I don't think anybody has a lock on a 
starting position now because Posey is a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a nice mix of veterans and youngsters, and they should  
adapt well to the running game the Nuggets hope to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's the only way you can be successful here,''  
Issel said. ``You have to take advantage of the altitude. We're 
still not the biggest team in the world, and so we're going to have 
to get up and down the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the roster taking shape, Issel was asked what expectations  
he had of the Nuggets this season following 11-71 and 14-36 
campaigns the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my concern is having a competitive team this first  
season in the Pepsi Center,'' he said. ``Our expectation is to be 
competitive for a playoff spot. That ought to be our goal, that 
we're still playing for a playoff spot late in the year, that we're 
not out of it by Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought this year's team could be significantly  
better than last year's, he said, ``If you give me a healthy Raef 
LaFrentz, I would say significantly better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we're probably two or three years away from  
really seeing if we've done a good job or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel also said the current roster ``has more athleticism than  
any team we've ever had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the offseason last spring, the Nuggets had four  
goals: acquiring a starting small forward, improving their 
perimeter shooting, upgrading their defense, and acquiring a backup 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer and McCloud fill the first two needs. Jones, Posey and  
Herren are solid defenders. But Issel suggested the backup center 
spot remains unsolved, despite the trade for Schintzius, an 
eight-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only gaping hole that we wanted to address that we  
have not yet is backup center,'' Issel said. ``Raef is doing 
exceptionally well in his rehab. He's been cleared to do everything 
but scrimmage. We feel quite sure he'll be ready to go full speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a backup center. The big problem is they're very  
difficult to come by. So we'll have to wait and see what happens. 
But Schintzius is what we have right now. That didn't sound like a 
great endorsement, did it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said the 6-foot-7 Mercer, who averaged 17 points last  
season for the Celtics, ``can get up and down the court, he can 
defend, and he's bigger than most people think. The way we want to 
play, I think he'll fit in fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the 6-8 Jones, who played in only 18 games last season  
before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, ``gives us a 10-12 
minute guy who can play behind Antonio. He's a good rebounder, a 
good defensive player, and he's a very solid citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing Van Exel was Issel's main goal this offseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at his statistics, he's one of the better point  
guards in the league, assists-to-turnover ratio,'' Issel said. ``He 
had a terrible year shooting the ball. But he made some big shots 
in the two biggest wins we had last year, beating Utah and the 
Lakers back-to-back. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get better as a team and he doesn't feel he has to carry  
so much of it himself, he'll be a much better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-8 McCloud is a deadly 3-pointer shooter who averaged 8.9  
points last season for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play a lot of different positions and he can defend,''  
Issel said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index rising in Tokyo after two straight sessions of 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
144.23 points, or 0.81 percent, to close at 17,969.93. On Monday, 
the average closed down 36.16 points, or 0.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei's close was the highest since July 21, when it ended  
at 18,257.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks rose as the dollar's gain against the yen Tuesday  
afternoon boosted shares of Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen cuts the profits of exporters by making their  
products more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 115.40 yen, up  
1.36 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 114.22 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he  
had conferred with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers about 
exchange rates in a recent phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares rose sharply following a technical rebound in  
blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index surged 22.473  
points, or 3.8 percent, to 618.986. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, the main index plunged more than 3 percent before  
buying by government funds erased most of the losses. Traders said 
Taiwanese investors were nervous about China's test-firing of a new 
long-range missile on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan market's key Weighted Stock Price Index slipped 20.75  
points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,175.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine stock and foreign currency markets were closed  
Tuesday because of monsoon rains that flooded large areas of 
metropolitan Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher for the third straight  
session in light trading. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 38.41 
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,473.84. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, recouping  
some of Monday's losses. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 
16.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,180.11. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, driven by  
gains in diversified resource stock prices and the country's major 
banks. The All Ordinaries Index rose 32.2 points, or 1.0 percent, 
to 3,032.20. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher following two sessions of  
declines. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 13.52 points, 
or 1.4 percent, to 973.33. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher on buying by local  
institutional funds, dealers said. The Composite Index, which 
tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, closed at 748.34 points, up 13.40 
points, 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower, although the key  
index rose slightly. The Straits Times Index rose 14.72 points, or 
0.7 percent, to 2,143.37. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of  
Thailand index rose 3.46 points, or 0.76 percent, to 456.07.

<HEADLINE> Guzman Ready To Swing With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Juan Guzman has been through this before. He  
knows why he was traded. He knows what's expected. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's happy with all if it.  
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles traded Guzman to the Cincinnati Reds just  
before the deadline Saturday night for two minor leaguers. The 
Orioles also agreed to include some cash to help the Reds pay the 
remainder of his $5.25 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman, 32, knew it was coming. He knew what it would be like --  
Toronto traded him to Baltimore last July 31, acquainting him with 
the midseason trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman goes from a team that was one of the major leagues' most  
expensive disappointments to one of its biggest surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the beginning of the season for me now that I'm with  
a contending team that's so close to winning,'' Guzman said 
Tuesday. ``I've been in that position before. I know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman was in Seattle with the Orioles when he was traded. He  
flew to Baltimore, then joined the Reds on Tuesday. They plan to 
start him for the first time Thursday against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year I was more prepared than last year,'' Guzman said.  
``I knew for sure I was gone because I'm a free agent at the end of 
the season. I knew they were not going to let me go without getting 
anything back. For the last two months, I've been getting myself 
ready for whatever team I would go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wound up in an unfamiliar league. The Reds are hoping that  
hitters' unfamiliarity with Guzman gives him an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never been seen in the National League before,'' general  
manager Jim Bowden said. ``Sometimes that's a plus heading into 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main drawback is that Guzman will have to bat regularly for  
the first time in his major league career. Heading into this 
season, he had only two at-bats -- both in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 1-for-6 in interleague play this season with an RBI  
single off Atlanta's Kevin Millwood on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitting?'' Guzman said. ``I've been in the American League for  
so long ... We'll see. That's all I can say.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices closed higher today after the  
dollar's gains against the yen fueled hopes for increased profits 
among Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 144.23  
points, or 0.81 percent, to finish the day at 17,969.93. On Monday, 
the average closed down 36.16 points, or 0.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.40 yen, up 1.36 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 114.22 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices ended higher as the  
dollar's gain against the yen this afternoon boosted share prices 
of Japanese companies with large overseas revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen cuts into the profits of exporters by making  
their products more expensive and therefore less competitive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei's close was the highest since July 21, when it ended  
at 18,257.52. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen's weakness helped blue chips, although they had fallen  
on profit taking,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at Chuo 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sony, Fujitsu and NEC were among those that ended  
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 13.37 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,481.99. 
The TOPIX closed down 10.31 points, or 0.70 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rose after Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa said he had conferred with U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers about exchange rates in a phone call Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``In more ways than one, we are speaking with the U.S., and  
basically, we've agreed that sudden changes (in currency rates) are 
undesirable,'' Miyazawa said today in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman in Washington said Summers and  
Miyazawa pledged close cooperation on currency exchange rates. 
Miyazawa refused to elaborate on the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``News of the phone call sent the dollar up, and some sell  
orders disappeared,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone conversation suggested the United States has  
softened its resistance to the Bank of Japan's attempts to weaken 
the yen. Summers had said earlier that the Bank of Japan shouldn't 
manipulate currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened in recent months to rein in the  
yen's rise against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.08 yen, up from  
121.78 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8400 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.32 yen from 99.65 yen.

<HEADLINE> Casino Reprimanded for Leech Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A casino restaurant has been reprimanded for  
hosting a party where Robin Leach allegedly cavorted with naked 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delmonico Steakhouse could have lost its liquor license for  
the May 31 incident. The Clark County Commission instead gave it an 
administrative reprimand on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the department found that the former host of  
``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' and five female companions 
engaged in ``lewd conduct'' while attending a party in a private 
room. Several employees witnessed the party because the room was 
enclosed in glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach has said the allegations were a ``gross exaggeration'' and  
no sexual acts took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a harmless fun whipped-cream fight that lasted less  
than two minutes when dessert was served,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse, who owns Delmonico, called  
Leach's behavior ``outrageous'' and apologized for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened, and I take responsibility. It happened with a  
breakdown in command,'' he said. ``Who would ever dream something 
this bizarre would happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the restaurant said Leach, 57, has been told he  
is no longer welcome at Delmonico, several employees have been 
fired and some have been reprimanded.

<HEADLINE> Opening Statements in Ala. Gay Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- A prosecutor acknowledged today that a  
construction worker on trial for killing a man over an unwanted 
sexual advance did not cut the victim's throat or beat him to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	But District Attorney Fred Thompson said Charles M. Butler, 21,  
did play a key role in the Feb. 19 slaying of Billy Jack Gaither, 
39, who was beaten with an ax handle and burned atop a pile of 
kerosene-soaked tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Steven Eric Mullins, 25, who has pleaded guilty, is  
expected to testify against Butler. Prosecutors have agreed to 
recommend a sentence of life in prison without parole for Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney told jurors during opening statements this  
morning that Gaither was a homosexual ``and that is the only reason 
they killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pure, simple hatred -- hatred of someone perceived to be  
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler could be sentenced to death in Alabama's electric chair  
if convicted of capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, defense attorney Billy Hill Jr. acknowledged that his  
client was the first one to hit Gaither, after Gaither 
propositioned him, while the three were drinking beer in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said everything his client did was under orders from  
Mullins. Hill agreed with the prosecution that Mullins cut 
Gaither's throat and beat him to death before the body was set 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the district attorney said Butler aided in the crime  
partly by setting the tires on fire and by burning Gaither's car to 
hide evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to be the triggerman to be guilty of capital  
murder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaither's slaying ignited civic leaders and gay rights  
organizations, spurring comparisons to Matthew Shepard, a gay 
college student slain in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the suspects lured Gaither from his home with a  
phone call asking him to a Sylacauga club, then took him to an 
isolated spot in Coosa County, where he was slain.

<HEADLINE> Defections Is Focus at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Canada tried to get the focus back on  
the competitive side of the Pan American Games, while defections 
and complaints from the Cuban delegation drew attention away from 
the 13th regional Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's delegation criticized organizers, saying security was  
lacking and that it would respond quickly to any insult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' a statement from the Cuban 
delegation said. ``From now on we will react with full energy to 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement from the Cubans was aimed at a protester who  
jumped out of the stands with a sign ``Human Right First'' during 
their baseball semifinal game Sunday against Canada. But it also 
followed reports of more defections from their delegation. Cuban 
delegation officials insist athletes are being encouraged to 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen-year-old pitcher Danys Baez was the latest to leave the  
Cuban team, supposedly heading to Miami with sports agent Joe 
Cubas, who has helped many Cuban ballplayers defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell the people of Miami that another Cuban in  
search of freedom is about to become part of the people of Miami 
over there ... to wait for me over there,'' Baez told Miami 
television station WSCV. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas said Monday that Baez left the team Sunday night after it  
beat Canada 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The defection would bring to eight the number of Cubans to  
reportedly leave their nation's delegation since arriving for the 
Games. According to sources close to the Cubans, 400-meter relay 
runner Michal Ortiz, a goalkeeper from the men's soccer team and an 
artistic gymnast also abandoned their compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
	While not acknowledging anyone by name, the Royal Canadian  
Mounted Police, however, said they knew nothing of the latter two 
seeking asylum. They were also unaware of an asylum petition by 
Baez. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg City Police said federal officials had detained the  
protester from Sunday night's game, who gave a Miami address, for 
possible immigration violations. He was taken into custody after 
getting into a scuffle with four members of the Cuban delegation, 
who came upon the protester outside the Canadian Broadcast 
Corporation offices late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's anger was eased somewhat by its baseball team's 5-1  
victory over the United States Monday night for its eighth straight 
gold medal in baseball. Cuba takes the Pan Ams very seriously, and 
baseball is its most beloved sport.

<HEADLINE> Aide Clarifies First Lady's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton does not blame her  
husband's marital infidelity on the tumult of his childhood, her 
spokeswoman said Tuesday, despite the apparent link she drew in a 
much-discussed magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did not say the president's childhood in any way caused  
his behavior, nor does she believe that,'' spokeswoman Marsha Berry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the debut issue of Talk magazine, which went on sale Tuesday,  
Mrs. Clinton said the president was ``scarred by abuse'' as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, he has his weaknesses,'' she told the magazine. ``Yes, he  
needs to be more responsible, more disciplined, but it is 
remarkable given his background that he turned out to be the kind 
of person he is, capable of such leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on her husband's background, Mrs. Clinton said he was  
scarred at age 4 by a struggle between his mother and grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
she said. ``There is always a desire to please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comment followed a frank discussion about Clinton's  
infidelities, in which Mrs. Clinton said her husband ``doesn't make 
any excuses for what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's office discussed the childhood abuse question  
after news accounts of Mrs. Clinton's interview focused on that 
aspect. Mrs. Clinton's quotations were misinterpreted, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that she was basically stating some feelings about his  
childhood, but that they do not excuse his behavior,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denied that the  
young Clinton suffered physical abuse but said: ``There were 
difficulties in his family. He faced issues that were hard on him; 
they were hard on his family.''

<HEADLINE> Airports To Offer Flights to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Direct charter flights to Cuba will be allowed  
from airports in New York and Los Angeles for the first time since 
the United States imposed an embargo on the communist-ruled island 
four decades ago, says a leading congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York said Monday he learned in  
conversations with State Department officials that charters will be 
allowed from Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los 
Angeles International Airport sometime after October. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a commonsense decision that will make it easier and  
hopefully cheaper for more Americans to visit Cuba,'' said Rangel, 
ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing more travel between the United States and Cuba is the  
latest in a string of Clinton administration initiatives to loosen 
restrictions on contact between the two estranged countries. Direct 
flights now are limited to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a package of changes announced in January, Clinton  
re-established direct mail between the United States and Cuba and 
expanded the number of Americans able to send cash to Cubans to 
include nonrelatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also said in January it was prepared to allow  
direct flights to Havana from U.S. airports other than Miami. 
Rangel's Monday disclosure was the first indication the suggestion 
was being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said New York and Los Angeles were the leading contenders based on 
market demand and availability of Customs Service personnel to 
handle the additional workload. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the final decision was up to the Treasury  
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Rangel said the 
Treasury Department still needed to select the airlines that will 
be allowed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to Treasury was not immediately returned Monday  
night.

<HEADLINE> Big funds -- too big, or just right? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fidelity Magellan fund has become the first  
mutual fund to reach $100 billion in assets, but for investors, the 
milestone is more than just another record high and round number -- 
it offers them an opportunity to reflect on big funds and whether 
it's smart to be in them. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan made it past $100 billion in July as the stock market  
itself soared to record levels and investors poured billions of 
dollars into mutual funds. The market's declines since then brought 
Magellan's assets down to $95 billion at the end of July, but the 
next big upturn is likely to send the fund's assets climbing again. 
</P>
<P>
	There actually are relatively few mutual funds -- 24 out of  
10,801 -- with $20 billion or more in assets, according to 
Morningstar Inc., which tracks mutual fund size and performance. 
The vast majority of funds have less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place behind Magellan is Vanguard Index Trust 500  
fund, with assets of $92.6 billion as of June 30, and No. 3 is 
Washington Mutual Investors Fund, with $58.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For many investors, whether or not to buy into Magellan is moot  
-- Fidelity closed the fund to most new accounts in September 1997 
because it was getting too unwieldy with $63 billion in assets at 
that time. But other big funds are open and continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (a fund is) done well, people invest in it and it becomes  
self-fulfilling,'' said Glenn Hubbard, a professor of economics at 
Columbia University's graduate business school. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest funds may not deliver the biggest returns.  
</P>
<P>
	Magellan had a cumulative return of 194.14 percent over the past  
five years, according to Lipper Inc., which also follows fund 
performance. Vanguard Index Trust 500, which tracks the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index, has returned 225.31 percent. Washington Mutual 
Investors fund returned 193.67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the biggest cumulative return over the past five  
years, 701.75 percent was achieved by the Firsthand Technology 
Value fund, with $326 million in assets. In second place was the 
Rydex OTC Investor Class fund, with a return of 542.47 percent and 
$1.4 billion in assets, and No. 3 was the Fidelity Select 
Electronics fund, with a 532.44 percent return and $3.9 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	As funds grow bigger, they may become more diversified, and that  
can mean a lower return over time. With money pouring in from 
investors, big fund managers buy hundreds of different stocks -- as 
opposed to smaller sector funds that focus on a smaller number of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fund of that size is going to reflect pretty much the stock  
market,'' said Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant with the 
firm B.J. Greenwald Associates in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems faced by portfolio managers of big funds is  
that federal law limits how big a position they can take in a 
particular stock. That means they must keep finding new issues as 
people invest more in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's obvious by the amount of money going into these funds  
that they work for many investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The big funds ``tend to be middle-of-the-road funds that are  
pretty good and probably should be core positions in everyone's 
portfolio,'' Greenwald said. ``What you won't get is a 
shoot-the-lights-out performance in a particular year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard said most small investors probably want to be in a big  
fund. But ``if you want an actively-managed fund, then avoid the 
real giants. Stick to ones in the middle, and smaller ones too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another plus for investors, Greenwald noted, is that these large  
funds are prominent -- and subject to outside scrutiny -- simply 
because they are so big. ``Sponsors have a huge interest that they 
don't underperform -- you can be sure, they'll pay particular 
attention to these particular funds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their diversity, they can also be a cushion when the  
market drops. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan was guided to prominence and stellar returns by manager  
Peter Lynch in the 1980s. He retired in 1990, and the fund's 
returns lagged behind the S&AMP;P 500 under Lynch's successor, Jeffrey 
Vinik. But it has improved under current manager Robert Stansky, 
and over the past year has had a cumulative return of 24.18 
percent, compared to 18.95 percent for the S&AMP;P 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors can open a new Magellan account only through a group  
retirement plan, such as 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans, only if 
Magellan was an established plan option as of Sept. 30, 1997.

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Sonja Tate and Andrea Lloyd-Curry, scoreless  
in the first half, combined for 16 points during a second-half run 
as the Minnesota Lynx beat the Phoenix Mercury 73-56 in the WNBA on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lynx avenged a 79-46 loss in Phoenix on Thursday by making  
10 of their first 15 shots from the field in the second half to 
break open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (12-10) led 29-27 with 16:03 left in the game when  
Tonya Edwards hit a 3-pointer to start a 25-15 run. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate scored six consecutive points to make it 46-34, and  
Lloyd-Curry and Tate closed the run with four consecutive free 
throws for a 54-42 lead. The pair combined for 21 second-half 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix (10-13) never got closer than seven points after that.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lynx moved within 1 1/2 games of Sacramento for the third and  
final playoff spot in the WNBA's Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota had five players in double figures, led by Brandy Reed  
with 17. Angie Potthoff had a season-high 13. Marlies Askamp led 
Phoenix with 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, the WNBA's lowest scoring team, averaged just 54  
points in their last five games, shooting 33 percent and winning 
just once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lynx hit six of their first nine shots and led by as many as  
nine points in the first half. Phoenix scored the last five points 
to get within 24-20 at halftime. The Mercury made just 7-of-26 
first-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lynx ended a three-game home losing streak, while Phoenix  
fell to 1-7 in its past eight road games.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Payments Formula Devised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international commission is close to making  
recommendations on the divisive issue how much European insurers 
should pay Holocaust victims or their families based on pre-World 
War II life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission source on Tuesday disputed a published report  
asserting that agreement had been reached under which the insurers 
would pay 10 times the face value of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the  
figure an oversimplification, saying in some cases it would be less 
than 10 times and in other cases more. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, chaired by former Secretary of State Lawrence  
Eagleburger, is composed of five major European companies, Jewish 
groups and American regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger will seek comments from the five European insurers  
by Thursday and is expected to release final recommendations the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The five companies are: Allianz AG of Germany; AXA of France;  
Assicurazioni Generali SpA of Italy; Winterthur Swiss Insurance, a 
subsidiary of Winterthur Reinsurance Corp. of America; and 
Anglo-Swiss Zurich Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission decided in London in May to pay the ``real  
value'' of the policies. This led to approval here of a formula 
based on long-term government bond rates. The formula takes 
inflation into account and adds 2 percent interest per year, said 
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, 
who participated in talks held here two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> FTC Cites Five Travel Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state authorities announced  
actions against 25 travel companies Tuesday accused of luring 
consumers with flashy vacation offers and failing to disclose the 
full terms and costs of their trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission filed suit against five businesses  
asking that they stop their deceptive practices and seeking refunds 
for bilked consumers. An additional 20 companies face charges by 
state regulators, and two of them are also subjects of restitution 
oders from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Between July of 1998 and 1999, the FTC received nearly 2,500  
travel-related complaints worth more than $610,000 in alleged 
consumer losses. Of those complaints, nearly a third were against 
companies based in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem may be much more pervasive. The American Society  
of Travel Agents, for instance, estimates that $8 billion to $10 
billion is lost a year because of travel scams. 
</P>
<P>
	While travel scams are always a problem, ``they proliferate when  
demand is high for certain types of travel,'' says Dina Long, 
spokeswoman for the society. 
</P>
<P>
	At this time of year, consumers receive faxes touting special,  
cheap cruise tickets even when the ship line does not give 
discounts, Long says. 
</P>
<P>
	The approaching millennium celebration already is proving a gold  
mine for opportunists to exploit travelers who are willing to pay 
higher than premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are coming out of the woodwork with offers that are too  
good to be true,'' Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five companies targeted by the FTC are First Impressions  
Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; All Around Travel Club Inc. of 
Lauderdale Lakes, Fla.; ASQ Inc. of Las Vegas; Cerkvenik-Anderson 
Travel of Phoenix; and American International Travel Services Inc. 
of Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerkvenik-Anderson's general counsel, Brian Burt, denied the  
charges and said the commission was ``painting with a broad brush'' 
in including the business in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left with other companies were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Kuhaupt of Mesquite, Texas, expected a ``nice  
adventure'' after reviewing the glitzy promotional videos and 
brochures provided by American International Travel Service for her 
week-long Caribbean vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she got hassled for refusing to attend a promotional  
meeting for time-share condos, was told she would have to pay extra 
for a cabin aboard her ``cruise'' ship to the Bahamas and 
discovered her hotel food and drink vouchers were only valid at 
certain times of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told a little bit of truth and covered up the rest to  
make it look like something it was not,'' said Kuhaupt. 
</P>
<P>
	In one typical travel scam, consumers receive a fancy-looking  
travel certificate in the mail claiming that they have won a free 
hotel stay. When travelers call to claim their prize, they may have 
to pay the price of a plane ticket at a huge markup. A similar scam 
involves trips in which consumers must tour a time-share condo 
while on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Internet sites and print advertisements urge consumers to  
become a travel agent overnight, so they can reap the benefits of 
discounted industry fares. The problem is that the travel agent 
credentials -- which can cost as much as $495 -- are fake and won't 
be recognized by companies. Consumers who use them also are 
committing fraud.

<HEADLINE> Zapruder Heirs To Get $16M for Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government must pay the heirs of Dallas  
dressmaker Abraham Zapruder $16 million for his film that captured 
the assassination of President Kennedy -- 26 seconds of history the 
Zapruder family said should be valued like a van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 vote, announced by the Justice Department on Tuesday,  
arbitrators set the amount after lawyers for the government and 
Zapruder family could not agree on a price. The government offered 
$1 million; the family asked $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Zapruder film is one of a kind,'' arbitrators Arlin Adams,  
a former federal appeals court judge, and Kenneth Feinberg, wrote 
in a majority opinion. With no way to compare its value to any 
single object ever sold, they said they relied heavily on testimony 
given by auction house experts who tagged the value at $25 million 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The third arbitrator, Walter Dellinger, a former solicitor  
general and now a law professor at Duke University, wrote that $3 
million to $5 million would have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Posner, who wrote a book on the assassination, thought  
$16 million was overly generous, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that it's the American way to get as much as you  
can for something, but there is something unseemly about it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides accepted the figure as an appropriate  
compromise. The family said in a statement, ``We believe the result 
reached by the arbitration panel is fair and reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film is stored in a 25-degree room at the National Archives  
in College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The Assassination Records Review Board in 1997 declared the film  
the permanent possession of the people of the United States. The 
Constitution requires the government to pay owners of private 
property taken for the public good. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice  
Department's Civil Division, issued a statement, saying the 
government was relieved that the film would not just be stored at 
the archives but would be part of its permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Government appraisers had argued that without projection,  
Zapruder's movie was just a strip of celluloid wound around a 
plastic reel. They said that excluding jewelry, the highest amount 
paid for any of 1,200 items from former first lady Jacqueline 
Kennedy's estate was $1.4 million for an antique French desk her 
husband used in signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapruder family argued that the film should be valued like  
the works of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh or pop artist Andy 
Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Kennedy assassination researchers don't think the  
government should have paid a nickel, especially since the amount 
does not include the copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's outrageous,'' said Jim Lesar, president of the  
Assassination Archives and Research Center, a private collection of 
assassination documents. ``It's not the ownership of the film 
that's the problem, it's the copyright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Zapruder family charges high rates to reproduce the  
film for documentaries. A ``toll gate'' has been placed on the 
right of the American people to study and research the film, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family said it is working to transfer the copyright to a yet  
undisclosed public institution, but researchers wonder whether that 
will mean lower charges for using the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Bennett, the Zapruder family's lawyer, called the family  
a ``patriotic guardian'' of the film that ``rejected all offers to 
license the film for any purpose that could be considered 
distasteful or disrespectful of President Kennedy's memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zapruder cried when he told the Warren Commission in 1964 how he  
heard a shot and, through the lens of his Bell &AMP; Howell movie 
camera, saw Kennedy grab his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke down sobbing as he described a second shot and the  
bloody results that came ``before I had a chance to organize my 
mind.''

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins 'Showdown at Sherwood'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Great start, rocky finish.  
</P>
<P>
	That made David Duval a loser to Tiger Woods in golf's first  
appearance on network television in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing not far from where he grew up, Woods overcome a sluggish  
start and dominated the par-3 holes to beat Duval 2 and 1 in the 
``Showdown at Sherwood,'' a made-for-television match-play 
competition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing more than an exhibition match, but the world's  
top-ranked golfers were paid very well for their three-plus hours 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods earned $1.1 million, while Duval collected $400,000. Each  
will donate $200,000 to charity, including $100,000 each to the PGA 
Tour-sponsored First Tee program. 
</P>
<P>
	If either felt any pressure, it certainly wasn't evident,  
although neither was at his best. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time where the pressure perhaps should have been on, Woods  
and Duval were giggling like schoolchildren as they chatted while 
walking down the 15th fairway. Woods led 1-up at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached the match that David and I are good friends, and  
we were going to come out here and put on a good show,'' Woods 
said. ``I think it's a wonderful concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is this sort of thing the start of something new?  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but it's basically up to the ratings,''  
Woods said. ``How high the ratings are will determine how 
successful it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won the first two holes with a birdie and a par, but Woods  
won the next two, and added wins at the sixth and ninth holes for a 
2-up lead at the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	A win on 12 put Woods ahead 3-up, but when Duval won 13 and 14,  
it was anyone's match. 
</P>
<P>
	The players halved 15 before the match's biggest shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval hit what he would later call his best shot of the day down  
the middle on the par-4, 449-yard 16th hole, but the ball took one 
bounce into a rock formation some 300 yards from the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant a one-shot penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Woods hit two terrific shots to leave him 10 feet  
from the hole. Duval conceded, giving Woods a 2-up lead with two 
holes left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the worst breaks I've ever seen, to end up in  
Jack's little concoction in the middle of the fairway,'' Woods 
said, referring to Jack Nicklaus, the course designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it where I was aiming it,'' Duval said. ``I've played  
the Shark Shootout three times (at Sherwood Country Club), I know 
it's there. I've aimed for it every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, to his dismay, he hit it.  
</P>
<P>
	Needing a birdie to keep the match alive, Duval's tee shot on  
the 232-yard 17th caught a ridge and rolled 50 feet from the hole. 
Woods was 40 feet away, and lagged his putt within 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval then conceded, and they smiled and shook hands as the  
floodlights installed on the final two holes at Sherwood before the 
match cast shadows across the green. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth par-3 hole played by the pair; Woods won the  
first four. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about match play is I was down early, I knew I  
could come back,'' Woods said. ``It's a game of momentum. The 
momentum changes, it's like the NBA or football, when a team gets 
on a roll, they get all pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three times and has finished no worse than  
seventh since his post-Masters break, is No. 1 in the world 
rankings -- a position Duval previously held by becoming the first 
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rivalry? Not yet,'' Woods said. ``We haven't gone  
head-to-head yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, Woods and Duval have been paired together only  
one other time, in the third round of the World Series of Golf last 
year, a tournament Duval went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods took it easy heading into the event, hanging around the  
area and playing a practice round Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, meanwhile, played in the Hartford Open before traveling  
to California and arriving Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't use fatigue as an excuse.  
</P>
<P>
	``My game did not feel very good today, it was really  
disappointing,'' he said. ``I don't know why. I know I can play 
better against him than I did today. I was a bit apprehensive about 
it, I was a bit nervous, but I enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he hoped the exhibition would bring more interest to  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tiger turned pro in '96, golf became cool -- not a dorky  
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was attended by about 2,000 fans. The price of general  
admission tickets was cut in half last week because of poor sales -- 
those who bought in advance were given a chance at a rebate or an 
additional ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Woods described the crowd as ``boisterous.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty exciting atmosphere,'' he said. ``There were  
no gray areas. They were either for one player or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them were for Woods, and they got their wish. The  
hometown guy won.

<HEADLINE> McCain Speaks of Military, Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain says he would oppose reviving a military draft even though 
enlistments are down. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern military requires technical skills to operate today's  
sophisticated weapons, and it takes a long time to acquire those 
skills, the Republican senator from Arizona said Monday during the 
last leg of a bus tour through South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the old days, you would spend six weeks showing a recruit  
the right end of a gun and send him on his way,'' said McCain, a 
senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense analysts say the services could be forced to return to  
selective conscription if they can't fill the ranks with higher pay 
and improved benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain blamed Congress for the shortage, saying it has failed to  
provide the necessary funding to raise military pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The military is not seen as an attractive option, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain told the local Rotary Club here that there are 11,000  
military personnel on food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a national disgrace,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, McCain urged everyone to read the latest  
national report on gambling, which warns of its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is a longtime defender of American Indian tribal casinos  
and supported legislation in 1995 that paved the way for gambling 
``cruises to nowhere.'' While he defended the rights of the Indians 
to set up their own casinos, McCain said he also warned of the 
consequences associated with gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	And state-run lotteries aren't any better, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who buys lottery tickets?'' he asked. ``When I'm in a Circle  
K, I know who buys lottery tickets. The lowest income.''

<HEADLINE> Top Antivirus Company's Security Invaded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Like firefighters turning their hoses  
on arsonists inside their own firehouse, Symantec Corp. repulsed 
hackers who infiltrated the leading antivirus software company. 
</P>
<P>
	The hackers posted a message on Symantec's Web site early  
Monday, threatening to disarm the company by unleashing a worm, or 
a mutating line of destructive code sent via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Symantec employees in the Netherlands noticed the threat after  
about an hour, and called executives in San Jose, who deleted the 
message and repulsed the contagion with Symantec's security 
software, said spokesman Richard Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials didn't say whether they were embarrassed by  
the security breach, but they did notify the FBI, which is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	American businesses lost $7.6 billion due to software viruses  
during the first half of 1999 -- more than in all of 1998, according 
to Computer Economics, a research firm in Carlsbad.

<HEADLINE> Saturn President Has Determination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- The determination and self-confidence  
that helped make Cynthia Trudell the first woman to head a major 
U.S. automaker were clearly in evidence the first time she bought a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	When the native of New Brunswick, Canada, saw her dream car -- a  
yellow 1973 Ford Capri with black interior -- she knew she had to 
have it. She also knew she couldn't get it out of the dealer's lot 
because she didn't know how to drive a stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I don't know how to drive this now, but I will within  
24 hours,''' Trudell recalled. ``My friend had to drive it off the 
parking lot, but I was driving it the next day!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell's love affair with cars never waned and has taken her to  
the presidency of Saturn Corp., a position she assumed in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something just sexy and exciting about cars. I love to  
drive them and (I love) how they work,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell stands out in the male-dominated hierarchy of the auto  
industry not only because she is a woman, but because she is so 
approachable. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's very down-to-earth. She talks to you, not at you,'' said  
Dora Mack-Talley, Saturn's liaison to United Auto Workers Local 
1853. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times people are leery to approach someone in that  
capacity,'' said David Motil, who works in the Spring Hill plant. 
``But she came down here one day ... . People were amazed. They 
were going `Wow, she's actually over here interested in what we're 
doing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said having a woman president fits in with Saturn's  
reputation for ``pushing the envelope, trying new things and 
breaking new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell, 46, has her work cut out at Saturn, a General Motors  
Corp. subsidiary that has seen its spotless reputation tarnished 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The sting still lingers from last year's labor unrest and sales  
continue to lag as the company transforms itself from a one-model, 
one-factory operation to a two-factory company with three models 
and likely more. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell hasn't had much time to address those issues since she  
left GM's IBC Vehicles in Luton, England, to become the fourth 
president in Saturn's 14-year history. She took over from Donald 
Hudler, who retired after 3 1/2 years as president and 43 years with 
GM. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, while moving with her husband and two teen-age children  
to a house in Tennessee, Trudell helped put the finishing touches 
on a new mid-size car being manufactured at Saturn's Wilmington, 
Del., plant. 
</P>
<P>
	She's also preparing the Spring Hill plant to build a sport  
utility vehicle next year and spending time in Troy, Mich., where 
it's being designed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Trudell is traveling around the country meeting Saturn  
dealers while trying to get to know workers and the union leaders 
they elected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Hankins, the new president of UAW Local 1853 in Spring Hill,  
said Trudell impressed him during their initial meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seems to be somebody who sticks to her word. And she's  
absolutely committed to the partnership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That partnership is the Spring Hill plant's unique  
labor-management contract, which rewards productivity and gives 
workers a say in how the company is run. Saturn employees average 
about 12 percent less in salary than GM's other workers but can add 
to their base pay by hitting production goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Saturn's Delaware plant are covered by the UAW  
contract that governs all other GM employees, but they also have a 
contract with the local union that includes some of the teamwork 
aspects in the Spring Hill agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Spring Hill workers upset with their dwindling  
bonuses and input on management decisions gave their union leaders 
authority to call a strike. They decided not to picket after 
getting word the plant would be home to a new SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us like an uncertain future. When we have those types  
of uneasiness, they come to a climax and I think last summer was 
the climax,'' Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the plant's 7,200 union employees voted out most of  
their leaders, some of whom had represented workers since the plant 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	While Trudell and the new leaders are sure to have ``tiffs,''  
she said she looks forward to a good relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing is to make sure they're involved as we plan our  
future,'' Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hankins said Trudell and the union are working together to keep  
Spring Hill's powertrain production unit, where engines and 
transmissions are assembled, and its 2,000 jobs. GM reportedly is 
considering moving the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell wants to keep Saturn's team approach in the factory,  
no-haggle pricing policy on the sales floor and reputation for 
premium customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	But she will make changes once she finishes evaluating the  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business is going to become far more complex,'' she said.  
``So we can't naively assume we'll be able to run the business as 
we've always done it. But we still need the basic values -- people 
involvement and empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell's first experience with automobiles came growing up in  
Saint John, New Brunswick, where her father was a car salesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to get really interested in the cars my dad would bring  
home. And then when we would have to go pick up a customer's car 
because it wasn't right, I learned what quality was and what it 
wasn't,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she didn't jump right into the car business. She went to  
school, eventually earning a doctorate in physical chemistry at the 
University of Windsor, Ontario, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really thought I'd be a professor in university. But somehow  
that just wasn't what was calling me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a job as chemical process engineer at Ford Motor Corp.'s  
Windsor plant the next year. In 1981, GM hired her as senior 
engineering supervisor at its Windsor Transmission Plant, later 
promoting her to superintendent of manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	She moved up through GM's ranks, working in Michigan, Ontario  
and Delaware before heading to England to run IBC Vehicles, which 
manufactures the Fronterra 4-wheel-drive vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Through her varied work and educational experience, she knows  
car-making from the inside-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not gonna pull one over on her when it comes to that,''  
Hankins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell, who reads voraciously and laughs often, said she might  
differ from a male car company president in insight into how a 
customer views a product or service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand how a female customer wants to be treated. I  
personally resent it if anyone patronizes me. That's why I strongly 
identified with the philosophical culture of Saturn, where people 
are treated with respect,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudell also values teamwork.  
</P>
<P>
	``I bring to the party insight and strategy, but when it comes  
to execution, it's through the people that you execute,'' she said, 
quickly adding, ``That doesn't mean I tolerate mediocrity. ... I 
set extremely high standards in both quality and execution. 
Perfection is the standard I work to achieve and hold others to.''

<HEADLINE>  High Jumper Flunks Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A physician from the Cuban delegation  
traveled to Montreal on Tuesday to examine the urine samples of an 
athlete whose initial test came up positive at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While rumors swirled that the athlete is four-time Pan Ams high  
jump champion and world record-holder Javier Sotomayor, Dr. Rodrigo 
Alvarez Cambra journeyed to the testing facility in Montreal, 
sources close to the Cuban team told The Associated Press. The 
sources, who asked not to be identified, would not say if Sotomayor 
is the athlete -- or if it is even a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the sources emphasized, a key medical officer of the  
delegation would not be sent on such an assignment if the drug test 
did not involve a leading Cuban athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing that Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican  
Republic, winner of the women's high jump, was stripped of her 
medal for failing a drug test, organizers also said another 
athlete's A test had come back positive. But no action will be 
taken and the name will not be released unless the B sample turns 
out to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about Sotomayor failing a drug test, Pan  
American Sports Organization president Mario Vasquez Rana refused 
to speak specifically and would say only that the positive A test 
``could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams organizers said Arrendel tested positive for the banned  
anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same substance that caused Ben 
Johnson to be stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at the 
1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel was quoted in the Dominican Republic as denying she  
used stanozolol and said the test may have picked up a decongestant 
she used before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six years in athletics, I have never used substances to  
enhance my performance,'' she said in remarks published Tuesday in 
the newspaper La Informacion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams officials also said Ray Martinez, a baseball player from  
Mexico, refused to take a drug test Monday after his team's loss to 
Canada in the bronze medal game. That was tantamount to a positive 
test, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel's It was the second drug case announced at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	If Mexico had won the game, it would have been stripped of the  
bronze medal, Vasquez Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not take him as he were dirty or cheating,'' Vasquez Rana  
said. ``He was just punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 4 inches and  
had been the Dominican Republic's only gold medalist at the games 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's Solange Witteveen, the runner-up, gets the gold. The  
silver goes to Brazil's Luciane Dambacher and the bronze to 
Canada's Nicole Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first drug case of the games, Steve Vezina, goalkeeper  
for the Canadian in-line roller hockey team that beat the United 
States 7-6 in the title game, tested positive for stimulants and 
steroids. Canada was stripped of the gold, which was awarded to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record holder, won the high jump on the  
last day of the track and field competition. But neither Vasquez 
Rana nor the medical director of the games, Eduardo de Rose, would 
confirm that the positive A test came from the last day of that 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if that test came from the final day, de Rose  
said, ``I don't want to answer your question. I have the right to 
no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez Rana said all the track and field testing had been  
completed and ``we have no positive results officially unless we 
count that from the Dominican Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, talking about the A sample, Vasquez Rana said, ``There is  
a positive A that could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Rose did say that he ``never had an experience to see a B  
(test) not confirm an A.''

<HEADLINE> IRL Fines Cheever, Unser $5,000 Each </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Drivers Eddie Cheever and Robby Unser were  
fined $5,000 each for unsportsmanlike conduct by the Indy Racing 
League on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Ron Green also said the IRL would investigate rookie  
driver Scott Harrington's conduct during Sunday's MBNA Mid-Atlantic 
200. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington conceded that some drivers complained to the IRL  
about his tactics, which he said were being misinterpreted as 
blocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, angry and frustrated, walked down pit road after the  
IRL race at Dover Downs International Speedway to where Harrington 
was seated. A profane argument ensued, and Cheever admits he 
grabbed Harrington by his racing uniform and lifted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser joined Cheever as he walked toward Harrington. Witnesses  
said others in the area stepped in and quoted Unser as telling 
Harrington: ``It isn't over yet. This is just the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the confrontation, Cheever apologized.  
</P>
<P>
	``My actions were inexcusable,'' he said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Unser said Tuesday he also regretted what happened.

	Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Up 31.35  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A volatile session on Wall Street ended with  
mixed results for stocks today as a forecast of continued economic 
growth kept investors on edge about interest rates. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed up 31.35 at 10,677.31 after shifting 
between positive and negative territory for much of the day. 
Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index 
suffered another steep loss as technology stocks faltered. It was 
down 35.53 at 2,588.00. ``The general tenor is one of malaise,'' 
said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter 
Ltd.

	Leading Economic Indicators Rise  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is poised to keep growing at  
least through the first half of 2000, leaving it on track for 
achieving the longest expansion ever, according to a key gauge of 
future activity. The Conference Board said its Index of Leading 
Economic Indicators, which is designed to help spot turning points 
in the economy, rose 0.3 percent in June to 107.7. That matched the 
May increase and brought gains in the indicators to eight out of 
the past nine months. The last decline, in April, was 0.1 percent. 
The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106 
months, from February 1962 until December 1969. The current 
expansion, which began in March 1991, would match the record if it 
continues through January 2000 and pass it if it lasts until 
February.

	SEC Makes Small Stock Fraud 'Sweep'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities and Exchange Commission officials  
announced today their second nationwide sweep against small-company 
stock fraud, a success tempered by worries over a legislative 
proposal that could reduce the SEC's budget and hamper future 
enforcement efforts. ``It certainly would cut into our ability to 
bring cases,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said. He 
announced enforcement actions against 82 people and companies in 26 
cases of alleged stock fraud that bilked investors of millions of 
dollars. The latest fraud sweep differed from the first, conducted 
last October, which cracked down on investment fraud over the 
Internet. This time, only four Internet cases were involved. This 
time, such offenses as stock-price manipulation and sales of 
unregistered stocks were among a wide variety of targeted offenses.

	ExciteAtHome Denies Merger Rumor  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome Corp. denied a report that the  
company is in merger talks with Yahoo!, though it acknowledged 
today that the two Internet companies have talked about a 
partnership. Yahoo!, the second-largest Web search and directory 
destination, has held discussions over the last six weeks to 
acquire ExciteAtHome, the No. 6 destination, for more than $17 
billion, according to an article published on BusinessWeek Online. 
But ExciteAtHome president George Bell, speaking at a technology 
conference, told reporters, ``There is no truth to the rumors about 
acquisition discussions.'' A Yahoo! spokeswoman said the company 
does not comment on market rumors. Shares of ExciteAtHome were at 
43 3/8, up 7/8. Shares of Yahoo! were at 125 3/8, down 6 15/16.

	Top Antivirus Company's Security Invaded  
</P>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Symantec Corp. repulsed hackers who  
infiltrated the leading antivirus software company. The hackers 
posted a message on Symantec's Web site early yesterday, 
threatening to disarm the company by unleashing a worm, or a 
mutating line of destructive code sent via e-mail. Symantec 
employees in the Netherlands noticed the threat after about an 
hour, and called executives in San Jose, who deleted the message 
and repulsed the contagion with Symantec's security software, said 
spokesman Richard Saunders.

	Waste Management Meets Low Estimate  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc., whose stock price shrank  
in half last month in the wake of two separate warnings of reduced 
earnings, met lowered expectations today. The nation's No. 1 trash 
hauler earned $371.8 million after special items, or 58 cents a 
share, compared with $243.2 million, or 41 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Analysts initially had Houston-based Waste 
Management earning 78 cents per share, then lowered their estimate 
to 67 cents after the company's July 6 warning. Last week, the 
company issued a second warning of earnings between 58 and 60 cents 
a share. Shares of Waste Management were at 24 3/16, down 1 1/4.

	Online Banking Risks Criticized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the inherent risks of Internet  
banking, nearly half the banks, thrifts and credit unions in a 
survey hadn't taken all the necessary steps to limit risks, 
according to a report by congressional investigators released 
today. The number of financial institutions offering Internet 
banking has nearly tripled over the past year, and more than 6 
million Americans go online to transfer money between accounts, pay 
bills, check account or investment balances and apply for loans. 
Some lawmakers are concerned about the safety and security of 
online banking and the possibility that consumers could lose money 
or have their financial privacy breached by hackers.

	IBM Wants $11 Million Tax Refund  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- City schools would be hit hard if IBM  
wins a lawsuit that could mean a property tax refund of as much as 
$11 million. The New York-based electronics giant claims Santa 
Clara County over-assessed three of the company's properties in San 
Jose by more than $1 billion between 1990 and 1994. ``The CEO of 
IBM ... has given a lot of speeches about the poor state of public 
education, but through a technicality, IBM is now attempting to get 
a tax refund that would directly impact in a big way schools,'' 
county tax assessor Larry Stone said. ``Our commitment to education 
is indisputable,'' countered IBM spokesman Kevin McKee. In the 
lawsuit, filed Friday in Santa Clara County Superior Court, the 
company argues the county overvalued its main San Jose campus and 
two other locations during the early-'90s recession.

	Toys R Us Recalls Doll Sets  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 71,000 dolls that come with bathtub  
accessories were recalled today by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission because the toys pose a choking risk to young children. 
Bathtub Baby -- a vinyl doll that comes with a blue plastic bathtub, 
a fish-shaped strainer and a small pink ball -- was sold at Toys R 
Us stores from October 1998 until last month. After inspecting the 
toy, the commission determined the ball was too small for children 
under 3 years old. Owners should immediately return the doll set 
for a refund. Toys R Us sold Bathtub Baby for about $2.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drs. Don't Ask About Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Doctors are missing an opportunity to find  
victims of domestic violence by failing to ask all their patients 
about abuse during routine office visits, according to a study of 
California physicians released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of the 400 primary care physicians surveyed  
said they would inquire about abuse during routine office exams. By 
comparison, 79 percent said they would ask if the patient showed 
signs of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's reason to be concerned, especially in the context of  
knowing that physical violence occurs in 4 (million) to 6 million 
relationships each year,'' said the study's lead author, Michael 
Rodriguez of the University of California, San Francisco Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez based his estimate of the scope of domestic violence  
on two national studies, one conducted by the University of Rhode 
Island and the other by the Commonwealth Fund Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was reported in the latest issue of the Journal of the  
American Medical Association. Since 1993, the AMA has encouraged 
physicians to ask all patients about their exposure to domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the most important thing to emerge from this is that  
routine screening is still woefully uncommon in the primary care 
settings,'' said Patricia Salber, president of Physicians for a 
Violence Free Society and a former emergency room doctor.

<HEADLINE> '20/20' Helps ABC in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If not for the newsmagazine ``20/20,'' it would  
be a bleak midsummer week in the ratings for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsmagazine's separate Friday, Sunday, Monday and Wednesday  
editions each drew higher Nielsen Media Research ratings than 
anything put on the air by ABC's entertainment division last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ``20/20'' drew the biggest audience, and was topped in  
Nielsen's prime-time standings for the week only by a ``Frasier'' 
rerun on NBC. Friday's ``20/20'' featured a Barbara Walters 
interview with tennis star Alexandra Stevenson and her mother, 
Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
	The best the entertainment division could do was a movie rerun,  
``A Kidnapping in the Family,'' which ranked No. 23 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive signs for ABC News didn't extend to its summer  
replacement series, ``Nightline in Primetime: Brave New World.'' 
The offbeat news show that examines concepts like speed and 
technology finished No. 76 in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other ABC specials, an entertainment show from Ford's  
Theatre and a review of the Paris fashion collections, fared even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won the week with a 6.5 rating and 12 share. NBC had a 6.2  
rating and 12 share, ABC was at 5.5 and 10, and Fox had a 4.6 
rating and 9 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share. Struggling UPN was at 1.4 and 3, while Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.4 and 16. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.2 rating and 16 
share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of July 26-Aug. 1, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 8.6; ``20/20-Friday,'' 
ABC, 8.5; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Undue Influence, Part 1,'' CBS, 8.5; 
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 8.4; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.2; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.1; ``ER,'' 
NBC, 8.1; ``Dateline NBC-Wednesday,'' NBC, 8.0; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
8.0.

<HEADLINE> Some Chemical Exposure OK for Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Low-level exposure to chemicals that disrupt  
hormones won't necessarily lead to additional cancers or 
infertility, a scientific panel said Tuesday, stressing that more 
research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is clear that exposure to these chemicals at high  
concentrations can affect wildlife and human health, the National 
Academy of Sciences' 16-member research panel said, ``the extent of 
harm caused by exposure ... in concentrations that are common in 
the environment is debated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Far too little is understood about the possible harmful effects  
from low-level exposure to such chemicals, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists and numerous health experts have argued there  
is growing evidence that synthetic chemicals affect estrogen levels 
and even at low doses may lead to cancers, neurological problems 
and infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	These chemicals, called ``endocrine disrupters,'' are the  
subject of a massive screening process directed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency with as many 15,000 chemicals to be 
tested. The tests are being conducted mostly by industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAS panel's report said the current literature does not  
support an association between exposure to low levels of these 
chemicals and breast cancer or a variety of other hormonally 
sensitive cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists acknowledged there has been evidence of adverse  
reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife and laboratory 
animals because of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. But 
it said that increases in male reproductive disorders in humans 
cannot be linked to the chemicals at doses found generally in the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the panel agreed there is ample evidence that fetal  
exposure to high doses of these chemicals -- such as exposure to 
high amounts of pesticides in fish or other foods -- have been found 
to hinder nervous system development in humans as well as birds and 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the study said the data on the effects of these chemicals on  
human nervous system development at levels in the environment is 
insufficient to make a definitive conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	In all these areas, the panel said additional studies are  
needed, especially on children whose mothers were exposed to such 
chemical agents during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Determining the risks to humans from contact with these  
chemicals in the environment is difficult because ordinary exposure 
of these agents has not been routinely monitored, said Ernst 
Knobil, of the University of Texas and chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But several scientists, including a member of the panel, said in  
interviews that the data on which the study was based is now two 
years old and that more recent research suggests a closer link 
between endocrine disrupting chemicals and human health. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a ``plausibility of human harm'' that cannot be  
ignored, Frederick vom Saal, a professor of biological sciences at 
the University of Missouri, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Vom Saal, a member of the research panel, said the degree to  
which there is consensus on the effects of these chemicals at the 
molecular level on wildlife and on laboratory animals suggests the 
likelihood of impact on humans as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter deFur, an environmental biologist at the Virginia  
Commonwealth University, who reviewed the report, said more recent 
research not covered by the study implies ``a closer link to human 
health'' impacts than the study suggests. ``There is a tremendous 
amount of research activity going on a number of these questions,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> MLS Commissioner Logan To Be Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Doug Logan, the only commissioner in the 3 1/2-year history of  
Major League Soccer, will be removed perhaps as soon as Wednesday, 
a soccer source said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Garber, the senior vice president and managing director of  
NFL International, is expected to be hired as his replacement, the 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of Logan was first reported in today's Washington  
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was not in his office today and MLS canceled his weekly  
conference call with reporters. No reason was given. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not commenting on the matter at the present time,''  
league spokesman Dan Courtemanche said. ``However, we do expect to 
have further details within the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flat television ratings and attendance have plagued the league  
since the beginning of its second year. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan had predicted a 15 percent increase in average attendance  
from the league's first year to the second. The average crowd 
actually fell from 17,406 to 14,619, a 16 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	It further fell to 14,312 last season but has rebounded to  
15,174 through this past weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would be the second major senior management shakeup in  
less than six months. Deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati was fired in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was Gulati's decision last year to unilaterally  
exercise the league's option to renew the contract New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos, a close friend of Gulati. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati reportedly did not consult with MetroStars management,  
which angered Stuart Subotnick, one of the club's two 
investor-operators. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operates under a ``single-entity'' concept, whereby  
individuals or companies invest in the league and receive the 
rights to operate a club. The league contracts with all the 
players, assigns the major stars to clubs in the name of 
competitive balance and gate attraction, and pays them from a 
central fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the salaries the league negotiates with the players,  
each team must stay under a $1.7 million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulati has been a major figure in American soccer for more than  
a decade, including having a key role in the organizing committee 
of the 1994 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation and the formation 
of MLS.

<HEADLINE> Electric Industry Set on Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The electric utility industry told the  
government Tuesday it is prepared to deal with any Y2K computer 
problems, but federal officials reacted cautiously -- and promised 
spot checks of power plants in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't declare total victory yet,'' Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson told the industry representatives. He said consumers 
``deserve the answer to a simple question -- whether their utility's 
critical systems are ready for the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Electric Reliability Council, which has  
spearheaded the industry's preparation for any potential computer 
glitch at the end of the year, declared that overall, 99 percent of 
all ``critical elements'' of the electric supply system have been 
tested and passed muster. 
</P>
<P>
	``If New Year' Day 2000 were tomorrow, we believe the lights  
would remain on in North America,'' Michehl R. Gent, the council's 
president, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gent said the nuclear power plants ``are in good shape'' and the  
electricity distribution systems of both private and publicly owned 
utilities have largely been verified -- 96. 3 percent -- as prepared 
for the end of the year transition. Another 3.2 percent of the 
distribution systems have reported they will be ready by the end of 
the year, and one-half of 1 percent have not been heard from, the 
reliability council said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, assistant to President Clinton for Y2K  
conversion, expressed some concern at the news conference about 
power companies postponing action on some critical tests until 
later in the year so as not to disrupt electricity service. He said 
these tests shouldn't be delayed too long, leaving enough time to 
correct errors and unexpected problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Koskinen said, the electric power industry ``is within  
sight of the finish line'' when it comes to Y2K preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson promised his department would ``crack the whip''  
against utilities that have not yet completed their critical tests 
and would conduct spot-check audits on utilities to make sure 
information they're reporting is correct. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry will conduct a nationwide drill on Sept. 8-9, which  
will amount to a dress rehearsal for the Y2K conversion on New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Gent said that since utilities' computers are pegged to  
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the critical period of the conversion 
will be from 6 p.m. EST on Dec. 31 to 2 a.m. EST on Jan. 1. He said 
the industry also will remain on ``a maximum state of readiness'' 
into Monday, Jan. 3, the first business day of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem stems from the fact that many computers were  
originally programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a 
year. Such computers will not be able to differentiate between 2000 
and 1900 and, therefore, may malfunction if not adapted.

<HEADLINE> Agent: AWOL Vikings Player To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood skipped out on the  
Minnesota Vikings to attend to a ``family matter'' and will return 
to training camp Wednesday, his agent said after finally tracking 
down the AWOL rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called to inform me that he was planning to be back in  
Mankato tonight. He apologized for the way he took off without 
talking to anybody or asking for permission from the team or even 
letting me know or anyone else know that he was doing what he was 
doing,'' agent Craig Domann said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to deal with a family matter that had gotten to crisis  
proportions, and he had to take care of it. He is now focusing his 
energies back on football. I informed him that he would need to be 
talking to coach Green. He said he was looking forward to doing 
that either late tonight or first thing tomorrow morning depending 
on what time he got in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the family matter or  
Underwood's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green wouldn't discuss Underwood's status after  
learning that the rookie had been located more than 24 hours after 
his mysterious disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I said, I only talk in the morning,'' Green said as he  
went to dinner at the team's dormitory just before 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick, inexplicably disappeared  
from training camp Monday, worrying the team, his agent and his 
family, all concerned about his well being. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been my only concern the whole time,'' assistant coach  
Andre Patterson said Tuesday before Underwood was tracked down. 
``Football's just a game. I couldn't sleep because of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann didn't hear from his client until Tuesday evening.  
Neither did Underwood's mother and brother in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State, was the 29th selection in the NFL draft. He signed a 
five-year contract Sunday for more than $5 million, including a 
partially deferred signing bonus of $1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann dropped off his client at the team's dorm Sunday  
afternoon, and Underwood, dressed in military fatigues, proclaimed: 
``It feels good to be in Minnesota, a long anticipation. I got the 
war fatigues, got the Army fatigues, got to go to war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He participated in Monday morning's workout, ate lunch with his  
teammates, then between noon and the players meeting at 3 p.m., he 
vanished, leaving most of his clothes and personal items, including 
a Bible, in his room. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7:30 p.m. Monday, the Vikings issued a statement saying  
Underwood, who missed his senior season at Michigan State because 
of an ankle injury, had left camp without permission and without 
telling anybody where he was going or why. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said nothing occurred during  
the morning practice that would have indicated there was a problem. 
And his roommate, rookie defensive end Talance Sawyer, said 
Underwood never said anything about leaving camp, although he said 
Underwood received a phone call shortly before his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was miffed by the rookie's unexcused absence from three  
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're disappointed the guy would not want to play  
football. That's really what it comes down to,'' Green said. ``He's 
not the first guy to ever walk out of camp without permission and I 
guess he probably won't be the last one, either. But we'll stay 
focused on our football team. Now, it's just between Dimitrius, the 
NFL and us. We take a fairly aggressive approach on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green refused to elaborate or to say if Underwood, who was  
expected to compete with Stalin Colinet at left end, would face 
disciplinary action upon his return.

<HEADLINE> Gunman's Two Kids Laid To Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Having already lost his daughter and  
wife to violence, Bill Spivey was overcome at the thought of having 
to bury his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Spivey broke down in tears Monday and appeared to stagger with  
grief at the White Columns Chapel while saying goodbye to Matthew 
and Mychelle Barton, who were killed Wednesday by their father, 
Mark O. Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a suspect in the death of Deborah Spivey Barton and  
Eloise Powell Spivey five years ago, killed his second wife, Leigh 
Ann, before opening fire at two brokerage offices in Atlanta on 
Thursday, leaving another nine dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Kenneth Hennesy told Spivey and 300 other friends and  
family members that they shouldn't question why the children were 
gone. He urged them to take comfort in the fact that they had gone 
on to something better. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the chapel, teddy bears and inscriptions ``Gone to be  
with Momma'' decorated the pulpit. Mourners recalled how Matthew, 
11, loved baseball and Mychelle, 7, was an active Girl Scout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to remind you how your lives have been enriched just by  
knowing them,'' Hennesy said. ``Sometimes the answers are not there 
for the understanding of man, but there for us when we get to 
heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was suspected but never charged in the murder of his  
mother-in-law and first wife -- the children's mother -- five years 
ago. The women's bodies were found hacked to death in a camper in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Barton's two youngest victims was one of three  
held Monday. Two more were scheduled for today, for day traders 
Edward Quinn and Joe Dessert. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, services were held for Kevin Dial, 36, a manager at  
Momentum Securities and one of the first to die in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial's sister, Sherri Dial read a letter from her brother  
written a day before his death that vowed that he would live life 
to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure you're with Elvis, having cocktails, trying to  
convince God to let (John) Belushi visit,'' Ms. Dial said, speaking 
of her brother and drawing chuckles from mourners. ``And I think 
he'll probably do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, a memorial service was held  
for Russell Brown, a 42-year-old day trader at Momentum Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in his life, he finally found something he  
loved in day trading -- he would have done it 24 hours a day if 
possible,'' Brown's fiancee Patti Balon told those attending the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss ... his laugh, his little smirk, the way he walked,  
his hugs -- those hugs that meant it had been awhile since you'd 
seen each other and he was so glad to see you,'' said family friend 
Ray Chase.

<HEADLINE> GM Production Resumes in N.J., La. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Production resumed Tuesday at General Motors  
Corp. assembly plants in Louisiana and New Jersey after a problem 
with leaky brake lines on some pickups and sport utility vehicles 
was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, detected Friday, led GM to idle the plants Monday.  
The problem affected two-wheel-drive versions of the Chevrolet 
S-10, GMC Sonoma and Isuzu Hombre pickups produced at Shreveport, 
La., and the same pickups and two-door Chevrolet Blazer and GMC 
Jimmy SUVs made at Linden, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the leaks were found on a small number of vehicles in  
final inspection and were determined to be caused by a brake line 
wiggling loose as the trucks moved down the line. The problem was 
with assembly, not with the brake system itself, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Full production resumed at Shreveport Monday and limited  
production was under way at Linden.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Westbrook Can Keep Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Despite a broken hand, Detroit  
Lions cornerback Bryant Westbrook can continue training 
immediately, coach Bobby Ross said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook, the Lions' first-round draft pick in 1997, broke a  
bone in his left hand during Monday afternoon's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he can come out here and do some things in terms  
of drill work, which will keep him tuned to what he has to do,'' 
Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said that he can begin working out and running, although he  
is off-limits to hitting drills. Ross added that Westbrook should 
be back by the second week of the exhibition season, and that he 
shouldn't have to rush in order to be ready for season opener on 
Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll be okay,'' Ross said. ``That'll be fine as long as he  
can keep his conditioning and keep his work on the field. I want 
him to keep his sharpness because he came back (into training camp) 
very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross also said cornerback Kevin Abrams, out with a foot injury,  
will travel to New York to see a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross added he wants another opinion on Abrams' injury ``just to  
make sure'' that it is all right for him to begin practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another Lions player sidelined Tuesday was offensive lineman  
Aaron Gibson, a first-round pick in the 1999 draft. The 380-pound 
Gibson was red-shirted for the day due to a recurring shoulder 
injury that has hampered him since mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson underwent an MRI and an ultrasound Tuesday. Ross said he  
was not sure yet what the results of the procedures were, adding 
that he is keeping Gibson out of practice for now as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on rookie defensive end Jared DeVries, the Lions'  
third-round pick in April, was better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ross, the injury which DeVries sustained when his  
foot was stepped on by a cleat Monday resulted in a mild sprain but 
no broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's day-to-day,'' Ross said. ``It could be a while because  
there's a lot of swelling, but we dodged a bullet on that one, and 
we feel pretty good about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Luther Elliss continues to be held out of  
practice as he recovers from a broken orbital bone beneath his eye 
suffered in a July surfing accident.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Smith Aims for Super Bowl Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. -- There's one thing that could send Bruce Smith  
into retirement at the end of the 1999 season, but it's a good 
thing for Buffalo fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of the most dominant defensive players in NFL  
history, says he'll retire for sure after the season -- only if the 
Bills win the Super Bowl, something the team has failed to 
accomplish four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get to the Super Bowl and win, I will retire,'' Smith,  
36, said Tuesday. ``You'd better believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-time Pro Bowl selection who still carries the bittersweet  
memories of four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 1990s, 
Smith begins his 15th season with the health and optimism of a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some exciting new players and some who have been here  
a while and are ready to blossom,'' Smith said. ``And we have some 
older players who just seem to keep getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Count Smith among the latter.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Bills' all-time leader in sacks with 163 and second  
in the NFL behind Reggie White (192.5), entered training camp for 
the first time with no distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No contract disputes,'' Smith said. ``And the only pain I'm  
suffering from is old age. Fifteen years ago, you never could have 
told me that I would still be in this game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and White are the only two players to have recorded 10 or  
more sacks in 12 seasons; Smith had 10 last year. ``The older you 
get the harder it gets,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell Thurman Thomas, one of three Bills -- along with Smith  
and Andre Reed -- left from Marv Levy's Super Bowl teams. He says 
his friend still draws a crowd on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce is Bruce,'' Thomas said. ``They might say he's getting  
old and has lost a step or whatever, but you haven't lost that much 
of a step when people are still double- and triple-teaming you. 
That's out of respect; they know that he can still tear up an 
entire offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Bills struggled early, losing their first three  
games of the season. They rebounded with a strong finish before 
losing to Miami in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting off on a positive note and not being 0-3 or 0-4 is  
important,'' Smith said. ``If we get off on the right foot, we'll 
be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith serves on the board of directors for Operation Smile, a  
charity based in his hometown of Norfolk, Va., that helps poor 
children in developing nations who have facial disfigurements. The 
young patients have their cleft palates repaired free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	For 17 days in March, Smith watched and even assisted in  
surgeries in places such as Kenya and Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an overwhelming feeling to see that child look normal  
because a lot of times what happens in the community in the tribes 
over there, they're thought of as being outcasts. They shoo them 
away or don't pay any attention to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip put things in perspective for Smith, who has donated  
some of his own money to the charity. ``It kind of gets me a little 
emotional because we take so much for granted in this country. Over 
there, their average income is $30 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith draws inspiration also from father, George, who has been  
plagued by several ailments including emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wrote him off about six or seven years ago,''  
Smith said. ``They said he had six months to live, and my father's 
still hanging around. He's not in very good shape but he's still 
passing on knowledge and experiences and wisdom, and that's where I 
get my will to keep pushing on.''

<HEADLINE> Ratings Good in Woods-Duval Showdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tiger Woods-David Duval shootout may have  
lacked drama and even dragged at times, but it scored decent 
ratings for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	After defeating Duval in the first live network golf match  
Monday night, Woods said that the success-- or failure -- would 
depend on how many people tuned into the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a success.  
</P>
<P>
	The prime-time match-play exhibition, shown from 8-11 p.m. EDT,  
posted a 6.9 national rating and a 12 share. That number was higher 
than the final rounds of the British Open (4.8), PGA Championships 
(5.7) and the U.S. Open (6.8), but fell well short of the final 
round of the Masters (10.1). 
</P>
<P>
	However, all of the major golf tournaments are played during  
daytime, when it is more difficult to attract viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many industry experts, including the ABC brass, predicted a  
rating in the 5s for the Woods-Duval showcase. The show peaked from 
10:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a 8.2 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't compare this to anything, since it hasn't been done  
before,'' said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. ``What it means for the 
future, we still don't know. We're very happy with our telecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national rating for the event was comparable to NFL  
preseason games in prime time. For example, the Dallas-Jacksonville 
game on CBS in 1998 had a 6.5 rating while the Cowboys matchup with 
New England earned a 7.9. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods earned $1.1 million for the victory in the match, which  
ended under temporary floodlights set up at Sherwood Country Club. 
Duval was guaranteed a $400,000 losers share. Each donated $200,000 
to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most difficult challenges ABC faced with the match  
was to maintain viewer interest in between the golfers' shots. That 
meant filling a lot of air time with taped interviews and had 
co-host Al Michaels, making his network golf debut, going into 
great detail about things like the Met Life Snoopy II Blimp. 
</P>
<P>
	The casual viewer who knew little about Woods and Duval was able  
to get plenty of information from features and profiles between the 
shots and commercials. The avid golf fan, however, really didn't 
see or hear anything unique. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had wanted to mike Woods and Duval to get viewers closer to  
the personalities of the world's top two players. The PGA Tour 
nixed the idea because it violated tour rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think it would be a problem since players have been  
miked for 18 years in the Skins Game,'' said Barry Frank of IMG, 
which represents both players and organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both players wanted to be miked,'' Frank added. ``It was just  
an exhibition and wasn't for the championship of the world. It 
would have been more entertaining if they had been miked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC did pick up some audio from the golfers throughout the  
evening, but neither player really seemed to do much talking on the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it may have been a mild ratings success, don't  
expect to see live one-on-one golf matches throughout the year. For 
one thing, the PGA Tour won't allow it because it takes some of the 
attention away from its tournaments, such as last weekend's Greater 
Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Woods would almost certainly have to be involved in order  
to captivate a national prime-time audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to overdo it,'' Frank said. ``But we have to see  
what the players want to do. The plan, if we do another, would be 
to do one next summer. It's a good event once a year and let's just 
leave it at that. But we'd have to do it live during the summer on 
the West coast, or Hawaii, because of the time difference.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Judge Can Bar Bigoted Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge's order prohibiting an Avis  
supervisor from using ethnic slurs has been upheld by the 
California Supreme Court, despite a scorching dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A government that tells its citizens what they may say will  
soon be dictating what they may think,'' said Justice Janice Rogers 
Brown, one of the dissenters in Monday's 4-3 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But the majority said free expression isn't violated by an  
injunction against bigoted speech that has already been found, by a 
jury, to be so extreme and pervasive that it causes a hostile and 
discriminatory work environment. 
</P>
<P>
	One justice, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, described employees as a  
``captive audience'' and said speech can be restricted in the 
workplace in ways that wouldn't be allowed elsewhere. She said the 
workers in this case could have escaped the harassment only by 
quitting their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury had already awarded $135,000 to eight employees of Avis  
Rent-a-Car at San Francisco International Airport. They accused 
supervisor John Lawrence of constantly calling them vulgar and 
derogatory names, in Spanish and English, in 1991 and 1992, based 
on their ethnicity and lack of English skills. They said Avis did 
nothing to restrain him. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Carlos Bea ordered Lawrence not to use  
epithets toward Hispanic workers and ordered Avis to stop him if 
possible. His injunction was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's lead opinion, by Chief Justice Ronald George, said  
the jury had already found Lawrence's and Avis' conduct illegal -- 
and the injunction ``simply precluded (them) from continuing their 
unlawful activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avis lawyer Donna Rutter declined comment on the ruling. The  
company could appeal to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has divided free-speech advocates.  
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment is not a license to discriminate,'' said  
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Michelle Alexander. 
``Employees have a right to work in an environment free from 
discrimination, ridicule and insult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bruce Adelstein, who filed arguments on behalf of the  
Libertarian Law Council and other groups, said that while speech 
can cause harm ``it is more dangerous for the government to ban 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Pilots, NTSB Make More Rest Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pilots, airlines and regulators agreed Tuesday  
that rules governing work and rest periods for flight crews have 
not kept pace with the growth of airline travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in testimony before Congress, there was little movement  
toward a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there was a division into two groups: the pilots and  
the National Transportation Safety Board, favoring reduced work 
periods, and the Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines, 
pressing for pilots to make sure they get the proper rest during 
their off-duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board disclosed to the House Transportation  
Committee's aviation panel that the co-pilot in the June 1 crash of 
American Airlines Flight 1420 in Little Rock, Ark. -- an accident in 
which fatigue is suspected of being a factor -- had been awake for 
16 1/2 hours and on duty more than 13 hours the day of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he had flown slightly less than eight hours that  
day and had obtained about 9 1/2 hours of sleep the night before, the 
board said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 90 minutes more sleep than required by law, but the work  
day was nearly at the limit of the 14-hour duty period prescribed 
by the American Airlines pilot contract. Eleven people, including 
the plane's captain, were killed in the crash. Work and rest 
information for the captain is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fatigue has never been cited as the cause of a major airline  
disaster,'' said Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., chairman of the 
aviation subcommittee. ``While the federal government should not 
have to wait for a major incident to review its policies, we must 
not act in a way that would unknowingly erode safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under existing law, pilots cannot fly more than eight hours and  
must receive at least eight hours of rest in a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots want the FAA to create a universal ``duty day'' that  
would limit the amount of time they would have to participate in 
nonflying duties such as layovers or conducting preflight checks. 
They suggest continuing the eight-hour flight period and increasing 
the rest period to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilots are continuously subjected to onerous scheduling ...  
because the FAA regulations on flight and duty time are simply not 
based upon current scientific principles and are not adequate to 
prevent fatigue,'' said Capt. Duane E. Woerth, president of the Air 
Line Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Gilligan of the FAA noted that some pilots commute for  
hours from their homes to the airport where they are based, cutting 
into the rest they could get during their off-duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, pilots have balked at a proposal that would have  
addressed some of their concerns, said Gilligan, the agency's 
deputy associate administrator of regulation and certification. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the FAA proposed increasing the rest period to 10  
hours, increasing the flight time to 10 hours as well, and creating 
a duty day of no longer than 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 24-hour period, that would have given the airlines two more  
hours of flight time and the pilots two more hours of rest time, 
and it would have demanded that all flying be done within a 14-hour 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	``The length of time it is taking to finalize this rulemaking  
evidences the complexity of the issue and the strong concerns of 
the parties involved,'' Gilligan told the subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair Misses Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve  
McNair left Tuesday morning's practice with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated and is not expected to miss any workouts. The  
afternoon session was limited to special teams, so McNair, who has 
started the last 33 regular-season games, was not scheduled to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``His back tightened up a little yesterday and he threw across  
his body today and got spasms,'' coach Jeff Fisher said. ``Knowing 
Steve, with his record with injuries, he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year McNair became just the fourth quarterback in franchise  
history to pass for more than 3,000 yards in a season despite minor 
toe and elbow injuries. He finished passed for 3,228 yards and 15 
touchdowns, all career-highs, with 10 interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Mount Baker Sets Snowfall Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans sweltering in the summer heat may  
want to take a moment to imagine 95 feet of snow in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how much accumulated last winter at Mount Baker, Wash.,  
setting a seasonal snowfall record for the United States and the 
world, the National Climatic Data Center announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Climate Extremes Committee said the 1998-99  
snowfall at Mount Baker totaled 1,140 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	That topped the previous record of 1,122 inches set at Mount  
Rainier, Wash., in the winter of 1971-1972, the data center 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While the extremes committee was concerned only with national  
records for the United States, the data center said this total also 
stands as a world record for a verifiable amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The record snowfall was measured at the Mount Baker Ski Area,  
which made an unofficial claim on the record in May, announcing a 
total of 1,124 inches even though the snow season wasn't over. Now 
the extremes committee has made the record official, at a higher 
total than the ski area originally announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure of 1,140 inches was accepted after study by the  
extremes committee, which included representatives of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the American Association of 
State Climatologists and a regional expert from the Western 
Regional Climate Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowfall can be difficult to measure accurately because it  
settles, melts and drifts from place to place. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said the measurement met snowfall observation  
standards and practices prescribed by the National Weather Service, 
and was thus considered to be an accurate depiction of the amount 
that fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measurement frequency was once a day; a flat surface was  
used to measure daily snowfall amounts; and a snow stake for snow 
depth measurement was also in place,'' said Raymond Downs, an 
observations standards expert on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mount Baker Ski Area is located at an elevation of 4,200  
feet, nine miles northeast of the summit of the Mount Baker 
volcano. The snowfall season is for the period from July 1, 1998, 
through June 30, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snow is common in the Northwest with regular winter storms  
coming ashore loaded with moisture from the Pacific Ocean. When 
that wet air meets the mountains and rises the moisture condenses 
into snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter a moderately strong La Nina in the Pacific Ocean  
increased the stormy pattern, with a much higher frequency of wet 
and cold weather systems affecting especially the area from the 
Cascade Range westward.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Sign Sean O'Brien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers have signed  
defenseman and left wing Sean O'Brien to a one-year contract, the 
team announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, 27, had six goals and 13 assists for 19 points and 215  
penalty minutes in 63 regular-season games last season. He had a 
goal, two assists and 60 penalty minutes in 18 games for the 
Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' American Hockey League 
affiliate, after being acquired on Feb. 10 from the Pittsburgh 
Penguins in exchange for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a guy that we feel is a depth player and a player that  
at times can play for the Flyers, but basically he has been signed 
for the Phantoms,'' Flyers assistant general manager Paul Holmgren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11, 190 pound O'Brien was a member of the Phantoms'  
1998 Calder Cup Championship team before being signed as a free 
agent by Pittsburgh in the summer of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Gold Won't End Botsford's Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Winning an Olympic gold medal often  
means the end of a career for a swimmer. Not for Beth Botsford. At 
least not for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Botsford was the youngest individual swimming champion at the  
1996 Olympic Games, winning the women's 100-meter backstroke when 
she was only 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``While that was a great accomplishment, and I'm proud of it,  
that's not all there is to swimming,'' she said. ``I didn't think 
it was then and I don't think it is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have swimming in college and I would like to drop my  
times down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botsford will swim the 100-meter and 200-meter backstrokes this  
week at the Pan American Games, then get ready for her freshman 
year at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming for a team other than the North Baltimore Aquatic Club  
will be a new experience for Botsford. She has been with that team 
for 8 1/2 years, except for a two-month break in 1998 when she wasn't 
sure she wanted to continue swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to take time off to decide where I was going with my  
swimming,'' Botsford said, ``and how long I wanted to stay in the 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach at the Aquatic Club didn't try to stop her.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was very agreeable and told me to do what was in my best  
interest,'' Botsford said. ``I said I would come back when I missed 
it. I was losing the spark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I wasn't into my  
sport as much as I wanted to be. Taking time off made me realize 
how much I missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botsford's burnout didn't last long, but it cost her valuable  
training time. When she returned last summer, she wasn't sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national championships that determined the makeup of the  
Americans' A, B and C teams, she finished fourth in the 100 
backstroke and fifth in the 200. Instead of qualifying for the A 
team and a trip to the Pan Pacific Games in Sydney later this 
month, she was sent to the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	That has not dampened her enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be here,'' she said. ``I'm so ready to swim.''  
</P>
<P>
	Botsford, a member of several national teams, calls this the  
closest-knit of the squads. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group meshes nicely,'' she said. ``It's very tight.''  
</P>
<P>
	It's also very colorful.  
</P>
<P>
	Botsford and several other women are wearing glistening red,  
white and blue nail polish. Others are sporting little American 
flags on their nails. 
</P>
<P>
	With her experience, Botsford is considered one of the veterans  
of the team, the opposite of her experience at the '96 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Atlanta, I was a little uncomfortable with my age,'' she  
said. ``It was always a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always put in the category of being lucky. I said  
because I was 15, that doesn't set me aside. I've worked just as 
hard as anyone else. I didn't think my age should have been such a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got nervous, I got butterflies, just like everyone, but I  
knew what I was doing. I was there to perform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botsford also performed well in the 400-meter medley relay,  
winning a second gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two golds don't occupy a prominent place in her parents'  
home in Timonium, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in boxes between two bookshelves near the fireplace in  
the family room,'' she said. ``They're not on display. That's not 
my style. I would feel weird putting them on display. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people ask to see them, I'm always willing to show them.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we go away, my parents put them in safe deposit boxes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Since the Atlanta Games, the 5-foot-7, 130-pound Botsford has  
grown about 3 inches and added 12 pounds. She also has matured 
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown up a lot,'' Botsford said. ``I've also changed my  
program. I've paid attention to nutrition, I've done more 
cardiovascular exercising and I'm weight training for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better than I have in a long time.''  
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, Botsford has had only a couple of meets in  
short-course competition. That's why the games will be a big test 
for her. She is trying to downplay the meet, the same attitude she 
employed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason I was successful in Atlanta was because I  
looked at the Olympic Games as just another swim meet,'' she said. 
``If I had thought of it as the Olympics, it would have freaked me 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds more amazing when other people say I'm an Olympic  
gold medalist than when I think about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan now is to get back to another Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Fisher Signs Multiyear Lakers Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Spurning offers for more money  
elsewhere, Los Angeles guard Derek Fisher agreed to re-sign with 
his team Tuesday in a seven-year deal worth about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 24, who became a free agent after three years with the  
Lakers, made the announcement at the University of Arkansas at 
Little Rock, where he played college ball. He was expected to sign 
the contract within the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said he was closer to leaving the Lakers than some  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I'd go somewhere, but the last few days have been  
really tough on me,'' the 6-foot-1, 200-pound guard said. ``I think 
the Lakers just thought I'd go to the highest bidder, which wasn't 
exactly right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's signing puts to rest rumors that had Orlando Magic  
guard Penny Hardaway going to Los Angeles. Because of the supposed 
Lakers' interest, Fisher said it was difficult to plan his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frightening because you don't know where you're going to  
spend the next six or seven year of your life,'' said Fisher, whose 
family accompanied him. ``For a while, I wasn't sure if the Lakers 
wanted me around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other teams had shown interest in Fisher, said his agent,  
Elbert Crawford. Indiana, San Antonio and Toronto showed the most 
interest before Fisher finalized the contract with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were offers out there for more money than I'm getting  
now,'' said Fisher, who was the 24th player picked in the 1996 NBA 
draft. In his final year at UALR, Fisher was the Sun Belt 
Conference Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Fisher averaged 5.9 points a game in 50 games -- 21 of  
which he started. Fisher was second on the team with 3.9 assists 
per game and 1.2 steals per game. During his career, Fisher has 
averaged 5.1 points and 3.1 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability to distribute the basketball ultimately was the  
reason the free agent was able to sign with the Lakers, Fisher 
said. He wondered if Shaquille O'Neal had spoken with Lakers 
executive Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the big fella (O'Neal) stepped up and said the right  
things to people,'' Fisher said. ``I know they want me to keep 
getting him the ball, and I'm sure he wants it.''

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Mitchell Gets Two-Year Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dennis Mitchell, one of the world's best sprinters, received a  
two-year ban Tuesday for a failed drug test but will be eligible to 
run in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field's governing body said his drug test from 16  
months ago showed high levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitration panel ruled that Mitchell, the 100-meter  
bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics and two-time bronze medalist 
at the world championships, had no right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is final and binding,'' Giorgio Reineri, a  
spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation, said 
from the organization's headquarters in Monte Carlo, Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's lawyer maintained on Tuesday the 33-year-old sprinter  
had never taken testosterone or any other banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has always been against the use of drugs in track and  
field,'' lawyer Suja Thomas said from New York. ``This is truly a 
severe disappointment to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Mitchell in Florida was answered by his wife, who said  
he was not home. Mitchell ran Monday in Malmo, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell will be ineligible from April 1, 1998, until March 31,  
2000. Any performances by him during that period are ``null and 
void.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The retroactive ban ends six months before the Sydney Olympics.  
However, Mitchell, the U.S. 100-meter champion, will miss the world 
championships this month in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about Dennis Mitchell and he is an exemplary person,  
and secondarily he is an athlete,'' Thomas said. ``He doesn't want 
this perception and he wants to compete. He should compete because 
he hasn't done anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri of the IAAF said he did not consider the ban a light  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the rule for everybody,'' he said. ``According to our  
constitution, a ban starts the day after the positive doping 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of USA Track and Field cleared Mitchell in  
December. The USATF did not release the details of Mitchell's 
defense or the reasons for exonerating him. 
</P>
<P>
	But London's Daily Telegraph reported this year that Mitchell  
won his case on grounds that his positive result stemmed from 
having sex four times and drinking five bottles of beer the night 
before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitrators met July 24-25. The organization said the  
USATF decision in December was ``erroneous.'' Messages left at USA 
Track and Field in Indianapolis were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas disputed the report that sex and beer contributed to the  
positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more complicated than that,'' she said, adding that  
a combination of stress and nonbanned substances caused him to fail 
the test that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what this case is all about,'' she said. ``It's very  
unfortunate it has come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Mitchell ran the 100 in 10.09 seconds in Malmo. He  
led fellow American Maurice Greene for the first 50 meters before 
finishing second to the world record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	His best time this season is 10.02 with three other Americans  
having run faster. He has also run a wind-assisted time of 9.97 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	When he tested positive, Mitchell was the head of the USA Track  
and Field's Athlete Advisory Committee. He no longer holds that 
position.

<HEADLINE> Musgrove Wins Gubernatorial Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove won Mississippi's  
Democratic gubernatorial primary Tuesday, and former Rep. Mike 
Parker beat five other Republicans for the nomination to succeed 
the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Kirk Fordice, who is barred from seeking a third term,  
stole the show in the final weeks of the campaign when he was 
caught returning from a vacation in France with his junior high 
school sweetheart. Fordice says he will divorce his wife of 44 
years and marry the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all the primary candidates made a point of boasting  
about their strong marriages, their happy children and their 
small-town values. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove, 43, beat a GOP incumbent four years ago and  
immediately locked his sights on the governor's mansion. He won the 
nomination outright Tuesday by getting more than half the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	With 82 percent of precincts reporting, Musgrove had 254,151  
votes, or 57 percent, while former state Supreme Court Justice 
Jimmy Roberts had 113,906 votes, or 26 percent. Six lesser-known 
candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the GOP race, Parker, 49, narrowly avoided a runoff with  
former Lt. Gov. Eddie Briggs, who lost to Musgrove in 1995. 
Parker's campaign had concentrated on school safety, while Briggs 
had emphasized his plan to eliminate the sales tax on groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	With 84 percent of precincts reporting, Parker had 70,302 votes,  
or 51 percent, and Briggs had 38,483 votes, or 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other candidates were Dan Gibson, who quit his job as  
mayor of Crystal Springs and sold his antebellum home and two cars 
to raise money for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, state Rep. Charlie Williams, had just one TV  
ad, about his days as a record-setting base stealer on the 
University of Mississippi baseball team. He was the only candidate 
Fordice praised during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove was criticized in ads for running up $200,000 in  
expenses in private state airplanes for trips over the past four 
years. He generally ignored the attacks and stuck to scripted 
speeches about his integrity and ``straight talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Democrats on the ballot included a white supremacist  
and a woman whose campaign was marred by her prosecution for a 
fourth drunken-driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two terms as governor, Fordice concentrated on luring  
businesses to Mississippi and revamping welfare.

<HEADLINE> Larceny Up at Busiest Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- High-tech security abounds at airports,  
but nothing can separate a passenger from his property quicker than 
a short attention span. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people that are victims -- God love 'em -- weren't paying  
attention. They left their suitcases behind while going to the 
bathroom or they asked someone else to watch their baggage, or they 
left jewelry behind while they were washing their hands,'' said 
Avry Dodson, who as director of the Department of Public Safety 
oversees Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are leaving valuables in plain view,'' said Benjamin  
DeCosta, general manager of Hartsfield Atlanta International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Most airport security is focused on major breaches, such as  
terrorism. The amount of crime at the nation's airports is not 
monitored by any federal agencies unless it has a special relation 
to aviation safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Security is through the Federal Aviation Administration, but  
that's oriented only to terrorism and contraband goods that 
threaten flights,'' said Bill Mosley, a spokesman with the 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines do report mishandled baggage, which could be  
stolen, but otherwise ``street'' crime is considered a local issue 
and not monitored on a national level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, law enforcement concentrates on the trends it finds in  
its own backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hartsfield, the world's busiest airport with about 73.5  
million passengers annually, larceny is the crime of the year. 
According to police statistics compiled by The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution, theft has climbed 26 percent for the first 
four months this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Car thefts also have gone up, doubling from 107 in 1997 to 215  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A 9 percent increase in passenger volume could be partly to  
blame for the rising thefts, but DeCosta said he's investigating 
whether a theft ring is canvassing the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	At D-FW, missing vehicles are the bigger problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the last year we had 180 vehicles stolen from rental  
agencies,'' said Dodson. ``These are not random thefts. Most of 
these are employee related. We recover over 80 percent of the 
rental cars that are stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airline employees also have sometimes been the issue when theft  
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	This April at D-FW, 10 baggage handlers were arrested for  
stealing property from about 500 bags bound for flights on American 
Trans Air, British Airways, Korean Airlines and Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a group of baggage handlers at American Airlines in  
Miami were arrested after a 19-member special security team did a 
sting operation. The 44 baggage handlers were accused of pilfering 
thousands of pieces of jewelry, electronic equipment, cameras and 
cash from inside suitcases as planes arrived and departed. 
</P>
<P>
	But those aren't the majority of theft cases; much of the  
stealing is done right in front of the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year at D-FW a man was charged with habitually  
stealing those black-wheeled bags that look similar to dozens of 
others on the baggage carousel. 
</P>
<P>
	His modus operandi was to steal the common-looking bags and  
plead ignorance if stopped by the rightful owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy had been making a living out here,'' said Dodson.  
``He'd been stopped by people but always bluffed his way through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, he pirated about $1 million of loot to sell at flea  
markets and a couple of warehouses full of stuff before he was 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports in New York have a much bigger problem with pickpockets  
than many other cities and police have conducted several sting 
operations to catch regular thieves, according to Bill Cahill, 
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, which handled  
72.5 million passengers last year, seems to have the most trouble 
in its bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Thefts in airport restrooms have risen 99 percent at O'Hare as  
most property crimes decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that is rare at airports is violent crime.  
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually never,'' said Cahill.  
</P>
<P>
	And even though everyone hears about luggage being stolen, it's  
actually statistically unlikely that a passenger will become a 
crime victim at any U.S. airport, considering the number of 
passengers and the number of nonpassengers traveling through the 
airports on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theft is infinitesimal. Obviously if it's your bag it's more  
important,'' said Dodson. '' But in essence what this boils down to 
is airports are pretty dad-gum safe places to be.''

<HEADLINE> Government Regains Control in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KATIMA MULILO, Namibia (AP) -- Government forces rounded up  
rebels and their sympathizers in a town in the remote Caprivi Strip 
today after fending off an attack by separatists that claimed at 
least 15 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavily armed troops patrolled the streets of Katima Mulilo,  
while others fanned out along the perimeter of the town. 
Paramilitary police arrested 23 rebels or their sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty to 100 rebels tried to seize the town Monday, gaining  
control of the radio station and trying to commandeer a police 
station. After 12 hours of fighting, government troops, backed by 
reinforcements flown in from the capital, regained control. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead included three policemen, three soldiers and eight  
rebels, said Chief Inspector Hieronymus Goraseb, a police 
spokesman. Another person died at a hospital, but police did not 
know the identity of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Goraseb refused to confirm or deny reports that a rebel force of  
500 men was advancing on the town from outlying areas. Some army 
and police headed out of town Tuesday, possibly in pursuit of the 
rebels in the surrounding subtropical bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Some shooting continued in the town into Tuesday morning. In the  
afternoon, government forces opened fire briefly, apparently to 
flush out suspects believed hiding in a bakery. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there may be more dead outside town, but could not  
confirm the number. Goraseb said 16 rebels had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurgents were believed to be part of a movement linked to  
former opposition leader Mishake Muyongo, who demands autonomy for 
Caprivi from Namibia. Caprivians charge the government has 
neglected their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	American Peace Corps workers and other Americans were being  
evacuated from the area. The 15 Peace Corps workers include five in 
the town of Katima Mulilo, said Ruby Apsler, spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Embassy in the capital of Windhoek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have been difficult with regards to getting out,'' said  
Bruce Parcher, 31, a Peace Corps worker from Auburn, Wash. ``The 
advice we get from police is that we are traveling at our own risk 
and they can't guarantee anything. They would prefer we stay 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, the government has cracked down on the  
separatist movement in Caprivi, and more than 2,500 people have 
fled into Botswana. About 1,500 returned home recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Monday declared a state of  
emergency for the Caprivi region -- a long strip of Namibia that 
pokes east below Angola and Zambia and above Botswana in the remote 
center of southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	At the local hospital, doctors worked through the night to treat  
25 people admitted with gunshot wounds, said Alex Manning, a 
volunteer physician with a Belgian organization. At least seven of 
the wounded were civilians, he said.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Charges Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Christian Coalition is moving ahead with  
plans to distribute 75 million voter guides in the next election 
following a federal court ruling that the activity did not 
illegally help Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The beleaguered group -- trying to rebound from a restructuring,  
staff defections and an IRS decision denying it tax-exempt status -- 
plans to use churches and the Internet to distribute its scorecards 
for the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition hopes to raise $21 million to fund its  
2000 political activities, seeking 50,000 donors to give $20 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are so high,'' said Randy Tate, the coalition's  
senior vice president for government relations. ``Not since 1980 
has there been a chance to shift the national debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts received a boost from Monday's decision by U.S.  
District Judge Joyce Green, who rejected assertions in a 1996 
Federal Election Commission lawsuit that the coalition's voter 
guides and get-out-the-vote operations were partisan activities 
designed to aid Republican candidates and should be treated as 
contributions under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	She ruled in favor of the FEC on just two points -- that the  
coalition in 1994 improperly assisted then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, 
R-Ga., and Iran-Contra figure Oliver North, then the GOP Senate 
nominee in Virginia, and should pay a fine. The amount will be 
determined later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition had vigorously fought the lawsuit,  
defending the voter guides it has distributed for years to churches 
on the Sunday before election days. 
</P>
<P>
	The group argued the guides were covered by free speech and did  
not specifically advocate a candidate's election or defeat, and 
thus should not be regulated as federal campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are nonpartisan and there's no coordination,'' Christian  
Coalition President Pat Robertson said. ``Just because you tell a 
candidate you're going to distribute voter guides does not 
constitute coordination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson called Green's ruling ``a major victory for free  
speech in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the coalition said the court decision was  
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition have slipped through  
a legal loophole,'' said Barry Lynn, executive director of 
Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ``The decision 
still provides plenty of evidence that the Christian Coalition is a 
hardball partisan political operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the FEC, a six-member commission that enforces  
federal campaign laws, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Credited with helping the Republican Party win control of  
Congress in 1994, the Christian Coalition had run into rough times 
recently. The Internal Revenue Service ruled the group was not 
entitled to tax-exempt status, forcing the group to split into two 
entities. The decision, made last year but kept under wraps pending 
an appeal, was made public in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the reorganization plan, the Christian Coalition of Texas,  
a tax-exempt group, was renamed Christian Coalition of America and 
will publish the voter guides. A second group, Christian Coalition 
International, could engage in partisan activity, but no decision 
has been made on whether to do so, Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson founded the coalition in the 1980s and built it into a  
significant voice within the GOP before turning over control of the 
organization a few years ago. He recently returned as the group's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition hired eight new people to replace staffers who  
left, and Robertson wrote a $1 million check to the group in 
December 1997 to help reduce a $3 million debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a speed bump on road to maximizing our impact in 2000,''  
Tate said.

<HEADLINE> Gandhi Reflects on Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- In a speech meant to offer her vision of  
India in the new millennium, Sonia Gandhi recalled her party's 
glorious past today but gave few clues about how she would rule if 
elected prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi is being projected as the Congress  
party's candidate for prime minister in September-October 
elections. She took an active role in politics only last year, and 
has given only general policy statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the banner of ``India in the Third Millennium,'' she spoke  
to party members and the media, reiterating the Congress party's 
support for religious minorities and India's lower castes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party is committed to upholding the constitutional  
provisions safeguarding the rights of the minorities,'' Mrs. Gandhi 
said. She also said Congress would work to alleviate poverty in 
India's 700,000 villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi lifted campaign slogans from her late mother-in-law,  
Indira Gandhi, who was prime minister for 16 years and was popular 
for championing the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  
and heir to the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, which ruled India 
for 37 of the 52 years since independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress party cites the ``sacrifices'' made by the Gandhi  
family -- Mrs. Gandhi's husband was assassinated in 1991 while 
campaigning for office, and his mother was gunned down by her own 
bodyguards in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Sonia Gandhi's political inexperience and foreign  
birth make her unacceptable as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, she ineptly engineered the collapse of Prime  
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government without ensuring that 
she could cobble together an alternative coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress looked like a resurgent party with a good  
chance to win the elections, the news magazine Outlook said in this 
week's edition. But support seems to have dissipated, partly 
because of Mrs. Gandhi's mistakes. The weekly featured an 
unflattering caricature of her on the cover captioned, ``Ms. 
Clueless.''

<HEADLINE>  Orioles' Ripken Placed Back on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cal Ripken was placed on the disabled  
list Tuesday with a sore back, the second time this season the 
Baltimore Orioles' third baseman has been disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who had never been on the disabled list before this  
year, received a cortisone shot to relieve irritation in his lower 
back Tuesday. He went on the DL from April 18-May 13 with nerve 
irritation in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a recurrence of the previous injury,'' Orioles manager  
Ray Miller said before Baltimore's game Tuesday night against the 
Oakland Athletics. ``They say the best-case scenario is he'll be 
ready in 10 days. We were so thin already we had to put him on the 
DL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who played in 2,632 consecutive games until stopping the  
streak last year, is hitting .335 with 15 home runs and 47 RBIs. He 
is one homer away from 400 and 32 hits shy of 3,000 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned to Baltimore on Monday for an examination and  
was put on the disabled list retroactive to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fine, then he went to breakfast Sunday morning and said  
he just started getting spasms in his back,'' Miller said. ``It got 
worse all day and the next day. He said he wanted to see the 
doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles recalled third baseman Ryan Minor from Triple-A  
Rochester to take Ripken's place. Minor was batting .256 with 21 
homers and 67 RBI in 101 games with Rochester. He was 1-for-10 in 
four games with Baltimore in July.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Chief Backs F-22 Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A delay in construction of the Air Force's  
new-generation F-22 stealth fighter, which many in Congress seek, 
could kill the $65 billion project and upset aircraft modernization 
plans of the Navy and Marine Corps, the Air Force's top officer 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Michael Ryan said he is confident that with ``better  
education'' on the F-22 and its role in a 21st-century Air Force, 
Congress can be convinced of the need to start production next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are knowledgeable about what we believe will be the  
threats in 15 years or so are convinced that this airplane is what 
the (U.S. military) needs,'' Ryan told reporters over breakfast. He 
said the service chiefs and U.S. commanders around the world 
support the Air Force plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan and F. Whitten Peters, the Air Force secretary, met Monday  
night with Rep. Jerry Lewis, a chief force behind the House vote 
last month to delete $1.8 billion from the 2000 budget that was 
earmarked to begin production of the F-22. Ryan would not discuss 
the conversation except to say he remains confident the full 
Congress will side with the Air Force and save the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident the airplane is not going to be canceled,'' Ryan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' spokesman, Jim Specht, said the California Republican  
would not disclose details of the conversation but added, ``His 
mind is still made up that this is the way to go,'' to delay the 
start of production. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate appropriators will meet in September to make a  
final decision on the F-22 money. The plane has more support in the 
Senate, where the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, Sen. John 
Warner, R-Va., has said he expects a compromise to restore enough 
money to save the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and others argue that although the F-22 as designed would  
give the United States the most capable fighter aircraft in the 
world for years to come, it is too expensive given other national 
priorities. They note that the fighter it would replace, the F-15E, 
already is the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force so far has spent close to $25 billion on research,  
development and testing of the F-22; it expects to spend another 
$40 billion to manufacture 339 of them. The prime contractor is 
Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview Tuesday, Ryan said delaying production of the  
F-22 by even one year would be tantamount to canceling the program. 
That, he said, would weaken U.S. security in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take a pause ..., the airplane will then probably be  
killed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Mercer to Denver, Fortson to Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Celtics and Denver Nuggets completed a major  
six-player deal that sends guard Ron Mercer from Boston to Denver 
for power forward Danny Fortson. 
</P>
<P>
	Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius go with Mercer to Denver for  
Fortson, Eric Washington, and Eric Williams, who began his career 
in Boston. The Celtics will also receive a first-round draft choice 
in one of the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mercer and Fortson were up for contract extensions this  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer, who played for Celtics coach Rick Pitino at Kentucky,  
averaged 17 points per game last year and is considered an emerging 
star. The Celtics began exploring the trade market last month after 
Mercer said there was a ``huge difference'' between the Celtics 
initial offer and what he was asking on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino said the addition of the 6-foot-6, 260-pound Fortson  
changes the Celtics from an offensive, finesse-oriented team, to a 
``tough-minded'' club, and solidifies the Celtics low post game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to shore up our front court,'' he said. ``We've done  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino said the team would not have moved Mercer if not for his  
contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' Pitino said. ``I could  
not even come close to the numbers Ron Mercer wanted as a 
basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson was fourth in the league in rebounding with a 11.6 per  
game average last year, his third in the league. Fortson also 
averaged 11 points per game. Fortson came to Denver by a trade 
after being picked by Milwaukee in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal brings Williams back to the city where he played the  
first two years of his career. Williams, a fourth year player, 
averaged 15 points per game for the Celtics in 1996-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams left the Celtics under a cloud, with Pitino questioning  
his work ethic. But today Pitino said he was convinced Williams had 
changed his ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made a 360-degree turn about in all departments,'' he  
said. ``Now we're getting back a ballplayer that has matured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is entering the third year of a four-year, $30 million  
contract. Denver agreed to pay $3 million of Williams contract, the 
maximum percentage allowed by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics also announced the signing of free agent guard Wayne  
Turner today. Pitino said he envisions Turner, a Boston native who 
played for Kentucky, as a third guard on the Celtics.

<HEADLINE> Green Bay Re-Signs Hollinquest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Lamont Hollinquest was back with the  
Green Bay Packers on Tuesday, though he wasn't quite sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest, a special-teams standout and backup linebacker the  
last three seasons with the Packers, wanted a chance to be a 
defensive starter. He thought he'd get it when he signed a 
two-year, $1.6 million contract with the Kansas City Chiefs on 
March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	He participated in Kansas City's minicamps during the summer and  
was looking forward to training camp. But on July 21, the Chiefs 
abruptly waived him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest was informed of the decision by a letter in the  
mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never told me specifically (why),'' he said. ``There were  
some things they were going through. I'm not mad at them. They did 
what they thought was best for their team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefs director of pro personnel John Schneider did not return a  
phone call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the openings of most NFL training camps only days away,  
Hollinquest was out of work. His agent, Gary Uberstine, contacted 
the Packers, who said they didn't have the salary cap room. 
</P>
<P>
	But that changed when wide receiver Robert Brooks announced his  
retirement on Monday. The Packers were then able pick up 
Hollinquest, in part with the $700,000 of extra salary cap room 
Brooks' departure created. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest is the second former Chiefs linebacker signed by the  
Packers within a week. Green Bay picked up Anthony Davis on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers will take all the depth they can get at the  
position. Jude Waddy, expected to be a key performer for the team, 
will miss the first two games of the regular season while 
completing a suspension for steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay likes Hollinquest's ability to play all three  
linebacker positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some quality players at linebacker, but it's always  
good to have extra people for matchups and injuries,'' defensive 
coordinator Emmitt Thomas said. ``The more looks you can put out on 
the field, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest played three seasons with Green Bay and also has  
played for Washington and Cincinnati. He worked with Thomas when 
both were with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinquest started two games at right outside linebacker for  
the Packers last season while George Koonce was sidelined with a 
hamstring injury. He made 13 tackles at linebacker last season and 
a team-best eight on special teams. 
</P>

opportunity was elsewhere, but it didn't turn out that way.''

<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., (AP) -- Jamie Feick signed a six-year  
contract with the New Jersey Nets on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also waived on veteran center Rony Seikaly.  
</P>
<P>
	Feick, a free agent who led the Nets in rebounding, will earn  
about $15 million under terms of the agreement the team announced 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seikaly, 34, missed almost all of this past lockout-shortened  
season with a sprained ankle and then a foot injury. He scored 13 
points in 88 minutes, finishing the season nine shy of 10,000 
career points. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career Seikaly has averaged 14.7 points and 9.5

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Denies Yahoo! Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An ExciteAtHome Corp. executive denied a report  
that the company is in merger talks with Yahoo!, though he 
acknowledged the two Internet companies have talked about a 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, the second-largest Web search and directory destination,  
has held discussions over the last six weeks to acquire 
ExciteAtHome, the No. 6 destination, for more than $17 billion, 
according to an article published Monday on BusinessWeek Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, which cited an anonymous source, said Yahoo! might  
consider buying ExciteAtHome and spinning off the AtHome high-speed 
Internet access business, known as broadband. 
</P>
<P>
	But ExciteAtHome president George Bell, speaking at a technology  
conference Tuesday, told reporters, ``There is no truth to the 
rumors about acquisition discussions,'' adding, ``We've had talks 
with Yahoo and AOL about getting on the start page of a very 
powerful broadband opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Yahoo! spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market  
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome is discussing a partnership that would make Yahoo!,  
America Online Inc., or perhaps another Internet service company 
the initial page ExciteAt Home's customers would see when they go 
onto the Internet, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome was created earlier this year by the merger of  
Excite, an Internet search and directory service, and AtHome, which 
operates a network of fiber-optic cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal with Yahoo!, however, would likely hurt the Excite  
business since Excite and Yahoo! are direct competitors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trumpets Welfare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Calling welfare recipients ``people who are good  
for the bottom line,'' President Clinton today urged business 
leaders to hire more of them. The nation now has the smallest 
percentage of people on public assistance rolls since 1967, he 
said, crediting welfare reform for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The president came here to participate in a Welfare to Work  
partnership conference, which offers training for businesses 
interested in hiring welfare recipients. He trumpeted a year's 
worth of statistics showing that people are moving into the 
workplace as expected under the 1996 welfare law, and urged 
Republican leaders in Congress to resist using $4.2 billion in 
unspent federal welfare funds for other purposes, saying the money 
could go toward reducing welfare rolls even further. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every state, there are still people who could move from  
welfare to work if they had more training, if they had 
transportation, if they had child care,'' Clinton said. ``In every 
state, there are people who may be working today who might have to 
leave the work force for lack of transportation or child care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say let's spend this money to develop the human capacity of  
our people,'' Clinton said. ``It will make the economy stronger and 
we'll all be better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the welfare law say Clinton should not declare the  
1996 overhaul a success while ignoring studies that show many 
Americans who leave welfare aren't earning enough to escape 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data that is conveniently left out by the White House and  
by too many people in the Congress is this: What are the wage 
levels, what are people making?'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
He said he is always disturbed by Clinton's declarations that 
welfare reform has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton encouraged the business leaders in Chicago to invest in  
the workers they bring in off of welfare, for those workers may 
prove to be among the most devoted employees they have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare recipients can be a rich pool of untapped talent,  
people who are good for the bottom line,'' Clinton said. ``I ask 
you to stay at this. Ask others to join this crusade. Stay at the 
job until we can say we have completely ended welfare as we know 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said all states, plus the District of Columbia, had met the  
requirements for moving people from welfare into jobs. ``Every 
single state is in compliance,'' Clinton said. ``The welfare rolls 
have been cut in half. ... The credit goes to all of you in the 
audience, and people like you all across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Askew, a former welfare recipient who now works in the  
White House's mail room, said she is proud to be off welfare, 
despite any hardships that may come as a result of leaving welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a wonderful heaven has been opened, and blessings  
flowed out,'' she said Monday at a welfare-to-work event with Vice 
President Al Gore. ``For me, it's something I always wanted -- a 
stable job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore released new figures Monday showing the federal government  
had hired 14,028 people off welfare, surpassing the original goal, 
set in March 1997, of 10,000 by 2000. Most of them are working at 
the Commerce and Defense departments. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last September, nearly 70 percent of them were still on  
the job after a year -- compared with 37 percent of other, similar 
federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	New figures provided to AP on Monday show that welfare rolls had  
dropped 49 percent from their all-time high in 1994. Rolls have 
fallen by more than half in 29 states. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March, just 2.7 percent of the population -- or 7.3 million  
Americans -- was on welfare, the least since Lyndon B. Johnson was 
president. In 1967, the figure was 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new figures also show the dramatic declines are  
beginning to slow in some states. After large drops, welfare 
caseloads remained relatively stable in Kansas, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia. 
And they increased in New Mexico and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures offer further evidence that the toughest work in  
welfare reform may be ahead, as states deal with people who face 
complex problems -- poor education, domestic violence and drug and 
alcohol addiction.

<HEADLINE> How To Avoid Travel Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips from the Federal Trade Commission on ways to protect  
against fraudulent travel schemes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Be wary of ``great deals'' and low-priced offers. Few  
legitimate businesses can afford to give away products and services 
of real value or substantially undercut other companies' prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't be pressured into buying. A good offer today usually will  
be a good offer tomorrow. Legitimate businesses don't expect you to 
make snap decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask detailed questions. Find out exactly what the price covers  
and what it doesn't. Ask about additional charges. Get the names of 
the hotel, airports, airlines and restaurants included in your 
package. Consider contacting these businesses directly to verify 
arrangements. Ask about cancellation policies and refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you decide to buy, find out the name of the travel provider  
-- the company that is getting your reservations and tickets. This 
company usually is not the telemarketer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get all information in writing before you agree to buy. Once  
you receive the written information, make sure it reflects what you 
were told over the phone and the terms you agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't buy part of the package, the air fare or hotel stay,  
separately from the rest. If the deal is not what you expected, it 
may be difficult to get your money back for the part of the package 
you purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't give your credit card number or bank information over the  
phone unless you know the company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't send money by messenger or overnight mail. Some scam  
artists may ask you to send them a check or money order 
immediately. If you charged your trip to a credit card, you may 
dispute the charges by writing to your credit card issuer at the 
address provided for billing disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check out the company before you buy.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner: No Big Ten Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Big Ten does not plan to add a 12th member  
any time soon, commissioner Jim Delany said, declaring expansion 
``a dead issue'' just months after Notre Dame spurned the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had any activity at all since the Notre Dame  
decision, no calls from presidents or athletic directors,'' Delany 
said at the annual Big Ten meeting. ``I don't expect expansion in 
the next decade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, after Notre Dame turned down the Big Ten following  
months of talks, Delany had said the conference might consider 
searching for another school. Syracuse and Missouri were mentioned 
as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it appears the search is over.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry to hear him say that. I think he's wrong,'' said Joe  
Paterno, coach at Penn State, which joined the Big Ten in 1990, the 
conference's last expansion year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some schools out there that could probably bring as  
much to the table or more than Notre Dame,'' he said, declining to 
offer suggestions. ``You think about some of the institutions 
around, the all-sports programs, the type of research institutions 
they are, the media markets they're in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State's addition was the conference's first since 1949.  
With it, the Big Ten became 11, and that created scheduling 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12th team would ease those difficulties and allow the  
conference to hold a lucrative championship, just as the SEC and 
the Big 12 have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the coaches that I've visited with think we should add  
another team and have divisional play,'' said Ohio State coach John 
Cooper. He'd rather be playing, not watching, those late-season 
games that determine many bowl bids. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's not consensus on the idea. Michigan coach Lloyd  
Carr, for one, said he's happier with 11 teams, scheduling 
controversies and all. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, it adds a game,'' he said. ``We're already going  
to 12 games, that would be 13 and the bowl game would be 14. We 
need to make decisions based on what is best for the student 
athlete, not what's best for the budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all-or-nothing with Notre Dame, Delany said. The  
league just has not found another good ``fit'' and scheduling ``is 
not a reason to add a 12th member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paterno argued that there are plenty of other reasons to  
continue searching for another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to expand, you want to expand your influence,  
you want to expand your recruiting range, you want to expand your 
attractiveness to television networks,'' he said. ``There are a 
couple of schools out there who might do that -- more than a 
couple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame appeared poised to join this winter; its other  
athletic teams are already part of the Big East. But the school 
decided to remain independent in football, fearing it would lose 
its ``institutional identity'' as the nation's top Catholic 
university if it joined the conference.

<HEADLINE> Mozart Won't Make Kids Smarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The notion that listening to Mozart leads to  
brainy toddlers is likely a myth, two researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how science spreads through our culture,'' said Kenneth  
Steele, a psychology professor at Appalachian State University in 
Boone, N.C. ``There is one kind of study and everyone assumes that 
it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Mozart Effect'' holds that listening to the  
classical music of 18th century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
spurs brain development in children under age 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The original notion came from two studies conducted at the  
University of California-Irvine in 1993 and 1995. The studies, 
conducted on college students, found an increase in 
spatial-reasoning immediately after exposure to a Mozart piano 
sonata. 
</P>
<P>
	The belief that Mozart helps one get smarter has spread  
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, former Gov. Zell Miller started a program to provide  
every young mother with a CD of the composer's music. And the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Foundation handed 
out free CDs of Grammy-winning classical music at hundreds of 
hospitals in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steele and John Bruer, who heads the McDonnell Foundation in  
St. Louis, say there's no real benefit, and that one would see the 
same results listening to any kind of music or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have tried to produce the effect all kinds of ways,''  
Steele said. ``Not only haven't we found that it is a weak effect 
and we can't make it stronger, we can't find any kind of effect at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said follow-up studies have been unable to duplicate the  
original research. Steele conducted a study that went so far as to 
follow the same procedures used to produce the effect in the 
original study. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went back to that and still didn't get the effect,  
that cast grave doubts on the original effect and what the effect 
means,'' Steele said. ``It can't be investigated. It can't be 
researched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's research is published in the July issue of the journal  
Psychological Science; Bruer's book, ``The Myth of the First Three 
Years,'' will be published next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In his study at Appalachian State, Steele's subjects showed an  
increase in reasoning when listening to contemporary composer 
Philip Glass, or not listing to anything at all. The differences 
between silence, Mozart and Glass's music were so small, Steele 
said, they lacked any statistical significance. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all scientists feel there is no value in ``extra''  
stimulation for young children. 
</P>
<P>
	John Flohr, a professor of music education at Texas' Woman's  
University in Denton, Texas, was a consultant on the project to 
hand out Grammy-winning music to new parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stimulus in the environment has a significant effect in early  
childhood,'' Flohr said. ``We don't know what will do what yet. But 
music could be a part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Child-Abuse Deaths Underreported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of young children killed by their  
parents or caregivers is underreported by nearly 60 percent, 
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on an analysis of North Carolina records,  
but researchers said the results reflect the situation nationwide 
because all states use the same system to classify deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Caregivers commit 85 percent of the homicides of children 10 and  
under, and strangers are the killers only 3 percent of the time, 
said Dr. Marcia Herman-Giddens, lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, we as a society have not cared enough to do what we  
need to do to get accurate data on child abuse homicides,'' she 
said. ``If you don't have good data about the problem, good 
numbers, you can't possibly begin to do anything about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman-Giddens, who teaches maternal and child health at the  
University of North Carolina, said the problem is that all states 
use the International Classification of Diseases to record deaths, 
and the system's specifications are flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, three children who are stabbed to death would not  
be listed as abuse victims because the classification system says 
abuse deaths result from a string of events, not an isolated 
episode, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her study counted child abuse deaths if they resulted from a  
single episode such as a shooting or from a string of events, and 
came at the hands of caregivers -- including babysitters and 
boyfriends of mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	With that system in mind, the researchers analyzed records from  
medical examiners, police and other sources on the 259 homicides of 
children 10 and younger in North Carolina from 1985 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, the state's system underreported the number of deaths  
from battering or abuse by 58.7 percent, the researchers said. 
Biological parents committed 64 percent of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Translated to a national scale, the study suggests that 6,500  
more children than national statistics reflect were victims of 
homicide due to abuse from 1985 through 1996. The researchers 
estimated that in 1996, 835 children died at the hands of 
caregivers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Johnson, president of Prevent Child Abuse America, which  
was not involved in the study, said it gives credibility to what 
some experts have been saying for years -- that twice as many 
children are abused as reports indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman-Giddens said death certificates need to be redesigned to  
accommodate information related to abuse, and medical examiners and 
coroners need better training to recognize such deaths.

<HEADLINE> New York Opera Adds Sound System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York City Opera will become the first  
major American company to employ an electronic sound system like 
those used in cinemas and Broadway theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will be installed in the New York State Theater, home  
of the City Opera and the New York City Ballet, on an experimental 
basis in time for the Sept. 11 opening of the City Opera's fall 
season with Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' the companies' 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Opera companies occasionally use sound systems to amplify spoken  
dialogue, such as in Mozart's ``Magic Flute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 35-year-old State Theater, designed for dance, has poor  
acoustics for music, especially the singing voice. The sound system 
will feature stationary microphones and more than 100 inconspicuous 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view it as electronic architecture,'' said Martin  
Oppenheimer, head of the board that oversees the City Opera and the 
City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound system will enhance the acoustics of the auditorium  
but will not amplify voices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Sills, once a leading soprano and now chairman of  
Lincoln Center, endorsed the system but said she hoped it would be 
temporary.

<HEADLINE> FBI Says It Can't Pursue Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though a victim of the 1972 terrorist  
assault on the Munich Olympics held American citizenship, the FBI 
can pursue the attack's confessed planner only if Germany asks for 
help, the Justice Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, the FBI could open its own investigation into  
the slaying of an American abroad. But 1972 statutes allowed no 
such pursuit outside U.S. territory, and the Constitution allow no 
retroactive laws, Jon P. Jennings, acting assistant attorney 
general, said in a letter to Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead American was David Berger of Shaker Heights, Ohio, who  
also held Israeli citizenship. He was among nine Israelis who died 
in a bungled rescue attempt after the Palestinian terrorists killed 
two others in the Olympic village. A German policeman and five 
terrorists also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Munich planners, Mohammed Oudeh, who used the nom de  
guerre Abu Daoud, chronicled in a new autobiography his central 
role in planning the attack, which aimed to take Israeli 
weightlifters hostage to dramatize the Palestinians' homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourette has tried to round up congressional support to press  
for aggressive international pursuit of Abu Daoud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we understand your frustration and the feelings of  
your constituents who were directly affected by the Munich tragedy, 
we are without legal authority to investigate or prosecute this 
particular international terrorist attack,'' Jennings' letter said. 
``We stand willing to help the German authorities in any way we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since publication of Oudeh's book, Germany has issued an arrest  
warrant, which Palestinian officials are trying to have rescinded; 
Israel has banned Oudeh from returning to his West Bank home; and 
France has turned Oudeh away from its border.

<HEADLINE> Pilots, NTSB Make More Rest Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pilots, airlines and even the government  
expressed exasperation today that there has been no significant 
change in rules governing work and rest periods for flight crews 
despite the rapid growth of airline travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in testimony before Congress, there was little movement  
toward a solution and a basic division into two groups: the pilots 
and the National Transportation Safety Board, which want reduced 
work periods, and the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
airlines, which want pilots to get quality rest during their 
off-duty time. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty in reaching consensus was evident at a hearing  
before the House Transportation aviation subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board disclosed that the co-pilot involved in the  
June 1 crash of American Airlines Flight 1420 in Little Rock, Ark., 
had been awake for 16 1/2 hours and on duty more than 13 hours the day 
of the crash, but had flown slightly less than eight hours that day 
and had obtained about 9 1/2 hours of sleep the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 90 minutes more sleep than required by law, but the work  
day was nearly at the limit of the 14-hour duty period prescribed 
by the American Airlines pilot contract. Eleven people, including 
the plane's captain, were killed in the crash. Work and rest 
information for the captain is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fatigue has never been cited as the cause of a major airline  
disaster,'' said Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., chairman of the 
aviation subcommittee. ``While the federal government should not 
have to wait for a major incident to review its policies, we must 
not act in a way that would unknowingly erode safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under existing law, the FAA says pilots cannot fly more than  
eight hours and must receive at least eight hours of rest in a 
24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots want the FAA to create a universal ``duty day,'' which  
would limit the amount of time they would have to participate in 
nonflying duties such as layovers or conducting preflight checks. 
They suggest continuing the eight-hour flight period and increasing 
the rest period to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pilots are continuously subjected to onerous scheduling ...  
because the FAA regulations on flight and duty time are simply not 
based upon current scientific principles and are not adequate to 
prevent fatigue,'' said Capt. Duane E. Woerth, president of the Air 
Line Pilots Association. ``These rules were implemented when the 
DC-3 airplane was state of the art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Gilligan, deputy associate administrator of regulation  
and certification for the FAA, said pilots have balked at a 
proposal that would address some of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the agency proposed increasing the rest period to 10  
hours, increasing the flight time to 10 hours as well, and creating 
a duty day of no longer than 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 24-hour period, that would have given the airlines two more  
hours of flight time and the pilots two more hours of rest time, 
and it would have demanded that all flying be done within a 14-hour 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	``The length of time it is taking to finalize this rulemaking  
evidences the complexity of the issue and the strong concerns of 
the parties involved,'' Gilligan told the subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Tests Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experimental Army rocket sped into the  
skies over New Mexico, pinpointed an ``enemy'' missile and smashed 
it to bits Monday more than 50 miles above the Earth, the Pentagon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful test of the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense,  
or Thaad, missile was cheered by Defense Department officials as an 
important step toward developing an effective defense against 
medium-range ballistic missiles of the kind U.S. officials say are 
owned by about two dozen countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was probably one of the watershed events in the  
technological history of our country,'' Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald 
T. Kadish told reporters at the Pentagon in describing the Thaad 
test conducted shortly before dawn at White Sands Missile Range in 
New Mexico. He said it was only the second time the United States 
had ``basically hit a bullet with a bullet in outer space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After six consecutive test failures for the Thaad, dating to  
1995, the missile scored its first successful intercept in June. 
The Pentagon had said it would wait until it managed three 
successful intercepts before advancing the project beyond its 
current ``demonstrative-validation'' phase of development. But 
Monday, Kadish pointedly left open the possibility of moving ahead 
after just two successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great confidence now ... that we are well on our way  
to proving the technology out,'' Kadish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said Monday's intercept left the Pentagon far from  
proving that Thaad and its system of launchers, radars and battle 
management computers can provide reliable protection for U.S. 
forces abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's Thaad test was akin to getting a hit in slow-pitch  
softball,'' said Tom Z. Collina, an arms control specialist at the 
Union of Concerned Scientists. He said the Pentagon needs to show 
it can hit a target moving at much higher speeds than the unarmed 
Hera target missile used in Monday's experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hera is a modified Minuteman II missile; in May the Pentagon  
had to scrap a Thaad test because of a problem with the Hera target 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Congress supports Pentagon development  
of missile defenses, but many critics question whether the Thaad 
can be made to work at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a long road to prove reliability,'' said Brian  
Hughes, director of the Taxpayers for Common Sense's national 
security reform project. ``We make the simple observation that the 
potential missiles that this would have to be deployed against in 
the real world are faster and bigger and probably would have 
multiple targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Congress' staunchest supporters of missile defense  
spending, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Monday's success was reason 
to look for ways to accelerate the Thaad project and field it as 
soon as possible. The government so far has spent about $4 billion 
on Thaad. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big win for missile defense and for America's  
national security,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hastily arranged Pentagon briefing, Kadish showed a  
videotape of the Thaad launch, the infrared image of the target 
missile as Thaad closed in and a blinding white explosion in outer 
space as the two missiles collided. Kadish said Thaad hit its 
target 500 seconds after it was launched. He declined to specify 
the altitude of the intercept except to say it was greater than 50 
miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, chief military adviser to the assistant  
secretary of the Army for weapons development, said Thaad would be 
capable of hitting North Korea's No Dong ballistic missile, which 
has a range of about 800 miles. He would not discuss Thaad's 
capabilities against other missiles such as a longer-range North 
Korean missile that U.S. officials expect to be tested soon.

<HEADLINE> Trial Beginns in Alabama Gay Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- A construction worker on trial for the  
slaying of a gay man whose body was burned atop a pile of tires did 
not deliver the fatal blows, but is responsible just the same, a 
prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hatred -- hatred of someone perceived to be different,''  
District Attorney Fred Thompson said during opening statements. 
``Billy Jack Gaither was a homosexual and that is the only reason 
they killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles M. Butler, 21, played a key role in the Feb. 19 slaying  
of Gaither, 39, whose body was burned atop a pile of 
kerosene-soaked tires, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler could be sentenced to death in Alabama's electric chair  
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A construction worker, Butler admitted he kicked Gaither several  
times, knocking him down. But he said a friend, 25-year-old Steven 
Mullins, cut Gaither's throat and bashed him repeatedly with an ax 
handle until his skull split open. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins has pleaded guilty to capital murder and is expected to  
testify against Butler. As part of Mullins' plea deal, prosecutors 
agreed to recommend a sentence of life without parole for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson accused Butler of playing a vital role by setting the  
tires afire and then burning Gaither's car to hide evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to be the triggerman to be guilty of capital  
murder,'' Thompson said.

<HEADLINE> Islanders' Potvin Signs for 1 Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Goalie Felix Potvin didn't get a raise  
when he signed a one-year contract with the New York Islanders. The 
way things went for him last season, though, he said he didn't 
expect one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just knowing that I'm going to camp and playing, I'm happy, ''  
Potvin said Monday after signing for $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was not particularly noteworthy for the 28-year-old  
Potvin. It began with a long holdout with the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
And, then after appearing in only five games, he was traded in 
January to the Islanders, he was bothered by a nagging groin 
injury. He was 2-7-1 with the Islanders and had a 3.66 goals 
against average. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of his season was a 55-saves game against the New  
Jersey Devils in April.

	Mortgage Rates Go Up  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --The rising cost of a home mortgage is expected to  
rein in the prolonged U.S. housing boom, as potential homeowners	
balk at rates that climbed above 8 percent today for the first time	
in two years. HSH Associates, a financial publisher that surveys	
lenders, said the average rate had climbed to 8.07 percent, up from	
a two-year low of 6.85 percent in September 1998. The business for	
mortgage refinancings is expected to virtually disappear due to the	
rate increase.

	Clinton Praises Welfare Gains  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- According to new figures released by President  
Clinton, the percent of Americans on welfare assistance is at a 
32-year low. ``As pleased as we are, we have to do more,'' Clinton 
told a national conference of the Welfare to Work Partnership in 
Chicago. He met with some 350 business leaders and former welfare 
recipients. Experts credit tough new rules and the strong economy 
for the reduction in welfare rolls.

	9 States Get $55M in Heat Aid

	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton offered $55 million today to  
help low-income people in nine states pay their electricity bills 
or buy cooling equipment. He said he hoped the money would help 
encourage older people to run air conditioners without fear of high 
utility bills. Since July 19, the midsummer heat wave has killed at 
least 256, including 119 in Illinois. Joined by Mayor Richard 
Daley, Clinton thanked city workers in Chicago for helping to

$500,000 -- not including Air Force and Navy involvement. President 
Clinton has taken responsibility for authorizing the effort. He 
based it on the Kennedy family's role ``in our national lives, and 
because of the enormous losses that they have sustained in our 
lifetimes.''

Talk magazine article. ``She did not say the president's childhood 
in any way caused his behavior, nor does she believe that,''

stating some feelings about his childhood, but that they do not

captured the assassination of President Kennedy. In a 2-1 vote, 
announced by the Justice Department, arbitrators set the amount 
after the government and the Zapruder family could not agree on a 
price. The government offered $1 million; the family asked for $30 
million. In 1997, the film was declared to be the property of the 
federal government.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 31.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A volatile session on Wall Street ended with  
mixed results Tuesday as a forecast of continued economic growth 
kept investors on edge about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.35, closing at  
10,677.31 after shifting between positive and negative territory 
for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 5.87 to 1,322.18 and the Nasdaq composite index, dominated by 
technology stocks, fell 35.64 to 2,587.99 as Internet stocks 
faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tuesday's loss, the Nasdaq is down 9.7 percent from its  
July 16 record of 2,864.48. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general tenor is one of malaise,'' said Scott Bleier,  
chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. While volume 
outpaced the sluggish trading of recent sessions, stocks pitched up 
and down in a fairly narrow range as buyers found little reason to 
return to the market. The number of stocks that slumped easily 
outnumbered those that improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise rates later this  
month in an effort to cool off the economy held most stocks back. 
The Conference Board provided the latest hint that the nation's 
unbridled economic growth is continuing, announcing that its index 
of leading indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its May 
increase. The index is used to forecast economic trends for the 
coming three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates has rattled stocks and bonds in the  
past week, dragging stock indexes well below the record highs of 
mid-July. Bond prices slipped once more Tuesday, sending the yield 
on the 30-year Treasury bond rising to 6.16 percent from 6.12 
percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks are attempting to do battle within an investment  
climate that is not reacting favorably to bonds and is showing no 
concrete or consistent means of leadership,'' said Brian G. Belski, 
chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, which are vulnerable to higher interest rates,  
were weighed down by other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Yahoo! would acquire the recently merged  
ExciteAtHome for a price greater than ExciteAtHome's $17 billion 
market value stimulated early buying. But after ExciteAtHome's 
president refuted the rumors, the company's shares ended just 7/16 
higher, at 43 3/8. Yahoo! tumbled 6 15/16 to 125 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bill Burnham, an Internet analyst at Credit Suisse  
First Boston, said in a report that online brokerages may 
experience their first-ever decline in trading volume in the third 
quarter. Shares of ETrade fell 4 5/16 to 24 11/16 and Charles 
Schwab lost 5 9/16 to 36 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham said the brokerages' troubles are due largely to recent  
weakness among Internet stocks, which have been the favorite 
investments of many online traders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a difficult market, online florist 1-800-Flowers.com wilted  
in its initial public offering. Its shares were priced at 21 and 
opened at 21 3/4, then fell back to 18 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the Internet stocks have had a real comeuppance,''  
Bleier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains by Johnson &AMP; Johnson helped support the Dow. Its shares  
rose 2 1/4 to 94 3/16 after J.P. Morgan increased its growth forecast 
for the company, and gave the stock a ``buy'' rating, upgrading it 
from ``market performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson also benefited from investors' subtle move  
toward consumer products companies, analysts said. Those companies, 
which include Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 3 9/16 to 93 11/16, are 
perceived as a safe haven for investors because their products 
remain in demand regardless of economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume came to 885.63 million 
shares, compared to 783.75 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.94 to 622.40, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.17 to 780.47. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.35 to 436.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.81 percent.  
European indexes were mostly lower, as Germany's DAX index fell 0.4 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 0.6 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 lost 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tim McGraw Leads CMA Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tim McGraw was nominated for seven  
Country Music Association awards today, and will compete with 1998 
winner Garth Brooks for the top award of best entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw's other nominations were for best male vocalist, album  
(``A Place in the Sun''), single (``Please Remember Me'') and music 
video (``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me''). He'll get two 
trophies if he wins the best album or single awards, as a producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Singers Brenda Lee, Sherrie Austin and Brad Paisley announced  
the nominees in the courtyard of the Grand Ole Opry House. The

McBride, Jo Dee Messina and Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's list of CMA nominees consists of an eclectic mix  
of country music luminaries and exciting new talent,'' said Ed 
Benson, executive director of the CMA. 
</P>
<P>
	The most notable breakthrough was that of the female trio the  
Dixie Chicks -- Natalie Maines and sisters Martie Siedel and Emily 
Erwin. Along with the best entertainer nomination, the group's 
``Wide Open Spaces'' is up for best single and video. They'll also 
compete with Alabama, Diamond Rio, Lonestar and The Wilkinsons for 
best vocal group. 
</P>
<P>
	Late country music singer Roger Miller was nominated for best  
song for his 1966 hit ``Husbands and Wives,'' which was returned to 
the charts by Brooks &AMP; Dunn. George Jones continued his comeback 
from a near-fatal car wreck with a nomination for best single for 
``Choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pop singer Linda Ronstadt was nominated for best vocal event  
along with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris for their ``Trio II'' 
album. Parton will be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame 
during the awards show, along with late singers Conway Twitty and 
Johnny Bond. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Baseball Collection Hits 5th Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Collector Barry Halper smiled proudly as  
strollers stopped by Bergdorf Goodman's Men's Store windows on 
Fifth Avenue Tuesday to gawk at some of his baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Over here was Babe Ruth's luggage and polo cap, over there was  
Joe DiMaggio's jersey and jacket. All of it was mixed in with 
Bergdorf's fashionable suits and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper, probably the premier collector of baseball  
paraphernalia, is using Sotheby's to auction off much of the 
material he has assembled over the last half century. And Sotheby's 
is using Bergdorf's windows to display a portion of the items. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the volume of material, more than 100,000 pieces in  
the largest privately owned collection of memorabilia in the world, 
the auction will last a week, Sept. 23-29. The Bergdorf window 
display will be in place until Aug. 16, a sort of appetizer for the 
main course. 
</P>
<P>
	One window is dedicated to Ruth items, another for DiMaggio.  
There is an early baseball window, and another window that includes 
a turnstile from Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the store there are smaller displays for Willie Mays,  
Jackie Robinson and Pete Rose jerseys, caps and spikes. Another 
includes a picture of normally docile Lou Gehrig arguing ewith an 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lifetime's work,'' Halper said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Halper said he was not emotional about auctioning it.  
That's because about 20 percent of the collection has been 
purchased by major league baseball and will be on permanent display 
at the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's there forever,'' Halper said. ``I can rest easy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, when it came to packing up the rest of his collection for  
Sotheby's, Halper discovered it wasn't so easy to part with some of 
his treasures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a Ruth contract and I said, `You can't have this.'  
Then I pulled back a Gehrig contract,'' he said. ``One of my kids 
said if I kept pulling things back, it wasn't going to be much of 
an auction. So I put it all back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he kept were the items he prized the most like personally  
signed pictures from DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, who became close 
friends over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there were the Ruth bathroom items, which Halper  
acquired from the Babe's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all have the initals `GHR,' '' Halper said. ``There's a  
hand-held mirror, a shoebrush, a hairbrush and comb, a toothbrush. 
And there was the good luck charm, a nail file. I'd hold it in my 
hand when I watched Yankees games and when they were in a tight 
spot, I'd rub the initials for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife asked if I really thought that helped.''  
</P>
<P>
	Halper just shrugged. He doesn't know, but just in case, he's  
keeping the nail file around.

<HEADLINE> Sprinter Dennis Mitchell Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Sprinter Dennis Mitchell was  
suspended for two years today for failing a drug test 16 months ago 
but will be eligible for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field's governing body said his test showed high  
levels of testosterone. But Mitchell's lawyer said today the 
sprinter has never taken testosterone or any other banned 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's clearly very disappointed and very upset,'' attorney Suja  
Thomas said from New York. ``He has always been against the use of 
drugs in track and field. This is truly a severe disappointment to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Mitchell's home in Florida was answered by his wife,  
who said she expected to hear from him shortly. Mitchell ran Monday 
in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitration panel concluded that Mitchell, the  
100-meter bronze medalist in the 1992 Olympics and current U.S. 
champion, was ``guilty of a doping offense'' and had no right of 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is final and binding,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a  
spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said he did not consider this a light punishment.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the rule for everybody,'' he said. ``According to our  
constitution, a ban starts the day after the positive doping 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF said Mitchell will be ineligible from April 1, 1998,  
until March 31, 2000. Any performances by Mitchell during that 
period are ``null and void.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old sprinter would be able to run in the Sydney  
Games, which begin in September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that was no consolation for Mitchell.  
</P>
<P>
	``This about Dennis Mitchell and he is an exemplary person and  
secondarily, he is an athlete,'' Thomas said. ``He doesn't want 
this perception and he wants to compete. He should compete because 
he hasn't done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis knows in his heart that he didn't take any testosterone  
or any other prohibited substance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of USA Track and Field cleared Mitchell in  
December. The USATF did not release the details of Mitchell's 
defense or the reasons for its decision to exonerate him. 
</P>
<P>
	But London's Daily Telegraph reported this year that Mitchell  
won his case on grounds that his positive result stemmed from 
having sex four times and drinking five bottles of beer the night 
before the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF arbitrators met July 24-25. The organization said today  
the USATF decision in December was ``erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said Mitchell's case was ``not a manner of sex and beer  
as people have reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much more complicated than that,'' she said. ``A  
combination of factors, stress and nonbanned substances, caused a 
temporary rise in his T-E level on one day in his entire career. 
That's what this case is all about. It's very unfortuante it has 
come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Mitchell ran the 100 in 10.09 seconds in Malmo,  
Sweden. He led Maurice Greene for the first 50 meters before 
finishing second to Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	His best time this season is 10.02 with three other Americans  
having run faster. He has also ran a wind-assisted time of 9.97 
this season.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Traded to Sacramento Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic traded Nick Anderson, the  
only remaining member of the original expansion team, to the 
Sacramento Kings on Tuesday for Tariq Abdul-Wahad and a future 
first-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was part of a rebuilding plan that team officials hope  
will produce a younger, more athletic team under new coach Doc 
Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's difficult to see Nick depart, we are looking  
forward to bringing in a young talent like Tariq, while also 
gaining another future first round draft pick,'' Magic general 
manager John Gabriel said. ``Nick will always be in the hearts of 
Magic fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 31, who has averaged 15.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in  
10 NBA seasons, was the first draft pick of the expansion Magic in 
1989. He was entering the third season of a four-year contract 
that, with incentives, could pay him more than $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento is the talk of the league right now,'' Anderson  
said. ``Flash, run and gun, having a lot of fun -- that's what I 
like, to keep the fun in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a popular player in Orlando where he spent a lot of  
time and money doing charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was involved in two headline-making incidents that  
tarnished his image. In 1992, he was involved in a fight at a 
concert that caused him to miss 20 games because of broken face 
bones. Four years later, he was accused of rape, but no charges 
were filed after police discounted the woman's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a big-time two guard that's still in the prime of his  
career, that has a good relationship with some of our best players, 
wanted to be here, and has always played on winning teams, pretty 
much'' said Geoff Petrie, Kings vice president of basketball 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely think he brings some stature with him, and he's  
played on winners, been a good player on winning teams, I always 
think that's important,'' Petrie said. ``And he's really excited 
about joining our team with the style of play we have, and really 
improves our perimeter shooting in the backcourt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad, a 24-year-old shooting guard, has played two  
seasons with the Kings, who made him the 11th pick in the 1997 
draft. He played two seasons at Michigan and his final two at San 
Jose State. He changed his name from Olivier Saint-Jean early in 
his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	As a starter with the Kings last season, Abdul-Wahad averaged  
9.3 points and 3.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic also re-signed forward-center Bo Outlaw, 28, who  
averaged 6.5 points and 5.4 rebounds last season. Terms of the 
contract weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel refused to comment on the future of guard-forward Penny  
Hardaway, who visited with the Phoenix Suns last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lines of communication are open,'' Gabriel said.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Avoiding ATM Surcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Consumers are finally rejecting the idea that  
they should pay for the convenience of getting their own money. 
</P>
<P>
	People are doing just about anything to avoid pesky ATM  
surcharges, according to a new survey. They're using debit cards to 
make cash-less purchases. When they go to the grocery store, they 
get extra cash back with their change. When they do use an ATM, 
they're making sure it's at a branch of their own bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cash station surcharges have become a double-edged sword for  
ATM networks,'' said David Gosnell, senior editor for Bank Network 
News, which conducted the survey. ``There's a general consensus 
that surcharges have dampened ATM use and shifted consumer thinking 
toward using debit cards, but the industry has been slow to respond 
because of the profits attained from them,'' Gosnell said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based trade magazine found that monthly ATM  
transactions in March 1999 fell to 907.4 million, down 2.4 percent 
from the 930 million transactions recorded in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, debit card point-of-sale transactions jumped  
35 percent, according to the survey of the top 10 ATM networks, 
including Cash Station, Star and Interlink. Debit cards, which 
often look just like credit cards, work with a bank account, making 
a deduction for every purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks routinely impose ATM charges when a non-customer  
steps up to the keypad. The banks argue these fees are necessary 
because banks must pay each other to reconcile accounts. They must 
also pay thousands of dollars on annual upkeep of the machines. 
Some banks also charge their own customers when they use another 
bank's machine, resulting in double charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, roughly 66 percent of the nation's 227,000 ATMs in 1998  
had surcharges averaging $1.22 each time a non-customer used them, 
up from 56 percent a year earlier, according to Speer &AMP; Associates, 
an Atlanta consulting firm to the banking industry. Fees can rocket 
to $5 in such places are bars and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal lawmakers have attempted to limit the charges  
but have had little success. Now it appears customers are taking 
matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in a real pinch do I pay a $1 service fee,'' said  
business consultant Tom Nolan of Mokena, Ill., who uses ATMs only 
at his banks or uses credit cards to receive frequent flier miles. 
``I don't like giving away money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers, led by supermarkets and grocers, have taken advantage  
of that dissatisfaction by offering consumers the opportunity to 
use debit cards -- not only to make purchases but to get cash back, 
according Speer. 
</P>
<P>
	Debit cards are used widely in Europe and Canada but have been  
slow to catch on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Metcalfe, a Philadelphia architect, says he uses that  
option more often nowadays by stopping into supermarkets or drug 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting, though, how back in 1979, the banks  
presented ATM service free of charge,'' said Metcalfe, eyeing an 
array of such machines. ``We were ignorant consumers not to think 
they wouldn't start replacing tellers and charging us for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked my whole life and (made) my own money -- I can't get  
it out of the bank without paying,'' said a frustrated Grace 
Carter, a 72-year-old retired Philadelphia Board of Education 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	As ATM use has leveled off because of the fees, so have the  
profits from ATM networks, according to Bank One Corp., the 
nation's fifth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees have also shifted traditional American thinking away  
from paying for items first with cash, then by check, credit cards 
and then debit cards, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, based in Chicago, hedges its bets by being the largest  
issuer of debit cards and owning the second-largest ATM network 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A widely-watched indicator of future economic  
activity rose 0.3 in June, chalking up gains in eight out of the 
past nine months and signaling that the U.S. economy could be in 
its longest expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private New York-based economic research  
group, reported today that its index of leading indicators stood at 
107.7 in June, up from 107.4 in May. The index also rose by the 
same amount in May. The last decline, in April, was 0.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at The  
Conference Board, said that while the economic expansion is 
``firmly on track,'' concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise 
interest rates could roil financial markets and create some 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of current economic activity rose  
by 0.4 in June, while its lagging index decreased by 0.4 1/8pomts. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the ten indicators that make up the leading index rose  
in June. The most significant increases came in manufacturers' new 
orders of consumer goods and materials, money supply, and the 
difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six months ended June 30, the leading index rose 1.2  
pointw and seven of the 10 components advanced, the Conference 
Board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several components of the leading indicators index gave details  
about the growing economy. Manufacturers took in $166.4 million of 
new orders in June, up from $162.3 million in May. Money supply 
rose to $3.962 billion from $3.947 billion. And the difference, or 
spread, between the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds and the 
overnight Federal Reserve lending rate rose to 1.14 percent from 
0.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a sign that the labor market may not be heating up  
enough to push wages higher, the average number of hours worked per 
week by production workers was 41.7, unchanged from May. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall index is calculated from a base of 100, set in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets had little immediate reaction to the  
report.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 65 As Nasdaq Climbs 7 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as takeover  
speculation lifted Internet stocks and buyers returned cautiously 
to a battered market, hoping to find bargain stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 65.22 at 10,711.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher, although their gains  
were slim. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.16 at 1,333.21, 
and the Nasdaq composite index was up 7.77 at 2,631.40. 
</P>
<P>
	A report that ExciteAtHome may be acquired by Yahoo! for a price  
greater than ExciteAtHome's $17 billion market value stimulated 
some buying in Internet and telecommunications companies. 
ExciteAtHome rose 4 41/64 to 47 37/64, while Yahoo! slipped 9/16 to 
131 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the broader market, concerns about higher interest rates  
continue to hold most stocks lower amid light volume. Traders have 
become increasingly convinced in the past week that the Federal 
Reserve will raise rates later this month in an effort to cool off 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the Conference Board provided that latest hint  
that the nation's unbridled economic growth is continuing. The 
private New York-based economic research group said its index of 
leading indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its May 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey measures economic trends for the coming three to six  
months, providing analysts with the latest suggestion that 
continued growth will encourage the Fed to raise interest rates to 
prevent inflation from encroaching on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 81.1 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.54 at 626.88, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.83 at 787.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.81 percent.  
European indexes were slightly lower. Germany's DAX index was down 
0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent in afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Actor Withdraws Claim as Bono Heir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A struggling actor has withdrawn his claim  
that he is Sonny Bono's son and an heir to the late 
singer-turned-congressman's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Machu, 35, was not listed as an heir in court documents  
filed in Riverside County proposing how Bono's $1.72 million estate 
and other assets would be divided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can confirm that we are no longer pursuing the claim,''  
Machu's attorney, Michael Baranov, said Tuesday. He declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Machu filed a claim against the estate in July 1998, contending  
he was Bono's son and heir. Bono had died six months earlier in a 
skiing accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Bono's widow, Rep. Mary Bono, said she wouldn't contest Machu's  
claim if he was Bono's son. The results of a DNA test performed 
earlier this year have not been made public.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- Four days after attending a ``Birth Night''  
promotion at a Lowell Spinners baseball game, a woman has delivered 
a baby boy and claimed a free year's supply of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul John Armstrong, who weighed 8 pounds, 4 ounces and was 20 3/4  
inches long, was born to Paul and Lisa Armstrong of Tyngsboro at

Armstrong, reporting his wife was only in hard labor for about an 
hour. ``Lisa did great.''

	The Class A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox invited expectant  
mothers and their partners to Thursday night's game and offered

the baby to be born during the game to win.

<P>
	A sellout crowd cheered the couples on, helping out with  
breathing exercises and taking part in scoreboard contests to name 
the baby and guess the time of delivery. Rather than name the baby 
after one of the former Spinners players, as the team 
lightheartedly suggested, the parents decided to name him after his 
father.

<P>
	``We already had the names picked before,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> New York Opera Adds Sound System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York City Opera will become the first  
major American company to employ an electronic sound system like 
those used in cinemas and Broadway theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will be installed in the New York State Theater, home  
of the City Opera and the New York City Ballet, on an experimental 
basis in time for the Sept. 11 opening of the City Opera's fall 
season with Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' the companies' 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Opera companies occasionally use sound systems to amplify spoken  
dialogue, such as in Mozart's ``Magic Flute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the 35-year-old State Theater, designed for dance, has poor  
acoustics for music, especially the singing voice. The sound system 
will feature stationary microphones and more than 100 inconspicuous 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view it as electronic architecture,'' said Martin  
Oppenheimer, head of the board that oversees the City Opera and the 
City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound system will enhance the acoustics of the auditorium  
but will not amplify voices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Sills, once a leading soprano and now chairman of  
Lincoln Center, endorsed the system but said she hoped it would be 
temporary.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Campaign Finance Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee approved four competing  
campaign finance bills Monday, setting the stage for debate and 
votes in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But committee Democrats warned Republicans against structuring  
floor debate to undermine the vote on a bill similar to one that 
passed the House last year with support from nearly the entire 
Democratic caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that ... is to be proposed, I will be compelled and will  
urge all of my colleagues to vote against it,'' Rep. Steny Hoyer of 
Maryland, senior Democrat on the House Administration Committee, 
said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Another panel, the House Rules Committee, which decides what  
bills get to the floor, is to vote thi+s week on procedures for 
that debate. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to 
allow votes on the issue next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also plans to debate campaign finance legislation by  
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the proposals approved Monday combine elements of  
measures the House considered during last year's campaign finance 
debate. Other bills are identical to those offered last summer. The 
four bills would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Crack down on election activities by foreign nationals and  
improve and expand Federal Elections Commission operations. It is 
sponsored by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House 
Administration Committee, which approved it by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	--Remove limits on campaign contributions to federal elections,  
eliminate taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns and 
require certain disclosures. Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., is the 
sponsor, and the bill was approved by a show of hands. 
</P>
<P>
	--Impose a federal ban on soft money, unlimited and unregulated  
donations to political parties to finance party activities. It also 
would index contribution limits to inflation and expand disclosure 
requirements. Sponsored by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., it was 
approved by voice vote. The House rejected this bill last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ban soft money at the federal and state levels, regulate issue  
advertising and create a commission to study future reforms. 
Sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, 
D-Mass., the bill was approved by a 6-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill, 252-179. But  
Senate gridlock kept that chamber from voting on the issue as well. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 2668; H.R. 1922; H.R. 1867 and H.R. 417.

<HEADLINE> Services Widen Web Search Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes to hard-to-find information on the  
Internet, chances are improving that a few typed keywords may 
immediately locate what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Internet search services, including ExciteAtHome and  
Lycos, say they are dramatically widening their scope to encompass 
more of the 800 million Web sites on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves follow a recent study showing that most search engines  
let people scour just a fraction of the Net, excluding lesser known 
sites and the torrents of fresh information added daily to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While broader searches may clutter some Internet users with  
needless information, the services insist they are working harder 
to organize search results so that top-listed sites match what 
people are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely good that the search engines are getting  
bigger -- with a big caveat that bigger doesn't necessarily mean 
better,'' said Danny Sullivan, the London-based editor of 
searchenginewatch.com, a Web site that tracks the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, broader searches are more likely to benefit those who  
conduct in-depth research, such as scientists and journalists, 
rather than casual Web users just looking to buy books or CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, the journal Nature published a study showing  
that search engines cover a shrinking fraction of Web pages and 
take a long time to list new sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, by NEC Research Institute, offered fresh bragging  
rights to those Web destinations with search engines that ranked 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	Better search power is a good way to draw more visitors. Twice  
as many people have been using Northern Light, the top-ranked 
search engine in the study, since the Nature report was published, 
said Susan Stearns, director of marketing for Northern Light 
Technology LLC, based in Cambridge, Mass. ``People recognize that 
comprehensiveness is important,'' Stearns said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while offering more comprehensive searches is one way to  
lure more visitors to a site, it's no guarantee. The most visited 
network of Web sites, Yahoo!, ranked only No. 8 in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome Corp. unveiled a new version of its search tool on  
Tuesday, saying it will index up to 300 million Web pages, or more 
than a third of the Internet's public sites -- up from just 6 
percent. In addition, the service uses a more thorough method of 
sifting through Web sites to decide which to include in its index. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamped service, which will be available by the middle of  
this month, comes after a year-and-a-half of research, said Kris 
Carpenter, director of search services for ExciteAtHome, insisting 
the timing of the launch was unrelated to the study's release. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, a day before the Excite announcement, a Norwegian  
company named Fast Search &AMP; Transfer unveiled a service that checks 
200 million Web pages. The service also organizes information so 
that users aren't bogged down by lots of irrelevant material, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos plans to introduce a more comprehensive search by the end  
of the year, said executive vice president Ron Sege. But Sege 
played down the importance of broader searches, saying that the 
important thing is how well a company chooses the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The service upgrades come amid pressure from investors for  
search companies to boost traffic to their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, for example, saw the number of visitors to its sites  
rise only 5 percent in the second quarter after jumping by a third 
in the first quarter. Other Web sites have reported similar 
slowdowns.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Asks For Another Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Attorneys for retired Pittsburgh Penguins star  
Mario Lemieux have asked a judge for a third delay in the closing 
of the sale of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux needs more time to finalize settlement agreements with  
investors, attorney Douglas Campbell said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz scheduled a hearing on  
the extension request for 3 p.m. Thursday. That is the day that 
Markovitz had set as the deadline for the closing after attorneys 
twice requested extensions in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's investors, who have placed $50 million in an escrow  
account to buy the team, won't release their money until the 
settlements are wrapped up, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the remaining issues should be resolved by next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Campbell asked the judge to transfer ownership of  
the Penguins' practice arena to Morris Belzberg, a minority 
stakeholder in the team. Markovitz indicated he would approve the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Belzberg has invested $2 million in the reorganized team and  
plans to lease the Iceoplex in Canonsburg to the team, which filed 
for bankruptcy in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux still must work out a Civic Arena managerial contract  
for the team with Philadelphia-based landlord SMG Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, National Hockey League senior vice president of  
legal affairs, said the delays should not be cause for concern. He 
described the NHL's review of the sale as ``substantially 
complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing out of the ordinary here,'' Daly said Monday.

<HEADLINE> McNown Joins Bears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Cade McNown put on a red practice  
jersey and took his first snaps as a Chicago Bear today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' first-round draft pick arrived in training camp late  
Monday after ending a 10-day holdout and signing a contract that 
could be worth up to $22 million over five years, including a $6.1 
million signing bonus. He spent his first practice working with a 
group of receivers to begin learning the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we started camp a month ago or we started it today, I  
need all the preparation I can possibly get,'' he said after 
signing his new contract. ``It doesn't matter whether it's one week 
or two weeks away so the more the better. With that, I just want to 
tell you how excited I am to finally get up to camp and get 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a new offense to learn and the first preseason game  
Saturday, McNown has a lot to make up. While he won't start and 
might not even play in the first exhibition, the real season begins 
Sept. 12 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bears have made it clear they want the former UCLA  
standout as their starting quarterback -- the sooner, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. That's a decision for the coaches to make, but  
my job is to be as ready as possible to allow them to make a good 
decision,'' McNown said when asked if he'd be ready to start the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no expectations,'' he added. ``From all indications,  
they just want me to be able to step in and play, whatever that 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's confidence in McNown -- veteran Erik Kramer was cut two  
days before training camp began -- might have cost the team some 
leverage in contract negotiations. But there never was a doubt the 
deal would get done, agent Tom Condon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal could be worth up to $22 million over five years,  
Condon said. On paper, it's a seven-year contract for $15 million 
including the $6.1 signing bonus. But the last two years of the 
deal can be voided, and McNown can earn an additional $7 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last two years to void, McNown just needs to take 35  
percent of the snaps as a rookie or 45 percent of the snaps in his 
second or third year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the first three years it's realistic to believe  
that he's going to play 35 percent or 45 percent,'' Condon said. 
``If he doesn't, then there are a lot bigger problems than whether 
or not we've got extra years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other deals with voidable years, there is no  
``buyback,'' which allows the team to buy back the remaining years 
of the contract. Instead, Condon said McNown's contract contains 
``escalator clauses'' that could increase his salary in the later 
years of the deal if he meets certain performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my agent, Tom Condon, when he was satisfied, I'd be  
satisfied and so we've reached an agreement,'' McNown said. ``I'm 
very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears released quarterback Doug Nussmeier, who had been  
brought in for help during McNown's holdout. But three other 
quarterbacks remain on the roster -- Shane Matthews, Jim Miller, 
Moses Moreno. They have had 17 more practices than McNown to learn 
the team's new offense and develop a rhythm with their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown knows he's got a lot of work to do, which is why he left  
for camp right after he signed his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fired up to get to Platteville and get started on trying  
to make an impact this year,'' he said. ``Once I get up there, I'm 
just going to have to jump in wherever they are and just spend some 
time in the film room and with the coaches just kind of getting to 
where I need to be.''

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Black and Hispanic leaders announced Tuesday that  
they have formed a coalition to promote solidarity between their 
communities on issues such as voting and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope ... to create an alliance to work together on some of  
the issues that are significant to our communities,'' said the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of the agreement by the black and Hispanic leaders

</P>
<P>
	At a news conference to announce the signing, Jackson was joined  
by Raul Alarcon Jr., president of the Spanish Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and Alarcon said the pact was meant to unite and  
mobilize the Hispanic and black communities on such issues as 
voting, redistricting, the census, health care, education and

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise Above 8 Percent / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mortgage rates have crept above 8 percent for  
the first time in two years, causing predictions of a slowdown in 
the U.S. housing boom and mortgage refinancings that could ripple 
throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first signs of a letup in demand are expected to appear in  
the thriving business for home construction and eventually spread 
into the manufacturing and retail sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Construction will be the first area to be impacted, followed  
by sales of household goods,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at 
First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. He predicted a 
10 percent to 20 percent dropoff in the number of home sales during 
the fall buying season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitner said the expected ripple effect is significant because  
home construction and household goods are the only U.S. 
manufacturing sectors that have experienced growth in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of existing single-family homes jumped 10.6 percent to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million units in June, the 
highest level ever, according to the National Association of 
Realtors. Comparable increases were seen across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance, however, followed two consecutive months of  
sales declines and exceeded many analysts' expectations. Housing 
experts said the increase was likely caused by home buyers who 
jumped into the market as mortgage rates began to accelerate toward 
8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first consumers to feel the pinch will be first-time  
homebuyers, said Ed Phillips, executive vice president of the 
Homebuilders Association of Georgia. ``It will impact the people 
that need housing the most, the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HSH Associates, a financial publisher that surveys mortgage  
lenders, said Tuesday the average lending rate had climbed to 8.07 
percent, up from a two-year low of 6.85 percent in September 1998. 
The weekly survey by mortgage company Freddie Mac, released 
Thursday, is expected to show a similar level. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump to an 8 percent mortgage rate has stemmed primarily  
from a similar rise in the interest rates of 10-year U.S. Treasury 
bonds. The two rates generally mirror one anothers' movements 
because most mortgages are resold as investment products known as 
mortgage-backed securities, which compete for investment dollars 
with various types of bonds, including the 10-year Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury bond rates have climbed on fears that inflation is on  
the rise, and that the Federal Reserve Bank will increase interest 
rates across the board to stem a surge in the prices of consumer 
goods. Higher interest rates tend to reduce consumer spending, and, 
consequently, the costs of goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, some in the home buying and building businesses  
believe too much is being made of the 8 percent benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Lurie, with the Southern Arizona Home Builders Association  
in Tucson, Ariz., said the higher mortgage rates will undoubtedly 
discourage potential home buyers who are struggling to put the 
financing together. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who have benefitted from the prolonged strength of the  
domestic economy shouldn't be deterred, he said. ``We've seen seven 
strong economic years. Many people have made some money, and now 
they can build a house,'' Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8 percent figure is more of a psychological benchmark than  
an economic one because home buyers had grown accustomed to 
relatively low mortgage rates, said Adrian Skiles, a mortgage 
broker with Atlanta Mortgage Group. Ten years ago, he recalled, 
mortgage rates were in the double digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many metropolitan areas around the country, Atlanta has  
seen its housing market boom throughout the 1990s. Skiles said the 
growth is expected to continue because people relocating to the 
area for new jobs will need to buy a house regardless of rising 
mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The business for mortgage refinancings, however, is expected to  
virtually disappear in the wake of the rate increase. Refinancing 
is an option for current homeowners who want to reduce their 
mortgage payments. But experts said the cost and effort to 
refinance won't be worth it if the rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Others see a potential silver lining to the rate increase.  
</P>
<P>
	``The housing market has been extremely strong, and this could  
put a brake on the rising cost of housing,'' said Jeremy Siegel, a 
professor of finance at the Wharton School, adding that an easing 
demand for new homes will push prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes hand in hand with (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan  
Greenspan's goal of slowing the economy.''

<HEADLINE> Ginats' Sehorn Has Hamstring Tear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jason Sehorn's attempt to return to the New  
York Giants' lineup is going to be delayed about another 10 days 
because of a torn hamstring in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback who missed all of last season with a serious knee  
injury had the tear detected Monday night after undergoing an MRI 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost certain that Sehorn will miss the Giants preseason  
opener at Minnesota on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few injuries, and the hamstring is one of them,  
you can't push it,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said Tuesday after 
practice at the University at Albany. ``You have to let it go. Some 
come back a little quicker, some are a little longer, but you 
cannot push it. If you do it will keep going and going and will 
never clear up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's top cover cornerbacks, Sehorn injured the  
hamstring working out about three weeks before training camp 
opened. He didn't think it was serious then, but it cramped about a 
week before camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some reports that the Giants were concerned that  
Sehorn did not work out with the team while rehabilitating his 
right knee, which he hurt in a preseason game against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel downplayed that report, saying he personally knows Marv  
Marinovich and Kevin McNair, the two men Sehorn hired to get him 
back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to be pushed,'' Fassel said. ``He didn't  
spend as much time as he could have on stretching. Jason loves to 
work out and he pushed it hard and pulled a hamstring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sehorn said his trainers reminded him to stretch, but he didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time I worked my butt off, I put on a lot of  
muscle,'' Sehorn said. ``The amount of time I put into stretching 
compared to the time I put in working out wasn't there. You put on 
18 pounds, you need to stretch a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Sehorn still sidelined, Conrad Hamilton and Phillippi  
Sparks continue to start at cornerback.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Lawyers Threaten To Impeach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Defense lawyers in the sodomy  
trial of Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister threatened today 
to impeach the prosecution's star witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Christopher Fernando told the judge that Anwar  
Ibrahim's former family driver, Azizan Abu Bakar -- who accused his 
ex-boss of sodomizing him several times in 1992 and 1993 -- lacked 
credibility as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will show that this man was made use of and his evidence is  
fabricated,'' Fernando told High Court Judge Ariffin Jaka. ``I am 
laying the foundation with a view to impeach him if necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azizan, who has been on the witness stand since last Wednesday,  
has accused Anwar and his adopted brother Sukma Dermawan of 
sodomizing him up to 15 times in different locations. His testimony 
last week was closed to the media and the public, but recorded on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also threatened to prosecute Azizan for perjury  
during Anwar's first trial last November. Anwar was convicted of 
abusing power and is serving a six-year jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar says the charges were fabricated to end his challenge to  
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	Sodomy is a crime in predominantly Muslim Malaysia, punishable  
by 20 years in prison and a whipping. Anwar's adopted brother is 
also on trial.

<HEADLINE> Calif. City Claims School Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- The Compton mayor declared a state of  
emergency Tuesday over a spate of school arson fires and began 
recruiting citizens to form campus patrols, a move hotly opposed by 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of California is responsible for these fires even if  
they haven't set them themselves,'' Mayor Omar Bradley told a news 
conference. ``We intend to make sure when the state leaves we still 
have schools to administer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The patrol plan was viewed cautiously by the Compton Unified  
School District, which was taken over by the state in 1993 as it 
teetered near bankruptcy and has been the object of a long battle 
by local officials to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is nobody will be allowed on our campus,''  
said district spokesman Fausto Capobianco. ``It would be in 
violation of state law and it would create confusion on our 
campuses. Who is to tell if one of these people is the perpetrator 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight arson fires this year have caused $1.7 million in damage  
at six facilities in the 28,000-student, 40-school district. Six 
fires damaged classrooms; two others were set in unoccupied 
buildings. No one has been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The district had already posted a $10,000 reward, and the city  
added another $10,000 Tuesday. Fire and police officials would say 
little about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the nature of the fires and the location of the  
fires we believe it's more than a firebug at this time,'' Fire 
Chief Milfred Fonza said without elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plan calls for citizen volunteers to patrol schools 24  
hours a day if possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have citizens who are going to be standing out  
there documenting everybody who goes into the schools and who goes 
out of the schools,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 people signed up as volunteers after the City Council  
approved the emergency declaration on a 4-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I teach in the district and I don't want to see the schools  
burn down,'' said Carl Robinson, 64, offering to watch schools for 
six hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the fact that anyone can come in and say they're  
a sentinel and patrol,'' said Leon Mitchell, 17, attending summer 
school at Compton High. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow student Katrina Scarks, 17, said she was shocked about a  
fire last week on the campus but also dismissed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't going to accomplish anything,'' Scarks said.  
``Some kids leave at a certain time and come here at different 
times. They won't know who is coming and going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capobianco said the district has already increased patrols and  
is spending $3.5 million on installing fire and intruder alarms at 
its schools, he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Executive Resigns From Humana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Managed health care giant Humana Inc.,  
buffeted by declining earnings, underwent a shakeup in its top 
ranks Tuesday with the abrupt resignation of Gregory H. Wolf as 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading of Humana's stock on the New York Stock Exchange was  
halted late Tuesday afternoon at $10.25 per share, down 50 cents, 
as word of the leadership change emerged from the Louisville-based 
company. The company's stock has lost more than half its value 
since its 52-week high of $22.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	David A. Jones, a co-founder of Humana and Wolf's predecessor as  
CEO, was appointed by the company's board of directors as interim 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, who had stayed on as chairman of Humana's board, also  
will head an ``Office of the Chairman'' that includes three other 
high-ranking Humana executives to help navigate the company through 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	The board will start an immediate search for a permanent chief  
executive officer, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is committed to improving operating results,  
shareholder value and shareholder confidence in Humana, and to 
promptly finding a permanent successor who will renew Humana's 
tradition of excellence,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf, 42, could not be reached for comment. Humana said he was  
leaving the company to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf became Humana's CEO in December 1997, completing his rapid  
ascent through the managed-care company's ranks. He joined Humana 
after the company bought a Wisconsin-based insurer where he was an 
executive in October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana's problems were reflected by sharply lower first-quarter  
earnings that it blamed on a sudden jump in health care costs. 
Those rising costs were linked in part to a new contract that 
forced Humana to pay considerably more to continue doing business 
with Florida hospitals owned by Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter earnings announced by Humana last week met Wall  
Street expectations but were down significantly from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Humana's financial struggles are shared by other health  
maintenance organizations and include coping with changes in the 
government's reimbursement for covering Medicare recipients, 
industry analyst Steve O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neil, with Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, called Wolf's  
departure a surprise. But, he added, it's typical for executives to 
bear the brunt of blame when things go bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that can happen when a company runs into  
difficulties,'' O'Neil said. ``There have been some earnings 
difficulties, and the stock price has not performed well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humana underwent considerable upheaval last year, when its  
planned multibillion-dollar merger with United HealthCare Corp. 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a difficult time for managed care,'' O'Neil said.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neil said whispers of possible mergers persist in the  
managed-care industry but said the timing for such a move is bad 
for Humana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a company has run into difficulties, naturally there  
are rumors of a takeover and buyout,'' O'Neil said. ``It would seem 
like it's not an opportune time for the shareholders to sell the 
company, given the depressed value of the stock and the problems 
they've run into recently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.1 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 61 points  
in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
hold a 3-2 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 24 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up six points. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech sector is likely to draw strength today from a  
report that Yahoo! has been holding merger talks with 
Excite/AtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	But market-watchers says Wall Street is increasingly likely to  
trade cautiously as we move closer to the Federal Reserve's next 
policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank is scheduled to meet about interest rates three  
weeks from today. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, concerns about interest rates are leading to more  
negative reactions to economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, for instance, posted solid early gains yesterday, only  
to surrender the move by the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, the Conference Board is due to release its June

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Smith Aims for Super Bowl Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. -- There's one thing that could send Bruce Smith  
into retirement at the end of the 1999 season, but it's a good 
thing for Buffalo fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of the most dominant defensive players in NFL  
history, says he'll retire for sure after the season -- only if the 
Bills win the Super Bowl, something the team has failed to 
accomplish four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get to the Super Bowl and win, I will retire,'' Smith,  
36, said Tuesday. ``You'd better believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-time Pro Bowl selection who still carries the bittersweet  
memories of four straight Super Bowl losses in the early 1990s, 
Smith begins his 15th season with the health and optimism of a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some exciting new players and some who have been here  
a while and are ready to blossom,'' Smith said. ``And we have some 
older players who just seem to keep getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Count Smith among the latter.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Bills' all-time leader in sacks with 163 and second  
in the NFL behind Reggie White (192.5), entered training camp for 
the first time with no distractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No contract disputes,'' Smith said. ``And the only pain I'm  
suffering from is old age. Fifteen years ago, you never could have 
told me that I would still be in this game today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and White are the only two players to have recorded 10 or  
more sacks in 12 seasons; Smith had 10 last year. ``The older you 
get the harder it gets,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell Thurman Thomas, one of three Bills -- along with Smith  
and Andre Reed -- left from Marv Levy's Super Bowl teams. He says 
his friend still draws a crowd on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce is Bruce,'' Thomas said. ``They might say he's getting  
old and has lost a step or whatever, but you haven't lost that much 
of a step when people are still double- and triple-teaming you. 
That's out of respect; they know that he can still tear up an 
entire offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Bills struggled early, losing their first three  
games of the season. They rebounded with a strong finish before 
losing to Miami in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting off on a positive note and not being 0-3 or 0-4 is  
important,'' Smith said. ``If we get off on the right foot, we'll 
be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith serves on the board of directors for Operation Smile, a  
charity based in his hometown of Norfolk, Va., that helps poor 
children in developing nations who have facial disfigurements. The 
young patients have their cleft palates repaired free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	For 17 days in March, Smith watched and even assisted in  
surgeries in places such as Kenya and Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an overwhelming feeling to see that child look normal  
because a lot of times what happens in the community in the tribes 
over there, they're thought of as being outcasts. They shoo them 
away or don't pay any attention to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip put things in perspective for Smith, who has donated  
some of his own money to the charity. ``It kind of gets me a little 
emotional because we take so much for granted in this country. Over 
there, their average income is $30 a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith draws inspiration also from father, George, who has been  
plagued by several ailments including emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors wrote him off about six or seven years ago,''  
Smith said. ``They said he had six months to live, and my father's 
still hanging around. He's not in very good shape but he's still 
passing on knowledge and experiences and wisdom, and that's where I 
get my will to keep pushing on.''

<HEADLINE> KLA Said Behind Serb Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs and Gypsies are being beaten  
and killed by revenge-seeking ethnic Albanians, and efforts by 
NATO-led peacekeepers are often inadequate to stop the violence, 
two human rights groups said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were contained in a report published today by  
Human Rights Watch and in excerpts of testimony by Gypsies -- or 
Roma -- made available to The Associated Press by the European Roma 
Rights Center. Both groups blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for 
most of the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they provided fresh evidence that violence stoked by  
ethnic hatred persists in Kosovo despite the June pullout of the 
Yugoslav army and Serb police after President Slobodan Milosevic 
accepted a Kosovo peace plan in exchange for an end to NATO 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	In outlining abuses, Human Rights watch said that ``well over  
164,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo,'' along with ``significant'' 
numbers of Gypsies, accused by many Kosovo Albanians of siding with 
the Serbs and against the province's Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said there had been a ``rash of killings against  
Serbs since mid-June,'' including ``many ... innocent civilians.'' 
It said that Serbs and Gypsies are also abducted and ``in most 
cases, the men are detained, questioned, and beaten, often very 
badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While most are subsequently released, some of those abducted  
remain missing and are presumed dead,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, French police on U.N. duty in Kosovo  
briefly arrested a man thought to be a war crimes suspect, only to 
release him several hours later after determining that he was the 
wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers said that the man, Dragan Jovanovic, was  
released after an identity check revealed that the sought suspect 
was someone else with the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	One beating victim quoted by the Budapest, Hungary-based  
European Roma Rights Center related being taken into a room in the 
village of Drenovce, near the Albanian border to see a fellow-Gypsy 
who had been severely beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lifted up his shirt and showed me his ribs,'' said the man,  
identified only by his initials. ``His chest was all black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the men, some in KLA uniforms, turned their attention to  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kicked me all over my body, including my genitals,'' he  
said. ``I couldn't see, because my eyes were full of blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other men quoted by the Roma Rights Center related similar  
tales of beatings, threats and intimidation by people in KLA 
uniforms who accused them of spying for the Serbs, directly 
participating in the persecution of ethnic Albanians, or stealing. 
One of the men said his wife, sister and mother were raped by men 
in KLA uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Both rights groups described international efforts to stop the  
revenge crimes as inadequate, with NATO-led peacekeepers -- formally 
known as KFOR -- an inefficient alternative to thousands of police 
the groups said are needed to keep violence in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current ad hoc arrangements for policing are woefully  
inadequate,'' said the Human Rights Watch report. ``KFOR's concern 
about protecting its own forces, differing interpretations of the 
mandate ... and lack of experience in civil policing result in an 
uneven response to attacks and threats against minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reports were made public against the backdrop of a string of  
reported revenge killings of Serbs, including an elderly woman 
found strangled in her bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-year-old Serb woman was found dead Monday in Pristina,  
Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported. Three other 
slayings, including that of a Serb killed in the Vitina area 
southeast of Pristina and two others in Prizren in southwestern 
Kosovo, were reported by the private Beta news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	KFOR said two ethnic Albanians were detained in connection with  
the killing of the woman. In a statement, it also said four 
attackers ``alleged to be ethnic Albanians'' killed a Serb man in 
the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The KFOR statement also said 15 Serbs were detained in Mitrovica  
for attempting to prevent ethnic Albanians from returning home.

<HEADLINE> Probe Captured Asteroid Science Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft that failed to get  
close-up pictures during its flyby of an asteroid last week 
captured enough science data to determine the rock's makeup and 
raise questions about its past, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe Asteroid Braille may have once been part of a  
larger asteroid, Vesta, which is also cruising through the solar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 flew within 16 miles of Braille, a peanut-shaped  
object about 1.3 miles long. The July 26 flyby was the closest ever 
by a spacecraft -- twice the distance of a jetliner cruising above 
the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the probe's camera was not aimed accurately enough to  
take pictures at the closest point of the encounter, it did capture 
two fuzzy images and analyzed the rock's spectrum after the 
spacecraft reoriented itself about 15 minutes after the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's often said a picture is worth a thousand words, but today  
under this circumstance a spectrum is worth a thousand pictures,'' 
said Robert Nelson, a mission scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	Data returned from the spacecraft's spectrometer indicate that  
Braille is made up of igneous rock, suggesting that at some point 
it melted and cooled. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesta, the second-largest known asteroid, also has a similar  
composition, and scientists believe that Braille may have once been 
part of Vesta. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple explanation is that ``Vesta was a victim of a  
collision of some sort and that it spewed off chips of the old 
rock,'' said Bonnie Buratti, a member of the mission's science 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope indicate Vesta, which  
is about 325 miles across, has a large impact crater on its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will continue to run computer models to find out how  
Braille could have traveled so far. Braille, between the orbit of 
Earth and Mars, is about 117 million miles from Earth. Vesta, 
between Mars and Jupiter, is 219 million miles away.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' Trades Revamp Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a single day, the Denver Nuggets completed a  
sweeping reorganization of their roster, keeping Nick Van Exel, 
trading for Ron Mercer and two other players, and signing George 
McCloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we're done making major trades, major changes,''  
general manager Dan Issel said Tuesday. ``There's only so many 
changes you can make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we certainly have stabilized ownership now (with  
Donald Sturm). Hopefully, we have stable management. I think what 
we need to do now is let these kids play together for two or three 
years and see what kind of basketball team we can come up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Nuggets sent forwards Danny Fortson and Eric  
Williams and guard Eric Washington to the Boston Celtics for 
forwards Ron Mercer and Popeye Jones and center Dwayne Schintzius. 
The Celtics also will receive a first-round draft choice in one of 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring more deals, the Nuggets will open the 1999-2000 season  
with Raef LaFrentz, almost fully recovered from reconstructive knee 
surgery, at center; Antonio McDyess and Mercer at forward, and Van 
Exel and Chauncey Billups at guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, Bryant Stith and Keon Clark figure to be key players off  
the bench, and draft choices James Posey and Chris Herren also 
should be factors, especially the 6-foot-8 Posey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be real hard to keep Posey off the  
floor,'' Issel said. ``I don't think anybody has a lock on a 
starting position now because Posey is a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a nice mix of veterans and youngsters, and they should  
adapt well to the running game the Nuggets hope to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's the only way you can be successful here,''  
Issel said. ``You have to take advantage of the altitude. We're 
still not the biggest team in the world, and so we're going to have 
to get up and down the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the roster taking shape, Issel was asked what expectations  
he had of the Nuggets this season following 11-71 and 14-36 
campaigns the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my concern is having a competitive team this first  
season in the Pepsi Center,'' he said. ``Our expectation is to be 
competitive for a playoff spot. That ought to be our goal, that 
we're still playing for a playoff spot late in the year, that we're 
not out of it by Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought this year's team could be significantly  
better than last year's, he said, ``If you give me a healthy Raef 
LaFrentz, I would say significantly better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we're probably two or three years away from  
really seeing if we've done a good job or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel also said the current roster ``has more athleticism than  
any team we've ever had here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the offseason last spring, the Nuggets had four  
goals: acquiring a starting small forward, improving their 
perimeter shooting, upgrading their defense, and acquiring a backup 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer and McCloud fill the first two needs. Jones, Posey and  
Herren are solid defenders. But Issel suggested the backup center 
spot remains unsolved, despite the trade for Schintzius, an 
eight-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only gaping hole that we wanted to address that we  
have not yet is backup center,'' Issel said. ``Raef is doing 
exceptionally well in his rehab. He's been cleared to do everything 
but scrimmage. We feel quite sure he'll be ready to go full speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a backup center. The big problem is they're very  
difficult to come by. So we'll have to wait and see what happens. 
But Schintzius is what we have right now. That didn't sound like a 
great endorsement, did it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said the 6-foot-7 Mercer, who averaged 17 points last  
season for the Celtics, ``can get up and down the court, he can 
defend, and he's bigger than most people think. The way we want to 
play, I think he'll fit in fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the 6-8 Jones, who played in only 18 games last season  
before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, ``gives us a 10-12 
minute guy who can play behind Antonio. He's a good rebounder, a 
good defensive player, and he's a very solid citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-signing Van Exel was Issel's main goal this offseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at his statistics, he's one of the better point  
guards in the league, assists-to-turnover ratio,'' Issel said. ``He 
had a terrible year shooting the ball. But he made some big shots 
in the two biggest wins we had last year, beating Utah and the 
Lakers back-to-back. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get better as a team and he doesn't feel he has to carry  
so much of it himself, he'll be a much better player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-8 McCloud is a deadly 3-pointer shooter who averaged 8.9  
points last season for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play a lot of different positions and he can defend,''  
Issel said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Don't Ask About Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Doctors are failing to find victims of  
domestic violence by not asking all their patients about abuse 
during routine office visits, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of 400 primary care physicians surveyed in  
California said they would inquire about abuse during routine 
exams. By comparison, 79 percent said they would ask if the patient 
showed signs of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's reason to be concerned, especially in the context of  
knowing that physical violence occurs in 4 (million) to 6 million 
relationships each year,'' said the study's lead author, Michael 
Rodriguez of the University of California, San Francisco Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez based his estimate of the scope of domestic violence  
on two national studies, one conducted by the University of Rhode 
Island and the other by the Commonwealth Fund Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was reported in the latest issue of the Journal of the  
American Medical Association. Since 1993, the AMA has encouraged 
physicians to ask all patients about their exposure to domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the most important thing to emerge from this is that  
routine screening is still woefully uncommon in the primary care 
settings,'' said Patricia Salber, president of Physicians for a 
Violence Free Society and a former emergency room doctor.

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins 'Showdown at Sherwood'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Great start, rocky finish.  
</P>
<P>
	That made David Duval a loser to Tiger Woods in golf's first  
appearance on network television in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing not far from where he grew up, Woods overcome a sluggish  
start and dominated the par-3 holes to beat Duval 2 and 1 in the 
``Showdown at Sherwood,'' a made-for-television match-play 
competition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was nothing more than an exhibition match, but the world's  
top-ranked golfers were paid very well for their three-plus hours 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods earned $1.1 million, while Duval collected $400,000. Each  
will donate $200,000 to charity, including $100,000 each to the PGA 
Tour-sponsored First Tee program. 
</P>
<P>
	If either felt any pressure, it certainly wasn't evident,  
although neither was at his best. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time where the pressure perhaps should have been on, Woods  
and Duval were giggling like schoolchildren as they chatted while 
walking down the 15th fairway. Woods led 1-up at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached the match that David and I are good friends, and  
we were going to come out here and put on a good show,'' Woods 
said. ``I think it's a wonderful concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is this sort of thing the start of something new?  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but it's basically up to the ratings,''  
Woods said. ``How high the ratings are will determine how 
successful it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won the first two holes with a birdie and a par, but Woods  
won the next two, and added wins at the sixth and ninth holes for a 
2-up lead at the turn. 
</P>
<P>
	A win on 12 put Woods ahead 3-up, but when Duval won 13 and 14,  
it was anyone's match. 
</P>
<P>
	The players halved 15 before the match's biggest shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval hit what he would later call his best shot of the day down  
the middle on the par-4, 449-yard 16th hole, but the ball took one 
bounce into a rock formation some 300 yards from the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant a one-shot penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Woods hit two terrific shots to leave him 10 feet  
from the hole. Duval conceded, giving Woods a 2-up lead with two 
holes left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the worst breaks I've ever seen, to end up in  
Jack's little concoction in the middle of the fairway,'' Woods 
said, referring to Jack Nicklaus, the course designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it where I was aiming it,'' Duval said. ``I've played  
the Shark Shootout three times (at Sherwood Country Club), I know 
it's there. I've aimed for it every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, to his dismay, he hit it.  
</P>
<P>
	Needing a birdie to keep the match alive, Duval's tee shot on  
the 232-yard 17th caught a ridge and rolled 50 feet from the hole. 
Woods was 40 feet away, and lagged his putt within 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval then conceded, and they smiled and shook hands as the  
floodlights installed on the final two holes at Sherwood before the 
match cast shadows across the green. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth par-3 hole played by the pair; Woods won the  
first four. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about match play is I was down early, I knew I  
could come back,'' Woods said. ``It's a game of momentum. The 
momentum changes, it's like the NBA or football, when a team gets 
on a roll, they get all pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three times and has finished no worse than  
seventh since his post-Masters break, is No. 1 in the world 
rankings -- a position Duval previously held by becoming the first 
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rivalry? Not yet,'' Woods said. ``We haven't gone  
head-to-head yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, Woods and Duval have been paired together only  
one other time, in the third round of the World Series of Golf last 
year, a tournament Duval went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods took it easy heading into the event, hanging around the  
area and playing a practice round Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, meanwhile, played in the Hartford Open before traveling  
to California and arriving Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't use fatigue as an excuse.  
</P>
<P>
	``My game did not feel very good today, it was really  
disappointing,'' he said. ``I don't know why. I know I can play 
better against him than I did today. I was a bit apprehensive about 
it, I was a bit nervous, but I enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he hoped the exhibition would bring more interest to  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tiger turned pro in '96, golf became cool -- not a dorky  
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was attended by about 2,000 fans. The price of general  
admission tickets was cut in half last week because of poor sales -- 
those who bought in advance were given a chance at a rebate or an 
additional ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Woods described the crowd as ``boisterous.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty exciting atmosphere,'' he said. ``There were  
no gray areas. They were either for one player or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them were for Woods, and they got their wish. The  
hometown guy won.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Advocates Make Sweet Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Surrounded by bags and boxes of sugar, sweet  
drinks and pastries, consumer advocates on Tuesday urged that food 
labels disclose the amount of sugar added to the products. 
</P>
<P>
	While current food labels report the total sugar in a product,  
there is no way for the consumer to differentiate between naturally 
occurring sugar and sweeteners that have been added in 
manufacturing, said Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest. 
</P>
<P>
	His group and others petitioned the Food and Drug Administration  
to change the current food label requirements to add a line listing 
``added sugar'' and show what percentage that is of a recommended 
daily amount. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said the agency had not yet received  
the petition for label change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sugar Association issued a statement calling the proposal  
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``American consumers already have all the tools they need to  
evaluate the nutritional quality of foods,'' Richard O. Keelor, 
president of the Sugar Association, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grocery Manufacturers of America said the battle against  
obesity cannot be won by ``obsessively targeting'' sugar, and the 
National Food Processors Association said the label change would 
merely confuse consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson said the amount of added sugars in the American diet  
has been increasing steadily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years ago, Americans were getting about 12 percent of  
their calories from refined sugars, or added sugars,'' he said. 
``Today we're averaging about 16 percent. Teen-agers get 20 percent 
of their calories from added sugars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he agreed that the body can't tell the difference between  
natural sugars and added sugars, Jacobson said the natural sugars 
come with other nutrients, including vitamins and fiber, while 
added sugars add only calories to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Nestle, a nutritionist at New York University, said the  
increased consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages 
replaces more healthful items such as milk and fruit juice in the 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like sweet foods and I do not for a minute believe that  
sugars are poison,'' she said. But, she added, ``rates of obesity 
are rising among children as well as adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People would be healthier if they replaced foods high in added  
sugar with more nutritious foods,'' she said. ``Food labels are a 
good way to help people do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mohammad N. Akhter of the American Public Health Association  
said that ``Americans have done wonderful work in modifying their 
lifestyles. More people exercise today, more watch their diet. Once 
they have the information they will act on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobson said the Agriculture Department recommends that the  
average person on a 2,000-calorie daily diet include no more than 
40 grams of added sugar. That's about 10 teaspoonfuls, or the 
amount of sugar in one 12-ounce soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his proposal, for example, a product listing total sugars  
of 15 grams -- of which 5 grams occur naturally in the food -- would 
include a second line saying ``added sugar 10 grams, 25 percent'' 
of daily recommended intake. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was sent to the FDA on Tuesday, and Jacobson said  
the normal process of studying such recommendations, seeking public 
comment and changing the rule would probably take up to five years.

<HEADLINE> Top Executive Resigns From Humana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Gregory H. Wolf's turbulent tenure as  
Humana Inc.'s top-ranking executive ended abruptly with his 
resignation from the managed health care company shaken by a failed 
merger and declining earnings in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf stepped down Tuesday as president and chief executive  
officer, and Humana co-founder David A. Jones emerged to reassume a 
more prominent role with the promise of restoring the company's 
``tradition of excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, who had stayed on as chairman of Humana's board, also  
will head an ``Office of the Chairman'' that includes three other 
high-ranking Humana executives to help navigate the company through 
the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	The board will start an immediate search for a permanent chief  
executive officer, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is committed to improving operating results,  
shareholder value and shareholder confidence in Humana, and to 
promptly finding a permanent successor who will renew Humana's 
tradition of excellence,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville-based company's stock has lost more than half its  
value since its 52-week high of $22.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf, 42, could not be reached for comment. Humana said he was  
leaving the company to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf became Humana's CEO in December 1997, completing his rapid  
ascent through the company's ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana's problems were reflected in sharply lower first-quarter  
earnings that it blamed on a sudden jump in health care costs. 
Those rising costs were linked in part to a new contract that 
forced Humana to pay considerably more to continue doing business 
with Florida hospitals owned by Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter earnings announced by Humana last week met Wall  
Street expectations but were down significantly from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Humana's financial struggles are shared by other health  
maintenance organizations and include coping with changes in the 
government's reimbursement for covering Medicare recipients, 
industry analyst Steve O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neil, with Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, called Wolf's  
departure a surprise. But, he added, it's typical for executives to 
bear the brunt of blame when things go bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that can happen when a company runs into  
difficulties,'' O'Neil said. ``There have been some earnings 
difficulties, and the stock price has not performed well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, one of the nation's largest managed health care  
companies, has about 6.1 million members in 15 states and Puerto 
Rico.

<HEADLINE> Nine West To Eliminate 1,900 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jones Apparel Group Inc. will eliminate about  
1,900 jobs and close three factories as it looks to reduce costs in 
its newly acquired Nine West footwear and accessories division. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, which designs and markets apparel under well-known labels  
such as Jones New York, Saville and Evan-Picone labels, bought Nine 
West in June in a $1.5 billion deal that created one of the biggest 
clothing and shoe companies in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Tuesday that it would close Nine West factories in  
Kentucky, Indiana, and the Dominican Republic. Like Jones does with 
its clothing lines, it will contract out production of its shoes to 
outside manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jones will close Nine West's administrative office  
in St. Louis and will merge those operations into Jones' 
headquarters in Bristol, Pa., and Nine West's headquarters in White 
Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	About 550 employees in the United States and 1,170 in the  
Dominican Republic will be affected as a result of the factory 
closings. About 190 jobs will be cut when the St. Louis office 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs represent about 12 percent of Nine West's total  
workforce of 15,600 people. Jones Apparel employs an additional 
9,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings are expected to be completed by the end of this  
year. Beginning in 2000, Jones expects to save about $7 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were difficult decisions, however, as we integrate the  
Jones and Nine West businesses into today's globally competitive 
women's apparel and footwear markets, it is imperative that we 
maximize worldwide sourcing capabilities and reduce costs,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Jones slipped  
1.5 percent, or by 50 cents, to $32.93 3/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> Heston Mesmerizes Packed Theater </HEADLINE>

	LONDON (AP) -- Charlton Heston mesmerized a packed theater with  
memories of Jimmy Stewart, Orson Welles and Robert De Niro -- all to 
help a young drama student pay his college fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 75-year-old star of ``Ben Hur'' and ``The Planet of the  
Apes'' agreed to appear at the Roses Theater at Tewkesbury after 
student Nick Wilkes wrote to ask for his help. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston agreed to be interviewed on stage by Wilkes, 25, who was  
struggling to find $4,000 to cover tuition at the Bristol Old Vic 
Theater School. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity audience of 350 welcomed the veteran star onto the  
stage with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 75-minute show, Heston commended Wilkes for  
having ``the common sense to ask for what he wanted, which he did 
very politely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Where is he going to get a theater from?' but he  
did, and more importantly, he filled it,'' Heston said. Wilkes 
works at the theater as a projectionist.

<HEADLINE> Charge Filed in Salt Lake Bid Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the first criminal case in the federal  
probe of whether bribery swayed the choice of a 2002 Winter 
Olympics site, a Salt Lake City businessman pleaded guilty in 
federal court today to a misdemeanor tax violation. 
</P>
<P>
	David E. Simmons, the former chairman and CEO of Keystone  
Communications, admitted helping the son of one of the most 
influential International Olympic Committee members obtain lawful 
permanent resident status by offering him a fraudulent job at his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, 41, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Ronald N. Boyce  
this afternoon. Boyce asked Simmons a series of questions to ensure 
the plea was not coerced, then asked Simmons to explain what he did 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I included in a tax return for Keystone Communications salary  
for an (International Olympic Committee) relative and I knew it 
false. The purported salary was not genuine,'' Simmons said in a 
voice barely above a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, Simmons admitted entering into a series of  
sham contracts and using phony invoices to conceal the fact that 
the son's salary was actually being paid by the Salt Lake City 
Olympic Bid Committee. The agreement said Simmons employed the son, 
whose name was not disclosed, ``for the purpose of influencing his 
father's vote in favor of awarding the Olympic Winter Games to Salt 
Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, an ethics report produced for the Salt Lake City  
Olympic organizing committee, which was set up after the bid was 
won, said that Simmons was involved in job scam for John Kim, the 
son of Un-yong Kim, a powerful IOC member from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake organizing committee board chairman Robert Garff said  
today the group wanted to read the government's court filing before 
commenting. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Howard Graff, a lawyer for Un-yong Kim, said an IOC  
investigator tried to strong-arm a man into signing a false 
statement saying he accepted $20,000 from Salt Lake bid officials 
and then gave it to a company employing John Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	Formerly chairman and chief executive of Keystone  
Communications, Simmons is charged in a criminal information filed 
with the plea agreement. The criminal information charges him with 
causing Keystone to submit a 1992 tax return that falsely deducted 
the salary of this ``employee'' as a business expense. The tax 
charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 
$10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the agreement said, Simmons knew the payments to the  
IOC member's son ``were not genuine salary payments, but were 
instead payments made under a sham employment arrangement designed 
to enable the ... (son) to attain lawful permanent resident 
status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons agreed to cooperate fully with the investigation, which  
was begun last December and now involves the Justice Department, 
the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea agreement must still be approved by the court.  
</P>
<P>
	The government's court papers said the scheme began in the  
summer of 1990 with an agreement between Simmons and an officer of 
the Salt Lake City Bid Committee for the Olympic Winter Games, 
whose name was not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons agreed that Keystone would hire the IOC member's son in  
a salaried position in Keystone's New York office so the son would 
be eligible for permanent resident alien status. The Salt Lake 
Olympic Bid official promised that the bid committee would 
guarantee repayment of the son's salary in the event the son did 
not bring any business to Keystone, the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government provided these additional details:  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC relative was hired as marketing manager-Asia at a  
purported salary of $50,000 a year beginning Oct. 29, 1990. On May 
1, 1992, the son's salary was increased to $70,383 per year. He 
remained ostensibly on Keystone's payroll until October 1992 
although he had ceased coming to the Keystone New York City office 
and was not performing work for Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
	Keystone was reimbursed for the son's salary in several ways:  
</P>
<P>
	--On April 21, 1992, Komar International of Hackensack, N.J.,  
owned by the IOC member's son, which imported and exported 
martial-arts equipment, purportedly hired Keystone as a consultant 
for $30,000 on a proposed cable television venture by Komar. No 
consulting was done and the ``contract'' was designed so the son 
could reimburse Keystone for keeping him on its payroll. Over time, 
this contract paid Keystone $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--In May 1992, Keystone received a check for $13,216.40 from  
Morris Travel Inc., that Simmons considered represented a portion 
of what the Salt Lake City Bid Committee owed him for the son's 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keystone submitted a sham invoice billing the Salt Lake City  
bid panel for ``video services,'' which were not provided. Also 
Simmons and the Salt Lake bid official wrote a sham ``consulting 
contract'' under which Keystone would purportedly arrange private 
meetings with IOC members, although such services were never 
contemplated. Between Sept. 20, 1992, and April 26, 1993, under the 
invoice and the contract, the Salt Lake bid committee paid Keystone 
$45,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--In January 1993, Keystone submitted a sham invoice to Kobee Co.  
Inc., which in turn passed on to Keystone $20,000 that Kobee had 
received from the Salt Lake bid committee under a separate sham 
consulting contract.

<P>
	Key events in the Olympic bribery scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	June 16, 1995: Salt Lake City wins bid to hold the 2002 Winter  
Olympics, receiving 54 of the 89 votes cast within the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nov. 24, 1998: Salt Lake TV station KTVX reports that the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee paid for a ``scholarship'' for Sonia 
Essomba, daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of Cameroon, 
to attend American University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nov. 25: SLOC chairman Bob Garff, responding to the reports  
about tuition assistance to IOC relatives, described the program as 
a ``humanitarian effort'' but denies it was a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 8: SLOC President Frank Joklik reveals that 13 individuals  
received a total of $393,871 in financial aid or scholarships from 
the committee. Six were relatives of IOC members. The program began 
in 1991 after Salt Lake City lost the 1998 Olympic bid to Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 10: IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch opens an internal  
investigation of SLOC's payments to IOC relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 12: Top IOC member Marc Hodler alleges that corruption and  
vote-buying has determined the locations of the Olympics in 
Atlanta, Nagano, Salt Lake City, and Sydney. He estimates that 5 to 
7 percent of IOC members have solicited bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 13: Samaranch says there was ``no possibility'' that Salt  
Lake City would be stripped of the 2002 games, regardless of the 
internal probe's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 14: Intermountain Health Care details the free medical  
services it provided to three Africans connected to the IOC. The 
nearly $28,000 in health care included hepatitis treatment, plastic 
surgery, and knee joint replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 16: A spokesman for Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, who  
was on the SLOC bid committee, says the city hired the son of an 
IOC member as an intern, later identified as the son of IOC member 
David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17: Japanese media report that Nagano bid committee spent  
on average $22,000 per member on each of 62 visiting IOC members -- 
in violation of strict IOC spending limits. All accounting records 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 21: Samaranch says IOC members will be banned from further  
travel to Olympic bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 22: Former Sen. George Mitchell is selected to head a  
five-member investigating commission for the U.S. Olympic Committee 
to look into bribery and corruption allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 23: The Justice Department and FBI formally open an  
investigation into whether bribery, fraud or public corruption laws 
may have been broken by the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 7, 1999: The Associated Press reports that IOC member  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo earned $60,000 profit on 
a land deal arranged through a member of the Salt Lake bid 
committee. Major sponsor US West says it will withhold a $5 million 
payment to SLOC until it can answer questions about the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 8: Joklik and senior vice president David Johnson resign.  
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11: IOC's investigating committee sends letter to 13  
members implicated in the scandal, demanding explanations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 14: Samaranch says nine IOC members face possible expulsion  
for ``serious'' offenses in the Salt Lake scandal and four others 
face minor charges. He also says it was the IOC's hope the games 
stay in Salt Lake City, and that he plans to stay in office until 
his term expires in 2001. USOC official Alfredo La Mont, the head 
of international relations, resigns amid allegations he worked with 
SLOC to secure information about Latin American IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 15: Samaranch announces a special IOC meeting on March  
17-18 to deal with possible discipline of its members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 16: Sponsor US West gives a $5 million check to the SLOC --  
a payment the sponsor had previously said it was withholding until 
it received assurances that the scandal would not interfere with 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19: Pirjo Haeggman of Finland resigns, the first IOC member  
to quit in the scandal. Her ex-husband reportedly worked briefly 
for the Salt Lake bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario 
government job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 20: USOC marketing director says two companies that were  
close to final agreement on Salt Lake City sponsorships had ``asked 
that the announcement of sponsorship be withheld until the results 
of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 22: Samaranch accepts the resignation of a second IOC  
member, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya, whose son reportedly 
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham 
Young and a community college, plus $700 a month for expenses from 
Salt Lake bidders. It is also disclosed that in 1993, on the night 
before Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing, the 
head of the Australian Olympic Committee offered two IOC members 
$70,000 in inducements to vote for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 23: The IOC begins meeting in Lausanne to consider actions  
against its members in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 24: IOC recommends the expulsion of six members for  
violating their Olympic oath in the scandal. A third member, 
Sibandze, resigns. Three others remain under investigation and a 
fourth was warned about his actions by the ruling executive board. 
Samaranch says the Salt Lake City and Sydney games would not be 
moved, although officials would be sent to Australia to investigate 
the situation there. 
</P>
<P>
	March 1: Mitchell commission says IOC fostered ``a culture of  
improper gift-giving'' that led to the Salt Lake scandal, calls for 
reforms including term limits and open financial records. 
</P>
<P>
	March 17: Samaranch receives a near-unanimous vote of confidence  
from committee members at the start of an emergency general 
assembly on the scandal. Number of expulsions and resignations 
reaches 10 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	April 14: In hearings, the Senate Commerce Committee sharply  
criticizes Olympic leaders for the Salt Lake scandal, with two 
members urging Samaranch be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	June 19: In the first vote on an Olympics site since the scandal  
broke, the IOC selects Turin, Italy as host for the 2006 Winter 
Games over the front-runner, Sion, Switzerland. The election is 
seen as a backlash against the Swiss-based IOC and Hodler. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 3: In the first criminal case resulting from the scandal,  
Utah businessman David Simmons pleads guilty to a federal 
misdemeanor tax charge and tells the court he helped create a sham 
job for the son of powerful IOC member Kim Un-yong. Simmons, who 
agrees to cooperate with authjorities, says the job was financed by 
Salt Lake Olympic bidders to try to influence Kim's vote.

<HEADLINE> Cayman Bank Industry Rocked Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The secrecy surrounding banks in the Cayman  
Islands, where for years wealthy Americans have used offshore 
accounts to avoid taxes, has been laid bare with the help of a 
former banker. 
</P>
<P>
	The probation sentencing of John M. Mathewson, 71, on federal  
conspiracy and money laundering charges has led to an unprecedented 
look at how Cayman banks operate, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Records provided by Mathewson, who was sentenced Monday, could  
result in tax evasion charges against 1,500 U.S. citizens and net 
as much as $300 million in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Caymen banks ``have proven over the past several decades to be  
one of the greatest allies'' of U.S. criminals, including drug 
traffickers, Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Carney said in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout from the takeover of the Mathewson's bank, Guardian  
Bank &AMP; Trust Limited, however, is likely to be more modest than the 
collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a Cayman 
Island bank that used fraud to cover up its insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	BCCI, which had 1.3 million depositors and operations in 70  
nations, dwarfed Guardian, which had some 2,000 mainly American 
clients. However, the Guardian case demonstrated that the secrecy 
of one of the world's largest financial depositories could be 
pierced. 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant who has worked in international banking and spoke  
on the condition of anonymity disputed the view of U.S. authorities 
who suggested that the 580 banks in the tiny British colony exist 
mainly to illegally hide American money. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the banks on the Caribbean island are based in either  
Europe or the United States, and they do not accept Americans as 
clients, leaving just a handful of Caymanian banks, such as 
Guardian, for such accounts, the consultant said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are merely offices with no services for individuals, the  
consultant said. Nevertheless, the Cayman Islands rank in the top 
half-dozen of world banking centers, by deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson, a U.S. citizen now living in San Antonio, Texas,  
could have received a five-year prison term, but got probation 
because of what U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. called 
``unparalleled'' cooperation with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	That assistance, over the past three years, included providing  
the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service with computerized records 
of Guardian Bank and continuing grand jury testimony. This could 
result in up to $300 million in taxes and penalties being 
collected, with $50 million received so far, his lawyer said. 
Authorities could not confirm those figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardian operated for nine years before Cayman authorities  
closed it in early 1995 and had it liquidated for serious 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Cayman bank regulator on Tuesday said the Guardian case  
is further evidence of the effectiveness of their ``regulatory 
regime'' and shows they will not allow the industry to be abused by 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement from Neville Grant, managing director of the  
Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, added that a 1996 law allows 
criminal courts to recover the proceeds of certain serious offenses 
and bars Cayman bankers from assisting in someone's criminal 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear whether its run as a tax haven is due to a  
failure of oversight, legislation, or some combination, said 
Stephen M. Feldhaus, an international tax lawyer based in 
Washington, D.C., who said he has done work in the Caymans since 
1975 for businesses and investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such clients make legitimate use of banks with Cayman offices,  
acknowledge offshore accounts on their U.S. tax forms, and are the 
bulk of the industry there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson had been arrested in 1996 in Texas following an  
undercover FBI operation targeting a group that pirated cable 
television signals and used Guardian to cloak bribes paid to an 
industry insider, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not realize Mathewson had Guardian's records  
until he offered the backup computer tapes. Many of Guardian's U.S. 
clients were illegally attempting to hide legitimate income, but 
some also are believed to be sheltering ill-gotten gains, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mathewson case is based in Newark because the nationwide  
cable piracy probe was handled by the FBI office here.

<HEADLINE> McGraw, Dixie Chicks Get CMA Nods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Touring partners Tim McGraw and the  
Dixie Chicks broke into country music's most elite circle on 
Tuesday, earning nominations for best entertainer from the Country 
Music Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The other nominees in the best entertainer category announced in  
the courtyard of the Grand Ole Opry House were Garth Brooks, George 
Strait and Shania Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners will be revealed Sept. 22 during an awards ceremony  
broadcast live by CBS. Singer Vince Gill will host. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cool deal,'' McGraw said. ``Our shows together have  
been going great and selling out every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The McGraw-Dixie Chicks tour ends Sunday in Birmingham, Ala.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised they've done so well, and I'm certainly  
pleased with my nominations,'' McGraw said. ``These nominations are 
a gauge of how your career is going, so I'm always nervous about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw also was nominated for best male vocalist, album (``A  
Place in the Sun''), single (``Please Remember Me'') and music 
video (``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me''). He'll get two 
trophies if he wins the best album or single awards, because he 
also produced the album and the song. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, who has won the most awards (17) in CMA history, got five  
nominations: best male vocalist, album (``The Key''), song (``If 
You Ever Have Forever in Mind'') and two nods for best vocal event, 
for duets with Patty Loveless and Sara Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining McGraw and Gill in the best male vocalist category were  
Strait, Alan Jackson and Steve Wariner. 
</P>
<P>
	Best female vocalist nominees were Ms. Twain, Faith Hill,  
Martina McBride, Jo Dee Messina and Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks -- Natalie Maines and sisters Martie Siedel and  
Emily Erwin Robison -- also picked up nominations for best album and 
single for ``Wide Open Spaces. They'll compete with Alabama, 
Diamond Rio, Lonestar and The Wilkinsons for best vocal group. 
</P>
<P>
	The best entertainer nomination stunned the group, Ms. Robison  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty surprising to me that we would be nominated for  
that award so soon,'' she said. ``It's thrilling that the industry 
has enough faith in us to recognize us in this category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late country music singer Roger Miller was nominated for  
best song for his 1966 hit ``Husbands and Wives,'' which was 
returned to the charts by Brooks &AMP; Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	George Jones continued his comeback from a near-fatal car wreck  
with a nomination for best single for ``Choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing!'' Jones said. ``It's a miracle.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pop singer Linda Ronstadt was nominated for best vocal event  
along with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris for their ``Trio II'' 
album. Ms. Parton will be inducted into the Country Music Hall of 
Fame during the awards show, along with the late singers Conway 
Twitty and Johnny Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,800 workers in the country music industry nominate and  
vote for CMA winners. The awards began in 1967.

<HEADLINE> High Tech Comes to Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Until recently, the 98-year-old Rockefeller University library  
in New York City loaned books on the honor system. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it gets a little help from a computer chip that allows books  
to be checked out anytime of the day or night -- without the 
assistance of a librarian. 
</P>
<P>
	The new device, called the Intelligent Library System, is the  
creation of Checkpoint Systems Inc. of Thorofare, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer chip acts as an antenna that connects with a  
database computer in the library. Patrons activate the system with 
a microchip that contains their name and other information. At 
Rockefeller, the chip is embedded in the ID card. Patrons can then 
sweep the books over a detector, much like the check-out clerk does 
with a can of tomatoes at a grocery store. The computer registers 
the book as checked out and issues a receipt with a due date. 
</P>
<P>
	An exit detector receives a signal from the chip and determines  
whether the book has been indeed checked through. If not, an alarm 
will sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The book can be returned through a depository which again  
detects the chip and tells the computer that it has been returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmett Erwin, Checkpoint Systems' library division director,  
said the system provides privacy for library customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids may be checking out books on sex or AIDS or adults may be  
wanting a book on personal bankruptcy, something they don't want to 
go up to a librarian with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At some libraries, the Intelligent Library System will replace  
existing Checkpoint Systems setups. When some sticky-fingered 
patrons of the Free Library of Philadelphia were taking the name 
too literally, Checkpoint Systems in 1967 put metal plates in the 
books and put detectors at the door to catch those skipping 
checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the metal bar was replaced by the  
electromagnetic strip, which has also found widespread use in the 
retail world. 
</P>
<P>
	But the computer chip may make them both obsolete. Current  
systems pose problems for libraries. For one, there is the problem 
with false alarms from other kinds of metal on a person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so many types of media: computers, computer discs,  
tape recordings,'' Erwin said. ``Magnetic devices will ruin this 
type of media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Intelligent Library System is in use at the Rockefeller  
University library and at the public library system in Gloucester 
County, N.J. It was recently on display at a national library 
conference in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller University chose the system after having problems  
with stolen research journals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a system that did not necessitate staff intervention  
because the library is open 24 hours a day, but the staff is on 
duty only eight hours a day,'' said Patrica E. Mackey, head of a 
12-member staff at the Rockefeller library. 
</P>
<P>
	James Gugluzza, who works in two labs at the university, said he  
likes the system, though it if there's a malfunction when there 
isn't a librarian on duty, then a patron can't take out a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Librarian Amy Vonk explained that the system won't work if a  
student card has expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``If happens at night, they get a message on the screen that  
says: 'Your card is not being accepted. Please come back to the 
circulation desk (from) 9 to 5 p.m.,''' she explained. She said the 
librarians call security, who can update the card. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we got this security system in people are allowed to  
bring their bags in also,'' she said. ``Before, a lot of books were 
being stolen so they had to leave their bags at the security desk, 
so people are glad about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chips also provide a quick and easy way for libraries to  
inventory their books, normally a time-consuming process, Erwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rockefeller, a consulting staff of 10 people used to perform  
the inventory, at a cost of $200,000. Now, by using an electronic 
wand, a library staff member can do the inventory in a day or two, 
Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will also find a misshelved book,'' Mackey said. ``If a  
book is misshelved, it's just as good as lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current cost of the system is about $100,000 per library,  
which should be recovered in about two years from reduced costs and 
lost books, Erwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erwin said the system likely would next be used in video stores.  
Future applications could include supermarkets and other retail 
outlets and studies are under way to determine if the system could 
simplify airline baggage handling. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Rockefeller is any indication, the system will be turning  
up at more libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when we're open we notice people using this instead of  
coming up to the counter,'' Vonk said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stolen Goods Sold Over eBay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Mich. (AP) -- Two Michigan men have been charged with  
committing old-fashioned shoplifting with a high-tech twist -- 
fencing thousands of dollars in stolen goods through the Internet 
auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore R. Armstrong, 31, and Neil A. Schultz, 30, were  
arraigned on racketeering and fraud charges Monday in Jackson 
County, in south-central Michigan. Each faces up to 20 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the pair shoplifted $40,000 in merchandise from  
Meijer discount stores in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, then sold 
about half of it on eBay to buyers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackman Township Detective Sgt. David Elwell said the buyers  
didn't know they were bidding on stolen merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Elwell said Amstrong and Schultz would go into a Meijer store  
and purchase something that comes in a large box, such as a 
wheelbarrow, remove the product and then re-enter the store with 
the empty box. They would then fill the box with fishing lures, 
digital cameras and radios, take it through the check-out aisle, 
and pay the cost of the wheelbarrow again, Elwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerks never noticed a difference in the weight, Elwell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong and Schultz were arrested after Meijer employees in  
Blackman Township saw them filling a box with about $4,000 in 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, said the company was  
cooperating with investigators. He could not say whether Armstrong 
and Schultz still had listings on the site.

	DALLAS (AP) -- The family of the first baby born to Kosovo  
refugees brought to the United States might soon have steady 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	Naim Karaliju, 28, father of baby Amerikan, had complained that  
the family faced a destitute life because of unfulfilled promises 
of aid. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Karaliju is being considered for a job loading and  
unloading trucks at a United Parcel Service center in Dallas, 
company spokeswoman Peggy Gardner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is in the interview process with us,'' she said. ``He has  
to meet the qualifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amerikan was born in May, days after his mother, Lebibe  
Karaliju, arrived at Fort Dix, N.J., on a refugee flight from 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Marie Weiss, one of a group of volunteers helping the  
family, said Karaliju is thrilled by the prospect of working at 
UPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great job,'' she said. ``He's very grateful.''  
</P>
<P>
	She said it has been difficult for refugees living in Dallas to  
find work because they have no transportation and speak limited 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee advocates also claimed that Refugee Services of North  
Texas, which gets federal funding, failed to provide the family 
with adequate housing, furniture, food and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Corcoran, the executive director of Refugee Services, has  
said his agency has provided the family with quality housing and 
helped 11 of the 24 refugees in the extended Karaliju family get 
jobs.

<HEADLINE> 9 States Get $55M for Power Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton offered $55 million Tuesday to  
help low-income people in nine states pay their electricity bills 
or buy cooling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the money would help encourage older people to  
run air conditioners during the withering heat wave without fear of 
high utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by Mayor Richard Daley, the president greeted workers  
from the Chicago Housing Authority and other municipal agencies, 
many of whom went door-to-door in the city's high-rise apartment 
buildings to check on elderly people and get them to cooling 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here mostly to just say thank you,'' Clinton told about  
200 people gathered in a gymnasium at a local park. ``You've done a 
great job, and I am profoundly grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois had the highest number of heat-related deaths, with  
officials reporting 119 deaths since July 19. Missouri has reported 
51 deaths. Both states received a share of the money Clinton 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it will be enough,'' Clinton said. ``We probably  
haven't seen the last of the heat for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he knew many victims of the ``blast-furnace heat'' were  
older people who sat at home with their fans or air conditioners 
off, worried that they couldn't pay their electric bills with their 
fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the elderly to take advantage of the money being  
offered under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, either 
by seeking help with their utility bills or accepting free fans and 
window-unit air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Send for something to keep you alive,'' Clinton said. ``People  
should never have to worry in this country about risking their 
lives because they can't pay their power bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the LIHEAP grants Clinton announced Tuesday, Illinois will  
get $15.9 million, Kentucky $7.7 million, Missouri $7.6 million, 
Indiana $7.1 million, Wisconsin $4.4 million, Iowa $3.4 million, 
Kansas $3.3 million, Minnesota $3 million and Nebraska $2.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler temperatures brought some relief Monday to the scorching  
heat that has struck much of the Midwest and East, but the death 
toll kept rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide death toll attributed to the heat since July 19  
was 256 Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Supporting High Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a show of support for the nation's high  
technology industry, Senate Republicans urged President Clinton to 
sign legislation that would extend the research and development tax 
credit for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Tuesday news conference, they also boasted of having pushed  
through the Senate six bills that would help high technology firms 
and said they are working on more than a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember what we're dealing with, Mr. President,'' said Sen.  
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate GOP's informal high 
technology task force. ``We're dealing with investment in R&AMP;D in 
the part of this economy that is the most vibrant and that is 
making the greatest contributions to our productivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of the economy in this country is going to be so  
tremendously and positively impacted by what's happening in this 
high-tech area,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference, attended by about 10 other Republican  
senators, underlined the partisan competition over courting Silicon 
Valley. The industry is one of the fastest growing sources of 
political campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators' plea to Clinton to extend the research tax credit  
is virtually certain to be ignored for now because it is part of 
the GOP's 10-year, $792 billion tax-cutting package that Clinton 
has promised to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But the credit has been renewed repeatedly over the years and is  
considered likely to be extended again in a year-end tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In their own tax package that the Senate rejected last week,  
Democrats also proposed renewing the credit for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders want the credit extended permanently. The  
Senate limited its renewal to a decade because of budget rules 
prohibiting measures that cost the Treasury money beyond 10 years 
into the future.

<HEADLINE>  High Jumper Flunks Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A physician from the Cuban delegation  
traveled to Montreal on Tuesday to examine the urine samples of an 
athlete whose initial test came up positive at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While rumors swirled that the athlete is four-time Pan Ams high  
jump champion and world record-holder Javier Sotomayor, Dr. Rodrigo 
Alvarez Cambra journeyed to the testing facility in Montreal, 
sources close to the Cuban team told The Associated Press. The 
sources, who asked not to be identified, would not say if Sotomayor 
is the athlete -- or if it is even a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the sources emphasized, a key medical officer of the  
delegation would not be sent on such an assignment if the drug test 
did not involve a leading Cuban athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing that Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican  
Republic, winner of the women's high jump, was stripped of her 
medal for failing a drug test, organizers also said another 
athlete's A test had come back positive. But no action will be 
taken and the name will not be released unless the B sample turns 
out to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about Sotomayor failing a drug test, Pan  
American Sports Organization president Mario Vasquez Rana refused 
to speak specifically and would say only that the positive A test 
``could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams organizers said Arrendel tested positive for the banned  
anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same substance that caused Ben 
Johnson to be stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at the 
1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel was quoted in the Dominican Republic as denying she  
used stanozolol and said the test may have picked up a decongestant 
she used before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six years in athletics, I have never used substances to  
enhance my performance,'' she said in remarks published Tuesday in 
the newspaper La Informacion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams officials also said Ray Martinez, a baseball player from  
Mexico, refused to take a drug test Monday after his team's loss to 
Canada in the bronze medal game. That was tantamount to a positive 
test, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel's It was the second drug case announced at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	If Mexico had won the game, it would have been stripped of the  
bronze medal, Vasquez Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not take him as he were dirty or cheating,'' Vasquez Rana  
said. ``He was just punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 4 inches and  
had been the Dominican Republic's only gold medalist at the games 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's Solange Witteveen, the runner-up, gets the gold. The  
silver goes to Brazil's Luciane Dambacher and the bronze to 
Canada's Nicole Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first drug case of the games, Steve Vezina, goalkeeper  
for the Canadian in-line roller hockey team that beat the United 
States 7-6 in the title game, tested positive for stimulants and 
steroids. Canada was stripped of the gold, which was awarded to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record holder, won the high jump on the  
last day of the track and field competition. But neither Vasquez 
Rana nor the medical director of the games, Eduardo de Rose, would 
confirm that the positive A test came from the last day of that 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if that test came from the final day, de Rose  
said, ``I don't want to answer your question. I have the right to 
no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez Rana said all the track and field testing had been  
completed and ``we have no positive results officially unless we 
count that from the Dominican Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, talking about the A sample, Vasquez Rana said, ``There is  
a positive A that could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Rose did say that he ``never had an experience to see a B  
(test) not confirm an A.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Compromising on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are heading toward a  
tax cut compromise that grants more than $100 billion in relief 
from the marriage penalty over the next decade and eliminates 
estate taxes, according to GOP sources familiar with the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
negotiators appear unlikely to approve any reduction in the 
corporate capital-gains tax. But they are hoping to leave room in 
their $792 billion measure for a reduction in the capital-gains tax 
rate for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials provided no precise details, and cautioned that  
these tentative decisions could change. They spoke as senior 
Republican lawmakers continued marathon negotiating sessions in a 
room on the Capitol's first floor. The group met until after 1 
a.m., picked up again at midmorning and hope to finish their work 
by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager for a veto showdown with President Clinton, Republicans  
intend to pass the resulting measure through the House and Senate 
by week's end. The legislation wouldn't be sent to the White House 
until Congress returns to the Capitol from its long August break, 
and in the meantime, rank-and-file Republicans would spend their 
break preaching the virtue of tax cuts in appearances around their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	At his weekly news conference with reporters, House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said, ``We do not give up on the 
possibility that he (Clinton) will sign (tax cuts) but if he vetoes 
them we think he'll find he's disappointed the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, he added, ``is a man who will disappoint everyone in  
his life except his pollster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the GOP tax cut is too large and would shortchange  
Social Security, Medicare and other programs. They also say that 
because it is based on anticipated budget surpluses, it could 
threaten the nation's economy if those surpluses fail to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative, Democrats propose a smaller tax cut, and  
putting more money aside for Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	On the marriage penalty, officials said negotiators were headed  
toward adoption of a provision patterned after the one contained in 
the Senate-passed bill. Like the House bill, it would slowly raise 
the standard deduction for couples until it was double that of the 
limit set for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, though, it would allow couples to file single  
returns on a combined form, a step that would allow many to lower 
their taxes. The estimated cost of this provision alone was $112 
billion over 10 years as it cleared the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	On capital-gains taxes, the House included a cut in the  
corporate rate, but the Senate did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also approved a cut in the personal capital-gains tax  
rate, but the Senate proposed only excluding the first $1,000 of 
gain from the tax. Officials said the House approach was the 
preferred one among negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure proposed phasing out the estate tax after  
2008. There was no word on the schedule that negotiators were 
likely to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no reported decision on how to craft the centerpiece  
of the measure, broad-based tax relief, either through 
across-the-board rate reductions, as the House passed, or by 
cutting the lowest tax rate and widening the bracket, as the Senate 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal-making moved on a track parallel to the political  
struggle, as each side sought to emphasize the divisions in 
Congress over how best to use projected federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President ... please reconsider your staunch opposition to  
giving the people their money back,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Monday at a 
brief, ceremonial meeting of House and Senate negotiators on the 
tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please resist the temptation to spend this budget surplus on  
more government programs. We don't need full-time government and 
part-time families, we need part-time government and full-time 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That drew a polite retort from Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,  
D-N.Y., who asked Archer whether he favored a ``part-time Marine 
Corps or a part-time Federal Bureau of Investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The projections of federal surpluses are ``deceptive,'' Moynihan  
said. If Republicans insist on their course, ``we will see a large 
and unanticipated decrease in government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer and Moynihan articulated opposing views at a brief  
evening meeting of members of the House and Senate who were 
formally appointed to negotiate a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The session was purely ceremonial. The real work had already  
begun behind closed doors, and it involved only Republicans.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rear Adm. Hugh Balfour, who helped modernize  
Britain's Royal Navy, was the captain of a destroyer in the 
Falkland Islands War and later commanded Oman's navy, died June 29 
of cancer. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 39-year navy career, Balfour also pushed for the  
introduction of satellite-based communications for ships after 
being made chief naval signal officer in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Malta, Balfour followed his father into the navy in  
1951. He qualified as a signal officer in 1959, and commanded ships 
from the royal yacht Britannia to destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	As captain of the frigate HMS Phoebe in 1977, Balfour commanded  
a small, but modern, fleet of ships that went to the Falkland 
Islands and succeeded -- at least temporarily -- in deterring 
Argentina from grabbing the disputed colony in the south Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	When Argentina invaded the Falklands on April 2, 1982, Balfour  
commanded the guided-missile destroyer HMS Exeter, which played a 
key role in air defense of the island landings. 
</P>
<P>
	HMS Exeter was Balfour's final sea command. After a stint as  
director of the Maritime Tactical School, he went to Oman in 1985 
to command the Sultan's navy. 
</P>
<P>
	He commanded the Omani navy, which dominated the Strait of  
Hormuz, an important oil passageway, during the Iran-Iraq war. In 
1990 he turned command of the Sultan's Navy over to His Highness 
Sayyid Shihab, a milestone in the British Royal Navy's involvement 
in the region, which had begun in 1853.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Gawthrop  
III, whose rulings included a key decision involving AIDS victims, 
died Sunday after a long battle with cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 trial, Gawthrop heard the case of a law firm accused  
of firing a young associate with AIDS. Although the case ended in a 
settlement, Gawthrop wrote the first opinion that people who show 
no symptoms of AIDS can still be considered disabled under the 
Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other notable cases in his court were the 1996 sentencing  
of five police officers who pleaded guilty in a corruption scandal; 
the 1996 racketeering and bribery trial of former Rep. Joseph 
McDade, R-Pa.; and the lawsuit brought by parents against the 
Chester-Upland School District, in which he appointed a special 
master to implement education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gawthrop also was known outside of court for performing in all  
14 Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, both regionally and with 
companies in England. He played the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of 
Penzance'' with the D'Oyly Carte Company.

	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Willie Morris, one of Mississippi's most  
treasured writers who wrote stories based on his life in the Delta, 
died Monday night of a heart attack. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who developed what he called a ``good ole boy' love for  
the South, grew up in Yazoo City, the small town that would become 
the focal point for many of his stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris had more than a dozen books to his credit. Among his  
works are ``North Toward Home'' (1967), and ``Terrains of the Heart 
and Other Essays on Home,'' (1981). 
</P>
<P>
	His latest published book was ``The Ghosts of Medgar Evers,'' a  
1998 work about the history of the production of the 1996 film 
``Ghosts of Mississippi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris became associate editor of Harper's Magazine in 1963, and  
in 1967, became the youngest editor-in-chief of Harper's, the 
nation's oldest magazine. He left Harper's in 1971, and stayed in 
the New York area until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Mississippi, serving as writer-in-residence at  
the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he wrote ``The 
Courting of Marcus Dupree'' (1983), based on a standout football 
player. 
</P>
<P>

	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Gen. Sunthorn Kompongsong, a  
chain-smoking general who led a coup in 1991 that toppled 
Thailand's civilian government, ushering in the country's last 
period of military rule, died of lung cancer Monday. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloodless takeover led by Sunthorn and other senior officers  
ended a year later, shortly after troops gunned down some 50 
pro-democracy demonstrators in the streets of Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunthorn had since lived in obscurity. Like other figures behind  
the so-called National Peacekeeping Council that embodied the coup, 
he went unpunished for deposing Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan 
and for his alleged role in the massacre known as Bloody May. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover in 1991 was the last in a score of coups or  
attempted coups since Thailand ended absolute monarchy in 1932. The 
target was the four-year-old government led by Chatichai, which was 
notorious for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Pledging to clean up politics, the generals set up the National  
Peacekeeping Council with Sunthorn, supreme armed forces commander, 
as chairman. But he was generally seen as a figurehead, with real 
power in the hands of Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, the army commander.

</P>

mid-1990s after it compiled a 117-game losing streak that spanned

<HEADLINE>  McNown Joins Bears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Cade McNown put on a red practice  
jersey and took his first snaps as a Chicago Bear today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' first-round draft pick arrived in training camp late  
Monday after ending a 10-day holdout and signing a contract that 
could be worth up to $22 million over five years, including a $6.1 
million signing bonus. He spent his first practice working with a 
group of receivers to begin learning the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we started camp a month ago or we started it today, I  
need all the preparation I can possibly get,'' he said after 
signing his new contract. ``It doesn't matter whether it's one week 
or two weeks away so the more the better. With that, I just want to 
tell you how excited I am to finally get up to camp and get 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a new offense to learn and the first preseason game  
Saturday, McNown has a lot to make up. While he won't start and 
might not even play in the first exhibition, the real season begins 
Sept. 12 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bears have made it clear they want the former UCLA  
standout as their starting quarterback -- the sooner, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. That's a decision for the coaches to make, but  
my job is to be as ready as possible to allow them to make a good 
decision,'' McNown said when asked if he'd be ready to start the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no expectations,'' he added. ``From all indications,  
they just want me to be able to step in and play, whatever that 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's confidence in McNown -- veteran Erik Kramer was cut two  
days before training camp began -- might have cost the team some 
leverage in contract negotiations. But there never was a doubt the 
deal would get done, agent Tom Condon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal could be worth up to $22 million over five years,  
Condon said. On paper, it's a seven-year contract for $15 million 
including the $6.1 signing bonus. But the last two years of the 
deal can be voided, and McNown can earn an additional $7 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last two years to void, McNown just needs to take 35  
percent of the snaps as a rookie or 45 percent of the snaps in his 
second or third year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the first three years it's realistic to believe  
that he's going to play 35 percent or 45 percent,'' Condon said. 
``If he doesn't, then there are a lot bigger problems than whether 
or not we've got extra years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other deals with voidable years, there is no  
``buyback,'' which allows the team to buy back the remaining years 
of the contract. Instead, Condon said McNown's contract contains 
``escalator clauses'' that could increase his salary in the later 
years of the deal if he meets certain performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my agent, Tom Condon, when he was satisfied, I'd be  
satisfied and so we've reached an agreement,'' McNown said. ``I'm 
very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears released quarterback Doug Nussmeier, who had been  
brought in for help during McNown's holdout. But three other 
quarterbacks remain on the roster -- Shane Matthews, Jim Miller, 
Moses Moreno. They have had 17 more practices than McNown to learn 
the team's new offense and develop a rhythm with their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown knows he's got a lot of work to do, which is why he left  
for camp right after he signed his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fired up to get to Platteville and get started on trying  
to make an impact this year,'' he said. ``Once I get up there, I'm 
just going to have to jump in wherever they are and just spend some 
time in the film room and with the coaches just kind of getting to 
where I need to be.''

<HEADLINE>  McNown Joins Bears at Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Cade McNown put on a red practice  
jersey and took his first snaps as a Chicago Bear today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' first-round draft pick arrived in training camp late  
Monday after ending a 10-day holdout and signing a contract that 
could be worth up to $22 million over five years, including a $6.1 
million signing bonus. He spent his first practice working with a 
group of receivers to begin learning the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we started camp a month ago or we started it today, I  
need all the preparation I can possibly get,'' he said after 
signing his new contract. ``It doesn't matter whether it's one week 
or two weeks away so the more the better. With that, I just want to 
tell you how excited I am to finally get up to camp and get 
started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a new offense to learn and the first preseason game  
Saturday, McNown has a lot to make up. While he won't start and 
might not even play in the first exhibition, the real season begins 
Sept. 12 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Bears have made it clear they want the former UCLA  
standout as their starting quarterback -- the sooner, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. That's a decision for the coaches to make, but  
my job is to be as ready as possible to allow them to make a good 
decision,'' McNown said when asked if he'd be ready to start the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no expectations,'' he added. ``From all indications,  
they just want me to be able to step in and play, whatever that 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's confidence in McNown -- veteran Erik Kramer was cut two  
days before training camp began -- might have cost the team some 
leverage in contract negotiations. But there never was a doubt the 
deal would get done, agent Tom Condon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal could be worth up to $22 million over five years,  
Condon said. On paper, it's a seven-year contract for $15 million 
including the $6.1 signing bonus. But the last two years of the 
deal can be voided, and McNown can earn an additional $7 million in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last two years to void, McNown just needs to take 35  
percent of the snaps as a rookie or 45 percent of the snaps in his 
second or third year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the first three years it's realistic to believe  
that he's going to play 35 percent or 45 percent,'' Condon said. 
``If he doesn't, then there are a lot bigger problems than whether 
or not we've got extra years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other deals with voidable years, there is no  
``buyback,'' which allows the team to buy back the remaining years 
of the contract. Instead, Condon said McNown's contract contains 
``escalator clauses'' that could increase his salary in the later 
years of the deal if he meets certain performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my agent, Tom Condon, when he was satisfied, I'd be  
satisfied and so we've reached an agreement,'' McNown said. ``I'm 
very happy.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lowery Sought To Oversee Farmer Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several members of the Congressional Black  
Caucus are urging Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to nominate 
civil rights activist Joseph Lowery as the monitor to oversee the 
multimillion-dollar discrimination settlement with black farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative that the monitor exhibits a strong commitment  
to overseeing the overall responsibility of resolving problems that 
any class member may have,'' the lawmakers wrote in a letter dated 
July 29 and obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rev. Lowery has a proven track record and would lend a  
tremendous amount of credibility to this office,'' said the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery is a former associate of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  
and served as president of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, which King founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted by telephone Tuesday, Lowery said he would be  
interested in exploring the job if it were offered. ``I certainly 
want to see the farmers get justice and I want to see the 
government get justice,'' he said. ``I want to see fairness 
prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was written by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman  
James Clyburn, D-S.C., and four black lawmakers serving on the 
House Agriculture Committee -- Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.; Rep. 
Earl Hilliard, D-Ala.; Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga.; and Rep. Eva 
Clayton, D-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman asked for black lawmakers' recommendation because the  
judge wants plaintiffs' and government attorneys to refer two 
nominees each for him to consider as monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman spokeswoman Laura Trivers said the agency had no  
comment on any possible candidates. ``It is up to the judge to 
select the monitor,'' Trivers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black farmers in January reached a settlement with the  
government that is expected to cost millions of dollars. The 
farmers filed the lawsuit two years ago because they had been 
denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who has overseen the case,  
gave final approval to the deal in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, farmers with less documented evidence of  
discrimination would receive a $50,000 payment and have their 
government debts forgiven. Farmers with more evidence could opt to 
go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger damages. 
Farmers could also choose to opt out of the lawsuit and pursue 
their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A final price tag won't be known until all eligible farmers have  
been located. Plaintiffs' attorneys have estimated the settlement 
could eventually reach the billion-dollar mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also included a provision for a monitor.

<HEADLINE>  High Jumper Flunks Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A physician from the Cuban delegation  
traveled to Montreal on Tuesday to examine the urine samples of an 
athlete whose initial test came up positive at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While rumors swirled that the athlete is four-time Pan Ams high  
jump champion and world record-holder Javier Sotomayor, Dr. Rodrigo 
Alvarez Cambra journeyed to the testing facility in Montreal, 
sources close to the Cuban team told The Associated Press. The 
sources, who asked not to be identified, would not say if Sotomayor 
is the athlete -- or if it is even a Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the sources emphasized, a key medical officer of the  
delegation would not be sent on such an assignment if the drug test 
did not involve a leading Cuban athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing that Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican  
Republic, winner of the women's high jump, was stripped of her 
medal for failing a drug test, organizers also said another 
athlete's A test had come back positive. But no action will be 
taken and the name will not be released unless the B sample turns 
out to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about Sotomayor failing a drug test, Pan  
American Sports Organization president Mario Vasquez Rana refused 
to speak specifically and would say only that the positive A test 
``could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams organizers said Arrendel tested positive for the banned  
anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same substance that caused Ben 
Johnson to be stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters at the 
1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel was quoted in the Dominican Republic as denying she  
used stanozolol and said the test may have picked up a decongestant 
she used before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six years in athletics, I have never used substances to  
enhance my performance,'' she said in remarks published Tuesday in 
the newspaper La Informacion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Ams officials also said Ray Martinez, a baseball player from  
Mexico, refused to take a drug test Monday after his team's loss to 
Canada in the bronze medal game. That was tantamount to a positive 
test, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrendel's It was the second drug case announced at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	If Mexico had won the game, it would have been stripped of the  
bronze medal, Vasquez Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not take him as he were dirty or cheating,'' Vasquez Rana  
said. ``He was just punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario won the high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 4 inches and  
had been the Dominican Republic's only gold medalist at the games 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's Solange Witteveen, the runner-up, gets the gold. The  
silver goes to Brazil's Luciane Dambacher and the bronze to 
Canada's Nicole Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first drug case of the games, Steve Vezina, goalkeeper  
for the Canadian in-line roller hockey team that beat the United 
States 7-6 in the title game, tested positive for stimulants and 
steroids. Canada was stripped of the gold, which was awarded to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record holder, won the high jump on the  
last day of the track and field competition. But neither Vasquez 
Rana nor the medical director of the games, Eduardo de Rose, would 
confirm that the positive A test came from the last day of that 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically if that test came from the final day, de Rose  
said, ``I don't want to answer your question. I have the right to 
no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasquez Rana said all the track and field testing had been  
completed and ``we have no positive results officially unless we 
count that from the Dominican Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, talking about the A sample, Vasquez Rana said, ``There is  
a positive A that could belong to athletics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Rose did say that he ``never had an experience to see a B  
(test) not confirm an A.''

<HEADLINE> Son of Homeless Woman Sues L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The son of a homeless woman fatally shot  
after allegedly threatening a policeman with a screwdriver is suing 
the city and police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Mitchell's civil rights lawsuit filed Monday in federal  
court contends that his frail, mentally ill mother posed no threat 
to the officers when she was killed May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Mitchell, 54, had been pushing a shopping cart down  
trendy La Brea Avenue when two officers stopped her and asked if 
the cart was stolen. Police said the woman then thrust a 
screwdriver at one of the officers, who fell to one knee and fired 
a shot into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer was not injured. Ms. Mitchell died later at a  
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses the police department of assault, battery and  
wrongful death and claims the city was negligent in hiring the two 
officers. Named in the suit are Police Chief Bernard Parks and 
officers Edward Larrigan, 27, and Kathy Clark, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday,  
citing the pending litigation. The city attorney had not yet seen 
the lawsuit and could not comment, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Baseball Gets Silver Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- They came to the Pan American Games as  
the first professional baseball players to represent their country 
in international competition. What many of the U.S. minors leaguers 
got was a wordly experience they won't forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't trade it for anything,'' third baseman Jason  
Hardtke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drums beating and horns blaring in the stands. Fans and players  
alike singing in the seats and dugouts. And often passionate 
celebrations by players, especially the Cubans, during the course 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also the intense pressure to represent their country  
in tournament play, where one bad inning -- even one bad pitch -- 
could have sent them home. It was a flavor of baseball that most 
American players never get to sample. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike zone was lower and rules interpretations were  
different, often leading to lengthy arguments. One by Canadian 
manager Ernie Whitt held up the opener with the United States for 
30 mintutes. An irate Whitt wrote his protest long-hand on a piece 
of paper in the dugout before it was rejected by a committee 
meeting under the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardtke and a quickly assembled group of players not on 40-man  
rosters qualified their country for the 2000 Olympics by making the 
finals of the nine-team tournament. What they could not do was win 
a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just came up short,'' Hardtke said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba lost two games in the preliminaries, but then the world  
champions put aside incessant talk of defection -- one of their 
relievers did leave the team and appears headed for Miami -- and 
played like the best team there is outside the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans played with passion. And they showed their anger.  
</P>
<P>
	When a protester ran onto the field with a ``Human Right First''  
sign in the ninth inning of their tense 3-2 semifinal win over 
Canada, the Cubans responded vehemently, chasing the man around the 
field and then knocking him down so authorities could take him 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, their delegation accosted the same man on a downtown  
Winnipeg street. 
</P>
<P>
	Their emotions were flowing as well when they wrapped up a 5-1  
victory over the United States in the finals. They came to the stop 
of their dugout in the final innings, unfurling flags and dancing 
to the beat of the drums played by their fans in the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
	Count U.S. manager Buddy Bell as one who enjoyed the experience,  
despite the disappointment of not getting the gold 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of differences we had to overcome,'' Bell  
said. ``We had to put a team together in two or three weeks and 
that was a tough task. We came together as well as we could and 
maybe better than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done is extremely acceptable. I hope these guys get  
the chance to compete in the Olympics down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone predicted a United States-Cuba final, although Canada  
emerged from the tournament with the best record at 6-1, with only 
a bronze medal to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost to Canada in the opening game and then  
won five straight, beating Panama and Mexico in the 
single-elimination quarterfinals and semis before losing to a Cuban 
team the Americans beat 10-5 in the round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans, who form a reception line in front of the dugout  
after every home run, featured many of the same players who split a 
pair of exhibition games with the Baltimore Orioles earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our guys have never been under this kind of pressure. Ever. In  
that regard, I think that will go a long way toward helping their 
personal development,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have bull's-eyes on our chest because of who we are and the  
kind of baseball we play. But we were not the favored team in this 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Craig Paquette, who came to the Pan Am Games as a  
player for the Mets' Triple-A team at Norfolk, was traded during 
his stay in Winnipeg. He's now headed back to the big leagues with 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most players on the U.S. squad, he'd love to play in  
Sydney. But he'd rather be in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in the majors is how you take care of your family,''  
Paquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team that heads to Australia in September 2000 will  
likely have plenty of new faces. You can bet they'll be pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's getting more that the public wants to see the  
best athletes, amateur or professional,'' said Pat Gillick, who 
headed the committee that picked the U.S. team from an original 
pool of 270-some players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might be some point where you have both pros and  
amateurs. In this case we felt this was a qualifying tournament for 
the Olympics and we just felt we should go with all 
professionals.''

<HEADLINE> Mystics 75, Shock 70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Nikki McCray rebounded from an early  
injury to score 14 second-half points to help lead the Washington 
Mystics to a 75-70 victory over the Detroit Shock in the WNBA on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star guard dislocated her left ring finger early in the  
game, but returned for the second half to help her team stop a 
four-game losing streak. Chamique Holdsclaw led the Mystics (7-17) 
with 23 points and seven rebounds, and Murriel Page added 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Azzi led Detroit (10-13) with a season-high 22 points, but  
it wasn't enough to keep the Shock from losing their fifth 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was Washington's first trip to the Palace since its  
83-78 double-overtime victory July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics got three 3-pointers from Monica Maxwell to take a  
41-35 lead into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit tied the game at 45 on Val Whiting's free throw with  
15:19 left, but Washington stalled the Shock's comeback by scoring 
the next four points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics maintained a lead between two and six points, as the  
Shock could not get the defensive stops they needed to get even. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray appeared to clinch the game by scoring five straight  
points to make it 71-63 with 1:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Azzi answered with two 3-pointers, and Holdsclaw missed two  
free throws to give Detroit another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Whiting made it 73-70 when she made one of two of free  
throws with 34 seconds left, with the second one going out of 
bounds off McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Detroit a chance to tie, but Claudia Maria Das Neves  
missed two NBA-length 3-pointers.

<HEADLINE>  Braves' Perez, Cox Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Atlanta Braves catcher Eddie Perez said Tuesday  
he is upset and disappointed with a four-game suspension and $1,000 
fine for his role in a brawl with Philadelphia and will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox drew a two-game suspension, but won't appeal  
and will sit out games in Pittsburgh on Wednesday and Thursday. Pat 
Corrales will manage in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to sit sometime, I might as well sit here,''  
Cox said. ``What are you going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox clearly was unhappy with the suspension, saying he returned  
to the field only to ``restore the peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, taking a verbal jab at Mets manager Bobby Valentine, said,  
``I don't think it's the same thing as coming back and sitting on 
the bench in disguise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, who was ejected for the eighth time this season, also was  
fined $5,000. Perez was fined $1,000. Braves pitcher John Smoltz, 
who also was ejected, was fined $2,500 but was not suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 0-for-1 with two walks in a 7-1 loss Tuesday at  
Pittsburgh, was especially upset that no Phillies were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody (from the Phillies) gets fined or suspended,'' he said.  
``That's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight began after Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd hit Perez in  
third inning Friday night, the second time in less than a week that 
Byrd hit his former teammate with a pitch. Byrd leads the majors 
with 13 hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The following inning, the pair exchanged words when Byrd came to  
the plate and Perez threw a punch, setting off a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox had been ejected the previous inning for arguing a  
double-play call and was suspended for returning to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was ejected by plate umpire Jerry Meals in the fourth  
after hitting Alex Arias with a pitch. However, Smoltz was not 
suspended, apparently after arguing he should have been warned 
first by Meals.

fined $5,000. Perez was fined $1,000. Braves pitcher John Smoltz, 
who also was ejected, was fined $2,500 but was not suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 0-for-1 with two walks in a 7-1 loss Tuesday at  
Pittsburgh, was especially upset that no Phillies were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody (from the Phillies) gets fined or suspended,'' he said.  
``That's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight began after Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd hit Perez in  
third inning Friday night, the second time in less than a week that 
Byrd hit his former teammate with a pitch. Byrd leads the majors 
with 13 hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The following inning, the pair exchanged words when Byrd came to  
the plate and Perez threw a punch, setting off a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox had been ejected the previous inning for arguing a  
double-play call and was suspended for returning to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was ejected by plate umpire Jerry Meals in the fourth  
after hitting Alex Arias with a pitch. However, Smoltz was not 
suspended, apparently after arguing he should have been warned 
first by Meals.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pilots at the French airline AOM returned to work  
Tuesday, ending a four-day strike that left thousands of tourists 
stranded in France, the Caribbean and several Pacific locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Marc Jamaillac, managing director of AOM, or Air Outre Mer,  
said on French radio that the strike had been suspended but 
provided no details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	AOM pilots walked off the job Friday to support their demands  
for higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline canceled all but one of its long-distance flights  
and 30 percent of its medium-range flights Monday, including those 
on domestic and European routes. Some charter flights also were 
scrapped.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Soar on Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures soared early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after the government sharply lowered 
crop conditions in major growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ignored forecasts for beneficial showers to fall in  
the next 10 days over major growing areas as they digested the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's weekly crop update, which showed 
conditions worsened in Illinois and Indiana in the past week under 
hot, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops in Ohio and eastern states also were suffering under  
severe drought conditions. The unexpected turn in weather during a 
growing season that has generally been beneficial to crop 
development now has analysts revising downward their fall 
production figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated after the government reported an  
improvement in spring wheat conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3/4 cents to $2.98 a bushel;  
December corn rose 7 1/2 cents to $2.34 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 
cent to $1.19 a bushel; November soybeans rose 13 3/4 cents to $4.77 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Cops Questioned on DuBose's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Civil rights activists on Monday questioned  
whether the fatal police shooting of former NFL linebacker 
Demetrius DuBose was racially motivated, saying witness statements 
indicated the black athlete may have been shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not think the gentleman did anything to provoke the  
shooting,'' said H.J. Sims of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicting accounts of the July 24 killing have prompted the  
family of the 28-year-old DuBose, who played for the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, to request an autopsy independent of the police probe 
and to hire an attorney to conduct a private investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego police Chief David Bejarano said he welcomes outside  
input and expects an internal investigation to be completed within 
two weeks. Results, which will include toxicology results, will be 
turned over to the district attorney's office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2-inch DuBose was shot several times by police  
officers after he allegedly charged at officers with nunchakus, a 
martial arts weapon that he took away from an officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers, who were investigating a burglary call in  
predominantly white Mission Beach, claim DuBose resisted officers' 
attempts to question him and appeared to be under the influence of 
alcohol or other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But preliminary findings of the family's investigation show  
DuBose was initially calm and cooperated with officers until they 
began to ``intimidate and harass'' him, likely because he was 
black, Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the police first arrived the gentleman was patient for  
about five to 10 minutes,'' Sims said. ``It was only after they 
tried to place him in handcuffs that the unprofessionalism of 
police allowed the situation to escalate and prompted the gentleman 
to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shooting, DuBose had played volleyball and drank  
beer, ``but beer and volleyball are kind of like peanut butter and 
jelly,'' Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego City Councilmen George Stevens and Byron Wear are also  
calling for a thorough investigation into the shooting to allay any 
concerns that it was unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens noted some people have said DuBose was bending over when  
the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others have said he was turning away. I would hope the autopsy  
would show where the first shot entered,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officers who shot DuBose have been removed from field  
work pending the investigation. Their names have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose had been arrested three times in the past year.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest was June 14, when California Highway Patrol officers  
found DuBose ``very dazed, very confused'' in his car parked on the 
side of a highway near Mammoth Lakes, said Mono County prosecutor 
Tim Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting field sobriety tests and observing ``white  
powdery substance dripping from his nose,'' officers determined he 
was under the influence of PCP, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose became increasingly agitated as the investigation went  
on, but officers were able to get him handcuffed, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose also was reportedly under the influence of an unknown  
drug Feb. 3, when he allegedly forced his way into a Mammoth Lakes 
restaurant after being denied entrance several times, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, DuBose, who played at Notre Dame, was arrested  
in South Bend, Ind., after he became belligerent at a nightclub. 
When an off-duty police officer ordered him to leave, DuBose 
allegedly grabbed a pipe from an overhead sprinkler system -- 
flooding the club with some 1,600 gallons of water.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Tires of Stats, Milestones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire is tiring of stats and milestones,  
but a big one is coming up. He's just two homers from the 500 home 
run club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fascination with numbers started when rotisserie baseball  
became big probably 10 years ago,'' McGwire said. ``There's stats 
coming out of the woodwork that nobody ever knew about that I think 
sometimes blow things way out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has set a few of those lately, such as most homers over  
a four- and five-year period. Last month he broke Joe Adcock's NL 
record with 16 homers in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hit 221 homers since 1996 and 259 since 1995, both records,  
naturally. He's second on the career list for homers by a first 
baseman with 483, 10 behind Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost assuredly will break Babe Ruth's record of reaching  
500 in the fewest at-bats, since he's at 5,478 and Ruth needed 
5,801. 
</P>
<P>
	His reaction? Statistics are for geeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only stats you look at with power hitters are driving in  
runs and hitting home runs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire entered Tuesday night's game in a sprint for 500, having  
hit 14 homers in 18 games, including No. 498 against San Diego on 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acts as if there's no special incentive, even though only  
15 players have reached 500, and all are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to feel,'' he said. ``It's going to happen one  
day. I don't know when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He feels the same way about Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 hits,  
which is being played out in front of him the next three days. 
Gwynn got his 2,995th hit, a two-run single in the ninth inning, in 
the Cardinals' 6-5 victory Monday, but McGwire said he and Gwynn 
didn't discuss their parallel chases at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much is there to talk about?'' McGwire said. ``There's no  
reason to talk about 500 until you get there and there's no reason 
to talk about 3,000 until he gets to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a level you reach. People have done it before, so  
it's just a milestone he's going to reach. What day, what hour, 
what minute, it's just a matter of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way McGwire is going, he'll get to 500 very soon. After a  
slow start, he was only four homers off his record 70-homer pace of 
last year and chances for him reaching his milestone before Gwynn 
appeared good. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cardinals began a seven-game homestand Friday, McGwire  
needed six homers and Gwynn needed nine hits, and McGwire said he 
basically had no chance of getting there first. Evidence to the 
contrary, he's sticking to that prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting hits is a little bit easier than hitting home runs,  
believe me,'' McGwire said. ``But you guys write it like it's easy. 
I think people take me for granted because I hit them in such 
streaks. They don't realize how tough it is.''

<HEADLINE> KLM Profit Slides 64 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Profits at the Dutch flag carrier  
KLM tumbled 64 percent in its first fiscal quarter, excluding a 
one-time gain, a decline the company blamed on an overall slowdown 
in the global airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the one-time gain of $433.8 million on the sale of its  
stake in Galileo International, a global airline ticketing company, 
KLM earned $37.2 million compared to $102.4 million in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dropped slightly to $1.6 billion from $1.7 billion a year  
earlier. Earnings per share fell to 59 cents from $1.38. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competitive conditions and excess capacity within the airline  
industry rather than the global macro-economic environment are the 
drivers of the current situation,'' KLM said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amsterdam-based airline, which has alliances with Northwest  
and Alitalia of Italy, said that the current airline market is 
``more difficult'' than it has been in a long time and added that 
excess capacity, especially on North Atlantic routes, was 
continually pressuring profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM's shares fell 2.6 percent on the Amsterdam stock exchange  
following the news. Traders already had offloaded KLM shares after 
an internal memo on an Internet website leaked part of the results 
last week.

<HEADLINE> Boston To Join Cardinals Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Newly signed rookie receiver David  
Boston will join Arizona Cardinals training camp Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston held out for four days and inked a four year, $7 million  
deal with the club. His sister and agent, Dallas attorney Alicia 
Boston, said Monday that the Cardinals compromised on length -- four 
instead of five years -- while David compromised on the ``bells and 
whistles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston received a $3.8 million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish it would have happened earlier. It'll be a set of fresh  
legs to run seam routes down the middle. He's going to be a key 
part of the offense,'' Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask Randy Moss what kind of impact (a rookie) can have,''  
wide receiver Frank Sanders said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While nobody is realistically comparing Boston to Moss -- Cards  
coach Vince Tobin rolled his eyes when asked how Boston compared 
with the Vikings rookie of the year from 1998 -- all involved see 
the potential for Boston to be a game-breaking threat who can 
stretch the field for quarterback Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Mark Trestman said Boston will serve as a  
backup to Rob Moore, who is still holding out of camp and will 
function in a different role when the team introduces 
three-receiver sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is to see how all three of us can function  
on the field together,'' Sanders said. ``For David, the sky is the 
limit. He has the potential to do it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston missed most of the team's June rookie camp in Tempe with  
a shoulder injury, so he already was behind the rest of the team in 
terms of learning the offense. He also has missed nine practices in 
an abbreviated training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to have David in here, no question,'' Tobin said.  
``We expect him to make a big contribution. In order for him to do 
that, he's got to get to camp and learn the system and get reps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Trestman: ``He's basically starting from scratch. But he's  
a smart kid and a fast learner. I don't anticipate it will take him 
very long to get into the swing of things.''

<HEADLINE> Tips for Proper Use of Sunscreen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cancer experts' advice on staying safe in the sun:  

</P>
<P>
	--Avoid sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., its most intense hours.  
</P>
<P>
	--Wear sunscreen with a sun-protection factor of at least 15.  
</P>
<P>
	--Choose sunscreens that protect against both UVA and UVB  
radiation. Check the labels on sunscreens and pick the ones that 
contain at least one of these ingredients: benzophenone, 
oxybenzone, sulisobenzone, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or 
avobenzone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Apply sunscreen generously at least 20 minutes before any  
outdoor physical activity. Sweating reduces the effectiveness of 
sunscreens so reapply often. Always reapply after swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	--At the beach or playground, try to stay in the shade. Sit under  
an umbrella or tree. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cover skin in tightly woven, loose-fitting, light-colored  
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wear sunglasses that protect from ultraviolet radiation. Such  
glasses carry a UVB or UVA sticker. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wear wide-brimmed hats to protect the face, ears and neck,  
which burn most often. 
</P>
<P>
	--Take special care protecting children, keeping children under  
the age of one out of the sun.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesian Elections Declared Legit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Frustrated by drawn out political  
infighting, Indonesia's president today declared the results of a 
historic June 7 parliamentary election legitimate after feuding 
electoral officials failed to release them. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie made the announcement at the State Palace  
where officials from 23 parties and senior Cabinet ministers had 
gathered for talks on constitutional and legislative reform. He 
will sign a formal decree Wednesday, said Information Minister 
Yunus Yosfiah. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday today Indonesia's General Election Commission had  
still not released the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Habibie's statement, commission chairman Rudini, a  
retired army general who uses only one name, told reporters his 
organization must endorse the figures before they can be declared 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The final figures are expected to closely mirror previously  
released unofficial tallies that gave Megawati Sukarnoputri's 
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle a clear lead with 34 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Golkar Party, which underpinned Suharto's reign and  
now backs his onetime protege, Habibie, came in second in the 
unofficial counts with 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I declare the results of the June elections are legitimate,''  
Habibie said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been nearly two months since Indonesians voted in the  
elections, regarded as crucial to the Southeast Asian nation's 
democratization and the selection of a new head of state after 
decades of authoritarian rule under ex-President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Vote counting ended July 26 after weeks of bureaucratic bungling  
and painfully slow procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's major parties and independent observers accepted the  
results as valid. However, they were blocked after a group of small 
parties claimed the election had been unfair and refused to sign 
off on the tally. 
</P>
<P>
	An election watchdog committee later threw out 100,000  
allegations of irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie intervened in the dispute after pleading several times  
with electoral officials to bury their differences and release the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who wants a second term, called on Indonesians to  
focus now on the selection of a head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected lawmakers, military appointees and regional and  
interest group representatives are to form a special 700-member 
assembly to select a president in November.

<HEADLINE> Six Buckeye Recruits Ineligible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Three members of Ohio State's acclaimed  
football recruiting class have been turned away by the school's 
admissions office because of academic deficiencies and the NCAA has 
declared three others ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	That eliminates a quarter of the 24 recruits who were supposed  
to report on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time since I've been at Ohio State that I  
think we've had outright denials by admissions,'' athletics 
director Andy Geiger said from the Big Ten football meetings in 
Chicago. Geiger has been at Ohio State since April 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State coach John Cooper declined to comment to reporters in  
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's admissions office refused the applications of  
defensive back Ziyier Walker of Fork Union (Va.) Academy, running 
back Richard Hall of Wyoming, Ohio, and receiver Maurice Harris of 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``The burden of proof is on the recruiters and on the athletic  
department to present candidates that can qualify for admission,'' 
Geiger said. ``In every situation there are gatekeepers and in this 
case the gatekeepers felt that these young people would have 
problems doing the work at Ohio State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Bryce Bishop of Miami -- perhaps the most  
touted of the incoming freshmen -- was expected to compete for 
playing time immediately, particularly after two-time All-American 
offensive lineman Rob Murphy flunked out of school this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bishop, defensive back Curtis Crosby of Columbus' Eastmoor  
High School and receiver Maurice Lee of Cleveland South all were 
turned down by the NCAA's clearinghouse that determines freshman 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if any of the six could be available to play this fall,  
Geiger said, ``I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of the six players is the latest in a series of  
academic problems for Ohio State football players. 
</P>
<P>
	Three starters -- linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, defensive back  
Damon Moore and Murphy -- had to pass second-term summer-school 
classes in order to be eligible last season. Two other players who 
were expected to be top substitutes, linebacker Chris Kirk and 
defensive tackle Paris Long, also encountered academic problems, 
although Kirk later returned to the team and both are set to play 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was suspended from the team prior to spring practice  
because of his grades. He was dismissed from Ohio State in June 
because of continuing academic shortcomings and later signed to 
play with the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger said those problems aren't connected to the current ones.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't think you should read those problems into it,'' he  
said. ``Each case is treated individually and I don't think that 
there's a change in policy because of that. I don't think it's 
relative to anything else other than the individuals involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer told reporters he was taking classes in music, AIDS  
awareness and golf in order to become eligible last summer. Several 
national publications poked fun at his course load and chided Ohio 
State for the classwork required of football players. 
</P>
<P>
	But Geiger said admission standards have not been tightened in  
response.

<HEADLINE> House Acts on Small Business Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved two bills Monday aimed at  
improving Small Business Administration loan programs for 
businesses unable to secure financing through normal channels. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the bills increases the maximum loans under the SBA's  
Loan Guaranty Program from $750,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also increase the guarantee percentage on loans  
of $150,000 or less from 75 percent to 80 percent. The 80 percent 
guarantee currently applies only to loans of $100,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	The second bill expands the SBA's program helping small  
businesses with long-term loans for major fixed assets such as land 
or buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	It increases the maximum regular loan from $750,000 to $1  
million and public policy loans from $1 million to $1.3 million. It 
makes businesses owned by women eligible for the policy loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills, passed by voice, require Senate consideration.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 2614 and H.R. 2615.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Complains About Long Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- His eyes were bleary after a long  
flight to Australia, and Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe 
was clearly unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should be made to have to fly 17 hours and play a  
football game,'' Sharpe said after the team arrived in Sydney for 
an exhibition game Friday against the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry, Mr. Tagliabue,'' he said, referring to commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue. ``You need to address this in our upcoming 
meetings. This is utterly ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos left Denver late Sunday after a 45-minute delay when  
newly signed offensive lineman Scott Adams realized he had left his 
passport in his rental car at the Broncos training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	An Arapahoe County sheriff's official had to break into the car  
and rush the document back to the airport, but the team left 44 
minutes late on the 2 1/2-hour flight to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came a 14 1/2-hour flight to Sydney. The team essentially  
missed Monday because of the time difference, arriving at their 
hotel this morning. Less than 90 minutes later, they were back on 
the bus and headed to a field for their first of four days of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough, it's tough,'' running back Terrell Davis said  
after a light workout later in the day. ``I feel like I just woke 
up. My body is not ready to come out here and run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``I think by tomorrow we'll be OK.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe wasn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the compressed schedule left no time for sightseeing and  
museum-going. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Broncos coach) Mike (Shanahan) was trying to make this as  
enjoyable as possible, but there is very little enjoyment you get 
out of a situation like this. Trust me, I've tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Broncos had their first full practice in pads.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Host Turkish Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet here next month  
with the Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, the White House 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit will visit Sept. 28 follows a trip to Turkey last month  
by Defense Secretary William Cohen. Like that visit, Ecevit's 
meeting will include a discussion of Turkey's longstanding dispute 
with Greece over the island of Cyprus, National Security Council 
spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resolving Cyprus is a key priority for the administration,''  
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is encouraged by both sides' willingness to  
hold negotiations this fall, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an Athens-backed coup on the  
island by supporters of union with Greece. Turkish troops are still 
stationed in a Turkish-Cypriot enclave on the island.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects $11 Billion Farm Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Tuesday rejected a  
Democrat-backed $11 billion bailout of the farm economy in favor of 
a smaller Republican package. But lawmakers said they hoped to work 
out a bipartisan compromise later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's bipartisan recognition that there's a disaster out  
there,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate defeated the Democratic plan  
54-44 after Democrats narrowly failed, 51-47, to kill the $7 
billion GOP emergency farm package. 
</P>
<P>
	A final vote on the Republican plan was then put off while  
Democrats and Republicans tried to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides had reason to work out a deal before lawmakers leave  
for a month-long recess. Democrats don't want to be held 
responsible for killing an aid package, and farm-state Republicans 
worry that conservatives may desert the GOP plan. It's also 
possible for a senator to block the aid on procedural grounds 
because it would exceed annual spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers ``are telling their senators that they want action, they  
want votes, some indication that something will happen,'' said 
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, one of the Republicans negotiating with 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., offered a $7.75 billion  
proposal containing disaster assistance not in the original 
Republican plan. Democrats said the GOP package wouldn't help many 
of the farmers who need it most, including drought-stricken growers 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore endorsed the $11 billion Democratic  
proposal earlier Tuesday, even as the Clinton administration was 
officially dodging the question of how much it thinks is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declined to tell the Senate  
Agriculture Committee how much help he thinks farmers need. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be in a position of saying you have to spend  
'x' dollars or 'y' dollars,'' Glickman said. Pressed as to whether 
the president would veto the GOP plan, he said, ``I'm not looking 
for a fight, if that's your bottom-line question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's move rankled Republicans, who fear they would lose a  
bidding war with President Clinton. During last fall's 
congressional campaigns, Republicans proposed $4 billion in farm 
aid only to have the president veto the package and force them to 
add $2 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're competing to show compassion with other people's  
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has depressed commodity prices low for  
the second year in a row, and USDA projects that net farm income 
will dip to $43.8 billion this year, about 4 percent below the 
inflation-adjusted average for the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drought has parched crops from New York to Virginia.  
Although the drought isn't likely to push commodity prices up, it 
has galvanized support for farm assistance among East Coast 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen this before and it shouldn't surprise us. Whenever  
commodity prices fall and there's a certain amount of dislocation 
among some producers, then there's going to be a political 
response,'' said Kevin Kliesen, an economist with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers themselves have mixed opinions about what Congress  
should do. While there's widespread support for some kind of 
assistance, there's disagreement about the best way to deliver the 
aid or how much growers need. And there is concern that some 
growers will use the cash to bid up farm rents to expand their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	And some farmers ``don't want any payment at all for fear of  
what it may do. Others need it right now,'' said Edward 
Wiederstein, a grain and hog producer who is president of the Iowa 
Farm Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Makers Lose Money Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- American satellite manufacturers are losing  
millions of dollars in sales and finding it tough to do business 
even with ally nations as a result of tighter export controls 
imposed in the wake of souring U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
	American companies have lost about $500 million so far, and  
could lose as much as $8 billion over the next five years if the 
government bans commercial satellite sales to China, according to 
the Washington-based Satellite Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials complain the crackdown on technology exports  
is creating a licensing logjam that is making foreign companies 
hesitant to hire U.S. corporations to build new satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hysteria over the Chinese situation has painted everybody  
with the same brush,'' said Douglas Heydon, president of Ariane 
Space Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the European space consortium 
Arianespace S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of non-U.S. customers are saying it's becoming too  
difficult to deal with U.S. manufacturers and they're seriously 
considering not doing it any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the brunt of losses has been born by Hughes Electronics.  
In March, the company withdrew from a $450 million contract to 
build a mobile telephone satellite for a consortium of Asian 
countries, including China. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes withdrew, its satellite half-finished, after the State  
Department said the deal could benefit the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes is under investigation along with Loral Corp. by the  
Justice Department for allegedly helping China improve its 
ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown follows a series of damaging blows to U.S.-China  
relations, including the Hughes-Loral investigation, the Democratic 
fund-raising scandal and congressional findings that Chinese spies 
have systematically stolen American nuclear weapons technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In large measure, the industry has itself to blame for its  
problems, said U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a proponent of 
stricter controls on China trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this industry's going to lose billions of dollars in  
business with China, they can thank Hughes and Loral Corp.,'' he 
said. ``I have no doubt they made some very wrong decisions that 
put this country at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies contend they complied fully with export  
regulations, and no information was transferred that would affect 
U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown started in March, when responsibility for reviewing  
commercial satellite exports was shifted from the Commerce 
Department to the State Department's Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. The State Department is stricter and has fewer people to 
do the job. Nineteen people are responsible for reviewing some 
45,000 export applications annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes' satellite business remains strong with $4 billion in  
back orders, but the lost China business forced the company to 
report a $92 million loss in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you lose a contract, it's important,'' said Hughes  
spokesman Richard Dore. ``Obviously, you have projections and you 
want your revenue streams to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loral faces a potential $136 million loss if it can't reverse  
the suspension of a license to deliver an already completed Chinese 
telecommunications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes and Loral aren't the only companies to be affected.  
</P>
<P>
	Since March, Orbital Sciences, of Dulles, Va., hasn't been able  
to exchange technical information with its Canadian subsidiary, 
MacDonald-Detweiler, about a $160 million project to build a 
satellite for the Canadian Space Agency. The agency has hinted 
publicly it may drop Orbital for a non-U.S. company. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Ariane projects also have been slowed because American  
companies are reluctant to share information with European 
customers, Heydon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month the House passed a bill, sponsored by Rohrabacher,  
that would ease restrictions on exports to ally nations while 
keeping tough scrutiny on China. The bill has been sent to the 
Senate, where its prospects are uncertain, Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, U.S. companies are standing on the sidelines as  
China solicits bids for new communication satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors likely to pick up the slack include Germany's  
DaimlerChrysler AG, French companies Alcatel SA and Aerospatiale 
Matra SA and Japan's Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	American companies don't believe they can get licenses in time  
to meet China's deadlines, said Clay Mowry, executive director of 
the Satellite Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been told the intention (of tighter controls) was not to  
stop selling satellites to China, but to deal with national 
security issues involved in the launch,'' he said. ``We hope that's 
true. What you do is end up giving the market to other suppliers 
and not denying anyone communications ability.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Place Otis Nixon on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Outfielder Otis Nixon was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list by the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday with a sprained 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The club said Nixon was injured during Friday night's fight with  
the Philadelphia Phillies. The trouble began when Atlanta catcher 
Eddie Perez, who had been hit by a Paul Byrd pitch earlier in the 
game, punched Byrd as the Phillies right-hander entered the batters 
box. 
</P>
<P>
	By placing Nixon on the DL retroactive to Thursday, the Braves  
made room on their roster for one of two players acquired in 
Saturday's trade with the Chicago Cubs. Atlanta sent left-hander 
Micah Bowie and two minor leaguers to the Cubs for 
infielder-outfielder Jose Hernandez and pitcher Terry Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, used mainly off the bench as a late-inning defensive  
replacement and pinch runner, was hitting .188 with 18 stolen 
bases.

	Children under 5 generally are ignored by commercial television,  
said Toper Taylor, president of Toronto-based Nelvana 
Communications Inc., producer of the PBS series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisers have no desire to sell to a preschool audience,''  
Taylor said, with most Saturday morning programs aimed at 6- to 
11-year-old children. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelvana will get international sales rights and also rely on  
production partners and corporate underwriters to finance the 
three-year, $40 million project. 
</P>
<P>
	Other books to be adapted for the series are ``George Shrinks''  
by William Joyce; ``Corduroy Bear'' by Don Freeman; ``Junior 
Kroll'' by Michael and Betty Paraskevas, and ``Elliot Moose'' by 
Andrea Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the series will become part of PBS's daily  
schedule. Also joining that lineup will be ``Dragon Tales.'' The 
animated series about a brother and sister and their adventures in 
Dragon Land debuts on Sept. 6 . 
</P>
<P>
	PBS also announced a new logo intended to give public television  
a more appealing image to children. The cartoon-style design 
features a grinning child -- alternatively a boy or girl -- to be 
used during children's programs, on the network's Web site and for 
the upcoming PBS Kids Channel. The 24-hour channel debuts in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Other announcements made by PBS during the Television Critics  
Association meeting: 
</P>
<P>
	-- LookSmart, an Internet directory and search tool, will  
underwrite ``Sesame Street'' and four other programs for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Writer-director Bruce Paltrow (``St. Elsewhere'') is joining  
the new ``PBS Hollywood Television'' series, which will feature 
drama and comedy, as executive producer for the first production. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fledgling venture PBS Records will release six new albums in  
the coming months, including four accompanying upcoming PBS shows.

<HEADLINE> Two Canada Banks Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- TD Bank has agreed to buy the holding company  
that owns Canada Trust in a $5 billion deal that links two of the 
leaders of Canada's financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is part of an effort to restructure the Imasco  
consumer products and services company, which owns CT Financial 
Services, Canada trust's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is conditional on the completion of a multi-stage  
transaction involving Imasco and British American Tobacco, the 
British tobacco company that owns 42 per cent of Imasco. Under an 
agreement that had been rumored since early June, BAT will make an 
offer for all the common shares of Imasco that it does not already 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Imasco also owns Shopper's Drug Mart and Imperial Tobacco.  
</P>
<P>
	If Imasco shareholders accept BAT's offer, BAT has agreed to  
sell 100 per cent of CT Financial Services to the TD Bank Financial 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale goes through, the retail banking operations of TD  
and Canada Trust would be merged under the name TD Canada Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The transactions are conditional on various shareholder and  
regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason for the shuffle of some of Canada's  
best-known corporate assets was BAT's desire to concentrate on its 
core business in tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Market observers have predicted the British company would sell  
off Imasco's non-tobacco assets after taking it private and keep 
Imperial Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``BAT's 1997 decision to concentrate exclusively on the tobacco  
business means that their business focus is now considerably 
narrower than Imasco's,'' Imasco President Brian Levitt said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	British American Tobacco, the world's No. 2 cigarette company,  
just completed an $8.2 billion acquisition of a smaller rival, 
Rothmans International NV, in June. BAT aims to become the world's 
leading international tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Imasco deal would make BAT the biggest cigarette maker in  
Canada but won't affect its global sales volumes. BAT's results 
already include 100 percent of Imperial Tobacco's sales volumes but 
only 42 percent of Imperial's profit. By buying the additional 
shares in Imasco, BAT would benefit from an additional $160 million 
to its annual cash flow, said Denise Hart, a BAT spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	BAT makes brands including Kent and Lucky Strike. Its  
acquisition of Rothmans, the world's fourth-biggest cigarette 
producer, gives it a 16 percent share of the global cigarette 
market, just behind Philip Morris Cos., which has 17 percent.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Madonna, Henry Kissinger and Paul Newman were  
among the headliners partying at the Statue of Liberty to celebrate 
editor Tina Brown's latest publishing venture, a new glossy 
magazine called Talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticeably absent Monday night were Hillary Rodham Clinton,  
featured on the debut cover, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who made 
the revelers move their soiree from Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress Sarah Jessica Parker said she had received a glimpse of  
Talk and liked it: ``It's a smart, provocative and well-thought-out 
magazine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gala was moved to Liberty Island after plans for a Brooklyn  
Navy Yard bash were nixed by Giuliani. The mayor said the 
city-owned Navy Yard isn't suitable for private parties, but his 
critics have said he was more miffed at Mrs. Clinton's appearance 
on the magazine's cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, possibly Giuliani's rival for the U.S. Senate seat  
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, shares the 
cover with a skimpily clad Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow and a 
grinning Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown, reveling in the spotlight Monday, teasingly thanked  
the mayor for the publicity. She said Mrs. Clinton was unable to 
attend because of a prior commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk had already grabbed international headlines for its  
interview with Mrs. Clinton, in which the first lady discusses her 
marriage and her husband's infidelity. The first issue hits 
newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
	A disc jockey entertained the hundreds of celebrities,  
politicians, literary types and fashion trendsetters, who munched 
on chicken served in baskets at the foot of Lady Liberty. Fireworks 
lit the sky.

<P>
	Guests included Salman Rushdie, Lauren Bacall, Demi Moore,  
Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant, Matthew Broderick, Queen Latifah, 
Kevin Bacon, Kate Moss, Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson and Natasha

<HEADLINE>  Death Toll Rises to 257 in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAISAL, India (AP) -- Rescue workers pulled apart a mountain of  
twisted metal today to get to bodies believed trapped in the 
wreckage of two trains that collided head-on in northeastern India. 
At least 257 bodies had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 more people were thought to be inside three smashed  
train cars, and authorities believed none had survived. Officials 
had earlier feared more than 200 people were trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The stench of rotting, charred flesh rose from a field where the  
railroad cars lay. No cries for help were heard from within the 
wreckage, where arms and legs hung limply from crumpled carriages. 
The only sounds were the sobs of victims' families and the noise of 
rescuers tearing apart the tangled heap with cranes. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were asleep when the trains collided before dawn  
Monday, sending coaches spiraling over each other and hurtling 
travelers about their compartments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard an explosion and then the coach rose, as if it was an  
aircraft taking off, and then came down with a thud,'' S. Chettry, 
a cook in the pantry car, told The Indian Express newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Railway officials said one of the trains was on the wrong track  
for unknown reasons. Railway Minister Nitish Kumar said today the 
accident was caused by ``criminal negligence,'' and announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three railway signal operators working at the time of  
the accident fled the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced today it would set up a commission to  
investigate the causes of recent crashes. India's rails are plagued 
by accidents, which happen at a rate of more than one a day. 
</P>
<P>
	District Magistrate Prashant, a senior local administrator who  
uses one name, said only 22 of the recovered bodies could be 
recognized since most were badly mangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident seemed to have occurred after the driver of the  
Avadh-Assam Express from New Delhi switched to the wrong track, 
senior railroad official V.K. Aggarwal told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The train drove on for four miles before crashing head-on into  
the Brahmaputra Mail from Gauhati at Gaisal Station, a small-town 
rail stop in West Bengal state, about 310 miles north of Calcutta. 
</P>
<P>
	Both trains were traveling at about 60 mph and the impact  
sparked a fire that engulfed some coaches, burning to death some of 
the 2,500 passengers aboard the trains, officials at railway 
headquarters in Gauhati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working by the dim light of gas lamps and generator-charged  
electric bulbs, officials laid out the dead on a grassy clearing 
Monday night and draped them with white shrouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were then loaded onto trucks and taken to the nearby  
town of Siliguri. 
</P>
<P>
	Even experienced medical officers were shaken.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are used to seeing dead bodies daily, but I've never seen  
anything like this,'' said Dr. C.P. Singh on STAR television. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives swarmed local hospitals, which were overflowing with  
more than 300 injured passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two huge cranes arrived at the accident site early today and  
began separating four railroad cars. Ten other carriages that were 
thrown off the track were to be lugged away. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the deadliest train accidents in India's history.  
In 1995, 358 people were killed in a train wreck near New Delhi and 
in 1981, nearly 800 died when a cyclone blew a train off the tracks 
into a river in the northern state of Bihar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the victims of Monday's collision were army soldiers  
traveling to or from Assam, a remote state in northeastern India 
wracked by separatist insurgency and tribal warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities resumed train services in the area today after  
clearing one track.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Misses Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Curt Schilling, scheduled to start Tuesday's game  
for the Phillies against the Florida Marlins, flew home to 
Philadelphia upon learning that his pregnant wife was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	A club spokesman did not give a reason for Shonda Schilling's  
hospitalization but indicated that it was not simply to give birth. 
Mrs. Schilling is eight months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple has a 4-year old son and a 2-year old daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling had arrived at Pro Player Stadium and dressed for the  
game before learning the news. He left for the airport at 4:45 
p.m., about 2 hours, 15 minutes before game time. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest was supposed to mark the return to the Philadelphia  
rotation for Schilling (14-4), who missed a start last Wednesday 
due to tendinitis in his biceps. 
</P>
<P>
	That outing, against the Marlins in Philadelphia, was the first  
one Schilling missed since coming off the disabled list on May 14, 
1996, a string of 117 straight starts. 
</P>

	Chad Ogea started Tuesday night's game in Schilling's place.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Cos. Face Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has voted to put new restrictions  
on the sweepstakes industry, saying too many people are being 
deceived into thinking that buying unwanted magazines and other 
items will help them win big prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 93-0 on Monday, would require sweepstakes  
sponsors to include ``clear and conspicuous'' messages in their 
mailings telling consumers that no purchase is necessary to enter 
or win a sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators could face fines of up to $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``This bill attempts to end these sweepstakes swindles which are  
swamping our nation,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``These 
sweepstakes scams are part of a billion dollar industry, an 
industry which is too often based on deception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet acted on similar legislation, but its  
Government Reform Committee's postal services panel was scheduled 
to hold hearings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Current lottery law prohibits sweepstakes sponsors from  
requiring purchases or giving people an edge in winning prizes if 
they do buy something. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, an investigation headed by Sen. Susan Collins,  
R-Maine, found that some people have spent hundreds of dollars on 
magazine subscriptions or merchandise of little value because they 
had been misled into believing the purchases would bring them 
closer to winning cash, cars and overseas vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Collins, the  
bill's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	During hearings in March, Collins' Permanent Subcommittee on  
Investigations heard from senior citizens who spent their Social 
Security checks, squandered their life savings or borrowed money to 
make purchases from sweepstakes sponsors. They often acted after 
receiving mailings that breathlessly announced, ``You may already 
have won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During debate on the Senate floor, Collins told senators about a  
constituent who spent $10,000 to $20,000 over 19 years, putting 
herself deeply in debt, in the vain hope that she would win and 
recoup her expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Deception was rampant in advertising issued by the four largest  
sweepstakes companies -- American Family Publishers, Publishers 
Clearing House, Time Inc. and Reader's Digest -- although those 
companies run legitimate sweepstakes that award prizes, Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The four major sweepstakes companies alone flood Americans  
with more than 1 billion solicitations every year,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem of deceptive advertising is even worse among  
smaller companies that often seek to conceal their identities and 
may never award a prize, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service's power to investigate and punish  
violators would increase under the bill, giving postal inspectors 
the authority to impose civil fines of up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require that sweepstakes offers include assurances that  
purchases will not increase the chances of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that all mailings include a clear statement of  
sweepstakes rules, procedures for entering, estimated retail values 
of all prizes and the estimated odds of winning each prize. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require sponsors to remove consumers' names and addresses from  
their mailing lists within 35 days of being requested to do so. 
Sponsors would be required to include information, including a 
telephone number or address, consumers can use to make the removal 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit mailings that imply a connection with or endorsement  
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require sponsors to include a message on mailings that look  
like checks telling recipients that they are not negotiable and 
have no cash value. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tighten laws governing skill contests -- puzzles, essay contests  
and other competitions that can require entry fees -- by requiring 
those mailings to disclose more details, including the identity of 
the judges and the method used in judging. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 335.

<HEADLINE> Deion Sanders Out for Preseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys will have to wait awhile for the return of  
``Prime Time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Deion Sanders will not return to the team until  
September, and even that may be a bit optimistic, team owner Jerry 
Jones said Tuesday. Sanders is in training camp, but not practicing 
with the team as he rehabilitates his left big toe. He underwent 
surgery to fix an extreme case of turf toe in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we won't see him in a preseason game,'' Jones said,  
confirming for the first time what had long been suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no estimate of when the All-Pro cornerback might  
suit up until Tuesday, when Jones said: ``I see him really trying 
to push himself sometime in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones also noted that if Sanders sits for all of  
September, he would miss only two games because Dallas has an early 
bye-week. The Cowboys' third game is Oct. 3 against division rival 
Arizona in Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Deion misses only two ballgames, then we've hit a home  
run,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' injury kept him out of five games last year and limited  
him in two others. The Cowboys were 8-3 in games he played and 2-3 
without him. He returned for the first-round playoff loss to the 
Cardinals and played in the Pro Bowl, but was still in pain two 
months later and opted for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing training camp and preseason games is nothing new for  
Sanders, who earlier in his career didn't start playing football 
until he finished the major league baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he doesn't expect the layoff to be a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than his rehabilitation on his toe, Deion is going to be  
in football shape by September,'' Jones said. ``We're not going to 
push anything anyway. It's going to have to be obvious to himself 
and to everybody that he cannot in any way be compromised.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Dimitrius Underwood skipped out on the Minnesota Vikings to  
attend to a ``family matter'' and will return to training camp 
Wednesday, his agent said after finally tracking down the AWOL 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick, inexplicably disappeared  
from training camp Monday, worrying the team, his agent and his 
family, all concerned about his well being. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called to inform me that he was planning to be back in  
Mankato tonight,'' agent Craig Domann said Tuesday night. ``He 
apologized for the way he took off without talking to anybody or 
asking for permission from the team or even letting me know or 
anyone else know that he was doing what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to deal with a family matter that had gotten to crisis  
proportions, and he had to take care of it. He is now focusing his 
energies back on football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the family matter or  
Underwood's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State, was the 29th selection in the NFL draft. He signed a 
five-year contract Sunday for more than $5 million, including a 
partially deferred signing bonus of $1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings went to federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday  
afternoon to keep Underwood from getting the $543,561.80 portion of 
his signing bonus it wired to his Milwaukee bank on Monday. 
Underwood's bank agreed to freeze the account for 48 hours. The 
lawsuit said Underwood breached his contract with the Vikings by 
failing to attend mandatory players' meetings and practices and for 
leaving training camp without permission. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown took part in his first practice with the Chicago  
Bears after signing his contract 11 days into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, ended his holdout Monday with a  
contract that could pay him up to $22 million over five years. The 
initial deal is for seven years and $15 million, but the last two 
years are voidable and he can make an additional $7 million in 
performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived late Monday after a solo drive from Chicago that  
included several wrong turns and a slight mishap when he discovered 
he didn't have any change for a toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Anthony McFarland agreed to terms with  
Tampa Bay, ending a three-day training camp holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said the six-foot, 300-pound  
defensive tackle from LSU would arrive in town to sign the deal 
Tuesday night and practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland was the first defensive lineman selected in the draft  
and 15th pick overall. His contract is believed to be worth more 
than $6 million over five years, including a $4 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sehorn's attempt to return to the New York Giants' lineup  
is going to be delayed about another 10 days because of a torn 
hamstring in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback, who missed all of last season with a serious  
knee injury, had the tear detected Monday night after undergoing an 
MRI in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost certain that Sehorn will miss the Giants preseason  
opener at Minnesota on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's top cover cornerbacks, Sehorn injured the  
hamstring working out about three weeks before training camp 
opened. He didn't think it was serious then, but it cramped about a 
week before camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair left Tuesday morning's  
practice with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated and is not expected to miss any workouts. The  
afternoon session was limited to special teams, so McNair, who has 
started the last 33 regular-season games, was not scheduled to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley, a bust for the New York Giants, lasted less  
than a week into training camp with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was unimpressive in the Dolphins' first scrimmage  
Sunday. He carried seven times for 18 yards. Wheatley, 27, was the 
Giants' first-round draft choice in 1995. But he started just eight 
games in four seasons and carried only 14 times for 52 yards last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Wheatley from New York in February for a  
seventh-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England coach Pete Carroll said the left knee injury  
suffered by tight end Ben Coates in practice Monday was nowhere 
near as serious as reported. Carroll termed the injury ``a very 
mild strain'' and said the veteran Pro Bowler's status would be 
evaluated on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates was unlikely to participate in Saturday's intrasquad  
scrimmage at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Veteran receiver Joey Galloway and first-round draft pick Lamar  
King were no-shows for the third consecutive day because of 
contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway is seeking more than the $1.6 million he is scheduled  
to receive in the final year of his current contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that the Seahawks are  
offering Galloway a seven-year, $35 million deal, which includes a 
$7 million signing bonus. That would make Galloway the 
second-highest-paid receiver in the NFL behind Jerry Rice of the 
San Francisco 49ers.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Tests N.Y. Local Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is quietly offering local telephone service  
to some consumers in New York, becoming the second major 
long-distance company to enter that Bell Atlantic market this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Opting for a more gradual approach than MCI WorldCom, AT&AMP;T is  
looking to sign up just 6,000 of its 5 million New York customers 
at first, and only in the New York City area and Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said Tuesday it began calling up its long-distance  
customers in those markets on Monday evening, offering a fixed-rate 
package for local and long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	For $24.90 a month, an AT&AMP;T customer in New York can get 75  
hours of local calling time and long-distance service for an 
additional 10 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom introduced local service in New York back in  
February, offering a package of 100 calls for $14.99 a month in the 
New York City area and $19.99 in less densely populated areas where 
Bell Atlantic charges more to lease its lines. In early June, MCI 
WorldCom reported having 75,000 local customers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's maneuver, its first local offering to most New York  
consumers in 15 years, comes amid a bitter, state-by-state battle 
between long-distance providers and regional ``Baby Bell'' 
monopolies created by the government in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic and the other Bells have been pushing hard for  
government clearance to sell long-distance to their residential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	They insist that rivals can now easily lease the Bell wires  
connected to people's homes and sell local service -- the main goal 
of a 1996 law designed to spark competition and choice consumers 
now enjoy in long-distance calling. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint charge that the Bells are  
still too slow and unreliable in filling orders for customers 
wanting to switch their local service. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, despite the new initiative into New York and an  
existing one in Texas, the main thrust of AT&AMP;T's overall strategy 
is to provide telephone and Internet service through cable TV wires 
rather than the Bell networks. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has committed more than $100 billion to that plan, having  
decided that ownership of the connections to people's homes is 
preferrable to leasing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, AT&AMP;T has assembled a ``local'' network  
covering about 60 percent of the country, buying two of the 
nation's four biggest cable companies and partnering up with the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
	But, since it's unlikely that regulators would allow AT&AMP;T to  
create a national cable monopoly, the company will need to lease 
some Bell lines to reach consumers.

<HEADLINE> Couple Sues Over Prayer Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Denver couple filed a federal lawsuit to  
challenge a city order barring them from holding more than one 
prayer meeting at their home each month. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by attorneys for the American Center  
for Law and Justice on behalf of David and Diane Reiter, claims the 
cease-and-desist order issued by the city zoning office is 
unconstitutional. It also contended the Reiters are the victims of 
religious hostility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city has trampled on the First Amendment rights of our  
clients and has enacted an order that is not only unconstitutional 
but absurd,'' said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the center based 
in Virginia Beach, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Strapko, administrator of the city's zoning department,  
predicted the city would prevail in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ordinance gives the city the authority to protect  
residential neighborhoods from anything beyond reasonably expected 
activity that is not uncommon or disruptive,'' Strapko said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It includes football parties, yard sales and religious  
meetings. We don't distinguish, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reiters began holding weekly prayer meetings in their home  
in March 1998. Between eight and 12 women would attend the meetings 
to study Christian literature, according to a letter to the zoning 
board written by Sekulow. 
</P>
<P>
	After numerous complaints by neighbors, the city filed a zoning  
order in October requiring the Reiters to stop the weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The order was filed not because it was a religious group, not  
because it was a Bible study group, but because of the meetings' 
impacts on adjacent properties,'' Strapko said. ``Complaints were 
made because of parking issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sekulow's letter to the zoning board said the order mentioned no  
parking violations and no noise ordinance violations.

<HEADLINE> Study: Violence Among Teens Is Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Violent acts by American high school students  
declined between 1991 and 1997, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found a significant drop in the number of students who  
said they got into fights or carried weapons. The decline was 
steeper for girls than it was for boys. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on data collected through the Youth Risk  
Behavior Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are similar to the results of other recent national  
surveys. But the report's authors warned against interpreting them 
too optimistically. They wrote that rates of youth homicide and 
other violence are still at ``historically high levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that in 1991, 42.5 percent of high school  
students said they had been in a fight in the previous year, but 
the figure was 36.6 percent in 1997. And in 1991, 26.1 percent said 
they had carried a weapon in the previous month, but the rate 
dropped to 18.3 percent in 1997.

	Zapruder Heirs To Get $16M for Film  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arbitrators declared today the government must  
pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder $16 million for film that 
Zapruder took of the assassination of President Kennedy, the 
Justice Department said. The Zapruder family had asked for $30 
million. The government offered $1 million. The government has to 
compensate the Zapruder family because the Assassination Records 
Review Board in 1997 declared the film the permanent possession of 
the people of the United States. The decision cannot be appealed. 
Zapruder filmed the assassination while standing on a concrete 
abutment along the route of the president's motorcade through 
Dallas.

after the death of her cousin John F. Kennedy Jr., was married in a 
private ceremony at the home of a Greek shipping magnate, the 
shipowner's office confirmed today. Ms. Kennedy married Mark Bailey 
last night on the grounds of the family compound of shipowner 
Vardis Vardinoyiannis. Kennedy Jr., along with his wife and 
sister-in-law, were killed July 16 when his plane crashed en route 
to Hyannis Port, Mass., for the wedding. Ms. Kennedy, 30, is the 
last of 11 children born to Ethel and the late Sen. Robert Kennedy.

the country hadn't spent enough money to upgrade the system. 
Railway Minister Nitish Kumar said one of the trains involved in 
yesterday's crash was on the wrong track for an unknown reason, and 
said the accident was caused by ``criminal negligence.'' At least 
257 bodies have been removed from the mangled wreckage. About 50 
more people were thought to be inside three smashed train cars, but 
authorities feared that none could have survived.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Former U.N. weapons chief Richard Butler  
says that the weapons inspection operation he headed was ``a thorn 
in the side'' of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and that Annan 
tried to destroy it. In an interview in the new Talk magazine, 
Butler said Annan repeatedly confused Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein's ``superficial cooperation'' with U.N. weapons inspectors 
``with substantive compliance'' on Baghdad's disarmament 
obligations. Butler pulled U.N. inspectors out of Iraq in 
mid-December prior to U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad, and Iraqi 
officials have banned them from returning.

they fatally shot their father and wounded their mother and sister 
four months ago. Originally charged with first-degree murder, the 
boys entered pleas yesterday to lesser charges and avoided a public 
trial. Their identities were not released. The maximum sentence 
would be confinement in a juvenile facility until they are 18. 
Prosecutors say the shooting occurred when the boys' mother found a 
rifle under their bed and tried to take it. One twin wrestled with 
his mom for the rifle, while the other shot her with a .38 caliber 
pistol.

Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius to Denver for Fortson, Eric 
Washington, and Eric Williams. The Celtics will also receive a 
first-round pick. Mercer and Fortson will be free agents after the 
upcoming season. Mercer, who averaged 17 points last season, said 
there was a ``huge difference'' between the Celtics' contract offer 
and what he was asking. Fortson was fourth in the league in 
rebounding with a 11.6 per game average last year.

<HEADLINE> Self Possessed a Favorite at Hambo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Self Possessed will be a heavy favorite in the $1 million  
Hambletonian in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts contend the only way Self Possessed can lose  
trotting's most prestigious race is if the colt goes off stride 
Saturday at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, N.J. He 
has done that before. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the weight comes in.  
</P>
<P>
	Ron Gurfein, the training guru who has combined with driver Mike  
Lachance to win two Hambletonians since 1994, isn't taking any 
chances with Self Possessed, one of the fastest trotters in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he's so fast, the colt is more apt to break stride,  
which is what happened in the Budweiser Beacon Course Trot on July 
16. The result was a fourth-place finish behind winner CR Renegade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurfein found a solution in last weekend's Hambletonian  
eliminations. He changed Self Possessed's shoes, making them a 
little heavier. He also changed the sulky, chucking a modern one 
for a steel one similar to the one used by Victory Dream -- Self 
Possessed's father -- in winning the '94 Hambo. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a 6-length victory over CR Renegade.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made some changes to make it easier on his feet, his knees  
and his splints,'' Gurfein said. ``He was much more comfortable the 
following week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance said the difference in the Beacon Course final and the  
Hambletonian elimination was like night and day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was much safer, more relaxed and much easier to drive,''  
Lachance, who also combined with Gurfein to win the '96 
Hambletonian with Continentalvictory. ``He probably has more speed 
than anybody in the race, but it's not going to be an easy race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, who has won three of five starts this year and  
twice matched the Meadowlands record for 3-year-old trotters 
(1.52.2), had a good day on Tuesday, getting the No. 4 post 
position in the draw at the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hambletonian, Self Possessed will be coupled with Angus  
Hall and Raffaello Ambrosio. Gurfein also trains Raffaello 
Ambrosio, while there is some common ownership between Angus Hall 
and Self Possessed. The entry is an overwhelming 3-5 morning line 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Angus Hall, who will be driven by John Campbell from the No. 9  
post, won last weekend's other Hambletonian elimination in 1:54.3, 
more than a second slower than Self Possessed's time of 1:53. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is definitely the horse to beat going in, there is no  
question about that,'' Campbell said of Self Possessed. He has a 
lot of ability. I wish we had drawn better, but it's just a 
starting point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell drove to an unprecedented fifth Hambletonian victory  
last year with Muscles Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of CR Renegade and CR Commando is the 7-2 second  
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade drew the No. 1 post position for driver Rod Allen,  
CR Commando got the No. 3 post for driver Carl Allen, Rod's father 
and the trainer of both colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting between them will be Cherry Hills, a 12-1 longshot  
driven by Dave Palone. 
</P>
<P>
	After Self Possessed in the No. 4 post, the rest of the field  
with colt, driver, and odds: 
</P>
<P>
	Comets Tail, Berndt Lindstedt, 15-1; Pearsall Hanover, Mickey  
McNichol, 15-1; Enjoy Lavec, Luc Ouellette, 9-2; Davanti, Doug 
Ackerman, 20-1; Angus Hall, Campbell, 3-5; Raffaello Ambrosio, Jack 
Moiseyev, 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time for scheduled for 3:43 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	Oolong, an impressive 4-length winner in her elimination last  
week, was made the lukewarm 3-1 favorite for the $500,000 
Hambletonian Oaks, which is also on Saturday's card.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys will have to wait awhile for the return of  
``Prime Time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Deion Sanders will not return to the team until  
September, and even that may be a bit optimistic, team owner Jerry 
Jones said Tuesday. Sanders is in training camp, but not practicing 
with the team as he rehabilitates his left big toe. He underwent 
surgery to fix an extreme case of turf toe in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we won't see him in a preseason game,'' Jones said,  
confirming for the first time what had long been suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no estimate of when the All-Pro cornerback might  
suit up until Tuesday, when Jones said: ``I see him really trying 
to push himself sometime in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones also noted that if Sanders sits for all of  
September, he would miss only two games because Dallas has an early 
bye-week. The Cowboys' third game is Oct. 3 against division rival 
Arizona in Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Deion misses only two ballgames, then we've hit a home  
run,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' injury kept him out of five games last year and limited  
him in two others. The Cowboys were 8-3 in games he played and 2-3 
without him. He returned for the first-round playoff loss to the 
Cardinals and played in the Pro Bowl, but was still in pain two 
months later and opted for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing training camp and preseason games is nothing new for  
Sanders, who earlier in his career didn't start playing football 
until he finished the major league baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he doesn't expect the layoff to be a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Other than his rehabilitation on his toe, Deion is going to be  
in football shape by September,'' Jones said. ``We're not going to 
push anything anyway. It's going to have to be obvious to himself 
and to everybody that he cannot in any way be compromised.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Dimitrius Underwood skipped out on the Minnesota Vikings to  
attend to a ``family matter'' and will return to training camp 
Wednesday, his agent said after finally tracking down the AWOL 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a first-round draft pick, inexplicably disappeared  
from training camp Monday, worrying the team, his agent and his 
family, all concerned about his well being. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called to inform me that he was planning to be back in  
Mankato tonight,'' agent Craig Domann said Tuesday night. ``He 
apologized for the way he took off without talking to anybody or 
asking for permission from the team or even letting me know or 
anyone else know that he was doing what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to deal with a family matter that had gotten to crisis  
proportions, and he had to take care of it. He is now focusing his 
energies back on football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann declined to go into specifics about the family matter or  
Underwood's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State, was the 29th selection in the NFL draft. He signed a 
five-year contract Sunday for more than $5 million, including a 
partially deferred signing bonus of $1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Cade McNown took part in his first practice with the Chicago  
Bears after signing his contract 11 days into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, ended his holdout Monday with a  
contract that could pay him up to $22 million over five years. The 
initial deal is for seven years and $15 million, but the last two 
years are voidable and he can make an additional $7 million in 
performance-based incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived late Monday after a solo drive from Chicago that  
included several wrong turns and a slight mishap when he discovered 
he didn't have any change for a toll booth. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	First-round draft pick Anthony McFarland agreed to terms with  
Tampa Bay, ending a three-day training camp holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said the six-foot, 300-pound  
defensive tackle from LSU would arrive in town to sign the deal 
Tuesday night and practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland was the first defensive lineman selected in the draft  
and 15th pick overall. His contract is believed to be worth more 
than $6 million over five years, including a $4 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sehorn's attempt to return to the New York Giants' lineup  
is going to be delayed about another 10 days because of a torn 
hamstring in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback, who missed all of last season with a serious  
knee injury, had the tear detected Monday night after undergoing an 
MRI in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost certain that Sehorn will miss the Giants preseason  
opener at Minnesota on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's top cover cornerbacks, Sehorn injured the  
hamstring working out about three weeks before training camp 
opened. He didn't think it was serious then, but it cramped about a 
week before camp opened. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair left Tuesday morning's  
practice with back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated and is not expected to miss any workouts. The  
afternoon session was limited to special teams, so McNair, who has 
started the last 33 regular-season games, was not scheduled to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley, a bust for the New York Giants, lasted less  
than a week into training camp with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley was unimpressive in the Dolphins' first scrimmage  
Sunday. He carried seven times for 18 yards. Wheatley, 27, was the 
Giants' first-round draft choice in 1995. But he started just eight 
games in four seasons and carried only 14 times for 52 yards last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Wheatley from New York in February for a  
seventh-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England coach Pete Carroll said the left knee injury  
suffered by tight end Ben Coates in practice Monday was nowhere 
near as serious as reported. Carroll termed the injury ``a very 
mild strain'' and said the veteran Pro Bowler's status would be 
evaluated on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates was unlikely to participate in Saturday's intrasquad  
scrimmage at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Veteran receiver Joey Galloway and first-round draft pick Lamar  
King were no-shows for the third consecutive day because of 
contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway is seeking more than the $1.6 million he is scheduled  
to receive in the final year of his current contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that the Seahawks are  
offering Galloway a seven-year, $35 million deal, which includes a 
$7 million signing bonus. That would make Galloway the 
second-highest-paid receiver in the NFL behind Jerry Rice of the 
San Francisco 49ers.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in 4 Murders Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Police in central Pennsylvania were looking  
today for an escaped murderer whose killings of four teen-agers in 
a rural crime ring were the subject of the 1986 film ``At Close 
Range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Johnston, 48, opened the window of his cell, sneaked  
across a grassy yard and wriggled through a fence of a 
maximum-security prison sometime after 1 a.m. Monday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported the escape nine hours later, after workers at  
the State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon noticed the fence 
was loose and Johnston's cell window broken open, prison 
spokeswoman Diana Baney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The section of yard Johnston crossed was in a blind spot and  
could not be seen from any of the four guard towers on the prison 
grounds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison's 1,833 inmates were confined to their cells Monday,  
but that lockdown was lifted today, Baney said. The last escape 
there was in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, from southeastern Pennsylvania, was convicted in March  
1980 of killing four teen-age boys in 1978 to cover up a 
multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two brothers. The 
ring also operated in Delaware and Maryland, police said. The four 
teen-agers gave the Johnstons stolen car parts to re-sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had been held at the prison since April 1987. He was  
serving a life sentence for one of the murders and would have had 
to serve life sentences for the other three if the first was ever 
overturned, Baney said. His brothers also are serving life 
sentences.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Avoiding ATM Surcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- James Synder used to routinely step up to  
whatever automated teller machine was around to get cash, but that 
was before he eyed monthly surcharges exceeding $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Chicagoan, like millions of Americans across the nation,  
is doing everything possible to avoid paying for the convenience of 
getting his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The service charge thing gets annoying,'' said Synder, who now  
uses only his bank's machines to get cash. ``You can wrack up extra 
charges fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder is one of a growing number of consumers who are turning  
their backs on surcharges, according to survey by a Chicago-based 
trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Network News found that monthly ATM transactions in March  
1999 fell to 907.4 million, down 2.4 percent from the 930 million 
transactions recorded in June 1998. It was the first volume decline 
in 10 years, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, debit card point-of-sale transactions jumped  
35 percent, according to the survey of the top 10 ATM networks, 
including Cash Station, Star and Interlink. Debit cards, which 
often look just like credit cards, work with a bank account, making 
a deduction for every purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cash station surcharges have become a double-edged sword for  
ATM networks,'' David Gosnell, senior editor for the magazine, said 
Tuesday. ``There's a general consensus that surcharges have 
dampened ATM use and shifted consumer thinking toward using debit 
cards, but the industry has been slow to respond because of the 
profits attained from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks routinely impose ATM charges when a non-customer  
steps up to the keypad. The banks argue these fees are necessary 
because banks must pay each other to reconcile accounts. They must 
also pay thousands of dollars on annual upkeep of the machines. 
Some banks also charge their own customers when they use another 
bank's machine, resulting in double charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, roughly 66 percent of the nation's 227,000 ATMs in 1998  
had surcharges averaging $1.22 each time a non-customer used them, 
up from 56 percent a year earlier, according to Speer &AMP; Associates, 
an Atlanta consulting firm to the banking industry. Fees can rocket 
to $5 in such places as bars and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal lawmakers have attempted to limit the charges  
but have had little success. Now it appears customers are taking 
matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in a real pinch do I pay a $1 service fee,'' said  
business consultant Tom Nolan of Mokena, Ill., who uses ATMs only 
at his banks or uses credit cards to receive frequent flier miles. 
``I don't like giving away money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers, led by supermarkets and grocers, have taken advantage  
of that dissatisfaction by offering consumers the opportunity to 
use debit cards -- not only to make purchases but to get cash back, 
according Speer. 
</P>
<P>
	Debit cards are used widely in Europe and Canada but have been  
slow to catch on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Metcalfe, a Philadelphia architect, says he uses that  
option more often nowadays by stopping into supermarkets or drug 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting, though, how back in 1979, the banks  
presented ATM service free of charge,'' said Metcalfe, eyeing an 
array of such machines. ``We were ignorant consumers not to think 
they wouldn't start replacing tellers and charging us for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked my whole life and (made) my own money -- I can't get  
it out of the bank without paying,'' said a frustrated Grace 
Carter, a 72-year-old retired Philadelphia Board of Education 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	As ATM use has leveled off because of the fees, so have the  
profits from ATM networks, according to Bank One Corp., the 
nation's fifth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees have also shifted traditional American thinking away  
from paying for items first with cash, then by check, credit cards 
and then debit cards, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, based in Chicago, hedges its bets by being the largest  
issuer of debit cards and owning the second-largest ATM network 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> N.C. City Backs Death Penalty Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The city council passed a resolution calling  
on President Clinton, Congress and state officials to halt all 
executions, and its supporters say Durham is the largest city in 
the nation to adopt such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The council voted 8-3 Monday night to encourage a moratorium on  
executions until laws ensure that death penalty cases are 
administered fairly and prevent the execution of mentally retarded 
people and people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote is going to be noticed by people all over the world  
and especially all over the United States,'' said Stephen Dear, 
executive director of People of Faith Against the Death Penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members in Durham, population 175,000, said they were  
most concerned about the number of minority and poor people 
executed since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to 
resume 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other North Carolina cities, Carrboro and Chapel Hill,  
approved similar resolutions in June. They came after a North 
Carolina judge overturned a man's murder conviction and death 
sentence, saying he was falsely accused and authorities withheld 
evidence of his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns vetoed a bill that would have  
made his state the first to place a moratorium on executions while 
officials studied whether the death penalty is being applied 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in other states, including North Carolina, have  
considered but not approved moratoriums, which also have been 
encouraged by the American Bar Association.

<HEADLINE> Strong Sunscreens May Up Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years ago, Melissa Beaudet joined in a  
walk to end hunger and came home with a blistering sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, the 21-year-old Washingtonian has liberally applied  
sunscreen -- nothing lower than a sun-protection factor of 8 -- when 
she's in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see my friends aging, and I know cancer is something you  
can get if you're not careful,'' she said, soaking in the rays at 
Georgetown Swimming Pool in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beaudet's careful approach may not be fully protecting her  
from the threat of cancer after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports in today's  
edition that European researchers found that people who use 
stronger sunscreens stay out longer in the sun because it takes 
longer for them to burn. And the prolonged exposure only increases 
their risk of getting skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not due to the fact that sunscreens are bad, but people  
have a bad attitude -- using them to increase the amount of time 
they spend in the sun,'' said Dr. Ferdy Lejeune, an author of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers gave 87 French and Swiss college students  
sunscreen to take on vacation and record their sun habits -- hours 
of exposure, amount of sunscreen applied, clothing and sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the participants were given sunscreen with a sun-protection  
factor, or SPF, of 30. The other half received SPF 10. But neither 
group knew which product they were using. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who applied SPF 15 to sunbathe stayed outside 25 percent  
longer, spending a majority of that time sunbathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lejeune said the students often waited until their skin turned  
red before finding shade. Vacationers with the stronger sunscreen 
waited even longer, increasing their exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being protected, it's just the opposite because  
their behavior is bad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivian Clark, 49, of Washington, said she uses common sense when  
applying sunscreen. In years past, when she has sunbathed on her 
row house roof, she has worn an SPF 10 or 12. This year, she's 
found that she can avoid burning if she monitors how much time she 
spends in the sun and wears a lower SPF. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't burned at all,'' she said. ``Maybe I started tanning  
slower or maybe it's the weather. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, sometimes she doesn't mind a rosy glow, she admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	Although skin cancer is preventable, the incidence of melanoma  
in the U.S. increases 4 percent a year, according to the National 
Cancer Institute. Previous research has also shown that people who 
use sunscreen have increased incidence of melanoma and other skin 
cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Karen Emmons, a researcher with the Dana-Farber Cancer  
Institute, said the study should not deter people from applying 
sunscreen -- liberally. 
</P>
<P>
	No one should say, ``Oh well, I'm still going to get skin cancer  
so why bother,'' Emmons said. ``It's very important that people use 
sunscreen and apply it appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmons recommends that in addition to lotions, people should  
avoid direct sunlight by staying in the shade and wearing hats and 
other protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published in December, the same researchers reported  
that of 631 European school children, those using the most 
sunscreen were most likely to have sun-caused moles, a sign that 
skin cancer might develop later in life. While the lotion itself 
did not cause moles, it may have made parents overconfident about 
how long their children could safely play outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and  
need more than just protective lotions, Emmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number one way that children are protected from the sun is  
using sunscreen,'' she says. ``And parents need to get with the 
program and start using other kinds of protection.''

<HEADLINE> Brister Starts Life After Elway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- He can travel to the end of the earth,  
but he can't escape comparisons with the great John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubby Brister will lead the Denver Broncos into life after Elway  
in the season's opening exhibition game against San Diego in 
Sydney, Australia, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After flying about as far away as possible from Mile High  
Stadium, Brister could be excused for thinking he'd escaped the 
fuss over his rise to starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	And after a brisk practice session Brister tried to convince the  
local media that no-one was comparing him with the quarterback who 
led Denver to the past two Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, no-one's comparing me to John,'' Brister said. ``I  
haven't done anything to deserve to be compared to John Elway. He's 
one of the best that have ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While no-one is suggesting journeyman Brister is in the same  
league, the comparisons are sure to run all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the opportunity to be a good quarterback on a great  
team,'' said Brister. Last year, he was just that, winning all four 
starts when Elway was missing. It was a major feat for a team which 
had ridden on Elway's arm for 16 years and hadn't won without him 
in nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister knows that at 36 his chances of reaching Elway's  
standing in the game are gone. But what a story if he can bring 
home the NFL's first three-peat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can take us to a third Super Bowl in a row,'' he  
said. ``I'm really just trying not to think about everything 
outside and just concentrate on the things I have to do to execute 
my position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said life has changed enormously since moving up into the top  
quarterback spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a feeling it would when John told me he was going to  
retire a while back,'' Brister said. ``I can deal with it for a 
year or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister needs to make a good start. While there are many  
comparing him to the man who has gone, others will judge him 
against those who are coming, like backups Brian Griese and Chris 
Miller.

<HEADLINE> Isiah Thomas Purchases CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	First, there were informal discussions between Isiah Thomas and  
CBA commissioner Gary Hunter about the NBA great purchasing an 
expansion franchise for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing Thomas knew, he owned the whole league.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the places I always wanted to play in,'' Thomas  
joked. ``This completes the cycle of basketball for me, touching 
all the aspects of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is paying $10 million for the nine CBA franchises and  
plans to reorganize the league into a single entity operation. 
Under that structure, the CBA would control all functions of team 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The franchises will be owned by the league,'' Thomas said.  
``My interest is purely in basketball remaining healthy and the 
game continuing to grow, and protecting the sanctity of the game we 
all love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter explained the transaction.  
</P>
<P>
	``Isiah is buying all nine franchises,'' he said. ``The owners  
will receive proportionate shares (of the purchase price). His 
outstanding reputation can take us to a level we are not able to 
reach on our own, a level we're not able to bridge ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, led the  
Detroit Pistons to consecutive championships in 1989 and 1990. 
After retirement, he became part owner and general manager of the 
expansion Toronto Raptors and then became a game analyst for 
NBC-TV. He will continue to broadcast games for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he always wanted to own an NBA team. ``The climate  
changed and corporations came into the picture,'' he said. ``It's 
difficult to compete with billion dollar players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he turned his attention to minor league basketball and last  
January began discussions with Hunter about an expansion franchise 
for Detroit. Those talks led to his purchase not of one team but 
the entire league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in this for the long haul,'' Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
	The CBA has long functioned as a developmental league, where  
players and officials refine their skills for the NBA. Thomas sees 
that role expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we ultimately would like to achieve is to form affiliates  
with NBA teams, each team calling up and sending down players with 
single contracts,'' Thomas said. ``We've had discussions and 
continue to have discussions. The key thing is to make sure 
whatever we do is in the best interest and the health of 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas believes the affiliate idea will work but needs time to  
put it in place. He thinks there is room for expansion, even in a 
city like Detroit which has four professional teams, including one 
in the NBA. The Pistons play in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas seemed inclined to move cautiously, particularly on the  
question of teams affiliating directly with NBA franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a discussion down the road,'' he said. ``We don't want  
to get too far ahead of ourrselves. We're not there today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is to concentrate on being the best  
minor league system around. The CBA has been here since 1946 and 
plans to be around until 2046.''

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Good for Indie Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No big stars? Tiny budget? No problem. ``The  
Blair Witch Project'' is proving that a movie shot for $60,000 can 
still conjure up a monster hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Seemingly coming from nowhere, the horror film went into wide  
release over the weekend and took in $29.2 million -- second only to 
Julia Roberts and Richard Gere's ``Runaway Bride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's success has reminded a blockbuster-crazy movie  
industry that sometimes, the next best thing in the cinema doesn't 
follow the formulaic route. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no words to describe it,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a  
movie-industry analyst for Reel Source Inc. ``I'm at a loss for 
words on what this film has done for the whole industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in barely a third as many theaters as ``Runaway Bride,''  
``Blair Witch'' averaged $26,528 a screen, nearly 2.5 times that of 
the romantic comedy, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., 
which tracks ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	And while ``Runaway Bride'' took in $35.1 million, about half of  
its production costs, in just one weekend, ``Blair Witch'' has 
grossed $36.1 million -- 100 times what the filmmakers and their 
distributor spent to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps the industry, because it shows you there's a  
business out there,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th 
Century Fox. ``It kind of stops the complacency where everything 
has to have a big budget, and you have to get this person to 
star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick shot ``Blair  
Witch'' for about $60,000, while distributor Artisan Entertainment 
poured in $300,000 more for other production costs, said Amir 
Malin, Artisan president. 
</P>
<P>
	A fictional movie, ``Blair Witch'' presents itself as a  
documentary pieced together from video shot by three filmmakers who 
disappeared in the woods while hunting for a witch. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing has played on that ``mockumentary'' notion,  
leaving some moviegoers guessing about whether the horror story is 
real or imagined. Word-of-mouth reviews and the Internet helped 
fuel interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan bought ``Blair Witch'' for $1 million after the  
distributor's executives saw it at the Sundance film festival, 
Malin said. He said the company has spent $10 million on 
distribution and promotion, still relatively cheap by Hollywood 
blockbuster standards. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the movie expanding from 1,100 theaters to about 2,000  
next weekend, ``Blair Witch'' was expected to easily gross more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' could even become the most successful film ever  
in terms of return on initial investment, said Tom Borys, president 
of box-office tracker ACNielsen EDI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then, a small film does break through. But  
there's been nothing before of this magnitude,'' Borys said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood always searches for independent films that might have  
commercial appeal, but ``Blair Witch'' might make big studios 
``reexamine what they can do to find those gems,'' Borys said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' could become a franchise film for Artisan, whose  
previous best box-office performer was Wes Craven's ``Wishmaster.'' 
That film made $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan already has plan for a ``Blair Witch'' sequel, and the  
distributor is cleaning up on T-shirts, books and other merchandise 
related to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Big movie studios are taking heed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need to make movies for $100 million, you don't need  
to spend $25 million in marketing and distribution,'' Malin said. 
``What audiences really want is something fresh that's not 
derivative in nature.''
