<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Tries to Avert February 29  Nation-Wide Demonstrations (By Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Next 48 hours will witness here
a competition between efforts by the government to cool the
situation and avert nation-wide demonstrations called by trade
unions on February 29 and mounting pressures from workers.
</P>
<P>
Using hard and soft tactics, Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri
chaired in the Governmental Palace this afternoon a meeting of top
security officers, during which measures to enforce a government
ban on demonstrations were reportedly discussed.
</P>
<P>
At 7:00 pm (17:00 GMT) this evening, the premier presided
another meeting of a ministerial committee charged with
negotiations with the General Workers Confederation (GWC).
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 pm (19:00 GMT), Labor Minister Asaad Hardan is due to
hold another round of negotiations with a GWC delegation headed by
Confederation President Elias Abu Rizk, and this will supposedly
be the last round of negotiations between the labor minister and
the powerful GWC before a cabinet meeting Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers concerned with the social and security
affairs have expressed hopes that a solution could be found in the
talks tonight, and trade union officials persisted in their
decision to resort to streets unless the government agrees to
their demands.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the whirlpool are workers' demands for a 76
percent salary rise, an increase of the maximum salary to 500,000
Lebanese pounds (315 U.S. dollars) from the current level of
250,000 Lebanese pounds (160 dollars), a cancel of the
controversial demonstration ban by the government and a freeze of
the newly-adopted law regulating the broadcast media industry.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr refused this afternoon to
make any statement before the talks between the government and
the workers tonight, and before the cabinet session Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow morning the Council of Ministers will have a
meeting and after the meeting we can talk on the issue,"
the interior minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Today there will be evening negotiations held by Minister
Asaad Hardan with the Workers Confederation and in light of a
development of these negotiations we can talk tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Interior Ministry has handed in the
application of the GWC on the February 29 demonstrations and the
government will discuss this application in the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The GWC, which groups various Lebanese trade unions with an
estimated membership of more than 400,000, handed over last week
to the Interior Ministry the application for demonstrations to be
held in Beirut, Tripoli, the Bekaa, Baalbek, Sidon and Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Following a bloody clash between the army and demonstrators
in south suburb of the capital in September, 1993, where at
least nine people were killed, the government issued the ban
on demonstration which, the government argued, is still
effective.
</P>
<P>
But local political analyst ruled out a possibility of a
recurrence of the violent demonstrations in May 1992, which led to
the resignation of former prime minister Omar Karami, since a
similar social chaos is not wanted by Syria, the main power broker
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the way back home from a private visit to France, Premier
Hariri visited Damascus on Sunday and had a meeting with Syrian
vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the meeting have not been officially announced,
but it is commonly believed that the situation in Lebanon was on
the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Beirut, Hariri held a meeting with
Interior Minister Murr and Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul,
which was interpreted as an indication that the government is
determined to enforce the demonstration ban.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Nile Conference Opens In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Nile 2002
Conference opened today with experts from eight Nile basin
countries meeting here to discuss the comprehensive water
resource development of the Nile Basin Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Uganda's Minister of Natural Resources
Kenry Kajura said one of the main tasks of the Ugandan government
is to create an integrated self-sustaining national economy.
</P>
<P>
He added the government fully recognizes the importance of
water as a strategic natural resource vital for life sustaining,
socio-economic development and maintenance of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Kajura noted that most Ugandans, together with the government,
are now concerned by the recent climate trends with recurrent
droughts which tend to be more severe and prolonged.
</P>
<P>
The minister further stressed that the national concern for
environmental protection of its water resources including the
river Nile and associated lakes is in conformity with the global
concern for the protection of the environment and fresh water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the conference which are aimed, among
other things, at bringing experts from the Nile Basin and
external support agencies to address pertinent topical issues
related to development of the Nile Basin from national and
regional perspectives.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled four-day conference is being attended by
delegates from Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan, Zaire, Rwanda,
Burundi and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The first Nile conference was held in Aswan, Egypt in February
1993. The second was held in Khartoum, Sudan in July 1994 and the
third was held in Arusha, Tanzania in February 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Opens Commonwealth War Veterans Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Legion
(SAL)'s adoption of former Liberation Force veterans was part of
the reconciliation process, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks when opening the 26th tri-ennial
conference of the British Commonwealth Ex-Service League in Cape
Town, which was attended by war veterans from over 50
Commonwealth Countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said only South african whites were fully honored as
war veterans when the league was founded 75 years ago, while
black soldiers who lost their lives in the war had been deprived
of that honor.
</P>
<P>
But changes sweeping across the country had closed that
chapter, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The SAL had accepted as its members of the war veterans of
"umkhonto we sizwe" (former military wing of the then banned
African National Congress) and then Azanian People's Liberation
Army.

<HEADLINE> Strategists Differ in Views of Economy's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite last week's strong
performance in the stock market, nagging recession concerns
continue to confound Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the "Wall Street Journal" today,
economists are divided into two major camps while predicting the
economy's performance of the year.
</P>
<P>
The economy registered a sluggish 0.9 percent pace in the
fourth quarter of last year, leading to the weakest yearly growth
since the 1991 recession. And consumer spending edged up just 0.8
percent during the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
But new-home construction rose 4.4 percent in January. Its
starts fell 7.3 percent in 1995 -- the first annual decline since
a 15.1 percent fall in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The conflicting economic signals have thrown investors in a
quandary, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some economists think the economy is rapidly dropping into
recession, or close to one. Others believe that it is simply
taking a modest breath before strengthening later this year.
</P>
<P>
One camp, which includes Charles Clough, chief strategist at
Merrill Lynch Co., argues that the economy is slowing much faster
than realized. Clough says rising corporate inventories and a
spent consumer are contributing to a steepening slowdown.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve is acting too slowly to avoid a
period of extended sluggishness, and company earnings will
probably suffer more than anticipated this year.
</P>
<P>
The other camp, which includes Abby J. Cohen, market strategist
at Goldman, Sachs Co., believes that the economy will rebound
later this year, with the cycle extending into 1997.
</P>
<P>
The divergent views play a crucial role in near-term investing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The stock market, the paper said, reflecting the division in
thought, has wrestled with both concepts in the past several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
But even Clough is not so pessimistic about the future of
the stock market. He said companies and households, both with a
lot of cash, will cushion the blow of a correction by continuing
to buy stocks. "No bear market is likely," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Improves Offer to Push WTO Telecommunications Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
announced an improved offer to open up its telecommunications
market and urged other nations to follow suit in order to conclude
a global market-opening deal by a deadline of April 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The revised U.S. offer was announced by U.S. Deputy Trade
Representative Jeffrey Lang at the beginning of one-week
negotiations which started here today under the auspices of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The offer includes, most notably, unrestricted market access
and national treatment for foreign companies in the U.S. local
telecommunications market, which is frequently requested by U.S.
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"With this revised offer, the United States signals its
intention to reduce existing restrictions on competition at the
local level, in keeping with the new telecommunications law signed
by President Clinton on February 8, 1996," Lang said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. offer was seen by trade experts here as another
campaign by the U.S. to persuade its trading partners to improve
or table their own offers to accelerate liberalization in their
national telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
As an earlier one, the new U.S. offer is conditional, which
means it may be subject to revision, or even total withdrawal,
depending on the quality of offers made by others. As another
condition, the U.S. insists that the future global
telecommunications deal should include competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on basic telecommunications, as part of
unfinished business of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks,
began in May 1994 and are schedule to conclude by the end of April
1996.
</P>
<P>
To date, 48 WTO members have participated in the negotiations
and 19 initial offers have been made. The success of the
negotiations depends on a large enough number of leading countries
putting forward positive offers.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations cover such basic telecommunications services
including international as well as domestic voice telephony, data
transmission, telex, telegraph, facsimile, satellite services,
mobile services and video transport services.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Disappointed in Britain Over Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), said this afternoon that it was
disappointed by the response from the British government which
refused to set a firm date for all-party peace talks, according to
reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness held its first
talks with British government representative Quentin Thomas in the
capital of Northern Ireland since the IRA disrupted its ceasefire
on February 9.
</P>
<P>
After talks, McGuinness said that the current situation facing
the peace process was very grave, and the British government was
not prepared to "take firm risks for peace".
</P>
<P>
He said that if the British government set a firm date for
all-party peace negotiations, he was prepared to approach the IRA
and seek a resumption of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
But the government representative Thomas said he was not
empowered to negotiate with Sinn Fein but to act as a conduit and
take note of Sinn Fein's position.
</P>
<P>
Since the IRA announced an end to its ceasefire, the British
government has banned ministerial contact with Sinn Fein.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Start to Evacuate Serb Sarajevans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 military trucks of
the Bosnian Serb army today began to evacuate Serbs living in
Vogosca and Ilijas which will be reverted to full Muslim-Croat
control in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
This convoy was permitted by NATO-led IFOR commanders and
escorted by IFOR tanks and armored personnel carriers to guarantee
its safe passage, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of civilian vehicles to transport Serbs out of
Sarajevo, Serb authorities decided to use military vehicles to
move their people out of the Serb Sarajevo districts to be under
government rule in line with the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Details of the organized evacuation with Serb military help was
worked out Sunday by the IFOR commanders and Bosnian Serb army
officers.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR has insisted that the drivers of the military trucks
must wear civilian clothes, carry no weapons and have their
license plates removed.
</P>
<P>
Muslim-Croat federation police began to patrol in Vogosca last
Friday and will enter Ilijas Thursday to gradually take over the
five sectors controlled by the Serbs during the war.
</P>
<P>
To avoid possible retaliation, some 20,000 Serbs living in the
affected Sarajevo suburbs have already fled, and many more are
desperately determined to move out, leaving Serb parts of Sarajevo
almost ghost towns.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Group Condemns Terrorist Attacks on Christians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Society for
Enhancing National Unity today condemned the recent terrorist
attacks by Moslem extremists on Christian Copts in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The organization said in a statement that the attacks targeting
Copts were aimed at disrupting national unity, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Christian Coptic leaders in southern Egypt also
appealed to the government to protect their churches and villages
following a wave of deadly assaults believed to have been carried
out by Moslem fundamentalist militants.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made after suspected Moslem extremists opened
fire Saturday in a Christian village near al Badari in the
southern province of Assiut, about 320 kilometers south of Cairo,
leaving eight people dead, including at least six Copts. The
gunmen escaped.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 Christians and two men guarding a church have been
killed in the south since the start of this year, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
Copts, descendants of families that were among the earliest
converts to Christianity, make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 60
million population, of which Moslems make up the vast majority.
</P>
<P>
In today's statement, the Egyptian Society for Enhancing
National Unity also asserted its full confidence in the ability of
the security authorities to confront terrorists, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been haunted by terrorist attacks since 1992 when the
country's Islamic militants launched a violent campaign against
the government in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have cracked down on militants fiercely and
largely contained terrorist acts, which have only happened
sporadically in villages in the south.

cooperation agreement is underway, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad said here today on his return from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Pahad was in Algiers as President Nelson Mandela's special

Salvation Front (FIS), in Pretoria, capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
President Zeroual even threatened to recall the Algerian
Ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said President Mandela had no intention to interfere
with other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa would continue to back Algeria's "move
towards democracy" as well as the "unequivocal condemnation of
all acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"The misunderstanding was fully explained to the Algerian
government," said the South African envoy.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis -- U.S. Reshapes Policy Toward Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Less aid. More trade and
investment. The United States is reshaping its policy toward
Africa.
</P>
<P>
This wind of change blows as the Clinton Administration begins
to attach "strategic importance" to Africa in its readjusted
global economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
"For too long, we in the United States have failed to look at
Africa as a place of business opportunities," said visiting U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown as he concluded a five-nation
African tour on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the historical time for us to move in and compete
stiffly for a share of the last virgin market of the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Brown, the first U.S. Secretary of Commerce in 14 years ever
setting feet on the Sub-Saharan soil, led a powerful U.S.
business delegation in touring Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya,
Uganda and Botswana during the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
In Accra, he held talks with the 16 trade ministers of West
Africa's sub-regional grouping, the Economic Community of the
West African States (ECOWAS), calling for peace and stability to
create a healthy environment for investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Nairobi, Brown praised the East African leaders for their
privatization efforts, stressing that with the dwindling of the
U.S. financial aid, the Clinton Administration is championing a
campaign for increased investment in Africa's private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also praised their fight against crime and corruption, and
commended them for making a revived effort to rebuild an
integrated regional market among Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In Goborone, the U.S. delegation signed a memorandum of trade
development with the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) following talks with the trade ministers of the 12 SADC
member states.
</P>
<P>
Brown's tour follows the unveiling the week before of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's long awaited plan for increasing trade
between the U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The plan, mandated by the U.S. Congress, set four goals:
liberation of trade and investment policies, development of the
private sector, enhancement of infrastructure, and regulatory and
economic reforms by governments.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. trade initiative reflected the U.S. resolve to
strike a balance of trade with Sub-Saharan Africa which had
enjoyed a $7.7 billion trade surplus with the Untied States in
1994, with oil sales by Nigeria, Angola and Gabon accounting much
for the region's exports to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It is also a result of the cutting back on the government aid
to Africa as the U.S. overseas aid fund dwindled in its 1996
budget.
</P>
<P>
"The economic realities in the United States compelled us to
focus more on trade and private investment than on aid to
Africa," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
But the no. 1 compelling force of the U.S. initiative, is the
charm of Africa's market and resources.
</P>
<P>
"Africa's abundant resources and huge markets are something
that we can no longer afford to ignore," Brown declared.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment returns in sub-Saharan Africa is about 25
percent, much higher than the average rate of 17 percent in other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. share of Sub-Saharan Africa's markets stood
at only 7.7 percent, while the European Union captured over 40
percent, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce report.
</P>
<P>
"We will no longer abandon African markets to Europe. We will
compete hard, which is good for the Africans because it reduces
prices and provides better quality goods and services," Brown
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Sub-Saharan Africa also boosts of rich natural reserves
such as oil and rubber in Nigeria, Gold and diamond in South
Africa, bauxite in Guinea and Cameroon, Uranium in Niger, copper
in Zambia, iron in Liberia, diamond in Sierra Leone, and water
power in Zaire, just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
And its agricultural, forestry and tourist resources remain to
be explored.
</P>
<P>
"It's high time that we in the United States have a new look
at Africa. War, poverty and refugees are not all that one sees in
Africa," said Brown at the end of his visit.
</P>
<P>
"From the five countries that I have visited, I saw hope in
the continent," he said, calling Africa "America's new trading
partner."
</P>
<P>
African businessmen hope that the Clinton Administration would
extend the Most-Favored Nation trade status to the Sub-Saharan
African states.
</P>
<P>
Observers say one thing is for sure, that Brown's visit will
entail a new wave of U.S. private investment in Sub-Saharan
Africa, a move backed by the Clinton Administration.

<HEADLINE> UK Claim on French Share Trade in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The volume of French shares
bought and sold through the UK market is substantially lower than
claimed by the London Stock Exchange, according to an analysis by
a leading French academic.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times reported today that of all the transactions in
French shares which are quoted on the London system, just eight
percent are carried out through London's Seaq International
system, with the rest conducted directly through the Paris bourse,
the study shows.
</P>
<P>
That contrasts sharply with figures published by the London
stock market authorities, suggesting that London's Seaq
International system, the automated quotation system launched in
1985, accounted for more than 52 percent of such trades.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange said that the Seaq International
system's figures were inflated by the fact that each transaction
was recorded twice, for every buy and every sell operation.
</P>
<P>
It added that it had changed its method for calculating volumes
in January, and the first monthly figures produced under the new
system would be available after the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The figures, however, throw doubt on the London statistics for
shares from other European Union countries and provide a further
embarrassing blow to the London Stock Exchange and the City's
hopes of remaining a leading financial market.
</P>
<P>
The study was funded by the Societe des Bourses Francaises,
operator of the French stock market, and was carried out by
Bertrand Jacquillat, an academic at Paris's Dauphine University.

<HEADLINE> PC Sales in US Jump by Half in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The retail sales of personal
computers in the fourth quarter in the United States showed an
unexpectedly strong 49 percent increase from a year earlier, the
Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Many market analysts used to believe that the soft retail
market would have an adverse effect on home PC sales. They
expected that home sales would grow as little as 10 percent to 15
percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the overall consumer
spending crept up just 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. In fact,
numerous industry observers have been saying that the U.S. home
market is nearing saturation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the industry attributed the rapid growth to the
development of faster microprocessors and new multimedia systems.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not give the exact value of the sales, which was
based on a survey of 1,100 retail and business dealers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It said the retail market is faced by fierce competition and
cost-cutting which have squeezed profit margins. "The basic fact
is that home PC sales are not profitable," the paper quoted an
analyst as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, some companies are hoping to spur sales among more
lower-income households by introducing less expensive PCs, it
said.

<P>
NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Strong spring winds lashed
New York metropolitan region Sunday, killing three residents and
causing severe damage to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
The winds that whipped to more than 60 miles per hour uprooted
trees, peeled roofs away, blew telephone poles onto roads and
houses, shattered windows in high-rise buildings and knocked out
power to more than 100,000 homes in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
A 40-year-old man was knocked down by a flying tree in the
street and died from head injuries in Brooklyn, New York. In
Farmington, Connecticut, a man and his 6-year-old son were killed
when a flying tree crashed their car. Three other passengers were
critically injured, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Brooklyn, a gust tore part a three-story apartment building,
forcing dozens of residents from their homes. Another two-story
wood-frame building under construction also collapsed, becoming
a pile of splintered timber.
</P>
<P>
The northwesterly winds, according to meteorologists, gusted at
speed up to 70 miles per hour in parts of the Hudson Valley, 60
miles per hour in Ossining in Westchester County and 55 in parts
of New York City, causing the cancellation of ferry service on
the Hudson and East Rivers.

the human race was indivisible. Referring to the lofty universal

productive life socially and economically, President Ben Ali said
this objective could only be achieved through international
cooperation and solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Ciller Leaves For Rome to Lobby EU Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua)-- Turkey's caretaker Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller left here today for Rome on a one-day
working visit, during which she will lobby support in the Aegean
dispute with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ciller is expected to meet her Italian counterpart Lamberto
Dini on Tuesday over Turkey's relations with the European Union,
whose rotating presidency is held by Rome.
</P>
<P>
Local radio reported that Ciller's trip was apparently a
counterattack after Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis toured
Europe to lobby support in a dispute with its old foe Turkey over
the ownership of an eastern Aegean islet.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last month when both Greece and Turkey
claimed sovereignty to a set of small islands, called Kardak in
Turkish and Imia in Greek, in the Aegean Sea. The United States
later intervened, preventing a war between the two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has advocated settling the dispute through bilateral
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But Greece has insisted on taking the case to the International
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Brussels indicate that Athens has already been
successful in effectively blocking a vote on EU aid to Turkey,
which has been part of a customs union accord reached between the
two sides last month.
</P>
<P>
Ankara believes that Greece's plan to obstruct this accord
is not a problem between Ankara and Athens but a problem
between Greece and the EU.

LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The government today warned

party if they try to storm parliament to protest re-introduction
of the public order act.
</P>

The warning was sounded by chief government Spokesman Amusa

Kaunda on Sunday.

Kaunda reportedly directed UNIP cadres to storm parliament if

The UNIP cadres and anybody else, regardless of their status
in the society, who would be involved in the planned storm of
parliament would regret their action, said Mwanamwambwa who is
also information minister.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Zambians to ignore the call by Kaunda because it
borders on anarchy.

The government would not accept any breakdown of law and order
through irresponsible actions of a few individuals, he noted.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Police have
arrested 60 Hamas activists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following two suicide bombing attacks Sunday in Jerusalem and
Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following the attacks, Izzidine al-Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide
explosions which left 23 Israelis and two Americans dead, 84
wounded.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Palestinian police said in Gaza today that
the arrested Hamas activists will be questioned for information
about the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian police are not arresting Hamas
members at random, but targeting people who are linked to Izzidine
al-Qassam.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today issued an
official statement to condemn the two attacks, saying that their
purpose was to harm the peace process and the interests of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres today called on
the PNA to crack down on the extremist groups in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Knesset (Israel's parliament), Peres said
the PNA "must decide to disarm the terrorists or risk endangering
its authority," and "must outlaw those who act contrary to the
law."
</P>
<P>
He added that the closure, imposed on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip after the bombing attacks, "will continue as long as
is required from a security standpoint."

<HEADLINE> Unity Problems Feed Unemployment in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin has said Canada is paying an ongoing economic cost because
of uncertainty over the future of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the country are cutting jobs and not making the
investments that create new employment because of national unity
concerns, Martin was quoted as saying by today's Canadian
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
This fear of separation in the business community was related
to the dismal job picture last November, when 44,000 jobs
disappeared, Martin said in an interview with the Canadian Press.
Canada is also losing on new jobs because companies are choosing
to invest elsewhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Martin declined to estimate the number of jobs lost
because of the Quebec situation. But he did say that lingering
anxiety about separation is exacting a heavy cost on Canadians,
and Quebeckers in particular.
</P>
<P>
"You only have to go to Montreal today and see the slowdown to
know that the overhang continues," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of volatility in the Canadian dollar and
interest rates related to speculation over Quebec's future, the
federal government has set aside a 1.8 billion U.S. dollar
emergency fund for the coming 1996-97 fiscal year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The move is a response to calls for the federal government by
business people to take actions to stabilize the financial market
after the October 30 referendum on Quebec independence. The fund
could be used if Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard calls another
referendum next year that sends interest rates soaring.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 26 (Xinhua) - Voting is going on peacefully
in the capital Freetown and its environs while a number of unrest
have taken place in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, Guinean and Nigerian forces launched heavy artillery
bombardments against suspected strongholds of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) early today.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties but voting in areas out of
Kenema were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
He said residents in a Red Cross supported camp totaling
8,000 fled the place due to rebel threats and are now in Kenema
town in the east.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross has set up an emergency camp to treat the
wounded, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the second largest city of Bo in the south, RUF rebels are
said to have launched an attack at Fallah, 4.8 kilometers from
Bo, injuring seven people with three civilians dead. there were
repeated calls on radio for doctors to report at the Bo
government hospital, one local journalist said.
</P>
<P>
"Heavy shelling was underway at the reservation area and the
polling stations there have been dismantled," one journalist
said.
</P>
<P>
Reaction nationwide by voters is that the polling process "is
extremely slow," leading to voter frustration.
</P>
<P>
"A voter spends over an hour waiting in the burning sun to
vote," one voter complained in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
At a displaced people's camp near the capital, there was a
huge turnout but only three polling booths. The camp has about
20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the charge, the Chairman of the Interim National
Electoral Commission (INEC), Dr James Jonah said the slow process
is "not unusual."
</P>
<P>
"You have to weigh vigilance against the slow process," he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
According to Jonah, "we shall make certain that everyone
standing in the queue would vote if even this takes a couple of
hours more."
</P>
<P>
Jonah said "a number of falsified ballot papers have been
discovered and in one station one voter was found with 25 papers.
We took them away from him ad put him out of the station."
</P>
<P>
The Head of State, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio,
according to state house officials, had not cast his vote up to
1400 hours gmt. The military is keeping a low profile in the
capital where there is a high police presence at polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
All flights to provincial towns remained grounded due to what
officials say "security reasons."

<HEADLINE> Ruling on Pesticide Labeling Suspended in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Ministry of
Agriculture has officially suspended the implementation of a
ruling on pesticide labeling.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after sticker and pesticide producers
failed to agree on an implementation system which would not burden
farmers. The suspension was reinforced through ministerial decree
no.81/1996, which became effective recently.
</P>
<P>
Under decree no.770/1995 issued last November, the Minister of
Agriculture stipulated that pesticides should bear hologram
stickers before they could be sold to protect users from the
distribution of fraudulent products.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 decree, originally scheduled to come into effect in
April this year, was greeted with fierce protests from pesticide
producers who complained that such stickers would create
additional costs which, in turn, would have to be passed on to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin Baharsjah earlier emphasized
that whatever compromise was reached between pesticide and sticker
producers on the terms and prices of the stickers, the government
did not want farmers to suffer from the labeling.

put forward last Friday by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, on an exchange of prisoners between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Lahd, commander of the 3,000-strong militia, said that
he welcomed Hezbollah's suggestion to release a certain number of
militiamen held by the Shiite fundamentalist group, in exchange
for the detainees jailed in the hilltop prison at Khiam in the
Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-backed militia said in a statement issued today
that General Lahd welcomed the suggestion "on the basis of a
principle of equality in the proposed operation" of exchanging
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But the statement failed to clarify what Lahd means with the
term of the "principle of equality."
</P>
<P>
It added that the operation of exchanging prisoners should be
treated through the International Committee of Red Cross "rather
than on newspapers."
</P>
<P>
The SLA, backed by some 1,000 Israeli army soldiers, polices
the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer enclave Israel carved out in
1985 to shield its northern Jewish settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah announced last
Friday the proposal to release the 19 SLA militiamen in
Hezbollah's hand in exchange for all the prisoners in the Khiam
jail.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in the south suburb of Beirut that
all the captured SLA militiamen are "in the hand of the Islamic
Resistance," the military wing of the Shiite Hezbollah which
spearheads a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of those prisoners could be solved in exchange
with all the male, female, and Lebanese and Palestinian detainees
in the Khiam prison," the Hezbollah leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that there are over 200 people jailed
by Israel and its surrogate militia in the Khiam prison deeply
inside the border strip in south Lebanon.

JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis were killed
and 23 others wounded when a car driven by an Arab-American ran
into a crowd at a bus stop in northeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Ahmed Abu Hamida who was a resident of the United
States and was visiting the West Bank town of Ramallah, was
immediately shot dead by a bystander.
</P>
<P>
Unlike initial reports, the Israeli police now tended to
suggest that this was a traffic incident instead of a violent
attack by a Palestinian extremist. Police commanders said they
found long skid marks on the road that suggested the driver was
trying to break.
</P>
<P>
The initial description of the incident as another Palestinian
attack was a result from Sunday morning's two Hamas suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon which killed a total of
27 people, including the two suicide bombers.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Urges Lifting of Sanctions Against Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian leadership wants
the U.N. to lift sanctions against Bosnian Serbs and hopes other
countries will understand its stance, a presidential spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Medvedev told a news briefing that Moscow's recent
decision to unilaterally lift sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs
is "a long-awaited move."
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
allowing Russia to unilaterally withdraw from U.N. sanctions
against the Bosnian Serbs on the grounds that they were complying
with the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The move did not mean Russia was in violation of the Dayton
agreement, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for understanding of the Russian stance by other
countries who participate in the economic blockade of the Bosnian
Serbs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is also considering lifting U.N. sanctions against
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev stressed that there are no grounds for a continuation
of U.N. sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and that there is no
need for a special U.N. resolution on the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A continued economic blockade may not only affect the
reconstruction of Bosnia's economy and social infrastructure but
also complicate the re-integration of the country's economy with
Europe's, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations suspended nearly four years of sanctions
against Belgrade not long after the signing of the Dayton peace
accord but kept them on the Bosnian Serbs to ensure their
compliance with the accord.
</P>
<P>
At the Rome meeting on Bosnia last week, the United States
agreed that if the NATO peacekeeping force confirmed Bosnian
Serbs' full compliance with the peace accord, sanctions would be
lifted.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South Korean
President Kim Young Sam predicted here today that his country's
investment in India will touch 5 billion US dollars in value terms
by the year 2000, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of Indian businessmen, Kim urged India to
liberalize its financial sector and provide tax benefits for
investors from his country.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day
official visit and headed a 38-member business delegation, said
even though two-way trade between India and South Korea has
surpassed 2 billion dollars last year, the two countries should
further their efforts to develop bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the two countries will have to upgrade their
partnership to a higher level and work for the common prosperity
of a new Pacific and Indian Ocean region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, India and South Korea signed two pacts on
promotion and protection of investment and for the setting up of a
joint commission to speed up cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is now the eleventh largest investor in India with
a total investment of 100 million dollars.

MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A huge blaze which raged for
nearly two days at a Moscow tyre factory, was brought under
control today after a massive fire-fighting operation.
</P>
<P>
One fire-fighter is missing and seven others were injured in
the blaze which broke out early Sunday morning (22.30 GMT
Saturday) in a six-story warehouse in the Moscow Tyre Plant.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 mothers and newborn babies were evacuated from
two nearby hospitals as 800 tonnes of burning rubber and 10-15
tonnes of sulphur filled the air with black smoke and acrid
fumes. Some 150 buses were on stand-by to evacuate residents of
nearby flats and office blocks.
</P>
<P>
Four of the injured fire-fighters were taken to hospital, the
other three were treated at a local clinic.
</P>
<P>
Thirty one special fire-fighting units, two fire-fighting
trains from the Moscow railway, a rescue helicopter and 15 mobile
medical teams from the Moscow police were involved in the
operation, which was hindered by the collapse of floors and
load-bearing walls in the building.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the plant supplied tyres for two big car plants
in the country -- ZIL and AZLK.

<HEADLINE> Peres: We will Continue Peace Process while Fighting Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres pledged here today that Israel will continue with
the peace process, but at the same time "will take all
appropriate means in order to strike at terrorists everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a Knesset (Israel's parliament) plenum this
afternoon following Sunday's two Hamas suicide bombing attacks,
Peres said he was confident that Israel will bring about the
collapse of the Hamas organization.
</P>
<P>
In the suicide bus bombing in Jerusalem, 21 Israelis and two
Americans were killed while in Ashkelon, one Israeli soldier was
killed. The two suicide bombers were also killed.
</P>
<P>
"In my capacity as Prime Minister and Defense Minister, I have
instructed all of the security services to give top priority to
the war against terrorism in general, and particularly to the
terrorism of suicide attackers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Murder will not kill the peace process, but there will be no
forgiveness for murderers because of the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The closure, intelligence activities, the elimination of
sources of funding, outlawing the terrorist organizations, the
arrest of terrorist leaders, and other operational actions will
also leave their marks on the fight against terrorism," said
Peres.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has asked the governments of countries from
which Hamas receives funding to take measures in order to
halt the flow of funds.
</P>
<P>
The closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will continue
as long as it is required from a security standpoint, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli leader called on the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to do its part in the fight against
violence by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
He urged the PNA to disarm and outlaw extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority must decide whether there is room
in the Gaza Strip for para-military organizations which want to
harm peace, the (peace) agreement, and Israel or whether there is
room for only one organization authorized to carry weapons there
-- the Palestinian police," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Denies Involvement in Loan Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today denied opposition allegations that he received
illegal funds from the Fuji Bank in a 1991 scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, testifying before the House of Representatives
Budget Committee, said: "I cannot answer because I know nothing
about" the scandal.
</P>
<P>
He denied receiving any money from the Fuji Bank loans via a
female restaurant owner in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto resigned as finance minister in 1991 when one of his
secretaries was found to be involved in the loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Keiwa Okuda and Hiroshi Yamada, both members of the leading
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), questioned
Hashimoto about the case.
</P>
<P>
They have demanded the Diet (parliament) summon Toyoki
Kobayashi, a former secretary to Hashimoto and restaurant owner
Mariko Obana, as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Okuda said there might be an "unusual" transfer of 1 billion
yen (9.86 million U.S. dollars) to Obana and suspected 700 million
yen (6.9 million dollars) of that had gone to Hashimoto. But he
offered no evidence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kichinosuke Sakaki, the head of Togensha, one of the
main borrowers of the failed "Jusen" housing loan companies,
claimed Kobayashi had demanded a 40 million yen(395,000 dollars)
commission for helping arrange additional loans from the
Industrial Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
But Hashimoto denied the allegations, saying "I've never heard
such requests (from Kobayashi)."

<HEADLINE> Pontoon Bridge Opens Between Serb-held Bosnia, Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Implementation Force (IFOR)
units opened a pontoon bridge today over the Sava River to link
Serb-held Bosnia and Croatia near Gradiska in northern Bosnia,
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is intended to be used by IFOR units, but it may also
serve civilians and humanitarian organizations if the Serb and
Croatian sides reach agreement to that effect.
</P>
<P>
It is situated 300 meters upstream from the old Sava bridge, which
the Croats blasted in May last year during an offensive on western
Slavonia to prevent Croatian Serbs from crossing to Bosnian Serb
territories.
</P>
<P>
The new pontoon bridge, nick-named "Susan bridge," after 10
days of work by IFOR's Hungarian engineering troops under command
of Col. Attila Letai.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the bridge fell a bit behind the schedule because
of the mine fields in the area that had to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
This is the second pontoon bridge over the Sava river. The first
one near Zupanja in eastern Croatia, was built by U.S. IFOR troops at
the end of last year.

peaceful transition of Macao and in the implementation of the 'one
 country, two systems' policy'', he said.

<HEADLINE> Temples in Lhasa Hold Summons Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Lhasa, February 26 (Xinhua)-- Temples in this capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region today started the annual
Buddhist service of moinlam qenmo (summons ceremony), the biggest
religious festival on the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
Today is January 8 by the Tibetan lunar calendar. Worshippers,
on foot or travelling by taxi, tractor and other means, streamed
into temples and monasteries here to give alms and pray.
</P>
<P>
The Johkang Temple in the center of Lhasa was immersed in a
festive atmosphere, with huge crowds of Buddhist worshippers
converging onto it to mark the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the main halls of various temples, many believers were
praying, while others went among the lamas to give them brand-new
currency notes as alms.
</P>
<P>
Lamas from southern Tibet trekked to Lhasa to hold the
festivities. The worshippers included those from Tibet as well as
from neighboring Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth completion of the week-long event, the regional
government allocated special funds of up to 150,000 yuan. Special
teams were also dispatched to the temples to prepare food for and
give offerings to the lamas and Buddhist believers.
</P>
<P>
Moinlam qenmo dates back to 1409, the year when Tsong Kapa,
founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan lamaism, sponsored the first
such event in the Johkang Temple.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exports to Be Hurt by US Budget Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The budget impasse in
Washington will affect the trade privileges enjoyed by Philippine
exporters under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),
Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that local exporters could lose their preferential
trade access to the US market if the US Congress failed to approve
a measure extending the GSP, which expires on July 31, before it
goes on recess in July.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said that he earlier received a firm assurance from US
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the GSP would be renewed.
</P>
<P>
A budget bill sent last year to Capitol Hill by US President
Bill Clinton proposed to extend the scheme to January 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Philippine exporters have to pay duties to the
US customs service. A refund will be given once the GSP is
extended retroactively.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, along with its neighbors of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, has strongly lobbied for the extension of
the GSP, which allows about 1.3 billion US dollars of Philippine
exports to enter the US market at low or zero duties yearly.
</P>
<P>
However, US budget officials have been pressing the Clinton
administration to scrap the program, which cuts the yearly US
tariff revenues by 400 million to 500 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Beats Netherlands in World Cup Cricket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Paceman Waqar Younis
captured four for 26 and Saeed Anwar stroked a stylish half
century as holders Pakistan sped to an emphatic eight-wicket
victory over The Netherlands in their second World Cup Group B
match at the Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan's Lahore city today.
</P>
<P>
Younis hostile spell restricted the Dutch side to 145 for 7 in
50 overs after acting captain Roland Lefebvre won the toss and
opted to bat and Pakistan knocked off the required runs in only
30.4 overs, making 151 for 2.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan overcame the early loss of Aamir Sohail (9) who fell
in the fifth over to Lefebvre before Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad put
their team on the road to victory with their 74 runs second wicket
partnership in 123 balls.
</P>
<P>
The pair thrived on an easy-paced pitch against a weak bowling
of the debutant Dutch side to gain the World Champions their
second victory following its nine-wicket success over United Arab
Emirates on saturday at Gujranwala.
</P>
<P>
Ijaz left at 104 caught in the deep by Lefebvre off Peter
Cantrell after making a fine 39 from 54 balls with two fours and a
huge six off Tim Leede.
</P>
<P>
Anwar brought up his eighth 50 in his 84th one-day
international with his sixth four off Flavian Aponso after batting
for 90 minutes and 75 deliveries.
</P>
<P>
He finished off the match with his third six, lofting Krik
Gouka over long-on and was unbeaten 83, coming off 93 balls and
studded with nine fours and three sixes.
</P>
<P>
Inzamamul Haq made 18 from 14 balls including a big six towards
square leg off Aponso.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, playing their third match, were undermined
by 'Man of the Match' Waqar Younis who broke up the line-up in a
lethal spell.
</P>
<P>
After Aaqib Javed had removed Noland Clarke in his first over,
Younis, playing his first World Cup, claimed Peter Cantrell and
Tim Leede in three deliveries to take the wind out of Dutch sail.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four years old Aponso, was only the Dutch batsman to
offer any resistance to the Pakistan pace bowlers making the top
score of 58 from 106 balls and hitting three fours and a six.
</P>
<P>
Together with Klaas Noortwijk who was the next highest scorer
with 33, he shared the fourth wicket of 73 that gave some
respectability to the total.
</P>
<P>
Noortwijk departed at 102, caught by Mushtaq Ahmad off a
leading edge as he attempted to drive Aaqib Javed and Aponso was
eventually bowled by Younis who then uprooted the middle stump of
Lebvre for ten.
</P>
<P>
Bas Zuiderent was run out in the same over off the final
delivery when Salim Malik, fielding at deep point threw the ball
to Rashid Latif who swiftly removed the bails.
</P>

Karachi on February 29 while the Dutch side complete their league
match with the final game against South Africa at Rawalpindi on

The warning was sounded at a meeting of 12 Lusaka-based CSUZ
branch members.
</P>
<P>
CSUZ General Secretary Japhet Moonde said at the meeting that
the strike action was likely to take place because the government
had not reacted to the union's letter of February 9, which
demanded the full payment of the 45 percent increment.
</P>
<P>
"The union has done what it could in resolving the issue
amicably, but in vain because of the government's arrogance," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government has only paid the civil
servants 15 percent of salary increase instead of 45 percent this
month.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Asia Summit to Mark Start of New Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Europe-Asia summit, to be
held in Bangkok later this week, will mark the beginning of a new
relationship between the two regions, an article in the Financial
Times newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the first of its kind between government leaders of
the two regions, will provide an opportunity for Europe to latch
on to a region with some of the largest and fastest-growing
markets in the world, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Asia and America have set up their own relations through the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) and strong
Europe-America links have already been formed. But so far no
similar links have emerged between Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted the two regions' leaders as saying that
their "more direct contacts" are long overdue and the Bangkok
summit will certainly help fill the gap, the article said.
</P>
<P>
There may only be a modest outcome, but the significance lies
in closer political and economic contacts and economic cooperation
will be high on the agenda, it predicted.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also due to discuss reform in the United Nations,
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also give the EU an opportunity to promote an
international agreement on investment in the World Trade
Organisation, said the article.
</P>
<P>
While Asia is still the European Union (EU)'s largest export
market, its share of the booming market is shrinking and total EU
investment was just 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The article urged European businessmen to invest in Asia,
saying that European companies and products are competitive, need
a presence in the market and integrate.

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has eliminated
illiteracy among a large number of adults in 471 counties and
cities, according to a news conference held here today by the

<HEADLINE> Killings Reported In Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of people from the
Bantu community, a minority clan, have been killed in Lower Jubba
region of southern Somalia by Galje'el clansmen loyal to a
regional warlord who supports Mohamed Farah Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The community's spokesman, Ibrahim Mohamed Dirie, said today
the victims included children, women and elderly people who were
killed for separate pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them were killed for their wealth, others were poor
farmers whilst another number were expert farmers," Dirie said.
</P>
<P>
He cited Makomo Majemi, a rich man, who was shot dead by the
Galje'el militiamen in a village after he refused to comply with
the orders of the militiamen to work as a laborer in a farm
belonging to the Galje'els on February 13.
</P>
<P>
The Bantu community in Lower Jubba and Lower Shabelle regions
are constantly subjected to eradication policies adopted by the
strong militias mainly from central Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Dirie said his clansmen would from now re-arm so as to defend
their dignity and property.
</P>
<P>
In response to the alleged killings in Lower Jubba, Abdurahman
Ahmed Foodadde, a senior politician from the Galje'el community,
had strongly denied any such act carried out by his clansmen in
the region.
</P>
<P>
There could be minor clashes among the people living together
in the fertile region, Foodadde said, adding that he would invite
an independent committee to investigate the said killings.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a national government since late
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in early 1991. Tribal
strifes have often been reported here and there in Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, met here
this evening with General Dumitru Cioflina, chief of staff of the
Romanian army, and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his welcome to the Romanian visitors, Chi, who is
also a state councillor and China's minister of national defense,
said that there is long-standing friendship and co-operation
between the two countries and the two armed forces, which, in
Chi's words, have stood the test of time and changes.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he was convinced that Cioflina's current visit to
China will further enhance the development of friendship and
relations of co-operation between the two countries and the two
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Romanian visitors on China's reform and opening
drive, as well as the modernization of China's armed forces, Chi
noted that the Chinese side is willing to learn advanced
experience from its foreign counterparts, including the Romanian
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Cioflina, who is on his third visit to China, said that this
visit has enabled him to witness China's new achievements.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing exchanges between the two armed forces in
the past few years, Cioflina said, Romania hopes that the friendly
relations between the two armed forces can be continuously
developed and bilateral friendly co-operation in various fields
can be further strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Continue Ban on Reconditioned Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will continue to
ban the import of reconditioned cars in a bid to develop the
domestic automobile industry, Minister for Commerce Ahmed Mukhtar
was quoted as saying by the official APP today.
</P>
<P>
The giants of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
developed their auto industry without importing such vehicles, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, prices of reconditioned cars would be higher than
before if they are imported now as the devaluation of rupee is
driving up car prices in Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar also said that India would be given the Most Favored
Nation (MFN) status only when it eliminates non-tariff barriers
and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The hidden barriers put restrictions on the quantity of
Pakistan's exports to India, whereas the subsidies make India's
products cheaper than Pakistan's, he said.
</P>
<P>
India offers a number of subsidies for fertilizers, pesticides,
urea and basic industries that make some of their products
cheaper, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar said that even if Pakistan gives the MFN status to
India now, it would only benefit the industrialists in the port
cities of Bombay and Karachi as there is no bilateral trade
through the land route at present.

<HEADLINE> Dim Prospect for British Economy: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The "feel-good" factor will
remain elusive in Britain this year even if the Treasury cuts
interest rates again, a leading firm of accountants and
consultants warned today.
</P>
<P>
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, in its latest UK Economic Outlook also casts
doubt on Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's forecast of
rapid economic growth in 1996 due to strong consumption.
</P>
<P>
The firm says that there will be no recovery in house prices,
while structural shifts in the labor market towards more
short-term, part-time working means consumers will remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
It forecasts only a two per cent increase in gross domestic
product this year, against Treasury expectations of three percent.
</P>
<P>
Coopers and Lybrand's "feel good" index, drawing together a
broad range of economic variables affecting consumers, shows
consumer confidence has recovered since November.
</P>
<P>
But the index will remain in "feel-bad" territory throughout
this year even if Clarke cuts interest rates by another half a
point, the firm says.
</P>
<P>
Whereas a year ago companies exporting abroad were optimistic
due to buoyant overseas markets, those companies are now more
pessimistic as foreign economies have slowed, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The firm also forecasts that investment will remain weak as
businesses face further political and economic uncertainty.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean President Chun Stands Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President
Chun Doo-hwan today denied charges that he took nearly one billion
U.S. dollars in bribes while being head of state between 1980 and
1988.
</P>
<P>
Chun, whose trial by the Seoul District Court started today,
admitted accepting 900 million U.S. dollars in "secret funds"
while in office but denied taking bribes from business leaders.
</P>
<P>
He argued that he received the money as a matter of custom on
such special occasions as year-end, without intimidation or
special favors.
</P>
<P>
Chun, arrested on December 3, was indicted on January 12 on
charges of raising the slush fund from 42 major business leaders,
of which 270 million U.S. dollars was confirmed to be from bribes.
</P>
<P>
In court, Chun refused to give the names of politicians and
journalists to whom he had given a total of 114 million
U.S. dollars before going into exile at a remote buddhist temple
in late 1989. He said such revelations would have grave political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South Korean prosecutors said that Chun handed out 114
million U.S. dollars to politicians, journalists and other people
in an attempt to create a new political party so that they could
take part in the general elections on April 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
The former president, who was wearing a light blue prison
uniform at the court, appeared to be in a good shape despite
reports that he was still recovering from his three-week hunger
strike last December in protest at his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Five of Chun's key aides are also on trial for corruption --
former chief presidential bodyguard Ahn Hyun-tae, former Senior
Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Sakong Il, former
Director of the Agency for National Security Planning Ahn Moo-hyuk
and former member of the National Assembly Chung Ho-yong.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of helping Chun amass the slush fund which
reached 900 million U.S. dollars during Chun's term of office.
</P>
<P>
Chun's chief bodyguard Ahn confessed at an earlier hearing that
the former president directly instructed his close aides to
collect money from the country's major conglomerates for campaign
funds for the then-ruling Democratic Justice Party (DJP) in the
1987 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 election, DJP candidate Roh Tae-woo, Chun's
protege, emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
"We were told to collect in a forcible manner election funds
varying from 1.25 million to 3.75 million U.S. dollars depending
on the size of the enterprises. No one of them rejected the
request," Ahn said.
</P>
<P>
The second trial on Chun's graft scandal will be held on April
15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chung's successor Roh Tae-woo, who was taken into custody on
November 16 last year, has already undergone trial three times for
receiving 370 million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen
while in office between 1988 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, both Chun and Roh have also
been indicted for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the subsequent
crackdown on anti-government movement on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju,
the capital of South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny brought Chun to power and he ruled the country until
February 1988 when his successor, Roh, took over. Roh stepped down
in February 1993.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- India's economy has steadily
improved since 1991 with the growth rate of the gross domestic
product (GDP) reaching 6.3 percent in 1994-95 and annual grain
output touching a new high of 192 million tons, President Shankar
Dayal Sharma said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint session of both Houses of Parliament,
Sharma said that the gross domestic savings at current prices also
improved to represent 24.4 percent of the country's GDP in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
India's industrial production in the first six months of the
current financial year from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996 went
up by 12 percent from that of the corresponding period in 1994-95,
showing a strong revival, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate that almost reached 17 percent in
August 1991 has been put under control and was brought down to a
seven-year low of around 5 percent in the current year, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the government's strong support for the agricultural
sector, grain production and stocks have reached very comfortable
levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Exports went up by 24.17 percent in the first eight months of
the current financial year, while imports also grew as a result of
the overall growth of the economy and the industrial sector in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Sharma said that the country's foreign exchange reserves are at
a "comfortable" level of about 16 billion US dollars.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police has so
far arrested 20 Hamas activists in the Gaza Strip following the
suicide bombing attacks Sunday in Jerusalem and Ashkelon, which
left 25 people dead and 84 wounded, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hamas issued a leaflet Sunday in the Gaza Strip, claiming
responsibility for the attacks, saying the attacks were to mark
the 50th day of the assassination of this organization's bomb
expert Yehya Ayyash, known as "The Engineer."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today issued an
official statement to condemn the bombing attacks, saying the
attacks' purpose was to harm the peace process and the interest of
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more victims of the attacks were buried today, as 41
wounded people still remain in hospital, and 19 of them are in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli media, the closure imposed by the Israeli
army on the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the wake of the attacks is
to continue for a long period.
</P>
<P>
This was decided late Sunday night at a meeting attended by
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and senior army and security
officials.
</P>
<P>
Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal said today that the
closure is, in fact, a separation between Israel and the
Palestinians which was advocated by late Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel does not have to provide incomes for the
Palestinians, and this could be done by other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has pledged to boost its export-oriented economy
substantially by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is known for its scenic karst areas and as being the
ancestral home of many overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The regional government will increase its trade volume by ten
percent annually in the coming five years, and tap market
potential all over the world.
</P>
<P>
It plans to rearrange the structure of foreign trade, and
export more manufactured industrial goods than farm products and
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to attract a total of seven billion US dollars
in foreign investment over the next five years, including
investment from multinationals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangxi has decided to use more loans from other
countries and world organizations.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage overseas businessmen to invest in such
sectors as farming, water conservation, energy, transportation,
raw materials, and hi-tech and service trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Guangxi's trade volume reached 10.2
billion US dollars-worth during the 1991-1995 period. Meanwhile,
it absorbed a total of 3.33 billion US dollars in foreign
investment and earned some 507 million US dollars from tourism
during that period.

<P>
DALIAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle school
students in this coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province are enjoying a more colorful winter vacation this year.
</P>
<P>
The winter vacation will end at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
According to the local education bureau, most schools have
organized activities to make the month-long vacation more
meaningful for students, rather than watching tv programs and
doing homework at home.
</P>
<P>
The Xiangyang Primary School has opened an amusement park at
the school, where students can play games, learn painting and
calligraphy and enjoy sporting activities.
</P>
<P>
Students at Shuixian Primary School are enthusiastic about
making handicrafts once a week. Prizes will be given for excellent
handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
Many local primary schools have organized activities aimed at
teaching children to help their parents with the housework.
</P>
<P>
Another major activity is sports training programs with the aim
of making young people healthier, such as long-distance running,
track and field, and ball games. Some schools have even sponsored
winter camps to toughen up the students.
</P>
<P>
Some middle schools have organized tours to poor mountainous
regions and prosperous coastal areas to conduct social surveys.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of local primary and middle school students
participated in the "Hand in Hand" activity, during which they
wrote letters to their counterparts in the countryside, donated
money to sick students and visited army camps.

<HEADLINE> Iran Extends 230 Million Dollars Letters of Credit to China for Subway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has extended two letters
of credits totalling 230 million U.S. dollars to China for the
Tehran Subway project to be launched in early April, an official
source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Another letter of credit of 270 million dollars will be
extended by Iran to China by the end of the current Iranian year
to end on March 20, 1996, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Iran will dispatch a subway delegation to China soon for
discussion of Chinese loan for the project which is expected to
complete in two year's period.
</P>
<P>
Today, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani inspected the
construction process of the subway and the double track railway
of the electrical express train which is to run from Tehran to
Karaj and Mehr Shahr, satellite towns of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed by China and Iran, China will
provide locomotives and passenger cars for the project, and will
also be responsible for electricity, signaling and ventilation
system.
</P>
<P>
Route 1 of Teheran subway covers a distance of 35 kilometers,
from Jahan-e Koudak street in northern Tehran to the Mausoleum
of the Imam Khomeini, and route 2 runs from Dardasht, Tehran
Pars in eastern Tehran, to the starting point of Tehran-Karaj
highway, a distance of 21 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The first line will start operation by mid-February 1997,
according to Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The double track railway from Tehran to Karaj and Mehr Shahr
is being constructed over a distance of 41.5 kilometers, enabling
the train to travel at a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection, the president was briefed by the
experts working with the metro company on the progress made in
the construction of the Tehran subway.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani is also expected on Monday to inaugurate
the subway technical college in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution, Iran was depending on France to build
the metro network in the populous capital city. As early as 1970
French technicians came to Iran to start the feasibility studies
for the construction of the metro.
</P>
<P>
After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the French technicians
left Iran. This country decided to continue the subway project,
but the war with Iraq brought the metro project to a halt.
</P>
<P>
After the Iran-Iraq war, the authorities decided to continue
the metro project in a bid to rid the capital of its heavy
traffic. By the end of the war the unregulated migration of people
from provincial towns and villages turned Tehran into a city of
over 10 million people, quadrupled as compared with the population
in 1978.

<HEADLINE> HK Observatory Denies Blame for Cold Weather Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- the Hong Kong Observatory
has refused to take the blame for the government's failure to
prepare a contingency plan for Lunar New Year cold snap.
</P>
<P>
An observatory spokesman said the institution issued a warning
to the public on the change of temperature a few days before it
started lowering to freezing point.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to give weather forecasts. We are not supposed to
tell government departments what to do," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to comment on whether we came out with a proper
forecast," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Department and the Home Affairs Department
said last week that they were unable to prepare a plan because
they did not expect the old snap to last longer than the normal
one to two days.
</P>
<P>
The lack of coordination and preparation between the two
government departments was blamed for the high death toll caused
by the bleak weather.
</P>
<P>
There had been conflicting reports on the death toll caused by
the cold weather, with the figures ranging from 44 to 64 by Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Most victims were elderly people living in public housing
estates.
</P>
<P>
The observatory said the first warning was issued at about 4:15
p.m. on February 15 when it notified the public that it would be
"progressively cooler" over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
An expert explained the term "progressively cooler' meant the
public should expect a sudden change in temperature.
</P>
<P>
A forecast issued the following day, February 16, at 11:45
a.m. said it would be "cold over the Chinese New Year Holidays".
</P>
<P>
The term "cold" meant a temperature below 12 degrees
Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
And a government spokeswoman said the observatory was not in a
position to give its opinion on policy matters.
</P>
<P>
Records showed a drastic change in the weather on February 18,
with temperature dropping to a minimum of 8.5 degrees Centigrade
from 15.7 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
And the temperature dropped to 5.8 degrees Centigrade on
February 21, the coldest third Lunar New Year since 1933 and the
coldest this winter.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shoe Makers Complain About Higher Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers of plastic
footwear in East Java, Indonesia, have complained about the rising
price of polypropylene, a raw material in the industry, according
to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted sources from the East Java Chapter of the
Federation of Indonesian Footwear Manufacturers as saying that
higher prices of polypropylene will eventually lead to declining
sales of their products.
</P>
<P>
The rising price of polypropylene is believed to have a
significant impact on members of the federation, which consists
mostly of home industries and small-scale factories.
</P>
<P>
The price hike followed the government's decision earlier this
month to impose a 20-percent surcharge on propylene imports.
</P>
<P>
Economists have criticized the decision, saying that the
government should not sacrifice the competitiveness of companies
at the downstream level.

<HEADLINE> HK Considers Introducing New Road Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is considering
introducing an advanced electronic road pricing system to tackle
the long-standing problem of traffic congestion, according to a
local press report.
</P>
<P>
The system, now in use in Singapore, will be applied to all
motorized vehicles except public buses and emergency vehicles such
as ambulances, fire engines and police cars.
</P>
<P>
Those who enter the designated "Restricted Zones" -- the
central business districts -- must have a tag on the windscreen;
those without the tag will be automatically photographed and
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Commissioner for Transport, Lee Shu-chee, said
they were considering whether the system would work for Hong Kong,
and had obtained information from the Singapore Public Works
Department as a reference.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that Hong Kong may need a larger scale of the system
as congested areas are "scattered."
</P>
<P>
A fund of some 15 million HK dollars (1.9 million U.S. dollars)
was expected to be provided for a feasibility study of the system,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
If the system is approved, a trial will be carried out in one
of the congested zones before full implementation. It is
estimated that two to three years would be needed before the
system is in force in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Singapore spent about one billion HK dollars (128 million
U.S. dollars) to set up the system, which was converted from a
manual version that proved successful in suppressing
non-essential trips and encouraging the use of public transport
means.

<HEADLINE> World Solar Summit Preparatory Meeting Opens In Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day world solar summit
preparatory meeting opened here today to compile documents on a
plan of action, world solar fund, world solar charter and
international solar convention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, World Solar Commission
Chairman and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said there is
need to promote the use of solar energy within the Southern
African Development Community region as most member states are
not generating enough electricity to meet national requirements.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Zimbabwe would use solar energy to supplement the
rural electrification program since there are no adequate
resources to extend the national electricity grid to remote parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore my sincere hope that in your deliberations
you will come up with recommendations for innovative funding
mechanisms which would push renewable energies into mainstream of
energy development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world solar summit is scheduled to take place in Harare in
September this year.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Undecided on Hostage Release in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian army and the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were still waiting
today for the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) to make
a final decision on the release of the 13 hostages they have held
for seven weeks in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the release of the hostages, including six
foreigners, were dashed again Sunday as representatives of the
ICRC, as a mediator of the military-led rescue operation, returned
empty-handed from a three-hour meeting with the OPM at Geselama
village, Jayawijaya regency.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports on Saturday, the OPM kidnappers
had hinted that they might release the hostages on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the kidnappers Daniel Kogoya said that the release had
yet to be approved by their "highest leader" at the OPM
headquarters in Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information as to who this "highest
leader" might be, said Lt. Col. Maulud Hidayat, spokesman for the
Irian Jaya Trikora Regional Military Command.
</P>
<P>
Kogoya also asked for one more meeting with the ICRC in the
presence of defense attaches from the British and Dutch embassies.
</P>
<P>
He asked the rescue team to keep contact before any "final
decisions" are taken on the fate of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC's request to meet with the hostages was turned down by
Kogoya.
</P>
<P>
The rescue team gave food and medicine to the OPM and received
four rolls of film in return believed to contain pictures of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM abducted 26 people on January 8, including seven
foreigners who were on a scientific expedition in Irian Jaya.
Later 13 hostages, including a German, were released.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for the freedom of the hostages were first raised last
month when Christian missionaries secured an apparent agreement
with the OPM to release some hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, the OPM then fled into the jungle and broke off
contact with the outside world for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The OPM demanded the recognition of a West Papua state in Irian
Jaya in return for the release of their captives while the
Indonesian government rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> Trade Pact With S. Africa Urged In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- the Presidents of South Africa
and Zimbabwe have been urged to meet at the earliest opportunity
to look into the issue of establishing a trade pact between the
two countries as the lack of which is causing great constraints.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Zimbabwean MP Norman Zikhali in
Parliament while debating President Robert Mugabe's State of the
Nation Address, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Norman Zikhali said the issue was turning out to be a hot
potato, and if not properly handled, it might turn out to be
another form of destabilization.
</P>
<P>
''We do not want to be a dumping ground of South African
suppliers. When South Africa got rid of apartheid, we all
applauded, hoping that the entire region of Southern Africa was
going to be one bloc, particularly following the formation of
the Southern African Development Community which was going to
benefit the entire Southern African region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He contended that the opportunity still existed and there was
a capacity to set an example, perhaps for the African continent.
</P>
<P>
''All we need to do is to handle the matter carefully. Let us
not allow it to slip out of our hands, and be exploited by
enemies,'' he stressed.

MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Energy experts from the

promoting the exchange of information on energy-related matters
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The energy experts open their two days of discussion here
today, during which they will finalize plans for the possible
access of each member to the Internet in the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenichi Hatsui, chairman of the 6th meeting of the
APEC Energy Data Experts Group (AEDEG), exchange of information
has been proven to be more effective and easier through the global
computer network than the old practice of mailing each member's
report to other members.
</P>
<P>
The energy experts will also look into economic and social
indicators needed to make energy projections, data for final
energy consumption in a more disaggregated basis, energy demand
and supply projections.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Intelligence Abduct Wanted Fugitive from South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- In a recent success operation
inside the Israeli-occupied enclave in the south, the Lebanese
army intelligence abducted a fugitive, alleged perpetrator of a
car bombing in a Beirut suburb in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In what was called a "brave security action," the Military
Intelligence of the Lebanese Army kidnaped Ahmad Hallak, the
first suspect of the car bomb blast in the Shiite-populated Sfeir
neighborhood in December 1994, from his residence in the Israeli
self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon, the leftist
"As-Safir" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hallak, who used to be one of the most important collaborators
of the Israeli intelligence in Lebanon, escaped to the occupied
border strip and from there to Israel 24 hours after the Sfeir
bombing, which killed three people, including the brother of a
U.S.-wanted officer of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government believed that the main target of
the blast was Fuad Moghaniyeh, a Hezbollah officer whose
brother, Imad, was wanted in the United States for the 1985
hijacking of a Trans-World Airlines flight and the kidnaping
of several Westerners.
</P>
<P>
Obtained financial rewards for his operation, Hallak travelled
to Philippines with a Lebanese passport counterfeited for him by
the Israeli intelligence, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
After passing several months in the Southeast Asian country and
consuming 1,500 U.S. dollars monthly he received from the Israeli
intelligent agency Mossad, he asked a return on the grounds of his
unadaptability of the life there.
</P>
<P>
After coming back to the Jewish state, the Israeli
intelligence set up for him a home in the border strip in south
Lebanon where he resided by the name of Michel Abu Kheir.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Lebanese army intelligence in the border strip
informed Hallak's existence, and confirmed it with his
pictures. The army intelligence instructed to get him out of the
Israeli-occupied enclave, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations were carried out in the next two months during
which documents and registers were sent to and back, and the
Lebanese army intelligence provided to its agents necessary tools
and equipments.
</P>
<P>
Successfully managing to narcotize him with a special drug
mixed in his whisky cup, the agents put Hallak in the trunk of a
car which was driven to the areas the Lebanese government
controlled.
</P>
<P>
On the next day, the Israeli intelligence agents found the
absence of Hallak. After intensive investigations, the abduction
was confirmed and a large-scale arresting campaign was carried
out inside the border strip.
</P>
<P>
But until then, most of the Lebanese army's collaborators
taking part in the operation had left the enclave and arrived in
the areas under Lebanon's control, the report added.

BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah announced that its
guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol inside Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon this morning,
killing and wounding over 10 Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, military wing of Hezbollah or Party of

with machineguns and anti-tank rockets at the patrol, killing and
wounding some 12 Israeli soldiers," the statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another group of Hezbollah guerrillas attacked two
Merkava tanks of the Israeli forces, which were attempting to
offering a guarding cover to the Israeli patrol, damaging one of
the tanks.
</P>
<P>
A third group attacked the Israeli position at Qalaat
Ash-Shqif with rockets, preventing the Israeli troops inside from
reinforcing the targeted patrol, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted 10 minutes, and the guerrillas "controlled
the battlefield at the end," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> New Regulation on Protection of Wild Aquatic Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Wild aquatic animals have won
increased protection from the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has issued a circular which
regulates the hunting, selling and purchasing of wild aquatic
animals for research, breeding, exhibition and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the hunting, selling and the purchase of wild
aquatic animals under State protection will not be allowed without
permission from the provincial or central governments.
</P>
<P>
It says people who want to hunt, sell and purchase animals
granted first class protection status, or at the top of the
central government' protection list, must apply to provincial and
central government departments in charge of aquatic production for
permission.
</P>
<P>
The circular says it also requires the permission of provincial
department in charge of aquatic production to hunt, sell and
purchase wild aquatic animals which are classified as second class
protected animals, or less important ones on the State protection
list.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many aquariums have been built for exhibition
and performances of or by wild aquatic animals. This has produced
a positive influence on improving awareness among the general
public of wild aquatic animal protection, the circular adds.
</P>
<P>
However, some units and individuals have captured, sold,
purchased and utilized wild aquatic animals under State protection
without government permission, it says.
</P>
<P>
Many rare wild aquatic animals have died as a result of the
illegal activities, usually because of a lack of necessary
facilities and expertise, it adds.

<HEADLINE> China Reducing Soil-Eroded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Former barren mountains in
northwest China are covered in a colorful blanket of shrubs and
trees, and muddy water has become clean. It's all thanks to
government's efforts over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China consists of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai
provinces and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions,
where about 900,000 sq km of land was eroded.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the central and local governments joined forces to
tackle soil erosion problems. The work centered on around 2,000
streams and small rivers flowing through valleys in an area
covering a total acreage of 55,000 sq km. Total investment of
nearly one billion yuan was spent on treatment projects in the
valleys.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40,000 small water conservancy projects were carried out
and about 300,000 hectares of land reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have grown 200,000 ha of grass and planted one
million ha of trees to protect the land.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the newly afforested land was planted with
fruit trees, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In Xianyang City, Shaanxi, farmers planted 6,700 ha of fruit
trees in 17 small river valleys. As a result, the city's annual
fruit output has been raised to five million kg from one million
kg, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total grain output of 115 small river valleys in Shaanxi
Province which underwent treatment increased by 46 percent to
exceed 300 million kg.
</P>
<P>
In the Chaigou River Valley, Qinghai Province, the per-capita
annual income of local farmers has jumped from 56 yuan to over 500
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Iran Pays 6 Billion Dollar Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared that it would
pay 6 billion U.S. dollars of debts in the current fiscal year to
end on March 20, 1996, local daily Tehran Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Governor of Central Bank of Iran (CBI), said
that Iran had already paid back 5 billion dollars debts so far and
another 1 billion would be paid to foreign debt collectors next
month.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times quoted the CBI governor as saying that Iran has so
far paid back some 15 billion dollars of its debts and has managed
to reschedule another 15 billion dollars of deferred debts.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh pledged that Iran is to pay some 3 billion dollars
of its deferred debts in 1996 and 3.5 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CBI governor said that Iran's total foreign debts stand at
23 billion dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Specialists here noted that Iran's foreign debts were caused by
excessive investment in capital construction in the past five
years, drastic fall in oil export revenue because of drop in oil
prices and weakness of U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
In face of the tremendous foreign debt pressure, Iran has
adopted nationwide austerity program to curb in investment and
reduce imports.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference with local reporters Sunday, Nourbakhsh
announced that Iran's foreign exchange policy will remain
unchanged next year.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that state economy has registered a positive growth
and the tranquility that prevailed in the gold and foreign
exchange market over the past 10 months will continue in the next
year (to start March 20, 1996).
</P>
<P>
In line with government's financial policies, he added, the
dollar will maintain its fixed exchange rate of 3,000 rials next
year.
</P>
<P>
On state foreign currency earnings, Nourbakhsh said, total
revenues from exports in the first nine months of the current
Iranian year amounted to 13.8 billion dollars, of which 2.8
billion dollars were earned through the export of non-oil
commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's state run TV has

letting them tune into the small screen.
</P>
<P>
A group company in southwest China's Yunnan province recently

CCTV introduced the project in 1994, to popularize agricultural
science and technology among farmers in the poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Chu Shijian, chairman of the board of the Yunnan provincial
Hongta Group, said, "We hope more rural people will master the
scientific way to get rich."
</P>
<P>
Over the past more than 10 years, the group has put a total of
more than one billion yuan investment in helping farmers in
mountainous and remote areas to learn advanced agricultural
technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu Weicheng, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that
"Chinese farmers are hungry for culture and science today."
</P>
<P>
In more than 10 years, CCTV has set up 185 TV relay stations
across the country including Shanxi, Qinghai, Yunnan and Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Polling Starts In S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The first democratic
elections in 29 years are now underway in Sierra Leone, which is
beset by nearly five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
When polling opened at 7:00 am today, huge crowds queued at
the 300 polling stations in the capital Freetown to cast their
votes for both the presidential and parliamentary elections being
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Polling will close at 6:00 pm and altogether there are 2,020
polling stations erected throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The elections had been pledged by former Sierra Leonean Head
of State Valentine Strasser to end the civil war. Strasser was
ousted by the incumbent leader, Julius Maada Bio, in a January
bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
According to one election official, heavy polling is likely to
take place in and around the capital whereas this is unlikely in
the major towns in the interior.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC)
James Jonah said he is "hopeful there will be no violence".
</P>
<P>
This is in reference to the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) which has vowed to attack polling stations. The RUF
launched its revolt in 1991.
</P>
<P>
INEC has a total of 15,000 officials to run the elections at a
cost of 11 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Freetown remains quiet and there has not been any report of
violence.
</P>
<P>
In the interior, it is still not known what group fired shots
to government troops in the suburbs of Bo in the south on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, said Monday that
preliminary talks for a possible ceasefire between the RUF and
the Sierra Leonean are underway.
</P>
<P>
The high-level government team includes Foreign Minister
Melvin Chaloba. There are high hopes that a ceasefire may be
announced soon.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil, Gas Reserves See Big Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China discovered record
reserves of oil and gas in its sea territories in 1995, a report
by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The corporation discovered 83.88 million tons of oil in proven
and controlled reserves last year, and 98 billion cu m of gas in
geological reserves.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC said it made noted achievements in its own exploration,
as well as in research and evaluation work during the same year.
</P>
<P>
It basically verified reserves totalling 98 billion cu m of
natural gas in the "Dongfang 1-1" and "Ledong 15-1" gas fileds in
the Yinggehai Basin.
</P>
<P>
In "Weizhou 12-1," a high-yield oil and gas field in the Beibu
Gulf, proven and controlled oil reserves discovered amount to
38.35 million tons;
</P>
<P>
Proven reserves of the "Qinhuangdao 32-6," a major oilfield
discovered in the Bohai Bay, are estimated at 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC also made a breakthrough in the exploration of
"Zhu-3" sag in the Pearl River Estuary Basin by discovering a
structure with large deposits of oil and gas, named "Wenchang 8-3."
</P>
<P>
This year, the corporation plans to sink 28 wells, striving to
discover 50 billion cu m of natural gas in geological reserves, at
the same time hoping to find 120 million tons of crude oil in
geological reserves.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative estimates put offshore oil and gas output this
year at 13 million tons and 3.15 billion cu m, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Lacks Money For Refugee Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 450,000 Rwandan
refugees in Ngara District, Tanzania, are unable to return home
in big numbers because the Rwandan government has no money to
effect concrete re-settlement programs for them.
</P>
<P>
Local sources told reporters over the weekend that effective
repatriation of refugees living in Tanzania could only be made
possible if the international community supported the Rwandan
government in full and not by mere pledges.
</P>
<P>
"It should be remembered that the majority of the 450,000 plus
refugees in Ngara lost almost everything -- houses, properties
and farms, because they have been away from home for almost two
years", they stressed.
</P>
<P>
This means that nearly half a million people need new homes at
their villages where the majority of the houses are inhabitable.

<HEADLINE> HK Considers Introducing New Road Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is considering
introducing an advanced electronic road pricing system to tackle
the long-standing problem of traffic congestion, according to a
local press report.
</P>
<P>
The system, now in use in Singapore, will be applied to all
motorized vehicles except public buses and emergency vehicles such
 as ambulances, fire engines and police cars.
</P>
<P>
Those who enter the designated "Restricted Zones" -- the
central business districts -- must have a tag on the windscreen;
those without the tag will be automatically photographed and
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Commissioner for Transport, Lee Shu-chee, said
they were considering whether the system would work for Hong Kong,
and had obtained information from the Singapore Public Works
Department as a reference.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that Hong Kong may need a larger scale of the system
as congested areas are "scattered."
</P>
<P>
A fund of some 15 million HK dollars (1.9 million US dollars)
was expected to be provided for a feasibility study of the system,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
If the system is approved, a trial will be carried out in one
of the congested zones before full implementation. It is
estimated that two to three years would be needed before the
system is in force in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Singapore spent about one billion HK dollars (128 million US
dollars) to set up the system, which was converted from a manual
version that proved successful in suppressing non-essential trips
and encouraging the use of public transport means.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Expand Trade with Luxembourg: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's minister of foreign
trade and economic cooperation said here today that there is
immense potential for more trade with Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Minister Wu Yi called for an expansion of economic and trade
links with the European country and Luxembourg also expressed a
desire to enhance ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi made the remarks at a working luncheon with visiting
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg in the capital
today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said there is a very good momentum in the development of
Sino-Luxembourg economic and trade relations. Last year the
bilateral trade volume reached 60 million US dollars. Wu added,
however, this level is still below the record mark in the history
of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems in the current economic and trade relations
between the two countries is that there are only a few varieties
of commodities. She added that the scope of bilateral trade should
be widened in order to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister suggested that the two sides offer a more detailed
list of their respective export commodities at the next meeting of
the mixed-committee of economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said the Luxembourg-China trade ties should be raised
to a higher level and the two countries should work for the
expansion of economic and trade ties on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the document on economic and trade cooperation to
be signed by the two sides indicated Luxembourg's desire to
enhance the economic cooperation and trade with China.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs accompanying him on the visit are expected to
discuss issues on specific projects with their Chinese
counterparts, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also thanked Luxembourg for providing government loans to
China, saying that the loans, which are of mutual benefit, have
helped bring the commodities of Luxembourg into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that Luxembourg will increase its
assistance to China in such projects as poverty-relief,
environmental protection and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon, Wu also heard briefings by the entrepreneurs
and businessmen from Luxembourg.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top ten gold
production bases have proved to be real gems in the past year.
</P>
<P>
One gold production base in east China's Shandong Province
produced 22 tons of the valuable metal last year.
</P>
<P>
The output by the top ten bases accounted for almost three
quarters of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from government sources show that they performed
outstandingly in the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95)
period.
</P>
<P>
The gold base bordering Henan and Shaanxi provinces produced
13.5 tons of gold. Output from the Liaoji base and Heilongjiang
base in northeast China rose to 6.3 tons respectively. Gold from
the Chengde base in north China amounted to 5.9 tons. Gold
producers in south China also did well in production.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Closure on Gaza, West Bank to Be Lengthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided that the
closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be a
"prolonged" one, Israel Radio said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting between Prime Minister
Shimon Peres and top security officials Sunday night following two
suicide bombing attacks on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Among those at the meeting with Peres were Chief of General
Staff Amnon Shahak, General Security Service (GSS) head Ami
Ayalon, Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz, Internal Security
Minister Moshe Shahal and Peres' military aide Danny Yatom.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip immediately
after the two attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bus bombing in Jerusalem was the worst of its kind
since Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo accords in 1993. So
far, 24 people have been confirmed dead, including eight
soldiers and two American students.
</P>
<P>
In Ashkelon, the blast at a hitchhiking post killed one
Israeli soldier and the suicide bomber himself.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 people were wounded in the two incidents, many
of them still in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for both bomb blasts to
avenge the killing of Hamas master bomb-making expert Yihye Ayyash
last month and to mark the second anniversary of the "Hebron
Massacre."
</P>
<P>
Israel has suspended its talks with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) at least until the funeral period of the bombing
victims.
</P>
<P>
Despite the deadly blasts, Peres pledged Sunday that Israel is
determined to carry on the peace process as well as to combat
violence by Islamic extremists "without any hesitation, any
postponement or any restriction."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres has demanded that the PNA take actions to
destroy infrastructure of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other
extremist organizations in areas under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent responding gesture, the PNA arrested at least
five Hamas members Sunday.

LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former President
Kenneth Kaunda has reiterated that he is ready to fight and win
through the ballot in this year's presidential and general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda made the reiteration while addressing cadres of the
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) here shortly
after his returning from a trip to Europe on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nobody would stop him from contesting the elections late this

</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he was ready to go to jail with a number of UNIP
supporters if the ruling party decided to lock them up, using the
police for disagreeing with them on important national issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kaunda urged the police force to be neutral in the
country's politics. "They must maintain law and order without
prejudice," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a clause in the draft constitution, Kaunda is not
qualified for a presidential candidate because his father is not

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Japan to End Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today urged Japan to give up the policy
of hostility towards it.
</P>
<P>
"We attach importance to the stated self-determined,
independent diplomacy of the new government of Japan," said Rodong
Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Worker's Party of Korea, in a
lengthy commentator's article today.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Japan had been pursuing a policy against
the reunification of the Korean Peninsula ever since Korea was
liberated from under its colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The article criticized Japan for dancing to the tune of others
without an independent principle and forgetful of its own
interests when handling its relations with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the two countries had opened talks for
the normalization of diplomatic relations but under pressure from
the U.S. and South Korea, Japan raised the settlement of the
"nuclear issue" as a precondition, bringing the talks to a rupture.
</P>
<P>
"Japan should learn a due lesson from its past Korea policy and
behave properly before it is too late," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The commentator said that the normalization of DPRK-Japan
relations is, in essence, liquidation of Japan's past wrongdoings
and establishment of peaceful, good-neighbourly relations between
the two countries without sacrificing peace and security in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the DPRK and Japan can never be
improved if Japan plans to stick to its past policy of hostility
toward the DPRK and alignment with South Korea, it said.

<HEADLINE> HK Observatory Denies Blame for Cold Weather Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- the Hong Kong Observatory
has refused to take the blame for the government's failure to
prepare a contingency plan for Lunar New Year cold snap.
</P>
<P>
An observatory spokesman said the institution issued a warning
to the public on the change of temperature a few days before it
started lowering to freezing point.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to give weather forecasts. We are not supposed to
tell government departments what to do," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to comment on whether we came out with a proper
forecast," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Social Welfare Department and the Home Affairs Department
said last week that they were unable to prepare a plan because
they did not expect the old snap to last longer than the normal
one to two days.
</P>
<P>
The lack of coordination and preparation between the two
government departments was blamed for the high death toll caused
by the bleak weather.
</P>
<P>
There had been conflicting reports on the death toll caused by
the cold weather, with the figures ranging from 44 to 64 by Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Most victims were elderly people living in public housing
estates.
</P>
<P>
The observatory said the first warning was issued at about 4:15
p.m. on February 15 when it notified the public that it would be
"progressively cooler" over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
An expert explained the term "progressively cooler' meant the
public should expect a sudden change in temperature.
</P>
<P>
A forecast issued the following day, February 16, at 11:45 a.m.
said it would be "cold over the Chinese New Year Holidays".
</P>
<P>
The term "cold" meant a temperature below 12 degrees
Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
And a government spokeswoman said the observatory was not in a
position to give its opinion on policy matters.
</P>
<P>
Records showed a drastic change in the weather on February 18,
with temperature dropping to a minimum of 8.5 degrees Centigrade
from 15.7 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
And the temperature dropped to 5.8 degrees Centigrade on
February 21, the coldest third Lunar New Year since 1933 and the
coldest this winter.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Language To Be Taught In Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Universiti Pertanian
Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia's national university, will introduce a
course on the Vietnamese Language this July in efforts to promote
greater understanding between members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
UPM's vice-chancellor Syed Jalaludin Syed Salim told the press
today that the move was made possible by a memorandum of
understanding signed here today between the UPM and Vietnam
National University (VNU), which is located in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Syed Jalaludin said: "We may also
send Malay language experts to VNU to promote the study of our
language in Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
Hoping the cooperation between the two universities would be
extended to other areas, the vice-chancellor said the UPM students
could take Vietnamese as a major or a second major, thus enabling
them to enter the job market with greater flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Representing the VNU at the ceremony, VNU President Nguyen Van
Dao said Vietnam should emulate Malaysia's policy of emphasizing
education in its path towards development, adding: "We need to
(lay) stress on education to develop as Vietnam now is where
Malaysia was 20 years ago."

<HEADLINE> Medical Output Value of Jiangsu Ranked first Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The medical industry has
provided a healthy future for east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Output from the industry last year was a real tonic for the
province, earning 11.3 billion yuan. It represented 11 percent of
the country's total earnings from the medical industry, and meant
that Jiangsu ranked first among all provinces.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years the medical industry in the province
has accelerated its own restructuring and developed a large number
of new products. Twenty of those products now earn an output value
of over 100 million yuan each, and 60 products dominate more than
50 percent of national markets.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 11 medical conglomerates had been
established in the province. The groups take in 48 firms that each
has a turnover of over 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province's major industrial cities of Suzhou, Wuxi and
Changzhou have made efforts to develop their medical industries
into pillar industries. More than 70 percent of the province's
commercial taxes and profits have come from these industries, as
well as over 57 percent of output value from the three cities.
</P>
<P>
Over one billion yuan has poured into some 700 scientific
research and development projects during the past five years, and
504 new products have been developed within the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the output value of the province's medical industry
topped 2.05 billion yuan (about 247 million US dollars), 5.26
times that of 1980, with an average annual growth rate topping 40
percent.

however, reached 12.2 percent. The value has scored a double-digit
growth for five years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Various localities in the province have taken different
measures to spread science and technology. In Qionghai City 100
new techniques have yielded 521 million yuan (about 63 million US
dollars) since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The city has established science and technology training bases
at various levels. Since 1991 these bases have held more than
3,560 courses, providing training in specialized production skills
for more than 220,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Baisha County has provided in-service training for farmers,
teaching them to raise fast-growing pigs. It has also established
121 model bases for farmers to learn how to plant hybrid rice,
cane sugar, cassava and natural rubber.
</P>
<P>
Chengmai County, has intensified co-operation with research
institutions to develop the processing of agricultural
products. The county has invented a "coffee-wine." A winery with
an annual capacity of 400 tons and an annual production value of
12.5 million yuan has been set up in the county.

<HEADLINE> Official Results of Polls Declared in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gazette, dated February 20, was made available to the EC
Sunday, five days after its publication.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, results of six other constituencies are in
the process of gazette notification while the dates for re-polling
in 84 constituencies will be announced soon. Elections in the
constituencies were postponed for rigging and violence.
</P>
<P>
An earlier EC announcement said that except one candidate from
a small party and another independent candidate, the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won all the other parliamentary
seats during the polls.
</P>
<P>
The country's 6th parliamentary elections were held in 298
constituencies, out of 300, on February 15. The polling in other
two constituencies were canceled following the death of a
candidate and a court injunction for the other.
</P>
<P>
While the BNP took part in the elections along with some small
parties and independent candidates, all opposition parties
boycotted the polls and demanded for cancellation of the poll and
resignation of the BNP government to pave the way for a neutral
caretaker government to conduct a fresh national poll.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Chief Election Commissioner Justice A.K.M.
Sadeque after the publication of the EC gazette, Zillur Rahman,
general secretary of the Awami (People's) League, the largest
opposition party in the country, questioned how the EC could
publish the gazette notification on public holidays on February
20-23 on the occasion of the Eid-ul-Fitr and the Shaheed day,
festivals of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal and unconstitutional for the BNP government to
publish the incomplete and fabricated results with back date, the
opposition leader alleged.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that candidates elected in the February 15
elections are likely to be sworn in soon and the president will
call upon the BNP chairperson to form the next government
afterwards.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Meets on Cuban Air Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council met Sunday night in an emergency closed-door session,
considering a U.S.-drafted presidential statement that would
condemn Cuba for shooting down two American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the council was first briefed by a CIA
officer on how the two civil airplanes were shot down by Cuban
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
According to the CIA officer, a Cuban Mig-29 aircraft destroyed
the two Cessna planes piloted by Cuban exiles on Saturday by
firing air-to-air missiles at them while they were over
international waters.
</P>
<P>
Russian U.N. Envoy Sergey Lavrov told reporters after the
session that council members have asked the U.S. to provide more
information on the shooting before taking any action. And they
suggested that the U.N. Secretariat should make some assessment of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said she was "heartened" by
the general understanding of the council members that Cuban action
was not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
She said that the case was "a blatant violation of
international law" and that Cuba should not have shot the civil
aircraft either in or outside its territorial space according to
Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
Germany, South Korea and Chile joined the United States in
condemning Cuba for the shootdown.
</P>
<P>
"This incident is a threat to international order, a council
reaction is necessary," said a German diplomat attending the
council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has insisted that the two civil planes were shot down
within its territorial space and that the incursion was one of the
many conducted by exile Cubans in Florida, the United States,
which were designed to undermine the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
It said the Cuban government decided to interrupt the
continuation of the flights by terrorist groups of Cuban origin
after repeated warnings.
</P>
<P>
"The shooting down of two pirate aircraft should be a lesson to
be learned by those who encourage and carry out such actions which
tend to increase tensions between Cuba and the United States,"
said a press release by the Cuban mission to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Issues Decree to Punish Trade Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 26 (Xinhua)-- The Vietnamese government has
issued a decree to specify punishments and fines for
administrative violations in trade, according to the latest issue
of the Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
All state-run firms, domestic private companies,
foreign-invested businesses, as well as individuals and
international groups working in Vietnam will be subject to the
decree, the English-language weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Punishments will be pitched at two levels: warnings and
financial punishment.
</P>
<P>
For the latter, foreign-invested businesses in breach of the
code will be fined between 2 million and 100 million Vietnamese
Dong (181-9,000 U.S. dollars), depending on the severity of the
violations which cover cases involving amounts too minor for court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Fines for Vietnamese companies range from 50,000 to 50 million
Vietnamese Dong (4.5-4,500 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In severe cases, punishments could result in temporary or
permanent suspension of a business license or in confiscation of
goods.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Starts First Trial of Former President Chun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The first trial of former South
Korean President Chun Doo-hwan charged with taking bribes began at
the Seoul District Court here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a light blue prison uniform, the ex-president, 65,
seemed composed and even smiled when he got out of his ambulance
and was asked about his health this morning by reporters.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said that Chun seems to be in good health. But
some hospital physicians indicated that the former president is
still suffering from the side-effects of his 26-day fast.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the same court are Chun's five key aides
who were charged with helping the former president in raising a
large slush fund.
</P>
<P>
The five are Chun's former chief bodyguard Ahn Hyun-tae, former
National Tax Administrator Sung Yong-wook, former Senior
Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Sakong Il, former
Director of the Agency for National Security Planning Ahn Moo-hyuk
and former member of the National Assembly Chung Ho-yong.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, was indicted on
January 12 on charges of amassing about one billion U.S. dollars
while in office from 42 major business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chun has been receiving medical treatment at the National
Police Hospital here since December 21 due to symptoms of
dehydration and malnutrition resulting from his hunger strike to
protest against his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Chun is the second former head of state of South Korea to stand
trial. Former President Roh Tae-woo, who was taken into custody on
November 16 last year after being arrested, has stood trial three
times already on charges of taking 370 million dollars in bribes
from businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, Chun and Roh have also been
indicted for insurrection and treason for their leading part in
the 1979 military mutiny and the 1980 military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in Kwangju, Capital of the country's South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the Army strongman after the military
mutiny on December 12, 1979, seized power on August 27, 1980 and
ruled the nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who
stepped down in February 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is in
for a sharp attack by the opposition parties on hawala and other
corruption issues in the parliament session which will open
Monday, the Financial Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, however, is not in favor of a no-confidence
motion at the end of the term of the House of the People. The
Delugu Desam Party (Naidu Group), a main component of the National
Front-Left Front combine, proposed the motion last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is likely to make immediate announcement of the
general elections date a major issue and launch a scathing attack
on the Indian government for keeping it shrouded.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to demand Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's
resignation, holding him as guilty as his former ministers over
their alleged involvement in the hawala (illegal foreign exchange
dealer) bribery scandal. The demand would come in a series of
adjournment motions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian cabinet met Sunday to discuss the
strategy to counter the opposition offensive.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had a last look at the presidential address to the
joint session Monday and finalized the issues to be taken up by
the government.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Car Sales Likely to Slow Down in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Thailand are
likely to fall short of the 600,000 target this year because of
the central bank's credit squeeze, industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
Private car sales last year totaled 571,580 units, an increase
of 17 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But the Bank of Thailand's tighter policy on leasing loans will
slow sales down this year, according to Surapong Paisitpatnapong,
spokesman of the Thai Automobile Industry Club.
</P>
<P>
The bank told finance companies late last year to enforce
stricter conditions on leasing loans.
</P>
<P>
Buyers must make down payments of at least 25 percent, and must
pay off their vehicles within 48 months instead of 60.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also capped finance companies' leasing loan
growth at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
These moves are part of the central bank's campaign to keep
inflation and the current account deficit in check by controlling
consumption of non-staple goods.
</P>
<P>
The car industry feels that it is being hit hard. Although
demand is still high, the credit squeeze will deny many consumers
a chance to purchase cars this year.
</P>
<P>
Car manufacturers say the government should support sales of
cars assembled locally or with locally produced parts.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is aiming to become an automobile production base in
Southeast Asia and make the industry a base for foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> India's CBI May Close Probes on 15 Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) is likely to close investigations against at
least 15 politicians in the hawala case, including four government
ministers whose names figured in the infamous Jain diaries, the
Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The four ministers are External Affairs Minister Pranab
Mukherjee, Minister of State for Environment and Forests Rajesh
Pilot, Health Minister A.R. Antulay and Minister of State for
Civil Supplies Krishna Sahi.
</P>
<P>
Former president of the Janata Dal Party S.R. Bommai, who
resigned over his alleged involvement in the 18-million-US-dollar
bribery scandal, will also be absolved of the charges, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
All these politicians were listed in the diaries of suspected
illegal foreign exchange dealers (hawala dealers) -- the Jain
brothers -- as recipients of hawala payoffs.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the CBI will inform the Supreme Court that
it has not been able to find "enough evidence" to proceed against
these 15 politicians as they were not holding public office when
the alleged payments were made and recorded in the Jain diaries.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has so far filed charge sheets against 24 politicians
for allegedly receiving money from the hawala dealers and is
expected to proceed against outgoing Delhi chief minister Madan
Lal Khurana today.

KATHMANDU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Five Nepali people have been
arrested recently in Thailand and kept in police custody, a
newspaper here reported today.
</P>
<P>
The five Nepalis had gone to Thailand in search of job after
paying money to employment broker agencies in Kathmandu two
months ago, the Kathmandu Post daily quoted a source from the
Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, these Nepali workers were detained
in a Thai jail and their passports had been seized by the Thai
authorities.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said Sunday that he had
 no information about those Nepalis jailed in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that local manpower supply agencies sometimes
send Nepali workers abroad with false job promises after taking
hefty payments from them and leave them stranded in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
These workers were often arrested by foreign authorities or
languished there helpless, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had sent an investigation team to learn
about the situation of those stranded in foreign countries,
including Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Keating To Quit Labor Leadership If Unelected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating said today that he would quit as the leader of the
Australian Labor Party if the party were defeated in the March 2
federal election.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can win the election. But were we not to, I mean I
certainly wouldn't be leader of the Labor Party," Keating told a
local radio station in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But he said in last night's television debate that he would
remain in politics even if he lost office in the election
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The results of a public opinion poll published today showed
that Labor was still lagging behind the opposition coalition of
the Liberal and National parties when there was only one week
before the federal election.
</P>
<P>
The AGB McNair Poll conducted last weekend showed that 39
percent of voters will vote for Labor Saturday while 47 percent
will vote for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
If the figures proved to be true in the national poll Saturday,
Labor would lose the federal office in a crashing defeat.
</P>
<P>
But the poll also showed that Keating had narrowed the gap with
the opposition leader John Howard as the preferred prime minister.
Some 44 percent of voters favored Keating as the better candidate
for the prime minister while 45 percent endorsed Howard.
</P>
<P>
Keating became the preferred prime minister in New South Wales
and Victoria, the two states with the largest number of federal
parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, there was a turn of tide in people's
confidence in the Labor government's re-election. There are 45
percent of voters believing that Labor will win the election while
37 percent think the opposition will win. This is in contrast
with the voters' favoritism toward the opposition one week ago,
when 43 percent predicted an opposition victory and 38 percent
foresaw a Labor win.
</P>
<P>
Keating won a television debate with Howard again last night.
But the local press said that neither side had obtained a clear
edge over the other that could gave them an easy win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Labor won over a large amount of voters from the opposition
support basis in Tasmania and improved strongly in both New South
Wales and Victoria. But it is still far behind the opposition in
Queensland and losing support in South Australia.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Labor's hope would rest on Keating's
ability to pull off a big last-minute swing of uncommitted voters
toward the party.
</P>
<P>
Keating succeeding Bob Hawk as the leader of the Labor Party
and the prime minister in late 1991. He was re-elected prime
minister in the 1993 federal election.

Major slices of farmland were lost because of a local custom

</P>
<P>
However, because the region lies on the southern fringee of the
Tengger Desert, the desertification of farmland was serious, said
a local agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
A large water conservancy project was finished last October,
with the cooperation of experts from China, Japan, Italy,
Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It takes water from the Datong River, which lines the border of
Gansu and Qinghai provinces, to the Qinwangchuan Prefecture, 60 km
north of Lanzhou City, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the project will help local farmers in
the prefecture to reclaim 57,000 hectares of desert.
</P>
<P>
About 280,000 farmers in Yongdeng and Gaolan counties have
raised nearly 20 million yuan. The money will be used to remove a
sand dune as thick as 30 cm from their land, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local government has bought 130 bulldozers to help
the farmers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The farmers have already reclaimed 21,600 ha of desert, the
official added. The acreage of the region's irrigated area has
increased by 19,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the farmers have also repaired and upgraded more
than 2,000 km of roads and planted trees to form a 400 km-long
shelterbelt.
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to move 80,000 people from
poverty-stricken areas to the region. So far, 11,000 people have
already resettled, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Out to Attract More Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment of the
Thai government will try to revive a flagging trend for small and
medium-sized Japanese manufacturers to move their factories to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The board had hoped Japanese investors would establish 1,500
factories in Thailand between 1995 and 1997. But only 300 were set
up last year.
</P>
<P>
The recent depreciation of the Japanese yen was a key factor
slowing down Japanese investment in Thailand and most Japanese
manufacturers had decided to stay home, a board source is quoted
as saying by the local media today.
</P>
<P>
The board has teamed up with the Industry Ministry, Thai
Industrial Estate Association and 15 industrial estate developers
to reverse the trend by promoting Thailand as the best factory
site in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japanese remained the major foreign investors in Thailand while
funds from Taiwan and Hong Kong had decreased.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in the total number of foreign investment
projects in Thailand, their overall value has doubled.
</P>
<P>
Applications for investment dropped from 1,407 projects in 1994
to 1,200 last year, but the state costs of the schemes doubled to
580 billion baht (23.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The board also planned to attract investors from Eastern Europe
and Australia by holding roadshows there.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Meeting in Bangkok starting Friday would be a
good chance for Thailand to show it was among the best industrial
sites in terms of setting and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Chun Goes on Trial on Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's former President
Chun Doo-hwan went on trial today on charges of accepting 900
million U.S. dollars in bribes while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun, 65, was not handcuffed, unlike most criminal suspects. On
trial with him in the Seoul District Court were five former aides
who were accused of helping him raise the largest slush fund in
South Korean history.
</P>
<P>
The five are Chun's former economic planner Sa Kong-Il, former
security chief Ahn Moo-Hyuk, ex-chief bodyguard Ahn Hyun-Tae,
former tax administration head Sung Yong-Wook and former ruling
party legislator Chung Ho-Yong.
</P>
<P>
Chun, president of the east Asian country from 1980 to 1988, is
the second ex-president to stand trial for alleged wrongdoings
while in office, following Roh Tae-Woo who ruled the country from
1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh may also face trial in March on mutiny and treason
charges arising from the 1979 coup and a 1980 military crackdown
that killed some 200 pro-democracy protestors.
</P>
<P>
Chun's trial, originally scheduled for February 5, was
postponed because of health problems from the 26-day hunger strike
he staged in prison in December to protest what he called
politically-motivated charges against him. Chun was arrested on
December 3.

<HEADLINE> China's First Contraception Hotline Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's most
populous country, has opened its first contraceptive hotline phone
service.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the Beijing-based hotline is to provide emergency
counselling and help to couples who suffer contraception failures.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, (010) 2173454, is sponsored by a reproduction
medical center affiliated to the Science Research Institute under
the Ministry of Public Health, says a report in "China Population
News".
</P>
<P>
The center opened an emergency contraception clinic last
September in Beijing to cater for the increasing number of people
who experience failures in contraception. Reasons usually range
from condom leaks, contraceptive breakdown or mistakes in
calculating the safe time for sex.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 30 percent of women who do not take
reliable or secure measures in their mating risk pregnancy, and
these women account for up to half of women undergoing abortions
to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, the clinic has provided counselling
and help for more than 50,000 telephone callers.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xiao Bilian, a noted birth control expert in China, said
that the emergency contraception service is to be further
publicized as an effective way of fighting unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
China is working towards finding a more convenient and secure
after-sex medicine for its fertile women, Xiao added.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Produce More Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia has turned
desert land into green pastures to help it become self-sufficient
in grain production.
</P>
<P>
Now the autonomous region in north China is even selling grain
to the state at the rate of three billion kilograms a year.
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry from the 1960s when Inner Mongolia was forced
to tackle its own shortages by buying an average one billion kg of
grain from other areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The region, comprised mainly of Gobis and grasslands, is even
expected to produce an extra 3.5 billion kg of grain in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government introduced a number of
policies in 1987 to encourage farmers to produce more food
grain. The aim was to turn poor harvests into bumper crops to
ensure that Inner Mongolia became self sufficient in grain
supplies.
</P>
<P>
More than three billion yuan was invested by the regional
government in agriculture infrastructure facilities and animal
husbandry production. This has helped increase the area of
irrigated land from some 1.1 million hectares to 1.5 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The region also initiated a Bumper Harvest Plan and Spark
Program which increased grain output in the region. The
construction of commodity grain production bases and comprehensive
agriculture production facilities were extended to cover 247
project areas.
</P>
<P>
Now the region has the capacity to produce 10 billion kg of
grain, 725 million kg of oil-bearing crops and 2.5 million kg of
beet. And the result of the initiatives means that the region
sells over three billion kg of grain to the state each year.

<HEADLINE> China to Pay More Attention to Aquaculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
make greater efforts to develop aquaculture in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
An extra seven million tons of seafood will be produced by the
year 2000. Aquaculture will account for 85 per cent of the total
increase, according to Yang Jian, deputy director of the Fisheries
Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Aquaculture development will rely both on enhancing yields and
expanding aquaculture acreage.
</P>
<P>
Reproduction excellence and disease prevention are now at the
top of the scientific research list.
</P>
<P>
More than 3.5 million ha. of coastal and inland waters are
expected to be developed into aquaculture fields with existing
technology. Some six million ha. of rice fields can be developed
to rice-aquaculture areas to further boost biological aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
To conserve resources, China should restrict boat numbers and
fishing in offshore areas in the next five years, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
A moratorium on offshore fishing will continue this year, but
it will not be extended in time or area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Further efforts should be made to protect fish resources, said
Yang.
</P>
<P>
Last year, aquatic production grew to 23.5 million tons,
one-fifth of the world's total production. Some 55 per cent of
China's aquatic production came from aquaculture, compared with
the world ratio of 16 per cent.

<HEADLINE> State Bookstores facing challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The days when China's book
distribution was dominated by the State-run Xinhua bookstores are
gone, and these shops are challenged by millions of self-employed
book-sellers today.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily today, revitalizing the Xinhua
bookstores has become an urgent question, and the Dezhou Xinhua
Publication and Distribution Group in east China's Shandong
province has become a role model for change.
</P>
<P>
The group has been honored by the State Media and Publication
Administration as a pace-setter for all the Xinhua bookstores. Its
general manager, Liu Qiang won the Fourth China Zou Taofen
Publishing Award last November.
</P>
<P>
Compared with private book-sellers, the distribution channels
of the Xinhua bookstores are not so open. To change this, the
Dezhou Xinhua Publication and Distribution Group decided to study
the book market to gain the latest information.
</P>
<P>
The group was aware of the importance of readership demands and
soon established business relations with more than 100 national
and regional publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of school pupils, the group co-published
100,000 sets of "A Collection of Test Papers for Primary and
Middle Schools Pupils."
</P>
<P>
Considering that Dezhou is an agricultural area, the group has
distributed a large number of agricultural science books, helping
local farmers to get rich in a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
The "Dezhou experience" has aroused the keen interest of both
publishers and policy-makers. Last October, the State Media and
Publication Administration sent a three-member team to
Dezhou. After a four-day careful investigation, the team concluded
that the Dezhou Xinhua Publication and Distribution Group is
indeed a pioneer in the current economic reforms, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Economic Growth to Slow Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy's economy will continue to
grow in 1996 but the growth rate will be lower than in 1995, an
economic institute predicted.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by 2.4 percent,
lower than the 3.3 percent growth rate in 1995, which was the
highest in Western industrialized nations, a report of the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade will fall owing to an overall economic slowdown
in the West and a decline of international demand.
</P>
<P>
Export is expected to drop from 1995's 11 percent to 6.5
percent and import to 8 percent from last year's 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand and fixed assets investment will also see a
marked fall in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a slowdown, budget deficit will continue to fall in
1996 to 120 trillion liras (about 76.4 billion U.S. dollars) from
last year's 130 trillion (82.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Employment rate will also rise slightly by 0.5 percentage
points over 1995 following a 0.2 percentage points fall that year.
</P>
<P>
The burden of national debt is also expected to be minutely
allayed in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Transferred to Yangtze River Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- From Shanghai to the upper
reaches, China's Yangtze river is on the verge of becoming one of
the world's most important industrial development belts.
</P>
<P>
Companies from around the globe have turned the area into an
even bigger focal point for more investment.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze, has
become a hot favorite for foreign investment. Both the number of
joint ventures approved in the province, and the amount of foreign
funds it has absorbed, rank first in western China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese, the United States, Singaporean and Taiwanese
investors have set up 190 firms in the Economic Development Zone
and at the New and Hi-tech Development Zone in Chongqing, a major
industrial city in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hubei Province, in the middle reaches of the river, has proved
more attractive to European investors. So far, 73 firms from
Europe have invested 1.66 billion US dollars in Wuhan, capital of
the province.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the province plans to make greater
efforts to attract more foreign investment and introduce more
intellectual resources.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai in
the middle and lower reaches of the river have been favored
investment destinations for some years. The suburbs, township
enterprises and service industries in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Shanghai have provided scores of new investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Years of construction have turned the Yangtze River reaches
into a major region for the development of raw material extraction
and processing industries. The region's steel and iron,
petrochemical, engineering and auto industries also play an
important role in the country.
</P>
<P>
New industries in the region, like new materials, biological
engineering, micro-electronics and telecommunications equipment,
are springing up quickly.
</P>
<P>
The region is also accelerating its industrialization and
urbanization process. The seven economic rings of Shanghai,
Nanjing, Anqing-Jiujiang, Wuhan, Yichang-Wanxian, Chongqing
Panzhihua-Luzhou, have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
As the tip of the Yangtze River, Shanghai has become gateway
for foreign investment to pour in the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that with advantageous geography, abundant
resources and great development potential, the region is an ideal
place for overseas businesses to transfer capital.
</P>
<P>
They expect the region to become one of the world's most
important industrial belts within a short time.

<HEADLINE> Australian Labor Still Behind Opposition In Election  Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The latest opinion poll
showed that the Australian Labor Party is still lagging behind the
Liberal-National coalition after entering the final week of the
federal election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Results of the AGB McNair Poll published today showed that the
Labor government got the support of 39 percent of voters, eight
percentage points lower than the opposition coalition's 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
The opinion poll was conducted last weekend before Prime
Minister Paul Keating won the final television debate with the
opposition leader John Howard Sunday night. It has an error margin
of two percent, which means that Labor is at least six percentage
points behind the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll remained the same as one week ago
although local analysts expected Labor to cut back the
opposition's lead after Howard made mistakes in his campaign last
week.
</P>
<P>
Howard got confused on the details of his family tax package in
a public speech, and one of the opposition coalition members
mailed letters to millions of voters, leaking the message that a
coalition government would give 25 percent of tax relief on
interest earned on savings.
</P>
<P>
Howard's mistake has done damage to his personal image. The
poll showed that 45 percent of voters regarded him as the
preferred prime minister over Keating, down one percent from one
week ago. Keating retained the 44 percent support rate.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that Labor had made improvement in New South
Wales, the state with the largest number of federal parliament
seats. Labor was only four percentage points behind the opposition
in the state on a two-party basis now, compared with six
percentage points one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Labor led the opposition by two percentage points in Victoria,
where Labor expects to win extra seats to offset possible losses
in other states.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that Keating failed to deliver a killing punch
against Howard during last night TV debate. But Jim Alexander, who
is responsible for the AGB McNair Poll, said that people should
note the swing of voters toward Labor in the states.
</P>
<P>
He said that Keating came from behind and became the preferred
prime minister over Howard in New South Wales. He said that Labor
kept a strong momentum in both New South Wales and Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Labor is expected to lose some seats in New South Wales because
it is defending a record high advantage won in last election.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that there would not be a last week
comeback for Labor as in the 1993 election. But the underdog image
of Labor, as it is depicted by local press, may boost Labor's hope
to win the final victory.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that a coalition government meant that Australia
would go back to the 1970s, while a Labor government would lead
the country into an open economy with high growth rate and strong
links with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to public opinion polls, most supporters of the
opposition did not endorse its policy. They only "parked" their
votes in the opposition because they did not like Labor.
</P>
<P>
But as the general picture for Labor became clearer, the voters
began to think about the gains and losses in case of a change of
government. Labor will enjoy a better chance of victory if people
get serious about its policies.
</P>
<P>
Australian voters are known for their dislike of changes.
</P>
<P>
Though the policies of the Labor government and the opposition
are so similar that they offer little clue for voters to make a
choice, the voters may prefer an old devil that they are familiar
with to a new one.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining public security is
of great significance as China moves from the planned economy to a
market economy, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
Listing negative factors leading to possible social
uncertainty, the paper said that concepts and values from the
traditional planned economy are facing challenges from the
market-oriented economy. The intests of people from all walks of
life have to be readjusted in the new climate.
</P>
<P>
There has been a rise in the number of cases of breaking the
law and discipline over recent years, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, China is going all out for economic development. A
peaceful international and domestic social environment is vital.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that a stable social environment is in the
interests of all citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining public security is of great significance, and
public security departments are expected to enhance their sense of
responsibility, make more aggressive punches to all social vices
and come up with new effective measures to deal with them, the
paper said.

WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Big-serving Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands overwhelmed third-seeded South
African Amanda Coetzer to defend her title at the IGA
Tennis Classic in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Schultz-McCarthy fired 14 aces in the 6-3,
6-2 demolition of Coetzer, who had upset top seed Chanda Rubin for
the final berth.
</P>
<P>
The towering Dutchwoman got off to a comfortable start in both
sets, breaking Coetzer's serve for a 4-1 lead in the first and
jumping out to a commanding 5-1 advantage in the second set of the
71-minute contest.
</P>
<P>
Schultz-McCarthy, who had played a doubles match that went
until almost midnight on Saturday, said she was a little tired and
didn't want to get in a three-set match with a lot of long
rallies.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer, disappointed by her own serve, said she suffered from
too much pressure in the match.

<HEADLINE> Tight Land Control Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has formed a new
administrative land system which has given rise to a flourishing
land market and immense national land assets, according to the
Economic Information News.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, problems crop up at the same time. As
land business becomes increasingly profitable, the State, the
owner of the land, finds it hardly gets a penny out of it. An
integrated, powerful land policy should be introduced, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The policy should include two parts. One is a policy of
provision and disposition, and the other is a policy of profits
distribution.
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the policy should be to guarantee the
provision of land for the continuous development of the economy
and a steady, vigorous land market. The other goal should be to
effectively utilize and reasonably dispose of the land resources.
</P>
<P>
The realization of these targets depends on the following three
elements: the land provision plan, the price and order of the land
market, and the tax policy of the land profits. Coordination
between these three elements is necessary, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem lies in the relationship between central and
local governments. Under the present policy, land income is
exclusively at the disposal of the local government. In this
sense, the implementation of the policy relies on the relationship
between central and local governments and the division of
government functions.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that we do not lay new obstacles while we march
forward," the paper said.

STOCKHOLM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Maria Mutola of Mozambique
clocked two minutes and 31.23 seconds to shatter her own world
record of the women's indoor 1,000 meters at an international
athletics meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mutola, 23, beat her previous mark of 2:32.08, which she set in

Bulgarian Natalya Dukhnova finished runner-up in 2:37.55, with
Surinam's Letitia Vriesde third in 2:38.79.
</P>
<P>
Mutola, who now looks forward to a break before preparing for
this summer's Atlanta Olympic Games, said she was aiming for the
world record in 800 meters in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The world 800 meters record is 1:53.28, set by Czech Jarmila
Kratochvilova in July, 1983.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey claimed the women's 60 meters in 7.14 seconds,
and fellow-Jamaican Donovan Powell set a stadium record of 6.56
seconds in the men's 60 meters, edging Canadian Donovan Bailey's
previous best of 6.57.

Courtney Hawkins clocked 7.54 seconds to beat fellow-American
world champion Allen Johnson in the 60 meters hurdles.

BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Iva Majoli of Croatia
defeated Jana Novotna to win the 50,000 U.S. dollars WTA
tournament in Essen, Germany on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Croat, ranked fourth in the world, won 7-5,
1-6, 7-6 (8-6) over the Czech rival.
</P>
<P>
It was the second tournament victory this year for Majoli, who
won the Pan Pacific contest in Tokyo three weeks ago but was
upset by Frenchwoman Julie Halard at the Paris Open a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Majoli seemed to be heading to victory, leading 4-1 in the
third set after a disastrous second set. But Novotna, ranked 12th
in the world and seeded fourth in Essen, scrambled back to force a
tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
Majoli jumped to a 6-2 lead in the tiebreak but let Novotna
even it again before putting her away for good, earning revenge
for her loss to the Czech in the 1994 Essen final.

<HEADLINE> Britain Agrees to Hold Talks with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has agreed to hold
talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, the first since the IRA resumed its bombing campaign two
weeks ago, according to reports from Dublin today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Sinn Fein said that the talks will take
place on Monday at Stormont, headquarters of Britain's Northern
Ireland office in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The talks would "examine how the peace process can be rebuilt,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Sinn Fein's leader Martin Mcguinness
said that the meeting was requested by his party.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would use the meeting to press for all-party
peace talks on Northern Ireland, blocked for months by a dispute
over disarming the IRA.
</P>
<P>
If Britain would set a date for all-party talks, he was
prepared to ask the IRA to resume ceasefire, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any new process must contain copperfastened and unambiguous
public assurance that all-party talks will be initiated by both
(British and Irish) governments at the earliest possible date," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Britain has shunned ministerial-level contact with Sinn Fein
since the London bombing two week ago and has repeatedly made it
clear that it will not negotiate with Sinn Fein until the IRA
declares a permanent ceasefire and makes progress on disarming.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Cuba Of Downing Two Small Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) --The U.S. administration
today denounced Cuba's downing of two small planes flown by
Cuban-Americans, describing it as "a violation of the norms of
civilized behavior".
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the United
States believes the planes were in international waters when they
were shot down off the Cuban coast Saturday. He said President
Clinton was considering a range of other options, but he declined
to give further identifications.
</P>
<P>
"The actions they took yesterday were not justified under any
circumstances," Christopher asserted at a White House news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The administration has instructed its ambassador to the United
Nations Madeleine Albright to request an emergency meeting of the
U.N. Security Council for possible punitive actions.
</P>
<P>
Some top U.S. foreign policy advisors, including the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretaries of state and
defence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as well
as National Security Advisor had a meeting earlier Sunday to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the meeting is "to put together all of
the evidence that we have" on whether the small planes had
ventured into Cuban airspace when they were shot down. An official
admitted that the planes "apparently ignored a warning not to
cross the 24th parallel." The air traffic in the area near Cuba is
believed under firm monitoring and control by the U.S. military
units.
</P>
<P>
Cuba called the aircraft "pirate planes" and said they were
shot down when they entered Cuban airspace and ignored warnings to
leave.
</P>
<P>
The two small planes were reportedly chartered by the Brothers
to the Rescue, a Florida-based Cuban-American group that flies
over the straits between Florida and Cuba to look for Cubans
escaping their country by sea.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Cotton Production To Be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The price hike of farm
chemicals is expected to seriously affect cotton production in
Mozambique, a local news agency report said today.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the market price is a result of the government's
recent decision to abolish the subsidiary provided to the import
of farm chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Vitorino Xavier, an official of the Agricultural Department in
the Nampula Province, the country's main cotton-producing region,
said the price hike would frighten the farmers, and therefore,
cotton output is bound to be reduced in the province.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 tons of cotton was originally expected for the
980,000 hectares of growing land in the province, a plan that is
very hard to accomplish, said the official.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Reproductive Rights and Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made great
efforts to enable its people to better exercise their reproductive
rights and improve reproductive health, a Chinese representative
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. Commission on Population and Development
opened here this morning, Chinese representative and Vice-Minister
of the State Family Planning Commission Peng Yu said that the
promotion of family planning is the major pillar of the nation's
population program, including the reproductive health program.
</P>
<P>
Following the principles of the International Conference on
Population and Development, the Chinese government has formulated
the Program for Promotion of Family Planning, which calls for the
integration of the family planning with the development of rural
economy, eradication of peasants' poverty and realization of their
family happiness through the provision of better services, she
said.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened training of family planning workers at
different levels since 1994. The UNFPA-funded project has been
carried out in 19 provinces and autonomous regions where 60,000
rural family planning workers have improved their capabilities in
recent years, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission, State Education
Commission, Ministry of Health and five other departments have
also promoted sex education, including sexual and reproductive
health counseling services for newly-weds in 60 percent of
localities.
</P>
<P>
In the field of maternal and child health care, China
promulgated the Mother and Infant Health Law in late 1994, which
stipulates that the medical and health departments should provide
the citizens with pre-marital health services, mother and infant
health services, including sexual and reproductive health care.
</P>
<P>
Chinese media has also disseminated knowledge on prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and AIDS in addition to
providing treatment of those diseases.
</P>
<P>
On achievements of the family planning program, she said that
China has curbed the trends of excessive population growth: the
total fertility rate went down from 5.81 births per woman to the
replacement level from 1970 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, China is still confronted with a quite grave
population situation in a considerable long period. The total
population on the Chinese mainland exceeded 1.2 billion last year;
there will be 1.3 billion in 2000 and 1.4 billion in 2010, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the Commission on Population and
Development will be ended on Friday. The central theme at the
session is reproductive rights and health, including such issues
as family planning, maternal and child health, abortion and
information on securityy.

<TEXT>
<P>

minister Tom Ikimi was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi made the disclosure to newsmen at the weekend in
Kinshasa after delivering a message from the Nigerian Head of
State, General Sani Abacha, to Zairean President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was reported to have said that the framework for the

</P>
<P>
On Nigeria's relationship with its neighbor Cameroon, Ikimi
remarked that Nigeria had had fruitful and rewarding ties, not
only with its French-speaking neighbors, but also with most African
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressedrs the need to resolve any differencesking caused by
artificial boundaries through dialogue and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian and Cameroonian soldiers clashed earlier this month
on the disputed Bakassi Penisula, whose ownerhip has been put
before the International Court of Justice in the Hague after
their armed clash in February, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Aims to Double Volume of Cotton Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt aims to double the volume
of its cotton exports as of next year in order to meet demands of
world markets.
</P>
<P>
Economists have urged the government to increase cotton exports
in the coming years and not to confine exports to traditional
markets, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
New markets should be sought for Egypt's long-staple cotton,
which enjoys good reputation in world markets, economists say.
</P>
<P>
Saad Hagras, former Chairman of the Agriculture Committee of
the People's Assembly (Parliament), was quoted by MENA as saying
that efforts should be made to look for new markets such as Syria,
Turkey and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Egypt now mainly exports its cotton to West European countries,
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's production and exports of cotton have largely decreased
in recent years. According to statistics, its share in the world
markets of long-staple cotton has dropped to about 5 percent from
some 40 percent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported some 300,000 kantars (13.5 million kilograms) of
cotton in the past season, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government has taken measures recently
to encourage farmers to plant cotton.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also planned to increase its exports of yarn and
ready-to-wear clothes this year from 1 billion Egyptian pounds
(294 million U.S. dollars) worth to 2 billion pounds (588 million
dollars), according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, though a cotton-exporting country, imports short-staple
cotton at lower prices to meet local demands.

<HEADLINE> Two Center-Right Parties Forced To Resume Coalition Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua)-- Leaders of Turkey's two
center-right parties held a telephone conversation today and
agreed to resume their coalition efforts as the last choice to
resolve the government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz and True Path
Party (DYP) Chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
agreed to hold talks on Wednesday to decide the final shape of
the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The ice-melting between the two party leaders came after ANAP
and the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) failed to form a government
following a week-long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Both Yilmaz and Ciller have been under increasing pressure to
compromise for such a long awaited coalition government.
</P>
<P>
After the brief telephone conversation, Yilmaz met with
president Suleyman Demirel, whom he assured that the projected
partnership between ANAP and DYP would survive the mandatory
confidence vote in the parliament with the help from the
Democratic Left Party (DSP).
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told local reporters that he was optimistic that he
could announce the cabinet by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said the partnership would be based on a rotating
premiership and he would take the first turn.
</P>
<P>
Previous talks between ANAP and DYP failed because both
Ciller and Yilmaz insisted on being the first Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic RP emerged as the leading party in the December 24
general election and was followed with a small margin by the two
center-right parties.
</P>
<P>
But none of them could obtained a simple majority in the
550 seat parliament to form a government on its own.

<HEADLINE> US Decides to Impose Punitive Sanctions on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has decided to impose a series of steps to punish Cuba for the
shooting down of two planes piloted by Cuban exiles, the White
House said here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the decision after a 75-minute meeting with his
national security aides at the White House today.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton "approved
a series of steps that the United States will pursue with the
international community and unilaterally that we believe will make
it clear that there's a price for outrageous behavior."
</P>
<P>
However, Cuba today accused the U.S. government of lying over
the downing of two civilian planes off Cuba on Saturday, saying
the two U.S. planes were inside Cuban airspace at the time.
</P>
<P>
McCurry declined to identify the steps but said the president
will personally announce them to reporters soon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to announce a series of economic,
diplomatic and political steps against Cuba, including measures to
restrict U.S. air travel to Cuba, a senior administration official
said at a White House background briefing today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also is expected to demand reparations from Cuba for
the families of the downed pilots and is warming up to a bill in
Congress to punish companies that do business with Cuba, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
But the president is expected not to take any military action
against Cuba, the official added.
