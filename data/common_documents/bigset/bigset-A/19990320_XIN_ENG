<HEADLINE> Libya to Turn Over Suspects in Lockerbie Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said Friday that Libya has agreed to turn over the two
suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing to the U.N. by April 6.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks in Libyan capital Tripoli after talks
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Mandela read out a copy of a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, in which Libya "ensure that the two suspects would be
available for the secretary-general of the United Nations to take
custody of them on or before April 6, 1999."
</P>
<P>
It also agreed the suspects, if convicted, will serve any
prison term in Scotland under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and Libya has long been bogged down in a
dispute over the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya had refused to hand over to the U.S. and Britain the two
Libyan suspected of bombing a American Jetliner in 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Libya had last year agreed in principle to hand over the
suspects for the trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
But the hand over snagged with Libya demanding clarifications
about the place where they would be jailed if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The letter also insisted that the sanctions, imposed on Libya
in 1992 over its failure to turn over the suspects, will be lifted
within 90 days of a report by Annan that Libya has met with
U.N. Security Council requirements.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the deal on the handover was hammered out with the
help of Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. have agreed to comply with the Security
Council's pledge to suspend the sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived in Libya Thursday after a tour of Nordic
countries.

impeachment crisis.

was dangerous as Yugoslav air defenses were formidable, the
terrain in Serbian and Kosovo was difficult and the weather was
unpredictable.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Senegal, FAO Extend Agricultural Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam, Senegal and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) have decided to extend a tripartite
agreement on agricultural cooperation, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for the 1996-1999 period between Vietnam, Senegal
and FAO will be extended to 2001, VNA quoted Vietnamese Deputy
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) Ngo The Dan
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dan was speaking at a tripartite meeting here on Friday to
review the implementation of food security program in Senegal with
assistance of Vietnamese agronomists.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Senegalese Minister of Agriculture
Robert Sagna, FAO representative in Hanoi Fernalda Guerrieri and
representatives from Vietnam's several government ministries.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country which has gained remarkable progress in
agriculture in recent years, Vietnam was selected to participate
in FAO's special program on food security for some countries in
the world, particularly African countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to send 100 more agronomists to Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam sent 83 agronomists specializing in rice, vegetable and
subsidiary farming, livestock breeding, irrigation planning,
forestry and aquaculture, to work in Senegal in 1997 and 1998.
They helped Senegalese farmers build high-quality cultivation and
breeding models and diversify farm produce.

<HEADLINE> International Verifiers to Withdraw From Kosovo (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The withdrawal of the international monitors is expected to
send a signal to both sides of the Kosovo conflict that the United
States- and NATO-threatened air strikes are imminent.
</P>
<P>
But local observers believed that the air strikes may not be
delivered until the end of next week when Russian Prime Minister
Evegeny Primakov, a strong opponent to the threat and use of
force, ends his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO could not afford to do more damage
to the already sored relations between them and Russia, their Cold
War-era nemesis.
</P>
<P>
The NATO headquarters are scheduled to review the case next
Wednesday and the order for delivery of air strikes may be
expected then, though now NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
alone has been entrusted with the authority to issue the order.
</P>
<P>
The international monitors came into Kosovo late last year to
monitor the cease-fire brokered by the international community.
They have been patrolling the Yugoslav southern province in five
regions in the middle, east, west, south and north.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the foreigners from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe member countries, lots of local people
were also hired as interpreters of Serbian and Albanian languages,
guides, drivers and other supporting staff.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Urges Eritrea, Ethiopia to Respect for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) has called on the parties involved in the border
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia to abide by the rules of
international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
In a press release here Friday, the ICRC said that it earnestly
requested that all the wounded and sick without distinction be
evacuated from the battlefield and be given appropriate medical
care.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of soldiers are reported to have been wounded, killed
or captured since violent clashes resumed in early February,
according to the ICRC. After a temporary lull, the fighting
intensified in mid-March, again claiming numerous victims.
</P>
<P>
"Combatants killed in the fighting must be identified and
afforded a decent burial," said the ICRC. "Their places of burial
must be duly marked."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC further reminded the parties that prisoners of war and
civilian internees must be treated in accordance with the
provisions of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
The international humanitarian agency also asked the concerned
parties to take all necessary steps to safeguard the civilian
population from the dangers of military operations.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, by virtue of the mandate entrusted to it by the
Geneva Conventions, pledged to assist and protect the victims in
accordance with the criteria governing its neutral and independent
humanitarian action.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Planned Gas Pipeline Under Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday voiced its
opposition to the construction of a trans-Caspian gas pipeline
planned by Turkey and Turkmenistan, saying such facilities may
endanger the Caspian's ecological safety.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side had an invariably negative attitude toward
construction of trans-Caspian underwater pipeline," Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by an
Itar-Tass report.
</P>
<P>
The pipelines could hurt the single closed Caspian ecosystem
and the unique sturgeon population, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Moscow considers it premature to go ahead
with such projects before the littoral states agree on the legal
status of the Caspian Sea and interstate compensation of damage to
their marine environment in case of accidents.
</P>
<P>
"We have given notice of our understanding of this issue to the
Turkmen side, in particular by handing over a special study ...
and expect that the position on construction of the trans-Caspian
gas pipeline," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan, Georgia and then
Erzurum, Turkey, will be 2,000 kilometers long. Its cost is
estimated at 2 billion U.S. dollars, and capacity at about 16
billion cubic meters a year.

SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials in Shanghai
recently intercepted an attempt to smuggle 1,000 bronze coins from
the Qing Dynasty, dating back about 200 years.
</P>
<P>
They say that the coins were discovered in the luggage of a
person with a foreign passport who was trying to pass through
customs in the no-declaration line.
</P>
<P>
The coins were confiscated because they can not be exported and
the case is being further investigated.
</P>
<P>
A crackdown on antiques smuggling was made a major task for
customs officers in 1999, they say. In 1998, they had 9 antiques
smuggling attempts.
</P>
<P>
Antiques can be taken out of China if they are approved by the
antiques control authority.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, U.S. End 7th Round of Talks on Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 19 (Xinhua) --The seventh round of trade talks
between Vietnam and the United States ended here Friday after
achieving some progress, but no breakthrough was made, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
During five days of talks which began Monday, the two sides
focused their discussions on the key issues of development of
investment, service trade, commodity trade and intellectual
property that had not been dealt with in the previous rounds of
talks.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, a U.S. trade representative said "some
progress" had been achieved at the talks. But he added that there
were still some difficulties to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said a new round of talks will be held in
this spring season, giving no specific date.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said the trade talks achieved "good
results," with the two sides having found common ground in most
issues. The gap between the two sides' positions has been
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to continue examining and discussing some
outstanding issues with a view to an early signing of a trade
agreement, accelerating the normalization of bilateral economic
and trading ties and boosting commodity exchange and investment
cooperation between the two countries, according to VNA.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Vietnam and the U.S. has increased steadily since
1995 when the two countries normalized diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Vietnam exported to the U.S. about 534 million U.S.
dollars worth of goods. Imports from the U.S. were worth about 200
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Their two-way trade in 1997 reached 611 million U.S. dollars.
Corresponding figures for 1995 and 1996 were 411 million and 597
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Urges NATO to Rescind Military Threat on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday urged the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to drop its threat of military
force against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As long as this destructive decision remains in force, no
regular negotiating process is conceivable," the Interfax news
agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if NATO goes ahead and uses force against
Yugoslavia, Russia would freeze its relations with the alliance,
suspend its involvement in the Partnership for Peace program, and
recall its envoy to NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia is adamant that only a negotiated settlement is
acceptable in Kosovo and would resolutely denounce any military
strikes against Yugoslavia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that Russia will counter NATO actions by
diplomatic and military diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
On the peace talks on Kosovo in Paris, the official described
the document signed Thursday by the Kosovo Albanians as legally
non-binding because it had not been negotiated.
</P>
<P>
"This was a pseudo-signing," and the Russian mediator at the
talks, Boris Mayorsky, did not sign the document, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral signing by the Kosovo Albanians is very
dangerous because the Kosovo delegation may view this as the
conclusion of the talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes that everything must be done to save the
negotiating process, otherwise a civil war will break out in
Kosovo, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Paris talks were still alive and that Mayorsky, the
Russian envoy and Russian Ambassador to France Nikolai
Afanasyevsky have been given the "appropriate instructions" to
move ahead.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Currency Depreciates Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's currency of naira this
week depreciated by 0.30 percent against the U.S. dollars for the
first time in six months at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market
(AFEM)
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) told forex dealers on Tuesday
that naira would exchange at 86.25 to one dollar as against 86 to
one last week, according to a This Day paper report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite depreciation in the value of the Naira, the demand at
the AFEM still peaked at 104.137 million dollars on Wednesday,
lower than 109.75 million dollars demanded at last week's forex
market.
</P>
<P>
The fall in value of the currency has been linked to the rising
level of demand for foreign currencies at the market.
</P>
<P>
In the last five weeks, the average demand for foreign exchange
is 100.4 million dollars per week, a figure considered high by
market watchers in view of the amount budgeted for the the market
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has earmarked some 4.4 billion dollars
for the funding of the foreign exchange market this year.
</P>
<P>
The rising level of demand at the market has also been
attributed to the fact that foreign exchange end users, especially
the manufacturers, are accumulating forex for import of essential
raw materials for their production activities in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the pattern of demand indicates that letters of
credit shared 92.48 percent of the total volume of currencies
purchased at the market.
</P>
<P>
Market dealers considered the drop in naira value as the
beginning of a gradual adjustment of the exchange rate to reflect
the trends in other market.
</P>
<P>
But, a CBN spokesman insisted that no one could predict the
direction of the naira value as the supervisory bank has taken
measures to stem speculative demand at the market.
</P>
<P>
Part of measures adopted by the CBN to curtail excessive forex
demand include bank's cash reserve, deregulation of treasury bills
market to attract more investors and the reduction of money supply
growth target for the year.

<HEADLINE> Likelihood of Y2K Serious Destruction Goes Down: Global 2000 Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Global 2000
Coordinating Group (Global 2000) Tim Shepheard-Walwyn said here
Friday there is indication that likelihood of Y2K serious
destruction is going down as more information comes out about the
degree of focus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"But it does not mean that there is not a possibility things go
wrong and that's why however well we address this problem we still
believe that senseful contingency plans are important part of
ensuring that this issue does not become more widespread,"
Shepheard-Walwyn added.
</P>
<P>
Shepheard-Walwyn made the remarks at a press conference at the
end of a meeting of the Global 2000, an organization of 288
private financial institutions operating in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Shepheard-Walwyn described the meeting as "very successful,"
saying understanding, determination and progress in Asian
countries regarding the Y2K compliance were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
He cited updating on status of preparedness here in Asia with a
number of presentations from countries in the region, the
kicking-off of the initiatives to contingency planning efforts of
the international financial community on the way, and
reemphasizing of something already signed for a significant period
of time, as the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the meeting, Global 2000
announced that a new focus of its efforts in the remainder of 1999
is cross-border contingency and business continuity planning, and
the initiative is led by Global 2000's External Risk Mitigation
and Contingency Planning Work Group.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the group is to identify and stimulate
specific actions that the international financial industry can
take both before and after January 1, 2000, to minimize potential
disruptions to financial markets triggered by Year 2000-related
problems, the press release said..
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Shepheard-Walwyn emphasized the
importance of the cross-border contingency planning initiative.
"With only 287 days until January 1, 2000, it is essential that
prudent institutions prepare contingency plans for their firms and
markets in order to ensure business continuity."
</P>
<P>
"Global 2000 is playing its part by considering cross-border
scenarios and action plans to minimize disruptions to
international financial market during the transition to the new
millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge financial services regulators and governments to work
with Global 2000 to further its progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
Global 2000 also reiterated its call for increased information
sharing and disclosure by financial firms, infrastructure
providers and governments, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there will be a bank holiday on December 31, this
year, Shepheard-Walwyn said the bank holiday should be discussed
extensively and there are different ideas about if it is wise to
announce the holiday.
</P>
<P>
But he said a number of markets, perhaps the majority of them,
are looking favorably to the idea because it is the last (chance)
for banks to conclude over proceedings which take place at the end
of the year before the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
This is obviously the point of which the clock rolls over into
the next millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Global 2000 meeting, attended by over 300 representatives
from the international financial community, was aimed at
identifying and resourcing areas where coordinated initiatives
will facilitate efforts by the global financial community to
improve the readiness of global financial markets to meet the
challenges created by the Year 2000 date changes.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Join N.Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
was ready to take part in an intensive round of negotiations to
push forward the Northern Ireland peace process, a Downing Street
spokesman announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair planned to take part in discussions to reach an
agreement on decommissioning before the devolution deadline of 2
April. The government has set a deadline of 2 April - the
anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement - for the handover of
power to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "The position under the Good Friday
Agreement is that decommissioning is not a precondition to joining
an executive - nevertheless it is an obligation under the Good
Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a joint statement issued by Blair
with US President Bill Clinton and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern urging Northern Ireland's politicians to press on with the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"What this statement shows is that the three governments are
united in their determination to get through and get over the
final hurdle," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly everybody knows what has to be done. The parties in
the agreement are in no doubt what the difficulties are and what
has to be confronted," he added.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement from the three leaders followed talks in
Washington this week between Clinton, Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, Northern Ireland's first minister, said Ulster
Unionists would not sit down with Sinn Fein in the new assembly's
executive unless the IRA began to hand over arms.
</P>
<P>
But Adams has said there is no mention in the Good Friday
Agreement of weapons being handed over before the executive meets.

<HEADLINE> IFRC Appeals to Curb Cholera in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRBOI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross (IFRC) Friday appealed for greater efforts to control
the spread of cholera in eastern and southern Africa, the Great
Lakes Region and the horn of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC's Nairobi Regional Delegation made the appeal here in
marking World Water Day which falls on March 22.
</P>
<P>
The delegation said that the outbreak of the disease is
attributed to lack of access of water, along with poor hygiene,
absent proper sanitation, environmental pollution and widespread
ignorance of the disease.
</P>
<P>
In recent two weeks, the outbreak of cholera has claimed dozens
of lives in western and eastern parts of Kenya due to lack of
clean water.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a more equitable distribution of water, the IFRC
and Red Crescent societies say that the Africa poor pay far more
for water than the rich, illustrated by East Africa's burgeoning
urban slums.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi's Korogocho quarter with 150,000 slum dwellers, where
the Kenya Red Cross intervened in a major cholera epidemic in
1997, faces an appalling water shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman Pius Achola of Kenya Red Cross Health
Committee, the dwellers there pay up to eight times more for water
from vendors than the well-off pay for tap water in the capital's
salubrious neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC said that people there with average daily earning
ranging from 30 to 200 shillings (about 46 U.S. cents to three
U.S. dollars) have to pay more than 10 percent of their income to
buy family water from vendors.
</P>
<P>
Living with such inadequate quantities of clean water, the IFRC
said, many families resort to water from free but polluted
sources, heightening the risk of the disease.
</P>
<P>
To help preclude further outbreak of cholera there, the IFRC
has developed plans for improving the water supply, providing new
systems of waster disposal and promoting hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The IFRC fully supports ongoing red cross/red crescent medical
 interventions, public health education campaigns and efforts to
improve water and sanitation in cholera-stricken areas in Kenya,
Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the
Nairobi Regional Delegation said.

<HEADLINE> January Retail Sales Fall Sharply in S'pore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales and catering trade
in Singapore declined by 13.4 and 4.7 percent respectively on a
year-on-year basis in January 1999, according to data released
Friday by Singapore Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The double digit decline was partly due to the high base in
January 1998 which had two festivals -- Chinese New Year and Hari
Raya Puasa. In contrast, January 1999 only consisted of the Hari
Raya Puasa holiday.
</P>
<P>
Compared to December 1998, retail sales in January dropped by 3
percent after rising consecutively for three months, while
catering trade in the month fell 12 percent with all catering
activities experiencing lower income.
</P>
<P>
Total values in the retail sales and catering trade in January
were estimated at 1,989 and 255 million Singapore dollars (1,170
and 150 million U.S dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers of textiles &AMP; personal effects encountered a reduction
of 8 percent in sales while business at department stores &AMP;
supermarkets and provision &AMP; sundry shops also sank by 6.3 and 1.7
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, retailers of furniture &AMP; household equipment reported
a growth of 3.4 percent in receipts and turnover of motor vehicles
expanded by 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
January 1999 saw a record contraction of 24.4 percent in
restaurants taking while sales at fast outlets and other eating
places also slid down by 11.4 percent and 3 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Meets Santer During Europe Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Current European Union (EU)
president, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Friday met here
with Jacques Santer, the outgoing European Commission president,
for the EU executive body's succession.
</P>
<P>
Leaving European Commission's headquarter building after meeting
with Santer for about an hour, Schroeder declined to detail
anything to reporters. And Santer, who with his 19 partners
resigned Tuesday after a panel accused them of mismanagement,
corruption and nepotism, is expected to meet European Parliament
President Jose Maria Gil-Robles later the day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Schroeder also met with French President Jaqcues
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to discuss the EU Berlin
Summit to be held on next Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The German Chancellor is shuttling European capitals looking
for consensus on a new team to replace the EU executive body in
order to restore business of the actually half-paralyzed
commission.
</P>
<P>
So far, he has run into rejection by Protugal and Spain, both
countries see the EU commission as an ally against the bigger and
wealthier EU member states, and were seeking an interim solution
to the power vacuum at the Brussels, known as the heart of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish minister for Europe, Ramon de Miguel, said a
permanent commission should not be appointed until after elections
to the European Parliament in June.
</P>
<P>
Now the European parliamentarian political leaders in Brussels
said Santer would be rejected at a plenary session next Monday,
unless he leaves before then. Parliamentarians said if he
attempted to stay on, even in an interim capacity, the assembly
would vote to remove the entire commission.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Santer has said he wanted to leave "as soon as possible."
Currently, He and his fellow commissioners have remained at their
posts in a caretaker capacity because they are required to stay on
by the EU's founding treaty. They have made a public statement
saying that they would handle regular business, but not to put
forward new political initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Reiterates Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has reiterated its
commitment to peace rather than confrontation to save innocent
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's Minister of Defense, Joseph Kubwalo, Thursday told the
20th session of the inter-state Southern African Development
Community (SADC) defense ministers and chiefs meeting in Mbabane,
Swaziland that indulging in wars would "destroy our already
fledgling economies."
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to support peace among warring factions because
you cannot lift up the living standards of the people in a war
situation," the Malawi News Agency (MNA) Friday quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As a testimony for its support for peace, the Malawi army and
the civil police would soon participate in the blue crane
exercise, a military exercise in southern Africa under the
auspices of the British government, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Besides its peace keeping role, the Malawi army and other
allied departments are actively working toward stamping out
corrupt practices, drug trafficking, forged travel documents,
illegal immigrants, armed robbery, as well as custom fraud,
smuggling, money laundering and motor vehicle theft.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the criminal acts are perpetrated across the
borders, Kubwalo appealed for joint border patrols and exchange of
intelligence tips.
</P>
<P>
A joint operation code-named "Cooperation Sesani" by Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, south Africa and Malawi showed that
out of the 117 vehicles impounded, 74 were Stolen and 24 were
recovered, making a representation of 13 percent recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Such regional collaboration must be urged to curb crime in
out states," he said.

UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade has asked the
U.N. Security Council to hold a session on the issue of Kosovo, a
province in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, so that the 15-member
body can urge NATO to cease its threats of use of force against
Yugoslavia and to stop any further military buildup in neighboring
countries.

Minister Zivadin Jovanovic to the president of the Security
Council, Qin Huasun of China, diplomatic sources said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Seeks Security Council Session on NATO Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has asked for a
Security Council meeting on NATO threats of air strikes, so that
the 15-member body can urge the military alliance to stop
threatening bombing the Balkan country and end further military
buildup in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The request was contained in a letter from Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic to the president of the Security Council, Qin
Huasun of China.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon you to convene a meeting of the Security Council,
so that this body, in line with its primary responsibility for
peace and security, could urge NATO to cease its threats of use of
force against Yugoslavia, to stop any further buildup of troops
and arms in the region and to withdraw those already deployed, "
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
This "would contribute to reduction of tensions and elimination
of unforseeable danger to peace and security in the region," said
the letter.
</P>
<P>
Security Council President Qin, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, has briefed all other
Council members on the Yugoslav request and has the letter
distributed as official U.N. document, Chen Ranfeng, spokesman for
the Chinese Mission, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a build-up of troops and arms by NATO
countries, which have been brought in from other parts of Europe
and th world, in the immediate neighbourhood of Yugoslavia," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 10,000 NATO troops have been deployed in the
neighboring Macedonia, along with 60 tanks, 250 armoured vehicles,
several dozen combat helicopters, great many pieces of artillery,
including 155mm long-rang guns," the letter quoted some press
reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Such a build-up of foreign troops and military equipment,
unprecedented in the post-war period, has been coupled with
ultimatums by the highest NATO officials and by individual NATO
countries to the effect that they are ready to launch attacks
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic sent a similar letter to Knut Vollebaek, chairman of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which has some 1,400 monitors in Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost
province, watching the renewed fighting between Serbian security
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister, in his letter, called on OSCE
members, especially countries bordering Yugoslavia, "to show
understanding for (our) efforts to protect (our) legitimate
national and state interests."
</P>
<P>
"In the event of a NATO attack, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia will act in accordance with its legitimate right to
self-defence," Jovanovic told the Security Council and OSCE, a
security bloc, groups European countries, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade is insisting on the rejection of any NATO presence in
Kosovo, saying otherwise it will be seen as "an act of
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The letter came after peace talks in France adjourned on
Thursday night with the ethnic Albanian signing an agreement on
autonomy but the Serbs still refusing to accept it.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation said that there is no agreement on
Kosovo yet because no peace agreement was reached at the end of
the first round of peace talks in Rambouillet, France, which ended
on February 23.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO is threatening to use force against Belgrade
if it refuses to sign on the Western-drafted accord, which
Belgrade said that it has not been discussed in the first round of
talks and even not touched by the six-nation Contact Group, which
is in charge of Balkan diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia pursue an active and
peaceful policy; it is committed to good-neighbourly relations,
peace and stability in the region; no threat is being posed from
its territory nor is it threatening the interests of any other
countries, least of all the interests of NATO countries," the
letter said.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Denies Role in Halting Vaccine Production for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler had rebutted an Iraqi allegation that his
weapons teams destroyed equipment in an Iraqi vaccine factory,
causing shortage that in turn led to the spread of foot and mouth
disease among the livestock in the country, U.N. sources said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf had written that Iraqi efforts to
end the spread of the disease had been hampered by the small
amount of vaccine available, "Particularly since work in the
laboratory that was producing the vaccine was halted when UNSCOM
destroyed all its equipment."
</P>
<P>
Responding to Iraqi allegation, Butler, Executive Chairman of
the United Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, also sent a letter to the
United Nations Security Council which was released Thursday, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the allegation did not accord with the fact,
Butler said Iraq admitted in July 1995 that the facility at Daura
was not purely a civilian facility, but had been used for
biological warfare agent production, research and development.
</P>
<P>
Butler added that in 1996, 28 pieces of equipment at the Daura
facility, which had been identified by Iraq as used for biological
warfare production, were removed and destroyed by Iraq under
UNSCOM's supervision.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 major pieces, originally imported for the production of
food and mouth disease vaccine remained, as their use in the
biological warfare program has not been established, the head of
UNSCOM said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said production of the vaccine was halted unilaterally
by Iraq in September in 1992 and that not all the equipment at the
facility was destroyed by UNSCOM in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although foot and mouth disease vaccine was no
the list of items subject to UNSCOM's export/import monitoring
system, the commission only required notification and did not
impose impediments on import of the vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Makes Contribution to WTO Technical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has contributed one million
Swiss francs (about 700,000 U.S. dollars) to the technical
cooperation activities of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In thanking the Swedish government, WTO Director-General Renato
Ruggiero noted that 80 percent of his organization's technical
cooperation activities are funded by extra-budgetary contributions
from a few developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that strengthening the technical cooperation
allocations in the WTO regular budget would enable the
organization to plan ahead and provide more efficient assistance
to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At a brief ceremony held at the Swedish Residence in Geneva
early this week, Sweden's Deputy Minister for Trade Ms Yvonne
Gustaffson underlined the importance Sweden attached to assisting
developing countries, particularly the least-developed among them,
in integrating themselves fully into the multilateral trading
system.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister also expressed the hope that Sweden's
contribution would pave the way for the establishment of a Global
Trust Fund for WTO technical cooperation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- First Union, the sixth biggest
banking company in the United States, announced on Friday that it
is cutting about 5,850 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force, in a
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The layoff announced Friday came in the wake of First Union's
16.1-U.S.-billion-dollar merger last year with Philadelphia-based
CoreStates Financial Corp, according to a report by the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
The banking company, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said
last month it was considering cutting as many as 7,150 jobs. Its
combined work force stands at about 79,000.
</P>
<P>
Layoff notices were delivered to employees in late February and
early March, spokeswoman Mary Eshet said. She didn't say how many
of the affected workers were former CoreStates employees.
</P>
<P>
First Union said its restructuring plan is expected to produce
pre-tax cost savings of about 400 million dollars for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The company, with assets of 237 billion dollars, operates
banking offices along the the country's East Coast from
Connecticut to Florida.

<HEADLINE> More People Ill After Visiting Dutch Flower Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Patients who used to visit a
flower show near Amsterdam, the Netherlands, increased to 212 on
Friday, 12 more than that on Thursday, the Dutch Health Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak of Legionnaire's disease in the Netherlands has
killed 13 people so far, while 80 people have been diagnosed with
certainty as having contracted legionnaire's disease.
</P>
<P>
officials from Dutch Ministry of Health said in The Hague that
all 212 people became ill with symptoms of pnuemonia after
visiting the show.
</P>
<P>
The infection was traced to the show in Bovenkarpsel, 40 miles
north of Amsterdam. Last month, some 80,000 people visited the
weeklong Westfriese Flora show. Earlier this week, Dutch Health
Minister Els Borst said she was deeply shocked by such an
epidemic. "We will do our utmost to ensure there is never a
recurrence of this sort of outbreak," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Dutch health authorities informed the World
Health Organization (WHO) of the bacteria infection, as too many
people including foreign tourists visited the flower show.
</P>
<P>
Dutch experts believe that the bacteria stemmed from a fountain
which served as a centerpiece of exhibits. The disease derives
from bacteria in water.
</P>
<P>
Usually, several national flower shows are held throughout the
western Netherlands each spring, when the 6-billion-US-dollar
annual Dutch cut flower and bulb industry shows off its wares.
</P>
<P>
The country's National Institute of Public Health and the
Environment has started a large-scale investigation into the
source of the infection. The institute also has written to 5,000
visitors to the show over the age of 40, advising them to have a
urine test.
</P>
<P>
Legionnaire's disease was first discovered after an outbreak at
a convention of the American Legion in Pennsylvania in 1976, when
about 180 people fell ill and 20 died of the rare disease.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria that are believed to cause the illness are found
in soil and grow in air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and
rivers.

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.N. Not Directly Engaged in Kosovo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday said that "we are monitoring developments very
closely" of the situation surrounding Kosovo, a province in the
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, and the United Nations "is not
directly engaged."
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters, Annan told reporters
that "The Contact Group has the lead and I am in touch with the
NATO Secretary-General and we are monitoring developments very
closely."
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no chance of the U.N. troops or
peacekeepers going into Kosovo at this stage, he said. "The
Contact Group is dealing with it and wer are monitoring: the U.N.
is not directly engaged."
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the Serbs will reconsider their attitude and
use the extra time given to come back with possibly a positive
attitude," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the NATO threat of air strikes against Yugoslavia, Annan
said, "It is difficult to say. It's an issue for the Contact Group
to decide. I cannot say if and when there will be any NATO
strikes."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, in charge of the Balkan diplomacy, is one of
sponsors of the peace talks held in Rambouillet, France, which
failed to bridge the gap between Belgrade and Western countries on
the deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo to monitor the autonomy
plan for ethnic Albanians, who, making up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs
for independence.

<HEADLINE> UK CJD Deaths Double in Last Quarter of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The death rate from CJD, the human
form of mad cow disease, more than doubled in the last quarter of
1998 compared with previous ones, British scientists reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (nvCJD), a degenerative
brain disorder linked to the so-called mad cow disease, first
emerged in 1996, the number of deaths per quarter was fairly
constant.
</P>
<P>
To the end of the third quarter of 1998, CJD had claimed an
average of two or three lives every three months, with the largest
number of five deaths in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to The Lancet medical journal, researchers
from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported
that in the final quarter of last year, nine CJD deaths were
recorded, which they said is "unusually high".
</P>
<P>
Up to March 2 this year, 39 deaths from CJD had been reported
in the UK, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, The Lancet journal said the outlook is "grim".
But the researchers stressed that the unusually high number of
deaths should be interpreted with caution.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of deaths in the last quarter of 1998 was
unusual, it is hard to tell whether this trend will be sustained,
the scientists concluded.
</P>
<P>
"The number of variant CJD deaths in the coming year will
provide a clearer indication," they said.

<P>
RIYADH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 18,000 Iraqi pilgrims, most
of them women and elderly, crossed into Saudi Arabia Friday in
nearly 400 buses and trucks, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef
Bin Abdel-Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd has issued directive to facilitate the access
of the Iraqi pilgrims and agreed to cover all of their expenses,
including that for accommodation, daily expenditure, traveling and
tour guides, the Saudi News Agency quoted Nayef as saying.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims will join their fellow Muslims in the pilgrimage
rites smoothly and peacefully, Nayef added.
</P>

By late Friday afternoon, Saudi authorities had begun taking
pilgrims on the 18-hour busride from Saudi border post of Arar to
the holy city of Mecca to perform the annual hajj pilgrimage,
Islam's most revered ritual.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were being made to get all 18,000 on the road by day's
end. Mecca is 1,126 kilometers south of this border post.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hails But Still Cautious on New Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday hailed the South
African President Nelson Mandela for winning assurance from Libya
on when Libya would hand over the two Lockerbie airliner bombing
suspects.
</P>
<P>
But British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he would not
relax until the two men were in the Netherlands for trial.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome President Mandela's statement and am very much
encouraged by what he has said," Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"(But)we will not drop our guard until the two men land in the
Netherlands. I am not going to breathe a sigh of relief until that
happens," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
"It has been seven months of hard and patient effort since we
made our offer to hold a Scottish trial in a third country. But it
will have been worth it if we can secure a trial that brings out
into the open the facts that we have," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Mandela said that Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi had decided to give a final date to hand over the suspects
which could be April 6 or before.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at the end of Mandela's visit to
Tripoli, the capital of Libya. The visit was mainly focused on
negotiating with Gaddafi about the trial of the two men in
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said in an appearance with Mandela that agreement had
been reached on the main issues of ending sanctions against Libya,
on jailing the two Libyan suspects if they were found guilty, and
on the Scottish court to sit in the Netherlands for the trial.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans are accused of planting the bomb that blew up a
Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988,
killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States had agreed to a UN pledge to
suspend sanctions on Libya, Libya's condition for a handover.
Libya had been under serious sanctions for years as it has refused
to handover the two suspects.

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Ministers Support Hague Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers from five GCC
countries said here on Saturday that they support the agreement
reached in Hague last week by OPEC and non-OPEC members to cut
back oil production by more than 2 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made following a meeting called by United
Arab Emirates (UAE) Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister
Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir to coordinate GCC policies on the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), set up in 1981, groups
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique, Al Nasir and oil ministers from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain stressed the urgent needs for
continued cooperation among oil producing nations, from within and
outside OPEC, to curb the falling of oil prices in the world
markets and achieve a more reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
"Urgent action must be taken to remedy the situation and to
ensure healthy growth and developments for the oil industry," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
The oil ministers also pledged to work together to support the
Hague agreement during the OPEC conference to be held in Vienna on
March 23, in a bid to restore stability to oil markets and boost
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
It was not known why GCC member Oman was absent at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states hold 45 percent of the world's proven oil
reserves and control 18 percent of global crude oil production.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March20 (Xinhua) --The Somalis are unexpectedly calm
Saturday after three days of fierce fighting between militiamen
loyal to warlord Muse Sudi Yalahow and others funded by
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few of the local buses have resumed operation around
Karan market which had been the center of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, business activities in the market did not return to
normal as the ordinary civilians do not yet fully trust the
temporary cease-fire brokered by some of the traditional leaders
of Abgal clan which the two concerned parties belong to.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the businessmen continue moving their stock from the
market to elsewhere in the capital in case the fighting resumes.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many families are still moving from the area for
fear of further clashes.
</P>
<P>
Separate meetings had continued since last night trying to find
out a possible solution to the conflict. But there has been no
fruitful outcome as yet from any of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Muhidin, Mogadishu former
strongest religious leader, told reporters that he is optimistic
no more fighting will erupt again in north Mogadishu.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton made his case to congressional
leaders and the American people for possible airstrikes against
Serbian forces in and around Kosovo, saying the Serbs have "
already ...crossed" a threshold in the embattled province that
would justify NATO bombing and missile attacks.
</P>

a powerful bomb in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz,

<HEADLINE> Russian Planes Leased By Zhejiang Province Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Manager Luo Qiang said that the planes have played a
major role in the airline's development and that some A-320s will
be brought in to replace them.
</P>
<P>
The Russian planes were leased under a practice known as wet-
leasing, whereby planes and crew members are leased from foreign
airlines, when Zhejiang Airlines was founded six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two planes carried 1.09 million passengers and more than 11,
000 tons of cargo during their term of service in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Airlines is considering leasing some planes to carry
freight from Russia in the years to come, according to the general
manager.

<HEADLINE> Knight: Coles Should Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympics chief Michael
Knight said Saturday a fresh investigation of Australian
International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles signaled
it was time for the former Olympian to resign.
</P>
<P>
Knight, president of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG), said the IOC's decision to launch an
inquiry into whether Coles accepted a gift of expensive jewelry in
contravention of IOC guidelines should trigger his departure from
the SOCOG board.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC have started some processes. I don't think Phil should
wait for the conclusion of those processes. I think he should walk,
" Knight said in Sydney. Knight cannot dismiss Coles from the
SOCOG board because his IOC membership gives him an automatic
place there.
</P>
<P>
Other SOCOG members urging Coles to step down include chief
executive Sandy Hollway, who said the continuing presence of Coles
on the SOCOG board jeopardized efforts to raise the remaining 228
million Australian dollars (141 million U.S. dollars) of the
target budget for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Coles claims he has no knowledge of jewelry that Georgina Coles,
his former wife, had been photographed wearing at an IOC function
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Georgina Coles sparked the fresh inquiry by faxing a letter to
the IOC confirming that the heavy gold and diamond pieces were a
gift from a businessman linked to Athens' bid for the Olympics 10
years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Customs of Pakistan seized
smuggled goods worth 2.74 billion rupees (59.56 million U.S.
dollars) during the first eight months of the current fiscal year
starting July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 91 percent as compared
with 1.436 billion rupees (31.22 million dollars) in the same
period of 1997-98 fiscal year, a spokesman for the Central Board
of Revenue said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on smuggled vehicles was the most effective
during the eight-month period, with 1,812 smuggled vehicles
seized, an increase of 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Customs had intensified its campaign
against smuggling and are taking effective measures in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
In February 1999 alone, the measures taken by the Customs
yielded greater results, with 665 million rupees (14.45 million
dollars) worth of contraband goods seized, compared with 112
million rupees (2.43 million dollars) a year earlier, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> New General Manager For China's People's Insurance Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- the Deputy General Manager of the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC Group) Sun Xiyue was
appointed general manager of the People's Insurance Company of
China (PICC) today by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
PICC was formed out of PICC Property, one of 3 subsidiaries of
PICC Group. Sun was also general manager of PICC Property, which
was restructured into PICC in November 1998, shortly after the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) was established, with
registered capital of 7.7 billion yuan. It does all types of
insurance business except for life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Sun says that PICC will stick to its principle of steady
development, paying attention to integrating development speed,
quality, rational organization, and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, PICC's premium income grew by five percent on an
annual basis to 40.16 billion yuan (about 4.6 billion U.S. dollars)
, with total profits for the year hitting 658 million yuan. PICC
now handles 80 percent of China's property insurance business.
</P>
<P>
He says that, although PICC is a wholly state-owned company, it
will continue with reforming itself and making a greater effort to
improve its supervision and service to prevent risks.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the CIRC, Ma Yongwei, has asked PICC to pay
greater attention to efficiency and quality and to draw on the
experiences of overseas insurance companies to reinforce its
controls to meet market challenges from the opening of China's
insurance sector.

<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The next meeting of the Joint
Economic Commission between Bangladesh and India will be held in
Dhaka soon, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Azad has just returned home from Sri Lanka after attending a
SAARC Council of Ministers' meeting, the official BSS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), a
regional economic bloc grouping Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives, was established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Azad told reporters at the airport that between the proceedings
of the SAARC meeting, he held talks with his counterparts from
other member countries, including India. Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh will attend the joint commission's meeting in Dhaka,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting of the Joint Economic Commission was held in
New Delhi in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The issue of zero tariff and greater access of Bangladeshi
products to Indian market leading to a more balanced trade between
the two countries would figure prominently during the meeting,
Azad indicated.
</P>
<P>
"We have to resolve trade and other issues with India through
dialogue and discussions," he said, adding that the date of the
meeting would be fixed after mutual consultation.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show Bangladesh's imports from India stood at
755 million dollars during the 1997-98 fiscal year, while its
exports to that country were valued at a mere 50 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes Three-way Meeting to Accelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Saturday expressed hope
that an upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in Amman will be an
affirmative step toward peace making in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib said the meeting will tackle
the Mideast peace process on all the tracks, especially the
Palestinian-Israeli one.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian National
Authority is scheduled to meet in the Jordanian capital later in
the day to discuss the latest developments of the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries which signed
peace treaties with Israel, have been playing a key role in
mediating the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will deal with the obstacles in the peace
negotiations on the Palestinian track and explore ways of boosting
the negotiations in the coming stage, al-Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been stalled
since December when Israel shelved the Wye accord after carrying
out the first of the three-phased withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on several occasions announced
he will proclaim an independent state on May 4 when the five-year
interim self-rule period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is striving to rally world
support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, is opposed to the Palestinian move, denouncing
it as a unilateral action. The Jewish state has threatened to take
tough measures against the step, including annexation of parts of
the West Bank under its control.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns: NATO Actions in Yugoslavia Within Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook on Saturday warned that NATO could begin actions in
Yugoslavia within days unless its President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed to a peace deal with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But he said in an interview with BBC radio that the West was
ready to reconvene peace talks on Kosovo at any time if Belgrade
decided it was ready to accept the peace package on the war-
ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no progress, we are looking at a time scale of a
matter of days in which (NATO military) action can begin," he said.
"As it is, the situation is very grave."
</P>
<P>
"At any time we are willing to reconvene the peace talks, but
only if Belgrade first tells us that it really is willing to
accept the peace package," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reasons of the peace talks collapse in Paris
on Friday, Cook alleged that "the Serb side was showing no serious
commitment to negotiation."
</P>
<P>
"They had gone back on points agreed before," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who have been fighting for
independence, on Thursday accepted the peace deal worked out by
the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia. The deal promised the
Albanians' autonomy.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslav side rejected the deal, saying its detailed
arrangement of sending troops to monitor the peace implementation
interfered its nation's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
International truce monitors are now being pulled out of Kosovo,
and Britain on Friday joined other Western countries in ordering
its nationals out of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Reporter Turns CNN African Journalist of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian reporter Declan Okpalaeke
from The Guardian has beat 180 entrants from 15 nations to win
this year's CNN African Journalist of the Year Award, The Guardian
on Saturday reported.
</P>
<P>
Okpalaeke picked up the prestigious prize in Johannesburg of
South Africa last Thursday for his article in Health/Medical
category titled "Message of Hope".
</P>
<P>
The winning piece was unanimously adjudged by a panel of
assessors as "a powerful article on male infertility".
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday by CNN International quoted the panel
Chairman Joel Kibazo as describing the article as one "the judges
all agreed upon without a shadow of doubt was the best piece right
through the competition."
</P>
<P>
Okpalaeke was presented with his award by eminent South
African politician and businessman, Cyril Ramaphosa who said
unless Africans developed skills and acquired technical
capabilities to put across their messages, the African voice would
continue to be a whisper in the ears of the world.
</P>
<P>
The winning entry "Message of Hope" is a report on five-month
research by The Guardian on Saturday on male infertility and its
anti-doses.
</P>
<P>
Under the research, the efficacy of local herb Ogbolo in
enhancing male fertility was tested and a resolution was found to
declining fertility among contemporary African men, according to
Okpalaeke.
</P>
<P>
An elated Okpalaeke told the newspaper on telephone from
Johannesburg that "as the African Journalist of the Year, I have
to be very careful on what and how I write because I represent the
whole continent. And so, the eyes of the world would be on me."
</P>
<P>
Okpalaeke's reward for his article include a three-day visit to
Atlanta and two days in New York at CNN's yearly World Report
Conference where he will have the opportunity to tour the CNN News
Group operations and meet with key CNN executives.
</P>
<P>
While in New York, there will be the United Nations Day at
which a keynote address will be presented by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Okpalaeke will have an opportunity
to tour the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Okpalaeke will receive "a generous cash prize from CNN's major
broadcasting partner and contributors to the awards, the South
African Broadcasting corporation".
</P>
<P>
In November last year at the seventh edition of the Nigeria
Media Merit Award, he won three of the four awards, namely the
Abubakar Imam Prize for the Best Features Writer of the year, the
NAFCON Prize for the Best Agri/ Environment Reporter of the year,
and The Guardian Prize for the Best Investigative Reporter of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Only last year, another reporter of The Guardian on Saturday
Olukayode Thomas emerged the Journalist of the Year in sports
reporting in the same CNN Journalist of the Year Awards.

<HEADLINE> Sampaio Confident in Macao's Smooth Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted in his honor by the Macao Chamber
of Commerce, Sampaio said he "will continue to endeavor to
continue the transition within a framework of tranquillity,
respecting the historical agreement between Portugal and the
People's Republic of China over the future of Macao."
</P>
<P>
"There is a good reason to be confident, despite the
unavoidable difficulties found along the way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal and China are "concerned with the stability and
prosperity of Macao and are determined to show the international
community their capacity to complete the transition process
smoothly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the economy of Macao "has a
solid structure as was proved by its behavior during the present
regional crisis," and "its external projection has strengthened
and in the future it has the opportunity to expand, namely in the
relationship between China and Europe."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday Sampaio was present at the inaugural
ceremony of the new building of the Macao Higher Court.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony Sampaio praised the efforts of the
courts of Macao, saying, "The residents of this land will find not
only sufficient supervision for their rights in Macao and its
courts but justifiable motive to trust them as it is the courts
that will guarantee that Macao is a territory under rule of law
and its inalienable underlying principles."
</P>
<P>
Describing the new building as a "symbol of a new age," the
president said the autonomous judiciary organization will "enable
Macao to continue to be a land of freedom, security, justice and
well-being into the next millennium."
</P>
<P>
Sampaio arrived here Thursday for a five-day official visit. He
unveiled the Macao Cultural Center Friday morning after meeting
with Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to discuss issues concerning
the last stage of Macao's transition period. Macao's handover to
China is to take place in December this year.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio will tour some local academic and community
institutions in the next two days before leaving for home on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Lockerbie Trial Closer Than Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Saturday it was closer than ever to have a fair trial
of the two Libyan suspects accused of the 1988 Pan Am airliner
bombing that killed 270 people on board.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep up our efforts right up until the moment the two
suspects land in the Netherlands. This now looks a real
possibility," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said a trial would give relatives of the bombing
victims the chance to learn about evidence in the case that could
not be released earlier because it could have prejudiced
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi confirmed on Friday in a letter
to the U.N. that he will release the two men on or before April 6
to stand trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain say they have convincing
evidence that the two Libyan suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- planted the bomb that blew
up Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on
December 21, 1988.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Afghan Fighting to Harm Peace Talks: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The renewed fighting in recent
days in Afghanistan will jeopardize the peace talks, senior
Taliban official Amir Khan Muttaqi was quoted as saying by a
report reaching here from Kabul Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi, who is responsible for information affairs, said that
although the two Afghan warring factions did not reach a
cease-fire agreement in their recent talks in Ashgabat, there
naturally seems to be no justification for fighting when peace
talks are under way.
</P>
<P>
Hopes have been created for peaceful settlement of the Afghan
crisis during the Ashgabad peace talks held from March 11 to 14,
he said. However, the renewed fighting will jeopardize the peace
talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Now, the law launched by the opposition would certainly have
adverse impacts on the talks and would create more mistrust and
also shatter peace hopes, the Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghanistan's Bakhtar News Agency, fighting has
again broken out between the Taliban and the anti-Taliban alliance
in the war-ravaged country. Muttaqi said the rival alliance
started fighting from Jablus Siraj Friday but the Taliban have
foiled the offensives.
</P>
<P>
Only a few days after the recent agreement was concluded for
sharing power in Afghanistan, the Afghan warring factions accused
each other of carrying out military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen from the two sides have said fighting is going on now
at three fronts, Jablus Siraj north of Kabul in Borbund Valley,
Bamyan and Saripul.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the anti-Taliban forces made a forceful attack on
the Bamyan town, capital city of Bamyan province, Friday night.
However, it met strong resistance from the Taliban Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Muttaqi, fighting has also been going on near
Saraipul for the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi blamed the opposition forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood
for carrying out offensives on Ghorband district in Parwan
province Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the beginning the opposition forces succeeded
in capturing some posts from the Taliban, but later they were
defeated, leaving behind two bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Masood forces also launched an attack in the outskirts of
Bamyan Friday night which continued till Saturday morning, but
they suffered defeat at this front as well, the Taliban spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Fund Set Up in Malaysia for Pig Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese Encephalitis (JE)
Humanitarian Fund was set up in Malaysia Saturday for pig farmers
and villagers badly affected by the JE epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The fund set up by the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) has
an initial sum of 620,000 ringgit (about 163,157 U.S. dollars)
pledged by MCA leaders, said MCA President Ling Liong Sik who is
the federal transport minister.
</P>
<P>
The fund would be channeled to the Negeri Sembilan state JE
Relief Committee for disbursement to the farmers and villagers,
Ling said after chairing an MCA Central Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The MCA, the largest Chinese-based political party in Malaysia,
would launch the fund soon and hoped the public would give its
full support, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
The JE epidemic, said to spread from pigs to human beings via
the Culex mosquito, has badly affected the livelihood of pig
farmers and villagers, causing the death of more than 50 people so
far.
</P>
<P>
The government set up last Wednesday a task force headed by
Health Minister Chua Jui Meng, which decided to destroy 64,000
pigs to control the disease and vaccinate 260,000 people living in
three high-risk areas of the southern state of Negeri Sembilan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban have foiled
offensives by the anti-Taliban forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood at
various war fronts, Afghanistan's Bakhtar News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition forces are reported to have carried out attacks
in recent days on the Taliban's positions in Parwan, Bamyan and
Saripul provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, claimed to have inflicted heavy losses in
men and material on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said the opposition forces fled all the three front
lines after suffering losses.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the opposition for initiating fighting in the
Taliban-controlled areas when peace and negotiations to end
fighting in Afghanistan are going on.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities are desirous of continuing talks with
the opposition, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Ruling Party Announces Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Nepali Congress (NC)
Saturday announced its manifesto for the May election to the House
of Representatives, which calls for a majority government under NC
for good law and order, development and employment.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto promises to fight extremism and corruption and
work for a clean and effective parliament. It also commits the
party to increasing productivity and income and developing water
resources for national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign policy, the manifesto promises to raise
national prestige through diplomatic dialogues to resolve such
issues as the withdrawal of Indian troops from Kalapani of
far-western Nepal and a review of the 1950 Indo-Nepal Peace and
Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
NC President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala compared
the upcoming election to a referendum, saying it will decide
whether the country adopts a democratic or non-democratic system.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that a coalition government is the
worst kind of government which mars development activities and
encourages corruption.
</P>
<P>
NC prime ministerial candidate Krishna Prasad Bhattarai said
all the other major parties like the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and the National Democratic
Party (RPP) are divided.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that as the only major party which remains
undivided, the NC can provide a stable government.
</P>
<P>
But the naming of candidates for the election has generated
much controversy in the party, which, many observers say, would
make a dent in the party's performance.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, NC's major ruling partner, has announced its
election manifesto which also calls for its own majority
government for political stability, good governance, development
and national pride and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The election will be held in two phases on May 3 and May 17.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan VP Vows Not to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe has vowed not to resign in spite of mounting pressure from
MPs who have threatened to censure her.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, who doubles as Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries, revealed this decision when interviewed by
the New Vision paper Friday, the leading daily here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary select committee on agriculture, headed by
Anthony Kanyike, made the threats after presenting a report
earlier this week to the plenary session of Parliament, saying
that there has been massive incompetence, mismanagement and
corruption in projects under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that she had no reason to resign her
ministerial post because as human beings, everybody is likely to
make mistakes. Moreover, she can competently correct the mistakes
she ever made, she said.
</P>
<P>
The report by the select committee accuses Kazibwe of failing
to supervise the 3.4 billion shilling (3.4 million U.S. dollars)
valley dams project by bogus contractors.
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke late last year with MPs saying while billions
of shillings had been spent, there were no valley dams. Kazibwe
insisted that the valley dams, though incomplete, did exist.
</P>
<P>
The report gives shocking examples of substandard work at all
the 15 valley dams which are meant to bring water to livestock and
people in some districts.
</P>
<P>
While accusing the report of insincerity, the vice president
also said that the responsibility for the mistakes, if any, should
be pinpointed on the permanent secretary of the ministry because
he is the very person managing the whole ministry's projects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kazibwe is overloaded and that some
MPs demanded she resign as minister. They also said that the vice
president did not show enough respect for Parliament because she
did not try to explain to the House what she did in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is being gripped by scandals of corruption. Two
ministers have been censured by Parliament for abuse of office or
corruption in the country's privatization process. Kazibwe's case
is the Parliament's latest effort to weed out corruption in the
ruling elite.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Spurs Economic Growth in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A significantly improved
transportation system has helped to accelerate economic
development in southwest China's municipality of Chongqing
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total length of the municipality's
highway system stretched 26,000 km by the end of 1996, up 70
percent from that in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has been constructing five other expressways
since completion of the 114-kilometer-long Chongqing-Chengdu
Expressway in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has also improved its railway, river and air
transportation systems since the 1980s. The shipping capacity for
Chongqing Port jumped to 17 million tons by the end of 1998, a 22-
fold increase on the 1970s level. The passenger volume for the
Chongqing Jiangbei Airport has registered an annual average growth
of 28 percent since the 1990s, with the facility's freight
capacity surging by 34 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of telecommunications has eased the "
bottleneck" previously limiting Chongqing's contact with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
The output value for telecommunication services has soared 40
percent annually since 1991. The formerly underdeveloped
communications systems in the Three Gorges Area now features
convenient domestic and international long distance call services
available to most villages.
</P>
<P>
Improved basic facilities have attracted increased foreign
investment, with the total influx of funds hitting 1.1 billion US
dollars by the end of October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing enjoyed an annual rise of 40 percent in foreign
investment last year, in spite of the fact that most parts of the
country witnessed declines in related funding.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Set up Embassy in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will soon have
a resident diplomatic mission in Libya, South African President
Nelson Mandela announced in Tripoli Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after his announcement that two Libyans,
wanted for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, will be handed over to the
U.N. for trial.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Mandela as saying that
he would get to work on establishing the mission when he returns
to South Africa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"When I arrive back in South Africa tomorrow (Saturday) the
implementation of that decision will be one of the first matters
that I shall attend to."
</P>
<P>
"Libya has been such an important ally for so long. (This) is
also intended to signal to the Libyan people and the world that we
are proud of the steps that Libyan people have taken today
(Friday) in regard to the Lockerbie issue," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
In an telephone interview with Xinhua Saturday, South African
Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said the diplomatic mission
in Libya will be definitely on ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no reasons for South Africa to downgrade the
 relations.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Libya established diplomatic ties shortly
after the first all-race elections in 1994. But diplomatic matters
in Libya have been overseen by the South African mission in
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in Tripoli Friday that Libya has decided to
hand over the two suspects on or before April 6 for trial in the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Lake Under Legal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, a
major grain producer, has recently enacted a law bringing the
country's fifth largest lake under legal protection.
</P>
<P>
The Regulations on Prevention and Control of Pollution in
Chaohu Lake, adopted by the Standing Committee of the Provincial
People's Congress this year, contain strict stipulations on the
supervision and management of polluters, the prevention and
control of pollution in the water, as well as penalties for
offenders.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's Chaohu Lake is more than 800 square kilometers in area,
and has been suffering from severe pollution in recent years as
some 280 million tons of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage
flows into it annually.
</P>
<P>
The central and provincial governments have launched a campaign
to halt all pollutant emissions from factories around the lake by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the local law, all manufacturers at the lake must
install pollution-prevention facilities and must report their
waste discharges to government departments.
</P>
<P>
The law also calls for use of organic manure and the
construction of more water-conservation works and urban sewage
treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
No phosphorus detergents are to be sold or used in the lake
basin as of next year, according to the law.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya airport police are
detaining an aircraft alleged to have smuggled three guns into
the country from Somalia, according to the Kenya Airport Police
Unit commandant Francis Waithaka.
</P>
<P>
Four Kenyan businessmen of Somali origin, including a man and
his wife, were being held over the weapons, the commandant was
quoted as saying Friday by the Daily Nation newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The guns were concealed in powder milk containers, a trick
commonly used by transport narcotic drugs, the commandant said,
adding that police had not detected similar cases of trafficking
guns.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft landed at Wilson airport on Thursday night. The
suspects were arrested Friday morning when they went to pick up
their cargo.
</P>
<P>
It may be a private plane and it is detained for participating
in smuggling guns, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Waithaka displayed the guns and the containers, saying the
cargo consisted of 60 tins full of powdered milk.

<HEADLINE> International Call Prices Might Fall in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- International call charges in
the Gulf countries are likely to fall drastically in the coming
years, the UAE's Gulf News daily said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is
pressuring the region's state-controlled telecom monopolies to cut
down their charges on international calls, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting industry sources, the paper said the Gulf telecom
operators need to bring about a balance in rates between
international and local calls.
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure costs are higher for local calls and lower
for international calls and hence it is not rational to charge
high rates for international calls and charge nothing for local
calls," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the FCC is seeking a two-thirds
reduction in the international call rate from the United Arab
Emirates to the U.S. from 65 cents per minute last year to a
benchmark of 9-22 cents.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE's rate is the lowest in the region, which means that
other telephone operators will be even more dramatically
affected," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The fall in international call charges will in turn have an
impact on the revenues of Gulf telecom monopolies who earn most of
their revenues from international calls.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the UAE's telecom operator Etisalat earns over 50
percent of its revenues from international calls while Kuwait's
telecom operator earns some 75 percent of its revenues from
international calls, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- the Norwegian government
granted Friday a total 51 million Norwegian kroners (about 360,000
U.S. dollars) for construction of a 66 kilovolt power line from
Zambia's northern Mbala to Sumbawanga in southwestern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to a contract signed between Tanzania Electricity
Supply Company (TANESCO) and Nor-ICIL, the contractor from Norway,
the 122- kilometer power transmission will replace the outdated
Sumbwanga's electricity produced with imported fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
The TANESCO Managing Director Baruany Luhanga said that during
one-year construction expected to start soon, two substations will
be built in Sumbawanga and an extension of substation in Mbala.
</P>
<P>
Luhanga said the document will also be sent to Zambia's
Electricity Supply Company (ZESCO) for approval.
</P>
<P>
The TANESCO chief said it was cheaper to import power from
Zambia than the hydro-electric power generated from water falls in
Kalambo.
</P>
<P>
Kalambo is one of the leading water falls in Africa situated in
the conjunction point of Tanzania's southern regions of Mbeya and

<HEADLINE> 2 Pro-Israeli Militiamen Wounded in Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Friday in a bomb explosion
in south Lebanon, the SLA announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio quoted SLA sources as saying
the remote-controlled bomb exploded on a road in Jezzine, just
outside the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, when a
patrol of SLA was passing by.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing. But in
the past, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, always
used roadside bombs to attack militiamen in Jezzine, which has
long been policed by SLA.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 11 the number of SLA members wounded in
south Lebanon since the start of this year. One militiaman was
killed in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to dispel Israeli occupation forces
and its ally SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Cease-fire Verifiers Leave Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kosovars
woke up Saturday trying to get used to the fact that they saw no
more orange-colored vehicles, be it jeeps, ambulances, pick-ups or
armored cars.
</P>
<P>
The loud-colored vehicles were all gone early in the morning
after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (
OSCE) decided to withdraw all its cease-fire verifiers from the
Yugoslav province following the failure of the peace talks in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced on Friday afternoon and the
verifiers, some 1,400 of them from the OSCE member countries,
gathered in their respective regional centers in central, western,
eastern, northern and southern Kosovo for departure.
</P>
<P>
They then drove the orange cars all toward one direction, the
border with Macedonia, where NATO has amassed an 1,800-strong
extraction force in case things go wrong with the verifiers.
</P>
<P>
The verifiers came late last year as a cease-fire verification
deal was reached between the OSCE and the Yugoslav authorities,
and they operated in all parts of Kosovo to try to monitor the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The verification mission was carried through five regional
bureaus which were further divided into 23 coordination centers
with field offices further down, from which patrol vehicles made
the daily rounds.
</P>
<P>
Before passing the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border, William Walker,
chief of the verification mission, told the press that it was sad
that the verifiers had to leave but hoped that they could roll
back very quickly after the Yugoslav authorities sign the peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
"With our departure, there is sure to be greater tension and
anxiety," said Walker, who had been described as a person non
grata after he had termed the Racak incident a "massacre" in
January.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat said that he expected things to go worse
before turning better.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he expected NATO to deliver its long-
threatened air strikes, Walker said that it was the business of
NATO and not that of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
Though not easy to define the verification mission either a
success or a failure, Walker said that at least the mission made
the difference while in Kosovo and gave the peace process the time.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Fund Kenya's Population Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Population Fund (UNPF)
will contribute 204 million shillings (3.4 million U.S. dollars)
toward Kenya's national population census scheduled for August
this year.
</P>
<P>
UNPF country representative Coulibaly Sidiki said his
organization would also donate 100 computers to facilitate fast
and easy processing of data during the exercise, the Kenya Times
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All we are trying to do is to avert the crisis that rocked the
1989 population census in this country." Sidiki said when he paid
a courtesy call on Shariff Nassir, Minister of National Heritage,
Culture and Social Services.
</P>
<P>
Sidiki also called on other international charitable
organizations to help fund the exercise, saying that the census
was the backbone of Kenya's both political and economic planning.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that UNPF has never been bent on trying to
impose foreign policies on Kenya, but rather, worked alongside
government strategic policies.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said part of the funds to be contributed by his
organization will be spent on public awareness campaigns prior to
the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Nassir asked non-governmental organizations operating in
various parts of the country not to act as lone-rangers in their
efforts to assist Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
He called for a closer collaboration between his government and
NGOs, adding that certain NGOs operated secretly without either
the knowledge or involvement of government departments.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Finance Ministers End Meeting in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Third ASEAN Finance Ministers
Meeting (AFMM) ended here Saturday morning after adopting a joint
statement stressing that ASEAN finance ministers resolve to
further enhance regional economic and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the crisis has introduced new challenges to
the ASEAN's commitment to economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the crisis has strengthened their resolve to
remain united while recognizing ASEAN member countries' diversity,
and explore options to further enhance ASEAN cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) "have forged an ASEAN consensus on the reform of
the international financial architecture," the statement said. In
this regard, they agreed that the global effort to resolve the
current crisis must recognize the diverse circumstances and
priorities of individual economies at different stages of
development. Any proposed solution must therefore be sufficiently
flexible to accommodate these differences.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Sinh Hung, Vietnam's finance minister and chairman of
the meeting, said at a joint press conference after the AFMM that
the ministers considered and adopted the first report of the ASEAN
Select Committee on the ASEAN Surveillance Process.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of ASEAN finance ministers, Hung called on developed
economies to keep their market open to the ASEAN and urged
international financial institutions to provide further assistance
to crisis-affected countries and other countries which are
currently under the threat of crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the outcomes of the first meeting of vice ministers
of finance and deputy central bank governors of ASEAN and China,
South Korea and Japan," he said. "We have all agreed that ASEAN
will closely coordinate and cooperate with our three dialogue
partners in strengthening financial stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Hung said, "We noted with appreciation China's commitment not
to devalue the renminbi."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, ASEAN finance ministers also met with
senior representatives from international financial institutions
such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the
Asian Development Bank. In the consultations, the ministers called
for continued and intensified assistance from the organizations to
the ASEAN in the recovery process and control the risks of further
contagion to new ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to hold the fourth meeting in Brunei
Darussalam in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The third AFMM opened on Friday morning, with the participation
of finance ministers from the nine ASEAN member countries --

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Students Demonstrate Against Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enraged by what they termed "American imperialism and
protectionist tendencies on the offending American citizens", the
students presented a petition to the American Embassy and the
British High Commission before presenting a copy to the
Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF) National Headquarters, the daily
Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In their petition the students accused the U.S. government of
treating its citizens as superior than Zimbabweans citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting against American imperialism which has no
mandate whatsoever to dictate to us what we must do with our
country. America is not superior to any other country and we are
tired of its policies and its funding of destabilizing force,"
the students said.
</P>
<P>
They accused the British government of conniving with the
Americans in making life difficult for millions of Zimbabweans
through unpractical monetary lending terms.
</P>
<P>
The students' demonstration comes in the wake of arrest of
three American citizens at the Harare International Airport two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The three were remanded in custody while investigations into
their involvement into possible acts of terrorism continue.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves to Visit Qatar, UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Saturday morning left here for official visits to Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates(UAE) aimed at promoting bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Hoss visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt last month.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the prime minister's palace said Hoss will spend a
day in Qatar and another in Abu Dhabi for talks with the two
countries' leaders on ways of promoting investments in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with the leaders of the two oil-rich Gulf
nations the ongoing Israeli-Lebanese confrontation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of seven Israelis, including a general,
were killed in south Lebanon in the ambushes launched by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes and artillery forces pounded
villages and hills in the country's eastern and southern areas
for several days.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to evict Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Under Construction Collapses in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An indoor sports complex, under
construction in Southeast Bangladesh's Feni district, collapsed on
Thursday killing six people, a report in The Daily Star newspaper
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 workers were injured when the roof of the gave in at
Masterpara Children's Park in the district, some 136 kilometers
southeast of here. Six of them died on their way to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The district administration has formed a five-member inquiry
committee to probe the worst accident in the frontier town in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the sports complex was reportedly illegal
as the land on which it being built was donated by late Shishir
Majumdar, who had made it clear that the land should be used for a
children's park only or his successors would become the owners,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Local Government Ministry rejected the proposal of building
a stadium at the park a year ago and officials of Feni
Municipality were quoted as saying they had been compelled to
forward a project profile for the indoor stadium under pressure
from a "very influential" person.
</P>
<P>
Some workers, who were doing the construction work, said the
roof on a 35-feet wall was built and beams were set up only with
bamboo props, without centering steel and iron pillars and bars,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Ready to Improve Tokyo-Pyongyang Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi Saturday announced his readiness to improve the
relations between his country and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) to ease the confrontational atmosphere on the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to improve Japan's ties with the Communist country
to shift the confrontational structure on the Korean peninsula to
a peaceful one," Obuchi said in his speech titled "Korea-Japan
Relations in the 21st Century, Creation of a New History" at Korea
University here.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan fully supports the four-day meeting involving
South Korea, the DPRK, the United States and China to bring a
permanent peace to Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister called for the inclusion of Japan and
Russia in the four-way peace talks on Korean issues.
</P>
<P>
"A six-way conference that includes Japan and Russia also must
be considered as an agenda for securing trust and easing of
tension in the area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who arrived here Friday afternoon for a three-day visit,
met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting the two leaders discussed a comprehensive
package approach toward the DPRK and cooperation in dealing with
DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development program and missile
issues.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the meeting, Obuchi said his
government supports President Kim's policy to engage Pyongyang,
which seeks reconciliation, cooperation and exchange based on
separating politics and business.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister also said he and President Kim will
make a joint appeal to DPRK leaders to open channels of dialogue
for reconciliation and exchange.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Tokyo Promise Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan on Saturday
stressed the importance of closer cooperation between Seoul, Tokyo
and Washington for maintaining stability and peace on the Korean
peninsula and in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting at South Korea presidential palace Blue House,
South Korea President Kim Dae-jung and visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi discussed a comprehensive package approach
toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
promotion of bilateral cooperation in dealing with DPRK's
suspected nuclear arms development program and missile issues.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders adopted a five-point South
Korean-Japanese Economic Cooperation Agenda for 21st Century,
calling for the conclusion of a bilateral investment treaty by the
year 2001 and early implementation of the bilateral double tax
avoidance agreement signed last October.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the agenda is designed for conclusion of a
bilateral free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the summit, the two leaders
issued a nine-point statement on bilateral partnership and
implementation of the joint action plan they announced last
October during Kim's visit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the progress made in defense
exchange between the two nations, including preparation for a
second security policy meeting in June this year.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Kim stressed that he explained to the
Japanese prime minister his "sunshine policy" toward Pyongyang and
the importance of improving relations between Pyongyang, Tokyo and
Washington to the policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Obuchi said Japan supports President Kim's policy to
engage Pyongyang in a bid to remove confrontation from the Korean
peninsula and seeks to improve its ties with the DPRK by solving
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But he also said Japan will cope with pressing security
problems caused by the DPRK's ballistic missiles and nuclear arms
development program.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they will make a joint appeal to DPRK
leaders to open channels of dialogue for reconciliation and
exchanges, instead of escalated confrontation and tension.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who arrived here Friday afternoon for a three-day visit,
is the first Japanese prime minister to visit South Korea since
Tomiichi Muryayama's visit in 1994.

<HEADLINE> 71 Teams for Short-course World Swimming Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-one countries and
regions have confirmed to take part in the next month's short-
course (25 meters) world swimming championships in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), a Hong Kong Swimming
Association official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officer said: "Up to the deadline for the submission today,
71 teams have confirmed their entries to the event."
</P>
<P>
The fourth world short-course swimming championships is to be
held from April 1-4 in the Hong Kong Coliseum in Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Association had announced earlier this
month a young squad, which includes 12 male and 15 female swimmers.
The Association has said that Chinese swimmers' main target was
next year's Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese swimmers had been very impressive for their
performance at the three previous short-course championships,
which proved that training sessions in short pools had long been
the key part of Chinese swimmers' tuning-up for major events.
</P>
<P>
Swimming powerhouse Australia is sending 45 swimmers to the
biannual event, to field the largest team in the SAR championships.
Germany will bring here 38 male and female athletes. Another
world swimming power United States will send a surprisingly small
squad of 13 to compete in the largest swimming event of the year.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Appeals to SADC for Proper Resource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has appealed to the
Supreme Audit Institutions in the Southern African Development
Community (SADCOSAI) to ensure proper management, control and
accountability of public funds.
</P>
<P>
"Issues of accountability, transparency and good governance
have become increasingly relevant in recent years especially when
government functions in the SADC region are witnessing
unprecedented economic and social development which has stimulated
an increased public sector spending," Michael Kamphambe Nkhoma,
deputy secretary to the Malawian president and cabinet, said
Friday in Blantyre when he officially closed the SADCOSAI seventh
congress.
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma thus called on the supreme audit institutions to respond
accordingly by ensuring that there is efficiency, effectiveness
and economy in the use of "these scarce resources," reported the
Malawi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said accountability of governments has become a recurring
condition of aid dispensation.
</P>
<P>
Thus good public accountability has become an essential
component of good governance and a vital component of economic
governance.
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma said lack of accountability amounts to bribery and
failure of professionalism.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that audit institutions need to be
strengthened in a bid to respond to the changing environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Conference Blantyre Declaration, Nkhoma said:
"It is recognized that supreme audit institutions can accomplish
their noble tasks objectively and effectively only if they are
functionally and organizationally independent of the auditees."
</P>
<P>
However, he said state institutions cannot be absolutely

<HEADLINE> Malawi Appeals to SADC for Proper Resource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has appealed to the
Supreme Audit Institutions in the Southern African Development
Community (SADCOSAI) to ensure proper management, control and
accountability of public funds.
</P>
<P>
"Issues of accountability, transparency and good governance
have become increasingly relevant in recent years especially when
government functions in the SADC region are witnessing
unprecedented economic and social development which has stimulated
an increased public sector spending," Michael Kamphambe Nkhoma,
deputy secretary to the Malawian president and cabinet, said
Friday in Blantyre when he officially closed the SADCOSAI seventh
congress.
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma thus called on the supreme audit institutions to respond
accordingly by ensuring that there is efficiency, effectiveness
and economy in the use of "these scarce resources," reported the
Malawi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said accountability of governments has become a recurring
condition of aid dispensation.
</P>
<P>
Thus good public accountability has become an essential
component of good governance and a vital component of economic
governance.
</P>
<P>
Nkhoma said lack of accountability amounts to bribery and
failure of professionalism.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that audit institutions need to be
strengthened in a bid to respond to the changing environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Conference Blantyre Declaration, Nkhoma said:
"It is recognized that supreme audit institutions can accomplish
their noble tasks objectively and effectively only if they are
functionally and organizationally independent of the auditees."
</P>
<P>
However, he said state institutions cannot be absolutely
independent because they form part of the state machinery as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Continues to Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade continued to shrink in February 1999, registering a hefty
12.9 percent decline compared to the same month of 1998, the Trade
Development Board (TDB) of Singapore said in a press release
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The overall non-oil domestic exports (NODX) remained weak as it
contracted by 6.0 percent in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, non-oil re-export (NORX) saw a hefty 16.9 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports fell by 12.3 percent in February 1999,
following a 7.0 percent decline in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
TDB said the worsened performance was mainly due to weak demand
from Malaysia and India, two of the key markets for Singapore's
oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Of Singapore's top five markets, only the EU market managed to
expand marginally while the remaining four markets, the United
States, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong, continued to shrink.
</P>
<P>
NODX to EU grew by 5.4 percent in February 1999, following a
marginal 1.6 percent increase in January in 1999.
</P>
<P>
NODX to Hong Kong plummeted by 26.1 percent in February 1999,
the 10th consecutive month of decline while NODX to the United
States, Malaysia and Japan contracted by 7.5 percent, 10.0 percent
and 13.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
NODX to the emerging markets fell by 3.8 percent in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
TDB said NODX to China continued to expand by 6.8 percent while
NODX to the Latin America and Eastern European markets continued
to shrink, reflecting weakened economic conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports continued to decline in February 1999, by 13.6
percent, and the decline was mainly in imports of integrated
circuits PCBAs, disk drives, parts of CTVs and radios, as well as
parts of aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Bans All Imports of Live Pigs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) --Singapore government has placed a
total ban on all live pig imports and closed its abattoirs
following hospitalization of five more abattoir workers for brain
infection.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Primary Production Department (PPD) Chua
Sin Bin in a briefing Friday said that all imports of live pigs
into Singapore are banned with immediate effect so as to remove
all possible sources of infection from pigs.
</P>
<P>
The ban covering live pig imports both from Malaysia and
Indonesia was announced one day after the PPD declared Thursday
night suspension of live pig imports from West Malaysia farms
north of Johor.
</P>
<P>
PPD has also disallowed cross-border crossings of horses on
account that they are also susceptible to the virus.
</P>
<P>
The moves are a precautionary measure as the authorities have
yet to determine if Japanese Encephalistis (JE) has crossed the
border into Singapore from Malaysia where there has been an
outbreak of JE which commonly infects pigs.
</P>
<P>
Normally Singapore imports about 4000 pigs daily of which
Malaysia accounts for about four fifths and the rest comes from
Indonesia. The total ban of live pigs means that fresh pork will
no longer be available in the city state, but chilled and frozen
pork will still be available from countries like Australia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the JE can not be transmitted through pork
consumption or from person to person, Chua stressed that there was
no cause for public alarm and there is no need for the public to
get vaccinations against JE unless they have come into contact
with live pigs.
</P>
<P>
According to a doctor, JE was an "occupational hazard" and in
both Malaysia and Singapore it had affected only those in close
contact with the live pigs. It is transmitted by the bite of a
Culex mosquito which has bitten an infected pig.

<HEADLINE> Chile Granted 79-Billion-Dollar Loan By IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
said Friday that Chile has been granted a 79 billion U.S. dollar
loan by the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
Frei, just back from his trip to France and the Czech Republic,
said Chile received the loan during the 40th annual meeting of the
Interamerican Development Bank in Paris on March 12.
</P>
<P>
He said 55 billion dollars of the loan would be used to carry
out the country's social development plan, assist poor areas,
reform the educational system and develop science and technology.
Another 24 billion would be used to develop small- and medium-
sized enterprises, and to readjust the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to France and the Czech Republic, Frei urged
European nations not to lose confidence in the Chilean economy and
to increase their investment in the country, since Chile was still
the fastest growing country in Latin America with an economic
growth of 3 percent and an inflation rate of only 4.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Europe invested 196.9 billion U.S. dollars
in Chile last year, dropping 11 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Frei said the next annual meeting of the IDB is scheduled for
Chile in the year 2001. About 6,000 bankers worldwide are expected
to attend.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Europe, Frei reiterated his belief that the
trial of former dictator Augusto Pinochet be held in Chile. He
added that Chile would continue to safeguard its state sovereignty
and oppose extraterritoriality.

Thomas Klestil Friday, urged foreign investors to have confidence
in the Romanian market and increase their investments in the

<P>
Constantinescu pledged that his country will continue to reform
the economic structure to build a "genuine" market economy "as

</P>
<P>
Although a series of austerity policies have been made to
guarantee the stability of the national economy, the country's
economic situation will gradually improve and the government will
take all possible means to meet the expectations of foreign
investors, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government's austerity measures include the
suspension of a series of policies designed to encourage foreign
investment, such as the cancellation of preferential tariffs on
imports.
</P>
<P>
Klestil, accompanied by a team of businessmen, arrived here
Thursday on a two-day state visit, the first of its kind in more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, the Austrian president said bilateral trade and
economic ties between Austria and Romania have a broad prospect
for further development, and that Austria is confident in the
future of the Romanian market. So far, there have been some 1,500
Austrian-Romanian joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two presidents signed an agreement on
cooperation between the two countries to crack down on organized
crime. They also exchanged views on other aspects of bilateral
ties and Romania's bid to join the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Economic Recession Causes More Latin Americans Emigrates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic recession in Central
and South America last year caused a massive migration of
personnel this year, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Stein commented during the Group of Rio meeting in the Mexican
Gulf city of Veracruz that the flow of undocumented migrants from
Guatemala will increase this year, especially toward the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not have the exact figures about those who
emigrate, but the "returns" from the United States and Mexico
during the last nine months were 1,500 persons a week.
</P>
<P>
Stein said that about 15 countries in the region register
irregular migrations to North America, so it is necessary to make
a joint effort to find solutions for such problems among these
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that migration problems and drug trafficking would be
discussed at the current meeting of foreign ministers before the
Group of Rio heads of state, and the government summit with the
European Union next June.

<HEADLINE> World Conference Urges Urban Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BARCELONA, Spain, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 mayors and
delegates ended their Sixth World Megacity Conference here on
Friday, adopting the "Declaration of Barcelona," which calls on
the world's largest cities to increase their investment in
controlling pollution and other major urban problems.
</P>
<P>
After three days of discussions, the participants made a series
of proposals including the establishment of a network to monitor
hazardous pollutants in the air and a data bank to study the link
between pollution and human health.
</P>
<P>
The measures also include a major cut in sources of air
pollution and increasing education on ways to prevent pollution.
</P>
<P>
As air pollution in big cities exceed safe levels, the
participants urged cities to use unleaded fuels, speed up car
innovation, limit the use of cars, and increase public mass
transit systems.
</P>
<P>
The conference also suggested the use of bicycles to reduce
urban pollution.
</P>
<P>
The conference opened on Wednesday. Delegates from over 60
countries throughout the world attended the event.
</P>
<P>
The event is sponsored by the Association of World Megacities,
established in 1985 and composed of 63 members. The purpose of the
organization is to promote cooperation among cities in resolving
social problems and improving standards of living.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Chongqing,
Wuhan, Shengyang and Hangzhou attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Ministers Meeting Ends With Adoption of Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VERACRUZ, Mexico, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The 18th Rio Group's
Foreign Ministers Ordinary Meeting closed Friday with the adoption
of the "Act of Veracruz."
</P>
<P>
The closing ceremony was presided over by Mexican Foreign
Secretary Rosario Green, who is serving as the Pro-Tempore
Secretary of the Permanent Mechanism of Political Consultation and
Coordination of the Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
Green said at the closing ceremony that the "Act of Veracruz"
shows that the Rio Group countries have a common historical
heritage of shared principles and adopted consensus, which must be
the guidelines to continue consolidating the Permanent Mechanism
as a more complete instrument of dialogue and coordination in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers from 14 Rio Group member countries convened
Thursday in the Mexican port city of Veracruz to prepare for the
13th Rio Summit Meeting, scheduled for May 28-29 in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The Rio foreign ministers have reportedly designed an agile and
realistic agenda for the 13th Summit Meeting, which will be
devoted to finance issues and arrangements for another meeting
with the European Union (EU) on June 26-28 in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the agenda for the Summit of the
Group could include two fundamental themes that require priority
attention: the international financial crisis and the preparation
for the Latin America and the Caribbean-European Union Summit in
June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The ministers believed that stability of the international
financial markets and the growth of the world economy are a
collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The ministers exchanged views on diverse topics, with special
emphasis on the strengthening of the bloc to more efficiently face
the challenges at the end of the millennium, according to a press
communique issued at the end of the one-day Veracruz meeting.
</P>
<P>
The permanent Mechanism of Political Consultation and
Coordination was founded in 1986 with the purpose of expanding
cooperation and dialogue in the region.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Runner Sues Cigarette Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese long-distance runner Wang
Junxia recently demanded 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars)
from the Yunnan Kunming Cigarette Factory in indemnity for
infringing on her right to her image, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in Wang's lawsuit, submitted to Shenyang
Intermediate People's Court, she accused the factory of using her
photo, without her permission nor knowledge, in a whole-page
advertisement in the Hong Kong-based Ta Kung Po on August 6, 1996,
according to a report in Beijing Youth Daily on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement ran after she won the gold medal in the 5,000-
meter contest in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Besides the indemnity, Wang also demanded a written apology
from the factory to restore her reputation and asked the factory
to bear all the expenses resulting from the litigation.
</P>
<P>
According to the factory's legal consultant, Lin Jiansai, the
cigarette producer was not sure how far in the judicial process
the case had reached, since they yet had to hear from the court.
Nevertheless, the factory had employed a law firm to investigate
the case.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the factory did not know that Wang's photo was used in
the advertisement, which was released by an advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
But the consultant said the factory certainly did not use
Wang's photo on its products.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Czech Republic Stress Political End to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and his visiting Czech counterpart, Milos Zeman, called for
new attempts through political means to ease the current Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference on Friday after their
meeting, the two prime ministers said facts have proven that
military measures do not work in helping to solve conflicts in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Zeman arrived here Thursday for a two-day official visit.
Bilateral cooperation and the regional situation were the two
major topics raised in his discussion with Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Vasile extended his congratulations to the Czech Republic's
formal admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
and Zeman, in return, noted that his government would support
Romania's application for membership in the military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Zeman said he believed the traditional friendship enjoyed by
the two countries would help promote their trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vasile echoed that there exists great potential for further
bilateral ties, adding that he hoped the two countries could
expand cooperation and benefit mutually in the fields of industry,
agriculture, energy, trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his government would continue to carry out a series
of reform policies so as to refresh the national economy, Vasila
welcomed investments by Czech entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic ranks as Romania's 22nd trade partner. Trade
turnover between the two countries in 1998 totaled 210 million U.S.
dollars, an increase of 72 percent from the previous year. To date,
the Czech Republic's direct investment in Romania reached 31
million dollars and has 127 joint ventures registered in Romania.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Second Asset Auction Fails to Achieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority (FRA) reaped little from Friday's firesale
of assets culled from financial companies which fell victim to the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The FRA announced late Friday that it fetched only 40.3 billion
baht (1.08 billion U.S. dollars), or about 18.2 percent of the
value of assets for sale.
</P>
<P>
Montri Chenvidyakarn, acting secretary-general of the FRA,
said earlier that he expected to realize around 25 percent of the
total outstanding value at the auction.
</P>
<P>
The failure, the second blow to the FRA's bid to sell off
assets of debt-ridden financial companies, did not surprise
analysts even though some had said the recent passage of
bankruptcy and foreclosure laws might increase the number of
bidders and push up prices.
</P>
<P>
Up for sale on Friday were 46 lots containing a total of more
than 7,000 loans worth 226,494 billion baht (6.2 billion dollars).
Overseas investors, including Lehman Brothers and the Pavilion
Fund, were reported to be among the big bidders for the assets.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Asset Management Corporation, the state-owned agency
set up in 1997 as "bidder of last resort" for the FRA auctions,
was the largest winner in Friday's auction.
</P>
<P>
FRA Chairman Amaret Sila-On told a press conference Friday
night that he could not say whether the auction was a failure.
</P>
<P>
He said bid prices were in line with internal benchmark prices
set up by the authority in valuing assets.
</P>
<P>
The FRA has sold nearly all of the 227.39-billion-baht (6.14
billion dollars) worth of assets in the several auctions held thus
far, fulfilling its core responsibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asset quality was generally poor, with nearly all assets
non-performing, leading to the low bid prices, FRA officials said.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time the FRA has failed to attract high
bids. The previous 10-billion-dollar auction, on December 15, 1998
and billed as the world's largest ever one-day asset sale, was a
flop too, selling only 15 of the 45 tranches of business loans and
unsolicited bids from 54 suspended finance companies with an
aggregate outstanding principal balance of around 156 billion baht
(4.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
With 46 tranches under the hammer this time, the FRA managed to
get rid of 44. The other two will go forward to the next round,
since bidders' bid lower than the current market value.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Booking System Solves Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's new passenger booking
system solving the Y2K problem has already handled more than 30,
000 orders for tickets in 2000, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official of the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China as saying that no complaints regarding the
system's data processing capability concerning 2000 have been
received, from domestic or foreign users.
</P>
<P>
The new system was made by the Civil Aviation Computer
Information Center of China after four years of research and was
put into operation on January 1 after passing international checks
and tests.
</P>
<P>
As the year 2000 draws nearer, the quest for resolving the year
2000 problem becomes more and more pressing.
</P>
<P>
The problem is caused by the fact that computers use two digits
to represent a year. For example, the year 1999 is referred to as
99. So both the years 1900 and 2000 are represented as 00 in
computer systems. That may cause chaos for all sectors using
computers, including civil aviation when 2000 comes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Eases Control to Promote Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai army will relax
commercial access to restricted border areas in a bid to help
promote Thailand's border trade with its neighbors, The Nation
Saturday quoted Army Chief General Surayuth Julanont as saying.
</P>
<P>
The general said that the army was ready to provide security
for border commerce and would invite representatives of provincial
commercial offices and chambers of commerce to sit on local border
committees, which hold regular talks with neighboring countries to
resolve border disputes and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement during a meeting Friday with Deputy
Commerce Minister Pravit Rattanapien and President of the Thai
Chamber of Commerce Vichien Techapaibul.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by Pravit to resolve the ongoing
border trade problems and note multilateral efforts to boost
commerce along the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Surayuth said that he believed all neighboring countries are
willing to boost their trade and economies, but there were still
problems and obstacles to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
He said the army would provide special security and protection
on the Thai-Myanmar border, since Myanmar often closed its
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
On the Cambodian border, the army had already relaxed
restrictions on Thai goods and access by Thai traders.
</P>
<P>
It would also de-mine three areas in the Northeast which have
potential to be opened as border crossings with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The army would also consider relaxing access to the Thai-Lao
restricted area in the northern Nan province, Surayuth said.
</P>
<P>
The current value of Thai border trade is 107.97 billion baht
(2.92 billion U.S. dollars), of which 84.31 billion baht (2.27
billion dollars) is exports and 23.66 billion baht (63.9 million
dollars) imports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is Thailand's largest border trading partner,
following by Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.

PANAMA CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Trade and Industry
Minister Raul Hernandez met a visiting Japanese trade delegation
Friday to explore investment possibilities in the Panama Canal
Zone.
</P>
<P>
The Japan External Trade Organization (JETO) mission also
visited infrastructures left by the United States in the former

</P>
<P>
Saburo Yuzawa, head of the Japanese trade delegation, said the
JETO mission would explore the possibility of exporting Panamanian
products to Japan and promoting Japanese investments in Panama's
small and medium industries.
</P>
<P>
Yuzawa said his government sent the mission on the suggestion
of Japanese Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka
Machimura, who visited Panama in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
"On that occasion, the Japanese minister said he would send
this high-level trade mission to encourage bilateral cooperation
in the environmental and cultural fields," said Yuzawa.
</P>
<P>
JETO, founded in 1958, aims at promoting Japanese trade at an
international level, stimulating investments abroad, and giving
incentives to technological exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Stresses Importance of Primary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said Friday that through well organized policies,
Brazil is advancing in primary education by registering 96 percent
of school-age children.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso made this statement during the celebration of the first
anniversary of the creation of the Fund for the Maintenance and
Development of Fundamental Education and Evaluation of Teachers (
FUNDEF).
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that FUNDEF is proof that well oganized policies
which allow a redistribution of income in favor of poor states,
particularly those in the northeast, can encourage education for
the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1999 may be a difficult year for Brazil, but that
will not affect the 10-year FUNDEF program, since it is an
essential way to care for people's needs.
</P>
<P>
FUNDEF is a fund that allows 15 percent of the taxes from
states and municipalities to be redistributed proportionately
according to the number of children registered in public schools.
</P>
<P>
60 percent of these resources went to the payment of teachers'
salaries and 40 percent for school infrastructure, didactic
materials and school transportation.
</P>
<P>
The state or municipality has guaranteed 315 reales (175
dollars) for each school child, and the federal government covers
the rest.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Renato said that FUNDEF redistributed 1.5
percent of the country's gross domestic product to the primary
school system.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to FUNDEF, the number of children registered in the
fundamental education public schools was 32.4 million last year, a
6.2-percent increase over the 3.5 million registered in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Poet Jaime Sabines Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Famous Mexican poet Jaime
Sabines died of cancer Friday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo described in his message of
condolence the death of the poet as "an irretrievable loss" for
the literary community of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Sabines has been "one of the greatest poets of Mexico and
a man of extraordinary moral, intellectual and human qualities,"
added the Mexican president.
</P>
<P>
Sabines' writings were sparse, stark and silky, vivid in
imagery, pithy in message and prude. He mostly wrote about love
and death. His other writings included a small ode to Johann
Sebastian Bach.
</P>
<P>
The late Nobel laureate Octavio Paz, one not given to idle
praise, called him "one of the best poets in our language."
</P>
<P>
"You Have What I Look For," "I Don't Know If For Certain," "The
Poet and Death" and "Of Death," were his best poems.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Policy on "Correct Course," Clinton Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday re-affirmed his commitment to the policy of engagement with
China despite a recent spate of anti-China reports made by U.S.
media and Republican Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the course I have followed with China is the one
that's best for America -- disagreeing where we have serious
disagreements, and pursuing our common interests where I thought
it was in the interests of the United States," Clinton told a
press conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remark at a time when some organizations and
Republican Congressmen here are faulting China for "pilfering
nuclear secrets," which reportedly helped them miniaturize nuclear
warheads, from the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that the investigation has not yet
determined for sure that espionage occurred," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
China has dismissed the lab-theft allegation as unfounded and
irresponsible, showing nothing but the cold-war mentality of some
who want to deviate from President Clinton's engagement policy and
undermine the Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship is not perfect, but I think it is the correct
course," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He described the U.S.-China relationship as "profoundly
important, very large and inherently frustrating," "because it has
many different elements, some of which we like, some of which we
don't."
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited successful cooperation between the two countries
in non-proliferation, maintaining peace in the Korean Peninsula
and standing firm during the Asian financial crisis as proof for
the need to work together with China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he looks forward to the upcoming visit of
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in April, during which the two sides
will define what kind of future they are going to have, how they
are going to share it, and "What is the proper arena for
competition, and what is the proper arena for cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Chile Granted 79-Billion-Dollar Loan By IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
said Friday that Chile has been granted a 79 billion U.S. dollar
loan by the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
Frie, just back from his trip to France and the Czech Republic,
said Chile received the loan during the 40th annual meeting of the
Interamerican Development Bank in Paris on March 12.
</P>
<P>
He said 55 billion dollars of the loan would be used to carry
out the country's social development plan, assist poor areas,
reform the educational system and develop science and technology.
Another 24 billion would be used to develop small- and medium-
sized enterprises, and to readjust the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to France and the Czech Republic, Frei urged
European nations not to lose confidence in the Chilean economy and
to increase their investment in the country, since Chile was still
the fastest growing country in Latin America with an economic
growth of 3 percent and an inflation rate of only 4.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Europe invested 196.9 billion U.S. dollars
in Chile last year, dropping 11 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Frei said the next annual meeting of the IDB is scheduled for
Chile in the year 2001. About 6,000 bankers worldwide are expected
to attend.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Europe, Frei reiterated his belief that the
trial of former dictator Augusto Pinochet be held in Chile. He
added that Chile would continue to safeguard its state sovereignty
and oppose extraterritoriality.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Focus on Economic Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration should
focus on economic fundamentals at home on which U.S. growth
depends, President Bill Clinton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The most ambitious set of legislative proposals yet in my
tenure, probably even more ambitious than the economic reforms of'
93 or the balanced budget of '97," Clinton told a White House news
conference, is "to save Social Security and Medicare for the 21st
century, to pay our debt down, and to secure our economy for the
long run."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he was concerned that the U.S. economy has
become too dependent on an overvalued stock market with the Dow
Jones crossing the 10,000 mark, while the U.S. personal savings
rate has dropped below zero, he said the savings rate "is very
important for the long-term economic health of America."
</P>
<P>
"At a time when we have such a low personal savings rate, it is
very important that we get the government debt down," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he carefully made the Social Security and Medicare
proposal so that the government could fund them and pay down the
debt. In doing so, he said, "We assure the long-term stability of
our economy."
</P>
<P>
"The markets will determine what happens to the market. What I
think I have to do is give the American people good, sound
fundamentals, pay this debt down, and try to get the financial
architecture of the 21st century straightened out," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Agent Denies Petit Quit Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- French player Emmanuel Petit's
agent dismissed report Friday that Petit threatened to quit
English football.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal midfielder had announced he was fed-up with English
referees after receiving his fourth red card in 17 months against
Everton last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Petit's agent, Jerome Anderson, has cast doubt over the
move, saying: "Many great players do have a situation when they
blow hot and cold - like Eric Cantona, Gorge Best or Johan Cruyff.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Petit has had problems with certain aspects
of the English game, but he has also had some fantastic times.
</P>
<P>
"It has crossed his mind to look to pastures new ... But at
this moment in time it is absolute nonsense to say he is going to
quit this and quit that. It is just not true," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in The Mirror newspaper, Petit had earlier said: "I'm
totally fed up with what has been happening. I've just had enough
and I won't change my mind.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to be shown the yellow card every time I open my
mouth or make a mistake on the pitch - while others are getting
away with much more - I'm wasting my time here.
</P>
<P>
"These people are supposed to be out there on the pitch to
protect skillful players from bad tackles, not to punish those
players every time they put a foot wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Arsenal team have been trying to talk me around at
training this week and I appreciate their concern," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I've also had lots of letters from supporters - even some from
Tottenham fans - begging me to stay. But I'm finding it difficult
to go out and do my job," he added.

Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Inspector General of Police and the Commissioner of

quoted a statement issued by the police headquarters on Friday as
saying.
</P>

All such material put up in the five provinces going the polls
on April 6 will removed Saturday by laborers provided by the
government agents and local authorities under the supervision of
the police, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that any person who display election related
any banners, cutouts and posters would be violated election laws
from Saturday.

Monitoring Committee presided by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
at a meeting last Wednesday. Representatives of all political
parties contesting provincial Council Elections had participated
at this meeting.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Requests to Reduce Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Former heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson has requested that his one-year sentence on
assault charges to reduce to eight months, and a hearing is set
for March 26 at the Montgomery County District Court in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"He could literally be a free man shortly thereafter," said
Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's two lawyers in the Maryland case.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, jailed since February 5 on charges he beat two motorists
after a minor traffic accident last August, would not have been
eligible for early release until July.
</P>
<P>
But if Judge Stephen Johnson approves the motion, he could be
eligible that afternoon, said Eric Seleznow, a spokesman for the
county's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Tyson threw a TV set. Seleznow said the 32-year-
old boxer has not had any substantial problems since.
</P>
<P>
Seleznow would not estimate when Tyson might be freed from the
jail.
</P>
<P>
"He could potentially go in three days or he could go months
later," Seleznow said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson probably would be placed directly on electronic
monitoring at his home with his wife, Monica.
</P>
<P>
Tyson likely would be permitted to train during the day. His
sentence would include the 60-day sentence Indiana has imposed for
violating his probation on a 1992 rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
Tyson would then have to complete two years of supervised
probation.

<HEADLINE> Poverty-Stricken Ningxia Farmers' Income Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The average per capita income of
farmers in eight poverty-stricken counties in southern mountainous
area in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region reached 1,053 yuan in
1998, up 157 yuan from the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
The country has listed those eight mountainous counties among
the key poverty-relief areas. Some 1.5 million people escaped
poverty over the past few years thanks to the efforts of both the
Central and local governments and people of Hui and Han ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated poverty-relief funds to
the poorest areas in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight counties have solved problems related to
ensuring adequate food and clothing for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The rise of farmers' income was attributed to the increase of
labor service, good harvest of crops and flourishing service trade.
Increased grain production in 1998 alone raised the net per capita
income of farmers by 59 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, China Vow to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Swedish King Carl Gustaf XVI
said Friday that his country will further its cooperation with
China in the fields of economy and trade, science, technology and
culture.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who arrived here Thursday for a visit at
the invitation of his Swedish counterpart Anna Lindh.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the first Western country to establish diplomatic
ties with China, Tang said, and the two countries have developed
their ties in the past, particularly in economy and trade. He
cited the large share in the Chinese telecom market gained by
Sweden's Ericsson group and automaker Volvo.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the two countries make concerted efforts to push
bilateral ties to a higher level, since Sweden has also become an
important partner of China in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tang also held talks with Swedish Deputy
Prime Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, Minister of Industry an Commerce
Leif Pagrotsky and Anna Lindh on bilateral ties, as well as
international and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Tang is expected to leave for Norway on March 21 after his
visit to Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Claims not Responsible for Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The doctor who administered to
Bulgaria's world indoor athletics champion Rostislav Dimitrov
drugs which contained substances banned by the International
Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), said here on Friday he should
not be held responsible for the case.
</P>
<P>
Angel Lozanov said he only assumes the moral responsibility for
the administration of the medicine Gincor Forte which contains
IAAF- banned heptaminol, but not in Dimitrov's case because he
didn't know it is a banned drug.
</P>
<P>
Lozanov's claims followed the statement issued by the Bulgarian
Athletics Federation (BAF) earlier on Friday. The statement said:
"No one is allowed to give athletes medicines containing banned
substances. We believe that Dr. Angel Lozanov should not have
administered that medicine."
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov's triple jump gold medal from the World Indoors
Championships in Maebashi, Japan, in February will be shortly
taken away, BAF said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hristo Markov, coach of another Bulgarian athlete
Tereza Marinova, Lozanov recommended the medicine to him and said
it was some herb which helped better acclimatization and increased
oxygen in the muscles.
</P>
<P>
"He did not warn me it contained banned stimulants. That is
why I gave it to Tereza and Rostislav. We have known each other
for quite a long time. We are working together with Rostislav's
coach Marin Donchev. I did it for good, to help him in winning
the world title," Markov said.
</P>
<P>
But Lozanov referred to a list of 28 substances banned by the
IAAF, which did not include heptaminol, the substance found in
Dimitrov's urine sample.
</P>
<P>
The latest extended list of substances banned by the
International Olympic Committee and adopted by the International
Athletics Federation only about a month ago, dates back to January
31, 1999. And at that time nobody in Bulgaria knew what were the
new substances in this list, which include heptaminol, Lozanov
said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Regrets OSCE's Participation in International Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic Friday expressed regret that the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was joining the
international effort to pressure Belgrade into signing the Paris
peace agreement by ordering its 1,400 observers to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to a foreign ministry statement, Jovanovic voiced his
dismay in a telephone conversation with OSCE Chairman Knut
Vollebaek, who is also Norway's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic reiterated that the Kosovo crisis could not be solved
by pressure and blackmail. He said it could only be solved by
political means through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He also said OSCE's unilateral decision to evacuate its
diplomats ran counter to the agreement it signed last year with
Yugoslavia on sending observers. The Yugoslav side has always been
committed to the agreement by protecting the safety of these
observers, he added.
</P>
<P>
OSCE's 1,400 observers from 38 countries are scheduled to leave
Kosovo by late Saturday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- For the second time this
season, Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider has been
suspended one game and fined by the National Basketball
Association (NBA).
</P>
<P>
NBA senior vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn
announced that Rider will sit out one game without pay for kneeing

Thursday. Rider was also fined 7,500 U.S. dollars.

"We got in an altercation and I put my hands on him, but he
walked up and got in my face, and that's what the referees failed
to see," Rider said after the game.
</P>
<P>
Rider will sit out tonight's home game against the San Antonio
Spurs. He is averaging a team-high 16.5 points per game.
</P>
<P>
A talented player with a history of trouble, Rider was benched
Thursday for missing a shootaround earlier in the day. He was

<HEADLINE> Brazil Congress Approves Budget Adjustment Advised by IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso Friday welcomed the approval by the
Congress of the budget adjustment program, saying "it was an
important victory for his country."
</P>
<P>
The financial transactions tax, known as CPMF, was approved by
the Congress on Thursday and is scheduled to take effect on June
17. Thursday's vote extended the tax for an additional three years
and raises it to 0.38 percent from 0.20 percent for the first 12
months. After this period, the tax will settle at 0.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the tax on financial transactions was the only
measure of the budget adjustment program that the Brazilian
government negotiated last November with the International
Monetary Fund IMF) that had not been approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The government is now able to implement the budget adjustment
it agreed to in exchange for the 41.5 billion U.S. dollars in
international assistance offered by the IMF, since all the
measures of the program have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The measure that created the transaction tax was not only the
last in the adjustment program, but also the most important,
because it means the government could gain an additional income of
4.086 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We completed a very important cycle. Now we have to stimulate
economic growth and create jobs," said Communications Minister
Pimenta da Veiga, the main promoter of the relations between
Cardoso and the parliament.

But Edwards is already looking beyond contract extensions. "We

"You are not, quite naturally, going to give someone of 57 an

down to results at the end of the day, I don't honestly care
whether Alex is 60, 65 or even 70," added the chairman.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 64 in Indonesian Ethnic Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Tensions in Sambas regency in
Indonesia's West Kalimantan province heightened Friday as the
death toll climbed to 64 in the third day of bloody ethnic
fighting, according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise as the authorities continue
searching for more victims.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 1,030 houses were burned in Sambas since
clashes broke out on Tuesday between the indigenous Malays and
migrants from the island of Madura.
</P>
<P>
Districts involved in the clashes are Tebas, Pemangkat,
Samalantan and Sanggau Ledo. In 1997, Sanggau Ledo was rocked by
clashes between the Dayaks and Madurese that killed at least 300
people.
</P>
<P>
West Kalimantan Police chief Col. Chaerul Rasyidi Friday called
on migrants from the island of Madura to exercise self-restraint
in order to prevent the outbreak of more violence.
</P>
<P>
"Once they (Madurese) make a move, other ethnic groups will
also take action," he said, adding that the slightest move by the
Madurese will also make it difficult for security forces to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
The precautions taken by the military included street
blockades, a search for weaponry and persuasion by community
leaders, Chaerul was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
While the situation has been "under control", Chaerul also said
that the military has witnessed concentrations of people from the
fighting groups in several areas.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency said that sporadic ethnic fighting actually
began in the region nearly a month ago, killing about 15 people
before the rioting exploded this week.
</P>
<P>
According to Malay chief Ismet Muhammad Noor, the violence is
rooted in long-standing rivalry between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Malays make up 40 percent of the population of West
Kalimantan province. The Madurese make up around 2 percent and
most have arrived under a government transmigration scheme to
resettle people from the more crowded islands.
</P>
<P>
The Malays were backed up by Dayaks, the region's other main
indigenous group, Noor said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Willing to Cut Oil Output in Line With OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has expressed its
willingness to cut oil production in line with the decision of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"If OPEC decides to cut production, we will join that decision.
I think there is no problem," local leading newspapers Saturday
quoted Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But if we cut production, how much will oil prices be? Cutting
production will affect our income. We do not expect our budgeted
income to be any less," Mangkusubroto said Friday when commenting
the OPEC ministerial meeting to be held in Vienna, next week.
</P>
<P>
Under last week's agreement among oil producers in The Hague,
Indonesia would cut production by 93,000 barrels per day. In its
budget for the fiscal year starting next month, Indonesia targeted
an oil price of 10.5 U.S. dollars per barrel, compared with 13
U.S. dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the only member of the OPEC in Southeast Asia, is
already facing formidable problems during its economic recession
in meeting state revenue target.

<HEADLINE> IOC to Investigate Bribery Allegations on Coles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has began to investigate
bribery allegations against Australian IOC member Phillip Coles.
</P>
<P>
The ex-wife of Coles sent a note to the IOC on Friday
confirming allegations that she had received gold and diamond
jewelry from a man involved in the bid by Athens for the 1996
Games.
</P>
<P>
As the IOC announced the dissolution of the ad hoc commission
set up to investigate the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the IOC
Executive Board will take over these responsibilities until the
formation of the IOC Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the Executive Board today invited Mr. Phillip
Coles to address the board as a result of receiving a
communication from his former wife," said the IOC in a press
release received here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the fact that a communication has been received
from a third party, the Executive Board decided to investigate the
matter further," it said.
</P>
<P>
Coles, who was given a "most serious warning" for accepting
excessive hospitality from the Salt Lake City, was accompanied by
Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Coles said, "I appreciated the opportunity to
explain the situation to the Executive Board."

<HEADLINE> Online Readers Back Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Alex Feguson's Manchester United
could break their Champions' League duck and bring the trophy home,
according to News Online readers.
</P>
<P>
In a Online poll, 55 percent of users believe the Old Trafford
club can go all the way to secure their first European trophy
since winning the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, the BBC reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the result shows, however, opinion is divided as to exactly
how successful United will be.
</P>
<P>
Robert Marshall from the United States highlights a recurring
theme - that Manchester United are now so big that the media
spotlight is rarely on anyone else.
</P>
<P>
"It would be impossible to bear the media hype if they got as
far as the final," he says, while Robbie Pender from England is a
little more blunt: "Man Utd are the worst team in the last four
and will be outclassed by who ever they play," he writes.
</P>
<P>
If many of your responses are to be believed then United's draw
against Juventus could put paid to their dreams of European glory.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom's Manfredi Bargioni says: "They will
probably put up a good fight against Juventus in the first leg and
then collapse" - comments echoed by Jon Harford of England who
writes: "One can't help but feel that in the big match situation
Juventus will scrape through."
</P>
<P>
On the positive side the support for United is typically global.
</P>
<P>
Graham Deere from the United States feels their recent
performances are evidence of their superior strength: "We saw them
in the States yesterday on ESPN, they sure look like winners."
</P>
<P>
Phil Davies from Finland is similarly optimistic: "After the
two games against Inter, it is hard to see a team left in the
competition that could beat them."
</P>
<P>
United's recent form has attracted fans from even further
afield, however.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Parvinder Walia writes: "Good Luck. Man Utd is the
best of the best," while Mohannad Kafri from Palestine says, "even
though I am a Liverpool and Juventus fan, I have to admit that
Manchester United is a superb team this year."

BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and German embassies in
Belgrade were open as usual on Friday, but families of diplomatic
staff in the two embassies had already been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Consular sections in the two embassies also suspended their
visa office activities, reports said.

The evacuations began after France and Britain announced they
were adjourning the Paris peace talks and would not resume them
until the Serb-led Yugoslav delegation accepted a peace plan for
Kosovo, which the ethnic Albanians have already signed.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and Austria said they would evacuate "non-

</P>
<P>
One exception was Russia, saying they believed NATO would not
launch air strikes against the federal republic and thus they
would not evacuate their embassy in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes Russia Reaches Agreement With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he hoped Russia and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) would agree to terms for lending to resume.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping we can reach an agreement which will permit the IMF
program to go forward, because I think that is important," Clinton
said at a press conference held at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement days before Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov arrives in Washington for a round of
top-level talks.
</P>
<P>
But the president also cautioned that new lending to Russia
would only achieve its goal if it was tied to legislative changes
and if a way could found to stop money flooding out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"It will only work if the money does not turn around and leave
the country as soon as it is put in," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There have got to be some changes, some of which require
legislative action in the Duma, in order for this to work.
Otherwise, even if we put the money in, it will leave," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted lending to Russia last August after Moscow
devalued the rouble and defaulted on some debts, reneging on the
terms of an international rescue deal agreed in July.
</P>
<P>
Russia had spent the first installment totaling 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars from that emergency package in a matter of weeks in a
futile attempt to defend the rouble.
</P>
<P>
Russia has to repay more than 17 billion dollars in foreign
debts this year. It hopes new lending from the IMF will open the
door to debt rescheduling deals giving it more time to pay this
crushing burden.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important if we are going to help Russia -- and
we should, we should do everything we can -- that we do things
that are actually likely to make a difference instead of things
that will undermine confidence in the long run in Russia and in
the ability of others to invest there," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Libya Ready to Turn Over Lockerbie Suspects, U.N. Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Libya has sent the United
Nations a long-awaited letter Friday afternoon, saying that it is
ready to proceed with the handover of the two Libyan suspects
accused of blowing up an American airliner in December 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by the U.N. spokesman, said, "This
afternoon the Permanent Representative of the Libyan Aran
Jamahiriya, Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda, hand delivered to the
Secretary-General a letter from Omar Mustafa Muntasser, secretary
of the General People's Committee of the People's Bureau for
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation of the Socialist
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya."
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Dorda told reporters his country had put in writing an
announcement delivered by President Nalson Mandela of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Libya has set a date for the handover
of the two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
"As already announced by President Nelson Mandela in Tripoli
this morning, the letter confirms the readiness of Libya to
proceed with the transfer of the two accused to the Netherlands,"
the statement said. "The Secretary-General is greatly encouraged
by this development and the necessary arrangements will now be
initiated by the (U.N.) Secretariat."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has shared the letter with the
Security Council," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General would like to record his warm
appreciation of the efforts made by President Mandela, as well as
Crown Prince Abdullah and others in order to bring this matter to
a satisfactory conclusion, in cooperation with the authorities of
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed that the letter had been
delivered to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Arabic,
accompanied with an English translation. But he did not say when
it would be made public.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued through his spokesman, voiced a
welcome to an announcement by Mandela on Friday in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General welcomes the announcement made in
Tripoli today by President Mandela that an agreement had been
reached, providing for the surrender of the two Lockerbie
suspects in the near future," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is currently on a visit to Libya for a meeting
with the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the issue of Lockerbie,
said in Tripoli. "The leader has entrusted to me the choice of the
precise date. The Jamahiriya (Libya) agrees to ensure that the two
suspects would be available to the U.N. Secretary-General to take
custody of on, or before, the 6th of April for their appearance
before the court."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have accused that two Libyans,
Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, of
planting a bomb that blew up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, together with the Saudi Arabian Government, has been
at the center of the efforts to persuade Libya, Britain and the
United States to accept a compromise under which the two would be
tried before a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: England Team Like a Kid in a Toy Shop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua)-- England soccer manager Kevin Keegan
said managing the England team was somewhat like a child who was
let loose in a toy cupboard and told "pick what you like."
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, Keegan, talking ahead of
his get-together with the England squad, said: "The great thing
about being England manager, for me it's like letting me into a
toy cupboard, like saying 'see all those toys, you can have any
one you want.'
</P>
<P>
"You take some off the top shelf and then you see something
better down there and as for picking the squad, it was the players
I left out that was the most difficult part for me."
</P>
<P>
Keegan, in buoyant and confident mood as he prepares for the
crucial Euro 2000 qualifier against Poland at Wembley next
Saturday,says he desperately wants the nation to get behind the
team.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I'd like to try and get England like a club. By that
I mean the fans one million per cent behind the team, no doubt
that the team is giving their all and more, and we go into the
games as one."
</P>
<P>
The Fulham manager, who is in temporary charge for just four
games, told Sky Sports Centre that the people whose advice he
would seek during his time at the helm are all dead.
</P>
<P>
And top of the list would have been Anfield legend Bill Shankly,
who plucked Keegan from obscurity at Scunthorpe and launched him
towards international glory.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "Bill Shankly, of all the people I've worked with,
spent time on the coaching and managing side.
</P>
<P>
"He was the one who had the greatest influence because he
taught me what it was like to have someone believe in you.
</P>
<P>
"He said to me 'son, one day you'll play for England' and my
first thought was I can't let him down. He wouldn't say that if he
didn't believe it, he honestly believes I can play for England,"
Keegan said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Looking For New Law On Bribery: Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- It is wrong to see corruption as a
problem only for developing countries and "we have nothing to be
smug about here in the UK," said Clare Short, secretary of state
for international development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference entitled "Corruption as a Threat to
World Trade and Investment" Friday, Short said, "In the past,
people have assumed that corruption was embedded in the culture of
many countries, especially poor countries."
</P>
<P>
"We need to be honest about the UK's record also. Even with all
our history and systems of control, corruption breaks out around
central and local government with notable frequency," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Short said, there is no question that the world's poor
suffer disproportionately from the effects of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at the case for a new UK law on bribery which
will be more effective against bribery at home and abroad," she
added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Committed to Helping Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here Friday that Nigeria
counld get financial assistance as early as July if it is fully
committed to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here before concluding his
three-day visit to Nigeria, the IMF chief pledged that the IMF would
work with the in-coming civilian government to fashion a program of
economic reforms which would help restore the economic health of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria signed a staff-monitored economic program with the IMF in
January which was aimed at bringing to an end years of sour relations
between Nigeria and IMF, and preparing the ground for a more substantial
deal with the in-coming civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted that the performance of the program would determine
if negotiations for a medium term fund arrangement would be initiated
with the IMF by the middle of the year to pave the way for discussions
with the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he lamented the divertion of most of the
past loans granted the country, saying that "a lot of the money borrowed
has flowed directly or indirectly into foreign accounts of Nigerians
while others were spent on military or unproductive in resolving the
country's economic problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with you because we beleive that what the
IMF is doing for us is what we should do for ourselves," said Olusegun
Obasanjo, the president-elect who suspended his world-wide tour for
the meeting with Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo noted that the size of the country's foreign debt which was
estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars was a threat to the nascent
democratization.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Camdessus praised the president-elect for his commitment to
economic reform but said that assistance in debt relief would depend
on the faithful implementation of the staff-monitored program and the
attainment of the performance targets.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief who is on the last day of his visit to the west African
country said the in-coming administration would face "formidable"
challenges with the economy being "as bad as it could possibly be."

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief:  Airstike on Yugoslavia Could be Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, Secretary-General
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned on Friday that
air strikes on Yugoslav Serbia could be imminent unless its
leaders backed down over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are very close. The behavior of the Serbs' party in the
conference in Paris has been really appalling," Solana told BBC
television.
</P>
<P>
"The military clock is ticking. It can be stopped of course if
a change in behavior of the Serbian side is produced in a very
short period of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the objection from Russia to using military
forces in Kosovo, Solana said NATO would use forces as there was
no other choice.
</P>
<P>
"(The Russians) are in favor of a diplomatic solution as I
am....But they have to understand that if the only possibility
which is left is to use force, then we will have to use it," said
Solana.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo peace talks between Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian
delegations broke down in Paris on Friday. France and Britain,
co-chairmen of the talks, said it was pointless to continue and
negotiations could only resume if Belgrade backed an autonomy plan
for the rebellious province.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are adjourned. The talks will not resume
unless the Serbs express their acceptance of the accords," a
statement issued jointly earlier Friday by British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook and his French counterpar Hubert Vedrine
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has repeatedly warned that it would bomb Serbian military
sites in Kosovo if Yugoslavia refuse to sign on the peace plan
initiated by the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the only non-NATO member of the Contact Group which
also includes the United States, France, Britain, Germany and
Italy, said it strongly opposes to NATO's attempt to raid
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Expects Strike for Kosovo Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)'s European military commander said Friday
that the 19-nation alliance is ready to take military action for a
political solution in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme commander in Europe, said that
the airstrike was up to the alliance's political authorities. He
gave no specific timetable on such attack.
</P>
<P>
At NATO military headquarters south of Brussels, Clark told
reporters that the alliance is increasingly concerned about the
current situation in Kosovo. "What we are watching here is a
growing humanitarian tragedy on the ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from NATO members also met here in the
Brussels-based NATO headquarters to discuss the Kosovo crisis. A
NATO official said the situation was very serious and the military
bloc could be taking a step in its policy toward Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general said the Yugoslav army and police units in
Kosovo are "far disproportionate to any reasonable requirement."
The Yugoslav are also beginning to move air defense equipment in
preparation for possible NATO aircraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to any risk if military action is taken, Clark said
one can not contemplate any military action without risks. Though
Serbia has very capable air defense, the alliance also has very
good forces, and "we will be ready to do what we directed to do,"
he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China respects and
supports Cambodia's position on trying the Khmer Rouge leaders, Qin
Huasun, Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations
stressed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Ambassador Qin said "China has noted that at
the meeting with the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March
12, 1999, Cambodia's Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong expressed his
country's unequivocal opposition to the establishment of a
international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge leaders."
</P>
<P>
"China respects and supports this official position of the
Cambodian government. China strongly opposes any act by the
international community to impose an international tribunal on
Cambodia and is not in the favor of the proposed establishment of
such an international tribunal by the United Nations Security
Council and the UN General Assembly," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Cambodia is entirely internal affairs of
Cambodia and should be dealt by the Cambodian Government and its
people without external interference," he added.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. special panel proposed that the Khmer Rouge
leaders be tried in an international tribunal. U.N. Chief has
recommended the Security Council to consider the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Justifies Possible Air Strikes on Serb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday laid out for the American people the justification for
U.S.-led air strikes that he said will follow if Serb leaders
ignore Western efforts to avoid bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"If we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be
more massacres," Clinton said, acknowledging that U.S. pilots
would be put at risk.
</P>
<P>
In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly a year,
Clinton said, "I do not want to put a single American pilot in the
air. I do not want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not
want a conflict... but a part of my responsibility is to try to
leave to my successors an environment in Europe that is stable,
humane and secure."
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. efforts in Bosnia proved that force can create
peace, and he warned that allowing Kosovo to be overrun could
cause conflicts to break out throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. and other NATO pilots will be put in harm's way," Clinton
conceded.

<HEADLINE> IMF Committed to Helping Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of International Monetary Fund

(IMF) Michel Camdessus said here Friday that Nigeria counld get financial
assistance as early as July if it is fully committed to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here before concluding his three-day
visit to Nigeria, the IMF chief pledged that the IMF would work with the
in-coming civilian government to fashion a program of economic reforms which
would help restore the economic health of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria signed a staff-monitored economic program with the IMF in January
which was aimed at bringing to an end years of sour relations between Nigeria
and IMF, and preparing the ground for a more substantial deal with the
in-coming civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted that the performance of the program would determine if
negotiations for a medium term fund arrangement would be initiated with the
IMF by the middle of the year to pave the way for discussions with the
Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he lamented the divertion of most of the past loans
granted the country, saying that "a lot of the money borrowed has flowed
directly or indirectly into foreign accounts of Nigerians while others were
spent on military or unproductive in resolving the country's economic problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with you because we beleive that what the IMF is doing
for us is what we should do for ourselves," said Olusegun Obasanjo, the
president-elect who suspended his world-wide tour for the meeting with Camdessus
.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo noted that the size of the country's foreign debt which was
estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars was a threat to the nascent
democratization.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Camdessus praised the president-elect for his commitment to
economic reform but said that assistance in debt relief would depend on the
faithful implementation of the staff-monitored program and the attainment of
the performance targets.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief who is on the last day of his visit to the west African
country said the in-coming administration would face "formidable" challenges
with the economy being "as bad as it could possibly be."

<HEADLINE> African Education Ministers Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The two-day conference of the
African education ministers ended here Friday after adopting the
Program of Action of the Decade.
</P>
<P>
The program of Action (1997-2006) urged African governments to
ensure that the proportion of the gross domestic product devoted to
education is substantially increased.
</P>
<P>
It also requires that about 20 percent of the government budget
be devoted to eductation, and basic education be provided either free
of charge or subsidized.
</P>
<P>
The program stressed that education in Africa should be based on
the fundamental principle that the current ways and means to achieve
basic education for all be changed.
</P>
<P>
It noted four areas of the Program of Action are equity and access to
education; quality, relevance and effectiveness of education;
complementary learning modalities; and capacity building.
</P>
<P>
The conference decided to establish a permanent steering
committee in charge of the Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
The committee shall be the main mechanism for the programming,
implementation, monitoring, evaluation and follow-up of the Decade
of Education.

<HEADLINE> Congress Told to Prepare for Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has laid out his case to congressional leaders for a massive
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia with the collapse of the
Kosovo peace talks, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We're on the brink of a very grave situation," Hastert said
after a two-hour meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to send planes in there," Sen. Robert Byrd, a
Democrat, said as the Senate debated the crisis. "Some of those
planes may be shot down. Americans may be held hostage.
Americans may be killed."
</P>
<P>
The Senate may vote next week on legislation aimed at
blocking funds for sending U.S. troops into Kosovo. But Senate
Majority leader Trent Lott said the debate has been altered
since it now seems that a bombing campaign is in the works.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that an agreed settlement is not going to be
achieved and the Serbian officials will not agree to have a NATO
force come in a peaceful arrangement," Lott said. "This is a very
serious step. We made the point that the president needs to
address this issue with the American people."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, meanwhile, ordered three
more EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes and four KC-135
refueling aircraft to Europe to join the approximately 200 other
American warplanes standing by for possible use.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft include B-52 bombers and F-117 stealth
fighter-bombers. There are also several U.S. Navy warships in the
area, including six ships and submarines that would be expected
to launch cruise missiles in the earliest stages of a NATO air
attack.
</P>
<P>
The State Department started pulling dependents and
nonessential employees out of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade as
other governments were also evacuating their staffers from the
Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon," Sen. Joe Biden
told reporters after Clinton's meeting with 31 House and Senate
members. Biden said the air campaign would be "robust and
serious."
</P>
<P>
Several other lawmakers said they thought that the bombing
was probably at least a week away, and that last-minute
diplomatic pressure was still being applied by other nations on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Republican lawmakers who met with Clinton were generally more
muted in their criticism of the administration on Friday than
they were the day before.
</P>
<P>
The Senate debated Kosovo policy off and on throughout
Friday, although no votes were expected until Tuesday at the
earliest.

<HEADLINE> Annan Meets With Libyan Envoy on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to meet with Libyan Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Abuzed Omar Dorda at 4:30 EST
Friday after the breakthrough achieved in the trial of Lockerbie
suspects with the help of South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Dorda "appears to hand over a letter in Arabic, together with
an English translation version," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
announced.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. officials at the moment cannot confirm the letter
contains the new Libyan policy on the surrender of the two Libyan
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Annan extended a welcome to an announcement by
South African President Nelson Mandela in Libya that an agreement
has been reached providing for the surrender of the two Lockerbie
suspects in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is looking forward to receiving the relevant details of
the agreement in the letter reported to have been addressed to him
by the Libyan side," said a statement issued by a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is currently on a visit to Libya for meeting with
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the issue of Lockerbie, said in
the capital Tripoli, "The leader has entrusted to me the choice of
the precise date. The Jamahiriya (Libya) agrees to ensure that the
two suspects would be available to the U.N. secretary-general to
take custody of on, or before, the 6th of April 1999 for their
appearance before the court."
</P>
<P>
"It is with great admiration for the Libyan people that I can
today announce to the world that Libya has decided to write to the
U.N. secretary-general to give a firm date for the handing over
for trial in the Netherlands of the two Libyan nationals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have accused the two Libyans,
Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, of
planting a bomb that blew up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, together with the government of Saudi Arabia, has been
in the heart of the efforts to persuade Libya, Britain and the
United States to accept a compromise under which the two would be
tried before a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has given what he said "all necessary explanations
and clarifications" to the Libyan side, has been waiting for the
positive response from Triopli.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Iraq's Revenue Shortfalls Affects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (xinhua) -- The drop in revenues from
the sale of Iraqi oil had led to the reductions of humanitarian
program in the country, a U.N. official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Sanctions Committee, Benon
Sevan, Executive Director of the United Nations Office of the Iraq
program, said the enhanced distribution plan for Phase IV which
ended on November 25, 1998, was budgeted at 3.1 billion U.S.
dollars, but the gross revenues from the sale of Iraqi oil were
just 3.0127 billion dollars, compared to the 5.265 authorized by
the United Nations Security Council last February.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said even with successive downward revisions, there was
around 500 million dollars worth of approved contracts for which
no founding would be available in this period and they had to be
transferred to Phase V which runs from November 26, 1998 to May 24
1999.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said the distribution plan for Phase V requires at least
some 2.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution last
February which permitted Iraq to sell 5.265 billion dollars worth
of oil in every six months to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of Security Council resolutions 986, Iraqi oil
revenues are used for the humanitarian program(66%), the
Compensation Fund(30%), the United Nations costs in administering
the program(2.2%), the administration of the United Nations
Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction(0.8%) and the escrow account (1%).

<HEADLINE> Russia: OSCE Pullout From Kosovo Only Temporary Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia regards the withdrawal of
OSCE monitors from Kosovo "as a temporary measure," the Interfax
news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Moscow is confident that
the OSCE monitors' "activity in Kosovo should continue once the
situation makes this possible."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also warned "against attempts to use the (OSCE)
chairman's decision for the further escalation of the threat of
force scenario."
</P>
<P>
"The entire history of the Balkans indicates that the use of
force there can trigger unpredictable consequences and carnage,"
the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
OSCE mission officers will start leaving Kosovo for neighboring
Macedonia on Saturday. The Russian members of the mission plan to
depart from Macedonia's capital Skopje to Moscow on a chartered
Aeroflot flight on Thursday, March 25, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The temporary removal of the mission "should serve as yet
another signal for the sides to display good will and flexibility
in searching for compromises, including those concerning the talks
in Paris," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged "the conflicting sides and the international community
to act with special patience and restraint in this complex
situation."

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors to Evacuate Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The
international verifiers for the Kosovo cease-fire are to start
evacuation early on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation was announced at a press conference Friday at
the headquarters of the Kosovo Verification Mission in Pristina,
capital city of the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made not long after the Paris peace talks
were pronounced to be ended without any positive progress
concerning the signing of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Convoys of the orange-colored verification vehicles are
expected to be seen early Saturday morning but the direction of
their movement was not yet known nor was the exact time for their
departure.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that the international verifiers, now
numbering some 1,400 from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), most likely will head for Macedonia,
where NATO has amassed a 1,800-strong extraction force to rush to
the rescue of the verifiers should things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Zoran Andjelkovic, president of the
temporary executive council of Kosovo, made a statement saying:
"Yugoslavia and Serbia will, regardless of any pressure and
blackmail from outside, keep to all agreements and treaties
achieved with the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The government does guarantee overall security to all the OSCE
Kosovo Verification Mission members, in accordance with the
agreement signed October 16, 1998."
</P>
<P>
The official also said that his country would do its utmost to
resolve the problem in Kosovo in a peaceful way through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the United States and German embassies
started evacuating non-essential staff to Hungary late on Friday.
It was the second evacuation in six months.
</P>
<P>
The embassies of the United States, Germany and Britain
evacuated their non-essential staff to Hungary last October when
NATO threatened to air strike the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
should it fail to agree to an international peace plan.
</P>
<P>
When the peace talks resumed in Paris on Monday, the United
States and NATO threatened again with air strikes to try to force
Yugoslavia to sign the deal that it did not agree.

The program included a performance by violinist who played
two of Menuhin's favourite pieces. There was also a performance of
songs composed to the words of Mr. Menuhin.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin performed at the inaugural concert for the signing of
the UN Charter in San Francisco, and then fifty years later
conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at its fifties
anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin used his music in pursuit of peace and, in his
twenties, embarked upon a lifetime of humanitarianism by giving
more than 500 concerts during World War II, many of them for
allied troops.
</P>
<P>
As a Jew, he proved his belief in reconciliation when he
appeared in concert shortly.
</P>
<P>
He was President of the International Council of Music at
UNESCO from 1969 to 1975 and UNESCO's goodwill ambassador from
1992.
</P>
<P>
Born in American of Russian immigrant parents, Menuhin was
awarded honorary citizenship in Switzerland and in England, where
he was knighted in 1965 by Queen Elizabeth and made a lord in
1993.
</P>
<P>
He also received India's Nehru Award for International
Understanding, France's Legion of honor and Belgium's Order of
Leopold.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin will be buried on Friday in London.

<HEADLINE> Museveni: Ugandan Govt Committed to Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Friday his government is committed to eradication of poverty
in the country through improving homestead incomes.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni made
the remarks when touring income-generation projects in the
southwestern district of Mbarara.
</P>
<P>
He said the government intends to see that each homestead in
the country can generate enough income to solve family needs,
urging local leaders to give farmers tips on how to undertake
viable projects.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to improve the road infrastructure
so that the people can transport what they produce to the market,
he added.
</P>
<P>
People near urban centers such as Mbarara were encouraged to
undertake peri-urban agriculture which can guarantee them good
financial returns because of proximity to the markets.
</P>
<P>
The president also cautioned the people about land
fragmentation which, he said, had aggravated poverty in some areas
by making small pieces of land uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the president had earlier inspected
heifer and tree planting projects in the area, assuring the people
there that the government will consider more funding for local
programs so that the local population can get some credit to start
off.
</P>
<P>
Mbarara district, home to President Museveni, is known for
large farms and milk production. It is one of the richest
districts of the country.

<HEADLINE> 46 Killed in Somali Clans Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 46 people are known to
have died and over 100 others were wounded in the fighting between
clans in the Somali capital Mogadishu over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, between the Muse Sudi Yalahow from the Daud clan
and Galmah clan, has taken place in the Karan District. Buildings
of the Galmah clan were seriously attacked and ransacked, sources
in Somali said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said six of Yalahow's fighters were killed during
the fighting on Friday morning, while the Galmah clan militiamen
have lost eight of their combat militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the battle zone have also confirmed seven
civilians were killed by stray bullets during the fighting from
house to house and street to street in the troubled district of
Karan in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses also said the militiamen of Galmah clan were
seen retreating back to the outskirts of Mogadishu after losing
three battle wagons to the better organized Muse Sudi's fighters.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of civilians have fled their houses in Karan
district. Some of the fleeing people said wild militiamen were
looting everything they could lay their eyes on.
</P>
<P>
Many of the displaced have fled to Arjantine, Yaqshid and
districts in South Mogadishu with nothing but their children as
time could not permit them to carry anything else.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, representatives from Yalahow and the Galmah clan met
at a compound in North Mogadishu. Both sides have accepted a
temporary cease-fire. There's relative calmness in the area now,
but the tension remains extremely high.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Arabs Over Disputed Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday night criticized the Arab states for
supporting the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over
disputed islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Asefi rejected the statement by foreign ministers of the
Arab League in Cairo on Thursday as an "intervention in Iran's
internal affairs," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign minister on Thursday restated support for
the UAE's sovereignty over the Abu Musa, the Greater and the
Leaser Tunbs at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait and
condemned Iran for staging war games in the waters off the
islands and building facilities on them.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League statement also accused Iran of "violating
UAE's sovereignty" over the Islands and urged Tehran to withdraw
its forces from them.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman reiterated that the three islands are
"inseparable parts of Iranian territory and Iran conducted
military exercises in the region with an aim to safeguard its
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is Iran's right to hold such military
exercises, which would help maintain stability and security of
the region.
</P>
<P>
Asefi underlined that the "misunderstanding" between Iran and
the UAE would be resolved only through bilateral talks and on
the basis of the agreement reached by the two countries in
1971.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands in 1971 after the
British forces withdrew from the region. However, both Tehran
and Abu Dhabi claimed sovereignty over them.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has proposed to refer the issue to international
arbitration, but Iran insists on holding direct negotiations to
solve the problem without interference of other parties.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has
canceled his scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia in a protest to
Riyadh's support for the UAE's sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that the UAE-Iran dispute would cast a
shadow over the relations between Iran and the Gulf states,
which have been warmed up only after President Khatami came to
power in 1997 with a policy of "detente" with regional
countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rules out Disputes over Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public Works
and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid ruled out on Friday eruption
of disputes among the Nile states over water sharing.
</P>
<P>
"The water future (in the Nile) is secure 100 percent and there
are no problems involving the Nile basin countries," Abu Zeid said
in an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Nile water, if well utilized, would meet the needs of all
the riparian states, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Nile flows through Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of reaching an agreement on the distribution
of the Nile water among the Nile countries, Abu Zeid said the work
to outline the agreement began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Each country's population, area, land and annual rainfall will
be fully taken into consideration when its quota of the Nile water
is decided, the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting Egypt's readiness to provide all forms of
assistance to the other Nile states, Abu Zeid said Egypt is
helping Kenya dig 100 wells for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
An anti-weeds agreement is in the pipeline between Egypt and
Uganda, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the completion of the Gongli Canal on the
Nile in southern Sudan would provide each of Egypt and Sudan with
an additional 2 billion cubic meters of water annually in the
first stage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's quota of the Nile water stands at 55.5 billion cubic
meters a year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Take Back Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is not prepared to
accept anybody who entered or left Lebanon illegally, Lebanese
Charge d'Affaires to Nicosia Halil El Hambre said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hambre made the remarks after discussion with Cypriot officials
on the 89 immigrants, who arrived in Cyprus illegally
Thursday. Cypriot police said the immigrants came from Tripoli,
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hambre refuted that he saw no Lebanese on board the Al Abjar boat that
brought them to Cyprus, adding that the vessel had no
identification marks except the Lebanese flag painted on it.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out "the Cypriot police were not there to
see. Some people said they left Tripoli, but most of the others do
not know where they were loaded (on the boat)."
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon will take back only those who have proof of
legal residence in Lebanon and had embarked from a Lebanese port.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants were detained on a cruiser at Larnaca port,
which is under police guard and access by press is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Hambre said he is trying to solve the problem "in consultation
with the (Cypriot) Foreign Ministry, which believes the boat came
from Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The immigrants, including 35 women and children, comprise 43
Iraqis, most of them Kurds, 21 Egyptians, six Syrians, five
Palestinians, nine Somalis and five from Siera Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Lebanese officials are expected to come
Cyprus to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
This is the third boatload of illegal immigrants from Lebanon
to have arrived in Cyprus over the past nine months, raising the
detained here to nearly 300.

<HEADLINE> IOC Executive Board to Investigate Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken over the
responsibilities of the ad hoc commission to investigate bribery
allegations against an IOC member of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The ex-wife of Phillip Coles sent a note to the IOC on Friday
confirming allegations that she had received gold and diamond
jewellery from a man involved in the bid by Athens for the 1996
Games.
</P>
<P>
As the IOC announced the dissolution of the ad hoc commission
set up to investigate the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the IOC
Executive Board will take over these responsibilities until the
formation of the IOC Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, the Executive Board today invited Mr Phillip
Coles to address the board as a result of receiving a
communication from his former wife," said the IOC in a press
release received here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the fact that a communication has been received
from a third party, the Executive Board decided to investigate the
matter further," it said.
</P>
<P>
Coles, who was given a "most serious warning" for accepting
excessive hospitality from the Salt Lake City, was accompanied by
Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Coles said, "I appreciated the opportunity to
explain the situation to the Executive Board. Until the matter is
resolved I will continue to stand down from my duties at SOCOG
(the Sydney Organizing Committee of Olympic Games)."

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Benefits Cystic Fibrosis Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Gene therapy can improve at least
one of the underlying abnormalities in cystic fibrosis which
causes chronic lung disease, British scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis, one of the commonest genetic diseases, is
caused by an abnormality in the gene CFTR which was found in 1989.
Since then scientists have tried to find a successful way of
replacing the defective gene with a healthy one.
</P>
<P>
Now a new study, led by researchers at the National Heart and
Lung Institute and Royal Brompton Hospital, London, showed that a
spray carrying normal version of CFTR gene helps tackle the
symptoms of cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
The scientists combined the CFTR gene with a lipid oil which
allowed it to be absorbed by cells, and administered the mixture
to patients in the form of an aerosol to the lungs and to the
nose.
</P>
<P>
The research also included eight other patients, who received
placebo aerosols without the gene mixture, so that the efficacy of
the active treatment can be assessed.
</P>
<P>
Their results, published in the medical journal The Lancet,
showed a 25 percent restoration of normal chloride transport in
the patients who received the CFTR gene treatment and no
improvement in the placebo-treated patients.
</P>
<P>
The genetic abnormality in cystic fibrosis patients usually
impairs chloride movement, which, together with the increased
sodium absorption that occurs in the disease, makes the patients
more susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
Though the gene therapy showed no effect on the sodium
absorption defect, the scientists believed it will continue to
"make steady progress towards becoming a realistic therapeutic
option for the disease."

<HEADLINE> Exercise Best Way of Weight Control in Teenagers: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The best means of tackling the
increase in obesity in young people is to encourage them exercise
rather than go on a diet, Australian researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is because dieting can greatly increase the risk of
developing eating disorders such as anorexia, said the scientists
from the University of Melbourne and the Royal Children's Hospital
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
After studying nearly 2,000 male and female students aged 14-15
over a period of three years, the researchers found that female
adolescents who undertook heavy dieting were 18 times more likely
to develop an eating disorder than whose who didn't diet.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that even those who diet moderately are
five times more at risk of suffering eating problems than the
average child.
</P>
<P>
Dieting was also associated with an increase in psychiatric
problems, it has found.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers said
that dieting is now the biggest risk factor for anorexia and
bulimia.
</P>
<P>
"In adolescents, controlling weight by exercise rather than
diet restriction seems to carry less risk of development of eating
disorders," they concluded.

BUCHAREST, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Five states of the South-East
European Cooperation reaffirmed here Friday their commitment to
the immediate peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis on the
basis of substantial autonomy for Kosovo and in full respect for
the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chief diplomats of Bulgaria, Greece, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Turkey and Romania -- Nadezhda Mihaylova,
Georgios Papandreou, Aleksandar Dimitrov, Ismail Cem and Andrei
Plesu -- made the declaration in a statement endorsed after their
meeting in Bucharest,
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their deep concern over the ongoing
conflict in Kosovo that carries the risk of spill-over effects,
thus endangering peace and stability in the region, and underlined
the utmost importance of restraint on both sides and called for
immediate cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the Paris talks may represent a last opportunity
for a political settlement of the crisis, they welcomed the signing of
the Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo by the
delegation of the Kosovar Albanians, and urged the Serbs to sign the
agreement as well. The ministers expressed, at the same time, support
for an international force that will assist the implementation of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating their full support to international efforts for the
political settlement of the Kosovo crisis, the five ministers
reconfirmed their commitment to contributing alongside the efforts
of the Contact Group, NATO, the EU and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to a viable, peaceful solution
as a prerequisite for peace and stability in Kosovo, as well as in
the whole region in compliance with the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their readiness to further strengthen
regional cooperation and solidarity, with a view to securing peace
in Kosovo, averting future crises and fostering the European
identity of the whole region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Skeptical of Libya's Handing Over Pan Am Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
expressed scepticism to reports of a breakthrough in attempts to
arrange a trial in the Netherlands of two Libyan men accused of
blowing up Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of scepticism. The test is when these guys turn
up in the Netherlands for trials," a State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said Friday Libya had
asked him to set a date for Libya to hand the men over for trial
and that this could take place by April 6.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Ghaddafi, appearing on television with Mandela
and Saudi Envoy Prince Bandar bi Sultan, said he accepted
assurances given by Mandela and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia over the
planned trial of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
"When Saudi King Fahd and President Mandela ask me to let it
into their hands, it would not be reasonable for me to set
conditions," Ghaddafi said in a speech in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
But Peter Burleigh, U.S. representative to the United Nations,
said: "The key is the turning over of the two accused to the
United Nations for transport to the Netherlands for a Scottish
trial."
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a date, but more important than the date is
the actual turnover. This is what is required by the resolution
and this is the one criteria about whether Libya has complied," he
said.

WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday asked Congress to give bipartisan support for NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia for its not conceding sovereignty of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, some of them sceptical about th merits of
putting American pilots in danger over Kosovo, sat down with
Clinton in the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
Among the 31 members of Congress attending were two top
Republicans in Congress -- Senate Majority leader Trent Lott and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert -- and two senior Democrats, Senate
Minority leader Tom Daschle and House Minority leader Richard
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
Lott and Hastert said they both urged Clinton to explain to
the American people why the United States should be involved.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the president now recognizes the need to say
to the American people exactly what's at stake here, why would
an action be taken, what would those actions be, and what are
the risks," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would "lay out
what our national interests are in Kosovo and in the region and
in regional stability, what our interests are in avoiding a
humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
"As we continue our consultation today and as I'm sure we'll
continue over the coming days, it is our hope and our
expectation that we'll have bipartisan support for whatever
action is taken," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"There's clearly the danger of regional instability," he said.
"There is the interest in safeguarding the credibility of NATO.
Those are things that are clearly in our national interest."
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss any deadline for action, but said
"there is not unlimited time here."
</P>
<P>
"NATO will be prepared to take all necessary steps," he said.

Sen. Joe Biden, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations

<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday vowed to launch a "ruthless fight" against those behind a
bombing in North Ossetia that killed over 60 people earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in a television program, Yeltsin apologized to the
families and friends of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"I apologize because I am responsible for everything," Yeltsin
said.

He promised to extend all forms of assistance to the families
of those killed and injured in the bombing in a busy market in
Vladikavkaz, capital of Russia's North Ossetia republic.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, Federal Security Service
(FSB) Director Vladimir Putin and North Ossetian President
Alexander Dzasokhov visited the site of the tragedy and held
consultations with the joint investigative group, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin sent a message of condolences to Dzasokhov, saying he
was "deeply shaken by this barbaric act."

in the North Caucasus and to sow hostility and hatred.

Yeltsin offered his wholehearted condolences to the families
and friends of those killed and wished them "courage in this
difficult hour."

The death toll is expected to rise as many of the wounded,
