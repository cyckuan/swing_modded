U.S. SQUAD HAS WAITED A LONG TIME
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The years of service of the 13 women on the U.S. National water
polo team varies from a lifetime served by Maureen O'Toole to nine
years put in by Julie Swail and Kathy ``Gubba'' Sheehy to the seven
months that Ericka Lorenz and Heather Petrie have been a part of
the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter how long it took to get here, the primary goal of
earning a medal - preferably gold - is the same for each and every
member of the team which will represent the country in the Sydney
Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who have been to the Olympics who tell me that
when you look back it is the process of getting there that you
remember most,'' said goalkeeper Nicolle Payne, a graduate of UCLA
and former All-American at UCLA. ``You remember the relationships
and what it meant to be a team. But right now, the most important
thing is getting a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any Olympic medals handed out until Sept. 23, but
there will be a good opportunity for a preview this week when the
six entrants participate in the Holiday Cup at the U.S. National
Aquatics Center on the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Los Alamitos.
</P>
<P>
   The men had control of the pool last week during the UPS
International Cup with Yugoslavia beating the U.S., 4-3, in
Sunday's championship game. The women's turn in the water begins
today with Kazakhstan playing Netherlands at 4:30 p.m., Australia
squaring off with Russia at 5:45 p.m. and the U.S. taking on Canada
at 7 p.m. and culminates with the championship game on Sunday night
at 7.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. coach Guy Baker said there will also be some
fireworks in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the women's game is exciting,'' said Baker. ``The
women are playing with movement, finesse and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   What the women's game doesn't have, however, is the Olympic
tradition. The sport has been played for 100 years but the women's
first shot at winning Olympic gold will come in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of being the first Olympic team can't be
overestimated,'' said United States water polo executive director
Bruce Wigo.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of women on the American squad who have waited
for a long time for this day. The 39-year-old O'Toole was 17 years
old when she first joined the national team in 1978 and has come
out of retirement twice. Swail and Sheehy each joined the national
team in 1991 and have been members since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us, to some degree, have put our life on
hold,'' said Payne, a member of the national team since 1996 and
three-time NCAA champion at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason the celebration included plenty of tears
when the U.S. qualified for the Olympic Games with a 6-5 semifinal
victory of Hungary during the World Olympic Qualification
Tournament in April in Palermo, Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans lost to Russia, 6-5, in the championship game of
the tournament but that didn't take the luster of Olympic
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget it,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, the focus is on getting ready to challenge
for an Olympic medal. Baker's system calls for a a pressing defense
and the speed to create counterattack opportunities for the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scorers in the Olympic qualification tournament were
Coralie Simmons (12 goals), Bell Gardens High graduate Brenda Villa
(10 goals), Robin Beauregard (seven goals) and Lorenz (six goals).
Beauregard won't be in the pool during the Holiday Cup as she
continues to rehab an injured knee that isn't expected to keep her
out of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. also has the luxury of featuring two top-notch
goalkeepers in starter Bernie Orwig and Payne. Orwig, who made a
spectacular save in the final seconds of the qualifying victory
over Hungary, was the collegiate water polo player of the year in
1999 after she led USC to the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is anxious to see his group take on the world's best this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last chance all the teams will be together before
the Olympics,'' Baker said.

FOOTSTEPS STILL FRESH FROM ROAD TRIPS WITH DAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is the Fourth of July. America's birthday. Just as
important to me, my father's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career as a journalist, my father has written
about sports.
</P>
<P>
   For years, his birthday would come and he would have to call me
from wherever he was on the road so I could wish him a happy
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A few times, the birthday calls came from Italy or France during
the World Cup. He would be rhapsodizing on the virtues of Roberto
Baggio or Zinedine Zidane and even Diego Maradona, the madman
artist of the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Once, all I wanted to know was whether I could borrow $5,000
because I had just found a house I couldn't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was soccer's intoxicating effects on him, but my father
said OK, the check's in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the birthday call came from London, where Wimbledon
was nearing the end of its grassy fortnight. Through the crackle of
long distance, my father would tell me how he was writing fast so
he could meet my mother at the theater that night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all I wanted to know was why Jana Novotna choked
again, what the tabloids were saying about Andre Agassi and Brooke
Shields or how Fergie looked in the royal box.
</P>
<P>
   Well before there was any kind of national ``Take Your Daughter
To Work'' day, my father used to take me to work. And that meant
road trips. Spring training. The barns at the race track. Football
training camps.
</P>
<P>
   I loved going. It was a blast, hanging out, watching practice or
games, stopping at diners to eat BLT sandwiches while my father did
his ``work.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he took me to Chicago, where he interviewed Joe Frazier
the day before Frazier's son, Marvis, made his pro boxing debut. I
accompanied my father to Frazier's hotel suite. When Smokin' Joe
asked me where I went to school, for some reason I blanked out. He
shook his head and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least she's pretty,'' Frazier rasped to my father, dissing
my memory lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Then Frazier added: ``She must have gotten her good looks from
her mother,'' essentially dissing my father.
</P>
<P>
   My father rolled his eyes and smiled. If you're going to be
insulted, it may as well be by Joe Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   The whole ``On The Road'' sports thing started when I was 1{
years old. The Mets had finished their second season and were
moving to Shea Stadium, so my father did what any New York National
League fan would have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the '63 season, I took you to the Polo Grounds
just so you could say you were there before they tore it down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I think, more to the point, it was so he could say he had taken
me there. But that's cool. We still secretly root for the Mets. And
the designated hitter ... well, I understand where he's coming
from.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest memory I have of being ``on the road'' with my
father was during spring training in 1965 or '66. We drove from New
York to Florida, where he was covering the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   One night, we were in the lobby of the Colonial Inn in St.
Petersburg. I was 3 or 4, and my father told me to sit and wait
while he talked with some ballplayers. When he turned around to
check on me, he saw I had been taken to the hotel lobby bar by an
animated, white-haired old man.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow was holding court, telling wild stories to a small
crowd gathered at the bar, making plenty sure I was supplied with
glass after glass of bubbly ginger ale.
</P>
<P>
   Later, my father told me that man was Casey Stengel. The manager
of the Mets, former manager of the Yankees, was one of sports'
all-time classic characters.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I tried to understand the intricacies of Stengel's
legend, but all I knew was that Casey had made my night, flooding
me with soda and putting me smack in the middle of a good time.
</P>
<P>
   I might have decided right there, ``This isn't a bad life.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, when I was about 8, I had another encounter
with a big-name baseball player. While my father was in the
clubhouse, me and some other kids were waiting outside, trying to
get autographs. A burly guy with a handlebar mustache came out and
I shoved my pen and paper at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, little girl,'' the man said. ``But come back and see me in
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when my father and I were driving back to the hotel, I
told him what Thurman Munson had said. What did he mean, come back
and see him in 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   Amused by Munson's ridiculously lecherous humor, my father
delicately explained to me that the Yankees catcher would probably
be a little more interested in visiting with young women of legal
age. It was an insight into ballplayers that has served well
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Munson did not make it 10 years, dying in 1979 when he
crashed his own plane.
</P>
<P>
   For me and my Pops, though, that story gets better with age.
</P>
<P>
   So does my father and so do the times we share in this world of
sports, which is what I'll tell him Tuesday on his birthday.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Swept to power by younger, better-educated voters
fed up with corruption and one-party rule, President-elect Vicente
Fox on Monday began the transition of Mexico from a republic headed
for decades by an autocratic president to one in which political
power suddenly seemed up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   As Fox fielded congratulatory phone calls Monday from world
leaders, including President Clinton, and met with President
Ernesto Zedillo, election returns showed that Mexican voters on
Sunday had handed him a substantially more decisive victory over
the governing party than any poll had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the ballots tabulated, the Mexican electoral
agency reported that Fox had won 43 percent of the votes, while
Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the ruling party, won 36
percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist candidate, won 17
percent. Fox will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, it was still sinking in Monday that after 71
years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which evolved from a
alliance of revolutionary generals into a model nationalist party
imitated across Latin America before degenerating into a clique of
corrupt insiders, had finally been deposed from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of
power in this country's history, for the first time none of the
major parties _ the deposed one, Fox's center-right party, or the
largest leftist grouping _ will be in control of either house of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday night, Fox said he had assured
Zedillo that he did not intend to carry out a purge of the
government bureaucracy, at least in the first stage of his new
administration. The two leaders agreed to meet frequently between
now and December to plan next year's budget and to discuss the
transition, Fox added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team will take office with creative ideas and new
philosophies, but there'll be no change in federal work rhythms,''
Fox said. ``Mexico will be a country on the move, headed by a
government that keeps its commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will preside over a government unused to coalition politics
but one in which all major business will require the consent of one
or the other of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parties are going to have to relearn the art of making
politics,'' said Carlos Elizondo, a political scientist who is
rector of the Center for Research and Teaching in Mexico City.
``The fundamental pillars of Mexico's political system have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   These unsettled results were reflected around the country. Fox's
National Action Party won the two governor's seats up for grabs on
Sunday and will now govern in seven of Mexico's 31 states. In
Mexico City, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or
PRD, retained control of the mayor's office, but the
president-elect's party took control of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Fox will face the ticklish task of meeting the
hopes for quick and sweeping change of the diverse voters who
backed him. He has promised, simultaneously, to modernize the
economy and spur 7 percent growth, carry out sweeping political
reforms, and initiate an ``educational revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged to better the lot not only of the largely young,
middle-class professionals in his own center-right party, but also
of millions of poor urban workers and farmers who have in the past
supported the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got to get to work right away,'' Fox said in an
interview early Monday, after his triumph. ``I want to be certain
to deliver good results to the people of Mexico, to govern and to
govern well.''
</P>
<P>
   The election results provoked a debate over how successfully
Zedillo's party would navigate its journey from its powerhouse
position into the ranks of the opposition. Some said that the party
had already proved its adaptability and resilience in states where
Fox's party had already won control of the governor's chair.
</P>
<P>
   But others, comparing the position of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, to some communist parties in
Eastern Europe, argued that without presidential support and
control over federal patronage, the party would crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The party's president during the presidential campaign quickly
announced her resignation, and some party officials said they
feared that a sweeping exodus could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the elections to fill all 128 seats in the Senate
and all 500 in the Chamber of Deputies indicated that Fox's party
would finish with its powers significantly enhanced, mainly at the
expense of the leftist PRD, with which it shared opposition powers
during the last Legislature; but that it would not control a
majority of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI lost the Senate majority it had enjoyed since the
party's creation and without the power of the president to
coordinate its efforts, the PRI's entire legislative delegation
will wield considerably less clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party was receiving 38 percent of the votes for Congress,
the returns showed. The PRI was receiving 36 percent and the PRD,
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the ballot-counting continued, Zedillo met privately in the
presidential compound with the top PRI leaders, whose power now
rests almost entirely in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Zedillo outlined his views of the unprecedented
survival challenges facing the party, which had gone undefeated in
presidential voting _ often through the simple exercise of its vast
powers of patronage and pork and sometimes through outright ballot
fraud _ for 71 years, longer than any other party in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a second encounter, Zedillo addressed the 21 of Mexico's 31
state governors who belong to his party, urging them to cooperate
fully with Fox's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is like the phoenix,'' Melquiades Morales, the PRI
governor of Puebla, told reporters as he entered the meeting. ``It
will rise again from its own ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to work with the new president in a relation of
respect and collaboration,'' Fernando Silva, the PRI governor of
the north central state of San Luis Potosi, told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexico was entering absolutely new political terrain with the
PRI's defeat, neither foreign nor domestic investors appeared
concerned. The Mexican stock market surged 6.1 percent on news of
Fox's victory, and the peso, which had been battered in recent
weeks as nervous Mexicans converted savings to dollars,
strengthened 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are very enthusiastic,'' said Rogelio Ramirez,
president of Ecanal, a Mexico City consulting firm. ``The market is
seeing Fox as a man who can bring important changes, in the sense
of modernizing the economy and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview early Monday, hours after his triumph became
apparent, Fox outlined his hopes to forge tighter relations with
the United States, where he attended high school in Wisconsin and
has traveled extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I know well the philosophy of the American
people, because I've worked all my life there both in business and
in politics,'' he said. ``I know that we are going to be able to
accomplish many things together. We can develop our great
potential, which still stretches before us. I want to work
intensely with the United States because it is the world's largest
market, it's our neighbor, it's our partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox offered words of conciliation to Labastida and to Cardenas,
with both of whom he had traded extraordinarily harsh criticisms
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send him my regards, I recognize his participation and his
passion in defending his ideas,'' Fox said of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech, Fox said he would withdraw the libel suit
he filed last week against his rivals, who had accused him, without
providing documentation, of accepting illegal campaign donations
from a Belgian company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is going to be a government of national concord, a
government of unity, a government with its eyes fixed on the
future, a government that we're going to build with the help of all
Mexicans,'' Fox said in the speech. ``I think that's the way to
build the great nation that we all dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Fox spent several hours at the downtown Mexico City
hotel that had been his residence for a year, greeting
well-wishers, speaking to reporters, and speaking to foreign
leaders by phone.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Fox Monday morning, said Jorge
Castaneda, an adviser to Fox. ``Clinton was very cordial, very
supportive, in general and in particular,'' Castaneda said that Fox
told him. ``Fox committed himself to a meeting with Clinton before
Clinton leaves office. They had a very pleasant conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegations of international observers on Monday praised
the elections as well-organized and fraud-free.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter called the elections ``a turning point of great
significance for all those who love freedom and democracy.'' He
said reforms implemented by an autonomous federal electoral agency
since the 1994 presidential balloting ``turned out to be almost
perfect''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts were scratching their head about why Fox's
victory was far more sweeping than most public opinion surveys had
predicted. Several polls had shown Fox and Labastida to be running
neck and neck, but preliminary results show that Fox won by a
9-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Reforma wrote Monday that the nearly 20 percent of
Mexican voters who said they were undecided before the vote, had in
reality been planning to vote for Fox, but had been disguising
their anti-government sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Greenberg, the American pollster who worked on contract
to the PRI during the campaign, said that Labastida's candidacy was
doomed when he failed to compete with Fox among the young, urban
middle-class voters whose portion of the Mexican electorate is
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the country's changing demographics, given the
globalization of its economy, all the changes in Mexico, Labastida
and the PRI simply had to attract votes beyond their longtime base
in the rural areas,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas not only went down to his worst defeat in three
presidential bids, but also saw his leftist party's power in
Congress reduced considerably, the returns show. The party's only
bright spot was the election of Andres Manuel Lopez to a six-year
term at the head of the Mexico City government, which will remain
the party's stronghold.

VICENTE FOX: MEXICO'S PRESIDENT-ELECT NOT ONE TO HIDE HIS
AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 4th-to-last graf re Fox's marriage.)  
(With MEXICO-ELECTION and related stories) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The confirmation of his election as president of
Mexico was still hours away, the victory real only in the computers
of his pollsters, but Vicente Fox was already three steps down the
road. There would be a quick sip of champagne, a victory speech and
then he would get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right tomorrow I want to be working,'' Fox told an American
journalist in between nonstop interviews handled over his
ever-present cell phone. ``My hobby is work. It enchants me. I
thoroughly enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turned 58 on the day that Mexicans elected him the
first president in the nation's modern history from an opposition
party, is nothing if not a man of considerable ambition and energy.
He is a politician who once told his political marketing strategist
to ``sell me'' like any other product.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous rancher, his career has traversed
business and politics. A manufacturer of cowboy boots and a former
Coca-Cola executive, Fox entered politics by being elected a
congressman and later was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more than anything else, Fox is a maverick. In
Congress half of his votes followed the line of his conservative,
pro-business party. The other half were leftist positions, many of
which were backed by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which he vanquished on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his campaign began, he was careful to manage
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending 70 years of dictatorship will be a great heroic exploit
for Mexico,'' he said, ``something like when you Americans put a
man on the moon. Reaching the moon took a decade of work, and
defeating the ruling party will also require lots of time, talent
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox sought to allay fears that turmoil
might result were he to prevail by pledging to form what he has
called a government of transition. After his victory, he reiterated
those promises, extending friendly messages to his rivals and
calling for unity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as governor of Guanajuato state in central Mexico from
1995 until he resigned to campaign for president, Fox appointed a
woman with ties to the PRI as his state auditor and enlisted the
help of a member of the largest leftist party to devise programs to
benefit rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the government he will lead will contrast sharply
with those of the 13 consecutive PRI presidents before him, partly
because he is likely to bring his business instincts to the job.
</P>
<P>
   When he formed his campaign team last fall, Fox asked a
headhunting firm to locate superstar executives to act as his top
aides. He is unabashed at using marketing techniques for political
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me as a product, and figure out how to sell me,'' Fox
said to Francisco Ortiz, the former Procter &AMP; Gamble marketing
wizard he hired to direct his broadcast campaign, Ortiz recalled in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ran as the candidate of the center-right National
Action Party, Fox reached out to leftist intellectuals from across
Latin America, and in discussion groups, he demonstrated
considerable political flexibility, according to Jorge Castaneda,
the liberal New York University professor and author who lives here
part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were from a different world, ideologically and
socially, and he was learning how to get along,'' Castaneda said.
``These were establishment and leftist intellectuals. They dressed
differently, they liked different things. To put it mildly, he was
not in his element. But he'd sit down and he'd manage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente Fox is a phenomenon,'' said Dick Morris, the American
political consultant, who worked for Fox. ``This has not been a
situation where the consultant runs the campaign. Fox has a
chemistry with the people of Mexico that is beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 2, 1942, in Mexico City, Fox spent his childhood on
an 1,100-acre ranch in San Francisco del Rincon, Guanajuato,
purchased during the Mexican revolution by his paternal
grandfather, an immigrant to Mexico of Irish descent.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mercedes Quesada, was born in Spain, a legal
impediment for Fox's eventual political ambitions until a clause
barring the children of immigrants from serving as president was
eliminated from the Mexican constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has eight siblings. His father was a prosperous landholder,
although not vastly wealthy in Mexican terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I'm proud of is that I became good friends with the
children of the smallholders and peasants; with them I shared my
infancy, my playthings, my house and my food,'' he wrote in a
campaign autobiography. ``From that time I began to understand our
country's painful inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   He was educated by Jesuits, and spent a year at an academy in
Prairie du Chien, Wis., learning among other things how to speak
fluent but accented English.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Catholic, he could be the most unapologetically
religious of Mexico's modern presidents. The governing party that
coalesced after Mexico's 1917 Revolution had a strong anticlerical
bias, and the armies of the revolutionary governments that ruled
during the 1920s carried out a bloody counterinsurgency against
Catholic rebels in the west-central region that surrounds Fox's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has expressed historical fascination with the legacy of the
Catholic insurgents, known as Cristeros, and during his campaign
often ended rallies with a Cristero war cry: ``If I advance, follow
me! If I stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!''
</P>
<P>
   If his predecessors have learned the country's local
idiosyncracies as military men or as government bureaucrats, Fox's
sense for the texture of grassroots life came as a route supervisor
for Coca Cola, where he worked in six cities in seven years. After
his transfer to Mexico City in 1971, he climbed to the top of
Coke's corporate hierarchy, serving as chief executive from 1975 to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hated most about those years at Coca-Cola was the time
I had to spend dithering with the government,'' he said recently,
recalling how the president would convene Fox and hundreds of other
business executives to the presidential palace ``so we could listen
to a lot of foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Coke offered to make Fox the head of its Latin American
operations, which would have required that he move to Miami.
Instead, he quit and returned to Guanajuato to work with his
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   While at Coke, Fox married his secretary, Lillian de la Concha,
and the couple adopted four children. They were divorced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The early 1980s saw many peso devaluations, and Fox has said
that the harrowing experience of running a small business with a
chaotic economy helped persuade him of the need for political
change.
</P>
<P>
   During that economic turmoil, Mexico's opposition forces were
achieving their first major victories in local elections in the
north, and in 1988, dozens of entrepreneurs ran for Congress
representing the National Action Party, including Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He won, served one term in the Chamber of Deputies, and ran for
governor in 1991, losing an election marred by fraud. Four years
later he won. Three years into his governorship, he launched his
quest for the presidency.

ANALYSIS: TAKING THE ADJECTIVES OUT OF MEXICAN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 485 words, bgng: In 1994...)  
(With MEXICO-ELECTION and related stories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At 11 p.m., with the official returns showing that
Vicente Fox had seized the presidency from the governing party, the
man who went before the nation to concede defeat was not the losing
candidate, but President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had telephoned Fox to congratulate him on ``his
triumph'' and promise him a ``transparent, clean and efficient''
handover on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In another country, a president whose crowning achievement was
to hold an election in which his party was humiliated and driven
from the office it had held for seven decades probably would be
regarded as a flop. But in Mexico, where the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been in command for seven decades,
the loss of the presidential battle won Zedillo a much greater war
to transform this country into a working democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have shown for all to see that ours is a nation of
free men and women who believe in the means of democracy and law to
achieve progress,'' Zedillo told Mexican viewers astonished by
Fox's showing.
</P>
<P>
   In his six years as president, Zedillo has been dogged in
pursuing the goals of political reform that he set forth early in
his term, knowing that they could ultimately lead his party into a
political winter. Enrique Krauze, a historian of the Mexican
presidency, recalls a meeting at the presidential offices in 1995
at which Zedillo, still fresh in the job, asked Krauze to look over
the draft of the speech in which he would unveil proposals for a
broad change in the Mexican electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans had long settled for the appearance of democracy.
During decades when the PRI was an untouchable single party, it
held ritual elections every six years. When real political parties
formed in the 1980s to challenge it, the PRI responded with
bribery, influence peddling and sometimes, critics said, outright
fraud to hold onto its power. Zedillo's own rise to office began in
tragedy, the assassination of the nominated PRI candidate in 1994.
In these circumstances, Mexican democracy was always described as
an ``artificial'' or ``useless'' or ``dictatorial'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over his notes, Krauze recalled, Zedillo mused, ``I am
going to take all the adjectives out of Mexican democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he did. Fox owed his victory in no small
measure to Zedillo. In his inaugural speech in 1994, the new
president had implied deficiencies in his own election and said
that Mexico needed a fairer voting system. Two years later he
pushed those electoral reforms through Congress, often over the
furious objections of the opposition parties, like Fox's, which
eventually benefited from them the most.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms created the independent elections agency that
organized the voting on July 2, the fairest election in Mexico's
history. They also provided for nearly $1 billion in public
financing for the parties' campaigns, so that Fox was able to buy
broadcast advertising time to blanket the country with his message
of change.
</P>
<P>
   All along it was clear that the big loser in the reforms was
Zedillo's own party. His policies amounted to an ultimatum. No
longer was it the domineering PRI elite's job to spread the spoils.
The president wanted the party to work for its votes.
</P>
<P>
   The need for an opening in Mexico was seared into Zedillo's
awareness before he took office. His predecessor, Carlos Salinas,
became president in a 1988 election that most Mexicans believe he
won by fraud. The tainted mandate came back to haunt Salinas after
the end of his term when the currency collapsed and his legacy was
instantly shattered, sending him into exile.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the man Salinas chose to succeed him, Luis Donaldo
Colosio, was assassinated during his campaign when Zedillo was his
manager. Although the homicide was never solved, there was no doubt
that it came in the midst of a buildup of tension in the PRI
because of the arbitrary method of the succession.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, 48, has always been an outsider in the PRI system. He
was never part of what Mexicans call ``the revolutionary family,''
the PRI elite. He comes from a family in the sand-blown border town
of Mexicali, far from the power centers. Bookish, he rose through
the government by discipline and hard work rather than the
traditional clever upward manuevering through competing cliques.
</P>
<P>
   An economist by training, Zedillo kept his distance from the
day-to-day horse trading in Mexico City, and so was often
criticized as politically maladroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a quiet man, withdrawn from the palace politics,''
Krauze said. ``It gave him a lot of time to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tellez, the energy secretary who was Zedillo's chief of
staff for three years, recalled that he had read every biography of
Benito Juarez, a Zapotec Indian who became a great reformist
Mexican president in the 19th century. Both presidents, Tellez
said, were convinced that economic change had to go hand in hand
with political opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has imposed some limits. Last year, he abandoned the
practice of picking his party's presidential candidate. At his
behest, the PRI ran its first competitive primary. Although four
candidates ran, it was clear that Zedillo favored Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, who had been his interior minister, the
president's top political operator.
</P>
<P>
   The party faithful had no doubt who was supposed to win, and at
the end of the race they piled on against the other three
candidates. In a bizarre show, the PRI rank and file turned on
their own brethren with the same vote-buying and pressure tactics
they long had used on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While he remained largely aloof from Labastida's presidential
drive, in the final weeks before the election Zedillo stepped in
with some sharply partisan attacks on Fox and other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zedillo emerged remarkably unscathed from the PRI's
debacle at the ballot box. The Reforma newspaper, citing interviews
with voters as they left the polls on Sunday after trashing
Labastida, reported that 66 percent of them gave Zedillo a
favorable review as president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zedillo is managing to end his term in a surprisingly
strong position. His party's demise is being hailed as evidence of
his democratic conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Castaneda, a close adviser to Fox, said that the winning
candidate initiated the call to the president on Sunday night.
Zedillo came right on the line to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first moment of contact Zedillo was careful, but
relaxed,'' Castaneda said. ``He was very statesmanlike.''

GRIND TAKES ITS TOLL ON ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Big Five the Angels have counted on for
most of their offense --- Darin Erstad, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon,
Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus --- have also been counted upon to
be in the lineup everyday.
</P>
<P>
   They've missed a total of eight games this season, which reached
the halfway point Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy load, however, may be taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who played in the first 71 games, sat out back-to-back
games last week with back spasms and is 1 for 23 with 15 strikeouts
(THROUGH 2 AT-BATS MONDAY) since.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Erstad, the Angels best player in the first half, who
is sidelined with a bad back. He was in the DH spot on Sunday and
was slated to play there again Monday, but was scratched just
before game time.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad leads the American League in hits (130), is second in
batting average (.371) and has driven home 59 runs --- tied for
second on the team --- from his leadoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker has likened the last week before the
All-Star break to the final minute of a basketball team --- it's a
chance to carry some momentum into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia couldn't disagree more with his former
Dodger teammate. Even as the Angels embarked upon a four-game
series with the first-place Mariners leading up to next week's
break, Scioscia isn't putting any extra importance on this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put a lot of stock in the leading up to the All-Star
break,'' Scioscia said. ``I put a lot of stock in the grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (former Notre Dame basketball coach) Digger Phelps
the last time we were in Seattle and he'd look at the schedule and
say we had to be 4-1 in this group. There's a lot of successful
coaches who look at it like that, but I never have as a player,
coach or in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does two things. First, it set in complacency if
you approach your goal. Second, it ignites a little panic if you're
behind. I think you play the game hard, try to carry some momentum
if you can and turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Game starters will be announced today, and pitchers and
reserves will be announced Wednesday for next week's game in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, the expected starter with leading vote-getter Cal Ripken
out, and Erstad, as a reserve, are locks. If the Angels get a third
player, it could be rookie Bengie Molina, who is having a terrific
season at bat and behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Molina entered Monday night's game batting .309 with 8 homers
and 35 RBI, and had thrown out 36 percent of runners trying to
steal.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Gil Meche (4-4, 3.49 ERA) vs. Kent Bottenfield (4-7,
5.60), 7:05 p.m.; TV: Fox Sports Net. Radio: KLAC/570 AM and
XPRS/1090 AM.

 DEATH PENALTY UPHELD FOR TAHOE MAN  &HT;     By BILL WALLACE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a 5-to-2 decision, the California Supreme
Court upheld the death penalty Monday for a South Lake Tahoe man
who murdered two women and raped two others during a crime spree in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Herbert James
Coddington had falsely represented himself as a model talent scout
in order to lure two teenage girls and their chaperones _ Mabs
Martin, 69, and Dorothy Walsh, 73 _ to his trailer house in South
Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Coddington then murdered the two adults and sexually assaulted
the teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Coddington's defense attorneys argued that their client was
insane at the time, saying he believed he was being ordered to
perform do  &LR; the murders by God, who communicated with him
indirectly through such instruments as traffic signals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, an El Dorado County Superior Court jury rejected the
insanity defense and convicted Coddington of the murders and sex
crimes. He was later sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Coddington's attorneys appealed the death sentence, claiming
that a variety of errors had hampered his opportunity to have a
fair trial, including moving his trial to Placerville from South
Lake Tahoe; allowing evidence from a search of his trailer, even
though investigators did not have a warrant; and excluding some
evidence of his longtime mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's 155-page ruling, five members of the state Supreme
Court upheld the death sentence. While acknowledging that some of
Coddington's arguments are true, the majority _ Justices Marvin
Baxter, Ronald George, Kathryn Werdegar, Ming Chin and Janice Brown
_ found that any errors that may have occurred during the trial did
not harm Coddington's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting opinion by Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce Kennard
drew the opposite conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Superior Court committed error, and the prosecutor
engaged in misconduct bearing on the issue, is undoubted,'' Mosk
wrote in the dissent. ``Whether such error and misconduct caused
prejudice is the question. The majority give a negative answer.
After reviewing the record on appeal, I would give a positive
one.''

MEXICO ELECTION BRINGS FEELING OF EMPOWERMENT TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite lede and adds dateline.)  
(With MEXICO-ELECTION) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For three generations, Juan Quiroz's family has
run a fruit-and-vegetable stand in the market that sits in the
shadow of the presidential mansion, Los Pinos. But Mexican politics
seemed so impenetrable, he said, that he has never felt close to
it.
</P>
<P>
   But several hours after he cast his vote on Sunday, Quiroz said
he realized he had touched power for the first time. His choice for
president, Vicente Fox, would be the first man in 70 years to oust
the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, known as the PRI,
from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that Fox would win, even if all the votes were
for him because the PRI was so powerful,'' Quiroz said. ``The
people finally showed that we are more powerful than any political
party _ even a dictatorship like the PRI. Now the people are in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   That euphoric feeling of empowerment echoed across Mexico on
Monday, among people of various backgrounds, professions and
political stripes, in newspaper columns and radio commentary, in
bookstores and cafes. A day after the most historic election in
recent memory, the nation seemed stunned and excited by Fox's
decisive triumph over one of the longest ruling political machines
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, people said, marked more than a challenge for
Mexico's president-elect. In words full of optimism, people
expressed pride in the peaceful way their votes were cast and
counted, in the way they overcame their fear of change and embraced
it. And almost everyone interviewed, no matter which candidate they
had supported, emerged with some personal feeling of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new day for me,'' said Francisco Rosales, 50, while
browsing through classics at a popular bookstore called Ghandi.
``The PRI has been defeated and once they are going everything else
in our lives will be easier. There will be less corruption, less
manipulation, less fear and more participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the market near los Pinos, people like Luis Manuel
Dominguez said that they did not expect all of Mexico's troubles to
vanish quickly and that they would be happy with slow, steady steps
toward progress.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans took the first step on Election Day, Dominguez, 38, a
telephone repairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' he added as he ate stewed chicken at a
lunch counter, ``we are entering a government that was really
created by the people. This is not a cosmetic victory. It is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Along a commercial strip in the working-class town of
Nezahuacoyotl, just east of the capital, the celebration of Fox's
victory stretched into the late afternoon Monday. Students waved at
passing cars, holding up their first two fingers, now a well-known
gesture from Fox's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents used to say it was better to vote for someone who
is bad but familiar rather than someone who is good but unknown,''
said Alejandro Robles, a student of veterinary medicine at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico who stood smiling among a
group of Fox supporters even though he had voted for Cardenas. ``I
think young people are ready to try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a clothing store showed off the ink that was
rubbed on his thumb at the polls to indicate that he had voted. He
said he had voted for Fox, but he saw the election as a victory for
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox became president,'' the manager said, ``but the people of
Mexico became a democracy.''

NEW SHOW PROMISES REAL LIFE DRAMA

By VALERIE KUKLENSKI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tonight, 10 strangers will enter a two-bedroom,
one-bathroom house to begin an 89-day living experiment, cut off
from the outside world but in plain sight of millions of TV viewers
thanks to 28 cameras and 60 microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Now what everybody really wants to know, on the eve Wednesday's
premiere of the much-talked-about KCBS-TV (Channel 2) reality show
``Big Brother,'' are the particulars -- such as what will be
recorded in the bathroom, what will the contestants be forbidden to
bring into the house and how will they eliminate housemates. We're
here to help.
</P>
<P>
   What's the house look like?
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a prefabricated structure assembled in a parking
lot deep inside the CBS Studio Center lot on Radford Drive in
Studio City. The interior living space covers 1,800 square feet,
with two cramped bedrooms sleeping five each; a bathroom with a
pedestal sink, a shower stall and a more private toilet chamber; a
kitchen with a double sink, refrigerator and electric stove; a
dining room table for 10; a living room with three couches and a
coffee table; a storage room; and the Red Room with a single chair.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the building is dedicated to the making of the show,
with camera bays, control rooms and other crew work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they go for fresh air?
</P>
<P>
   The living room and kitchen have windows and a door to a
courtyard measuring about 49 by 68 feet. It has a patio, new sod, a
vegetable patch, free weights, an umbrella table with four chairs
and a very small pool with the ``Big Brother'' logo painted on the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Where will they get their food?
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable garden, already thriving, includes corn, tomatoes,
zucchini, radishes, lettuce, peppers, herbs and a very dainty lemon
tree (from which not much should be expected). There is a coop
housing seven Rhode Island red hens, each expected to lay five eggs
per week for a ration of 3.5 eggs per person while the household
remains full.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions will be ordered weekly from a budget of $5 per
day per head to be spent as they decide collectively. Beer and wine
are for sale in Big Brother's grocery, but, the producers note,
with money that tight, no one will be getting drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The allowance pool drops each time a resident is voted out of
the house, but the garden produce and the eggs will be stable
supplies, so look for the biggest eaters to be among the first to
go. And don't fear for the chickens -- there's to be no
neck-wringing or feather-plucking.
</P>
<P>
   What can they bring with them?
</P>
<P>
   Each houseguest is provided two suitcases, one for clothes,
shoes and toiletries and the other for other personal items: family
photos, books, wine, cigarettes, even condoms, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Each person is allowed only one container each of toothpaste,
face cream, shaving cream, shampoo, soap and hair spray or gel.
They are allowed to bring instruments, which could make for some
charming after-dinner musicales -- or a karaoke twilight zone for
those who don't like to sing along.
</P>
<P>
   What CAN'T they bring with them?
</P>
<P>
   Electronic devices, cellular phones, pens, paper, diaries,
calendars, narcotics, hard liquor, weapons and pencil-shaped
makeup. The idea is not to prevent residents from preparing books
about their experiences, but to ensure they keep interacting with
the others as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   All those cameras and microphones -- does that mean nudity and
profanity on network television?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, to the relief of many and the disappointment
of some. CBS and its Internet partner, America Online, insist the
``Big Brother'' telecasts will meet the same standards as other
programming.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are cameras and microphones positioned to cover
every angle of the space, but producers say they are there for the
protection of the residents and to prevent secret meetings from
taking place.

PAYLESS CASHWAYS CHANGES THE WAY IT SELLS TO PROFESSIONALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JENNIFER MANN, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Mo. After two years of cleaning up the mess left
to him at Payless Cashways Inc., Millard Barron is ready to trade
his push broom and repair tools for some building materials and
blueprints for growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City home improvements company has made several
Internet e-commerce alliances and, more importantly, is creating a
division to capture a chunk of new business from professional home
builders.
</P>
<P>
   When Barron took the reins two years ago, Payless had undergone
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization _ but only its debt had really
been restructured. His new team still needed a year to stabilize
the company and another year to really reorganize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been eliminating impaired assets, changing the team,
developing a mission statement, remerchandising the stores,
changing the marketing _ those are all things that should have been
done under the umbrella of Chapter 11,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   With that work done, Barron is looking forward to Payless' new
initiatives, especially the wholesale operation called Builder's
Resource.
</P>
<P>
   Payless currently owns a little less than 1 percent of the $200
billion home improvement market _ a market where it's sandwiched by
giants Home Depot and Lowe's on one side and thousands of
mom-and-pop stores on the other. But with Builder's Resource, the
company hopes to tap into the separate $130 billion home-builder
market. Payless' goal for just 2001 is an additional $200 million
in sales from the new initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``neat'' thing about it, as Barron says, is that Payless
is spending a small amount of money to launch the initiative, a
total of $5 million to open what will basically be five sales
offices for a newly hired sales force _ many lured away from
Payless' competition in the professional dealer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gist of this story is that we're leveraging our existing
assets,'' Barron said. ``We're not adding new inventory. We're not
building new stores. The biggest expense really is the people we've
hired.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Payless management had always planned to capture
part of the professional market, and it has. Those on the
professional side of the business who patronize Payless are home
remodelers and repairmen and maintenance contractors.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of that market was attracted to Payless by another
initiative started by Barron more than a year ago, which was to
have separate entrances and sales counters for the repair and
remodeling contractors at the company's 150 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company addressed the do-it-yourself market by
giving the stores a cleaner sight line, reconfiguring the
merchandise mix and widening the aisles. To date, about a fourth of
Payless' 150 stores have been redone.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing were the lucrative pure professional builders,
who put up the thousands of new homes that make up the sprawling
suburbs surrounding Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, that's one of the interesting things I've learned in
my time here,'' Barron said. ``If we ever hoped to get part of the
builder market we had to get a different set of people to sell to
them, a different model.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the failure of dual-path _ (previous management)
was trying to serve everybody from the same store, and it didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dual-path'' may not ring any bells with most people, but those
involved with Payless will probably never forget the term. The
idea, under Barron's predecessor, David Stanley, was to serve the
entire do-it-yourself consumer market and the professional builder
from the same type of store.
</P>
<P>
   But the all-encompassing spectrum Payless was going after simply
doesn't shop at the same places _ not even at the stores of Orange
and Blue, as Home Depot and Lowe's are nicknamed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Dual-path left everyone _ from customers to industry analysts _
scratching their heads. The idea failed along with the company, and
Payless' bankers forced the company to reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barron hopes he can make up for some of the damage done by
Stanley and his team. If he can build the plan the way it's laid
out on the blueprint, sales will increase, margins will widen and,
most importantly, Payless will once again be a solidly profitable
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if all those things happen, hopefully Wall Street will
notice,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ideal builder's world as Barron sees it:
</P>
<P>
   A contractor on the job site pulls out his Palm Pilot. He orders
what he needs to build an entire home and sends the order to a
Builder's Resource center.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing weeks and months, virtually everything needed
to build a house _ from concrete fasteners, plumbing and electrical
packages to wallboard, light fixtures, doors, windows and roofing _
is delivered by Payless trucks to the job site in the sequence the
materials are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Builder's Resource center connects with the
builder's banker, who draws on his credit as needed, sends invoices
and pays bills.
</P>
<P>
   To attract and serve this demanding and sometimes disorganized
customer, Payless has lured away from other pro dealers a slew of
salespeople, people who already know this business, people ready to
bring their books of business to Payless.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Duggan of Duggan Securities, a longtime follower of
Payless, is impressed with Barron and his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millard has stabilized this company, has redone the debt in a
way that is much, much more favorable to Payless, and put it on
solid footing,'' Duggan said. ``Now, people in the business are
convinced of Payless' survivability. They're leaving good companies
where they've put in 10, 15, 20 years and uprooting their families.
You don't do that lightly, and I think that's a testament to
Millard.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the five Builder's Resource centers will open
within the next 30 to 45 days. Barron declined to say where, but he
did say they would open on real estate already owned by Payless,
including distribution centers and manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this, you only get one chance to do it right,''
Barron said. ``The worst thing you can do is screw it up, so we're
gonna crawl before we start running with this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of Payless' spectrum, for the serious
do-it-yourselfer, Payless has signed several e-commerce agreements,
including one with ImproveNet, a Web-based home improvement
contractor referral program.
</P>
<P>
   And just Friday, the company announced a new alliance with
DIYonline.com, a site designed for customers interested in
designing their own products and which will allow users to order
goods from Payless.
</P>
<P>
   Other initiatives include one whereby Payless is digitizing the
catalog images of its top special order vendors. About 10 percent
of Payless' existing business comes from special orders.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a customer wanting to place a special order goes into
a Payless store and thumbs through thousands of pages in a number
of catalogs. Once the new system is in place, the customer can come
in, type in what he's looking for on a computer terminal and get
real-time pricing and delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another new agreement is with CornerHardware.com, another
site for do-it-yourselfers.
</P>
<P>
   All these initiatives, Payless hopes, will strengthen its brand
name and shore up sales, which are slipping at an alarming rate,
including a 12.2 percent drop in same-store sales for the most
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said he abhors declining sales, but some of the drop was
expected. For instance, the company culled 7,000 items from its
inventory, reducing offerings from 30,000 to 23,000. The items it
dumped garnered sales, but not profits.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company has cut the number of advertising circulars
inserted in 10 million newspapers each Sunday. Those circulars have
a typical response rate of 2 percent, meaning that on weeks when
Payless doesn't have circulars there are typically 200,000 fewer
customers walking into its stores.
</P>
<P>
   But those marketing dollars have migrated elsewhere. For
instance, over the last year the company has built a detailed
database of its 1.5 million most loyal customers. And it's adding
new ones at the rate of 100,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   That database allows Payless to target and tailor its marketing
to its best customers.

LOS ANGELES: from taking place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What are the challenges the residents face?
</P>
<P>
   There are everyday challenges that stem from the
``back-to-basics'' lifestyle: baking their own bread, hand-washing
laundry and running it through a wringer, tending the garden and
keeping the chickens happy, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each Monday the household will be given a group
challenge to achieve by Friday. Some challenges used in the
European versions of the series: Keep a fire going in the courtyard
fire pit for five days, or pedal a total of 1,500 miles on the
stationary bike.
</P>
<P>
   Residents must decide among them who will take what shifts
toward the goal. They may wager from 20 percent to 50 percent of
the household food allowance on their ability to complete the
challenge. If they succeed, life gets a little easier, but if they
fail, that portion of the allowance is taken away.
</P>
<P>
   How are residents booted out of the house?
</P>
<P>
   Each day houseguests must check in at the Red Room, a soundproof
chamber in which they can talk one-on-one with a producer (via
camera and microphones only, of course) about whatever is on their
minds. This is where they will vent about who annoys them the most,
confess to an attraction or, if necessary, ask to leave the house
(and forfeit their chance at the $500,000 top prize).
</P>
<P>
   Here they also will submit their nominations for who should be
``marked'' for ejection. The names of the two most frequently
mentioned nominees will be presented to viewers, who may call a 900
number during the following week to decide which one is banished.
Every other Thursday the unlucky person will be notified during a
live (in the East) telecast and will be brought to a stage to talk,
under the glaring lights and yet more intrusive cameras, about the
humiliation of being kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Then he or she will hit the talk-show circuit, make a book deal
and negotiate for casting approval on the made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   When and where do I watch?
</P>
<P>
   CBS has five nights of ``Big Brother'' programming on its
regular schedule. On Mondays and Tuesdays the shows will feature
highlights of what occurred in the house on Sundays and Mondays.
Thursdays will feature a one-hour live program hosted by Julie
Chen, news anchor of CBS's ``The Early Show,'' with an audience
made up of friends and relatives of houseguests as well as behavior
experts and other interested observers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's show will cover highlights from Thursday, and
Saturday's program will recap the week and show what happened on
Friday. Online there is 24/7 coverage available through the AOL
keyword Big Brother or on the Web at www.bigbrother2000.com. Both
sites are coordinated by AOL, but the AOL site will include some
exclusive content for its subscribers, such as live chats with the
recently banished contestants.

NEW SHOW PROMISES REAL LIFE DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Moving in the ``a'' national news file, the ``e'' entertainment
news file and in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tonight, 10 strangers will enter a two-bedroom,
one-bathroom house to begin an 89-day living experiment, cut off
from the outside world but in plain sight of millions of TV viewers
thanks to 28 cameras and 60 microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Now what everybody really wants to know, on the eve Wednesday's
premiere of the much-talked-about KCBS-TV (Channel 2) reality show
``Big Brother,'' are the particulars -- such as what will be
recorded in the bathroom, what will the contestants be forbidden to
bring into the house and how will they eliminate housemates. We're
here to help.
</P>
<P>
   What's the house look like?
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a prefabricated structure assembled in a parking
lot deep inside the CBS Studio Center lot on Radford Drive in
Studio City. The interior living space covers 1,800 square feet,
with two cramped bedrooms sleeping five each; a bathroom with a
pedestal sink, a shower stall and a more private toilet chamber; a
kitchen with a double sink, refrigerator and electric stove; a
dining room table for 10; a living room with three couches and a
coffee table; a storage room; and the Red Room with a single chair.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the building is dedicated to the making of the show,
with camera bays, control rooms and other crew work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they go for fresh air?
</P>
<P>
   The living room and kitchen have windows and a door to a
courtyard measuring about 49 by 68 feet. It has a patio, new sod, a
vegetable patch, free weights, an umbrella table with four chairs
and a very small pool with the ``Big Brother'' logo painted on the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Where will they get their food?
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable garden, already thriving, includes corn, tomatoes,
zucchini, radishes, lettuce, peppers, herbs and a very dainty lemon
tree (from which not much should be expected). There is a coop
housing seven Rhode Island red hens, each expected to lay five eggs
per week for a ration of 3.5 eggs per person while the household
remains full.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions will be ordered weekly from a budget of $5 per
day per head to be spent as they decide collectively. Beer and wine
are for sale in Big Brother's grocery, but, the producers note,
with money that tight, no one will be getting drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The allowance pool drops each time a resident is voted out of
the house, but the garden produce and the eggs will be stable
supplies, so look for the biggest eaters to be among the first to
go. And don't fear for the chickens -- there's to be no
neck-wringing or feather-plucking.
</P>
<P>
   What can they bring with them?
</P>
<P>
   Each houseguest is provided two suitcases, one for clothes,
shoes and toiletries and the other for other personal items: family
photos, books, wine, cigarettes, even condoms, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Each person is allowed only one container each of toothpaste,
face cream, shaving cream, shampoo, soap and hair spray or gel.
They are allowed to bring instruments, which could make for some
charming after-dinner musicales -- or a karaoke twilight zone for
those who don't like to sing along.
</P>
<P>
   What CAN'T they bring with them?
</P>
<P>
   Electronic devices, cellular phones, pens, paper, diaries,
calendars, narcotics, hard liquor, weapons and pencil-shaped
makeup. The idea is not to prevent residents from preparing books
about their experiences, but to ensure they keep interacting with
the others as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   All those cameras and microphones -- does that mean nudity and
profanity on network television?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, to the relief of many and the disappointment
of some. CBS and its Internet partner, America Online, insist the
``Big Brother'' telecasts will meet the same standards as other
programming.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are cameras and microphones positioned to cover
every angle of the space, but producers say they are there for the
protection of the residents and to prevent secret meetings from
taking place.

MORE BEES ABUZZ IS A BOOST FOR FARMERS AND GARDENERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY BILL GRAHAM, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a honeybee revival going on this summer, and that's
sweet news to farmers and gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Parasitic mites decimated America's wild honeybees during the
past decade and damaged hive populations maintained by beekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   That was a hit on an insect that contributes $10 billion in crop
pollination value annually in the United States and creates a $150
million honey harvest, said Ray Nabors, state apiculture
(beekeeping) specialist for the University of Missouri system.
</P>
<P>
   But bees in the Kansas City region _ with help from beekeepers
and mild weather _ are making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually seen more swarms of bees in Missouri this year
than we saw during the entire decade in the '90s,'' Nabors said.
</P>
<P>
   A bee swarm occurs when a hive gets crowded. The queen bee,
which can lay an egg a minute around the clock, leaves the hive and
some bees follow. When the queen alights on a limb, thousands of
bees swarm over her in a hanging mass while scout bees search for a
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial beekeepers try to avoid swarms with hive management.
</P>
<P>
   But wild bees or bees from untended hobby hives will swarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did see an increase in swarms in our area,'' said Kenny
Bunting, owner of Osage Honey Farm near Sibley in Jackson County.
``I'm hoping we're finally starting to bounce back from the
mites.''
</P>
<P>
   Swarming bees are unlikely to sting unless provoked, Nabors
said. They're so full of honey it's painful for them to bend their
abdomen to use the stinger.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Burgess, a Kansas City area entomologist for the Missouri
Department of Agriculture, said he has received many calls asking
how to handle swarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just good news that the bees are back. I've seen lots of
bees working the nectar plants like white clover. It helps our
orchards and gardens. It's definitely a good sign,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Many farm crops such as soybeans can self-pollinate, Nabors
said. But honeybees can boost pollination in crop fields, raising
yields and thus profits.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether the bee boost is temporary or the
start of a long-range rebound.
</P>
<P>
   A warm winter and mild spring helped bee colonies build
populations early, Nabors said. Less rain and more sunny days gave
them more time to make honey and propagate.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range future depends on how the bees and beekeepers
battle the parasitic mites. One is microscopic and an internal
parasite, while the other is pinhead size and attaches externally.
</P>
<P>
   Honeybees were brought to America from Europe beginning in the
1600s. Pioneers kept bees for honey and some escaped to form wild
honeybee colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But the European bees were not adapted to fend off the two
bee-killing mites that arrived from Asia. Those mites were on bees
introduced to South America in the 1950s and they migrated to North
America, Nabors said.
</P>
<P>
   Wild honeybee colonies in Missouri were eliminated by the mites
in the 1990s, he said. Beekeepers suffered losses, and only those
who treated hives with mite control pesticides kept domestic
colonies going.
</P>
<P>
   The hives are only treated during winter months when honey is
not produced, so no mite control agents are present in commercial
honey.
</P>
<P>
   Many of this year's swarms probably came from well-tended
domestic hives with some help from the weather, said Roger Nichols
of Raytown, president of the Midwestern Beekeepers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because of the work beekeepers have been doing,''
Nichols said. ``Beekeepers are not losing their bees to the
mites.''
</P>
<P>
   Both wild and tame bees are needed, and Nabors is working on
mite controls that can help both.
</P>
<P>
   He helped design a screen and pollen trap for tended hives that
keeps external mites off bees. Apiculture experts also are
experimenting with organic mite control chemicals such as formic
acid, which is naturally produced by bees and wasps. A chemical
by-product from chrysanthemum flowers that kills mites shows
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Apiculturists also are breeding bee strains resistant to mites.
Some strains have been developed with healthy habits; the bees will
groom mites off their bodies and remove infected larvae from the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically good housekeeping,'' Nabors said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to keep domestic beekeeping productive and restore
beneficial wild honeybee populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin to control mites, we'll have more swarms out and
begin to replace all the feral bees we lost in the last 20 years,''
Nabors said.  &QL;

HIGHER OIL PRICES LEAD TO MORE DRILLING IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE EVERLY, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in years, drilling for oil in Kansas is on
the upswing, and credit is being given to higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Geological Survey said that 19 oil rigs were drilling
for oil in the state, compared with three rigs when oil prices
reached their lows in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling in the state practically disappeared as oil prices
dropped below $10 per barrel in early 1999. Generally, $15 is
considered a break-even price in the state. And now with oil prices
hovering above $30, the incentives are back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher crude prices have led to more exploration activity, and
that's a positive thing,'' said Tim Carr, a geologist for the
Kansas Geological Survey, which is part of the University of Kansas
in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices are a politically sensitive issue, with some
consumers complaining that oil companies are price-gouging. But
what's happening in Kansas is an example of another side to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said the below-$15 oil prices had hurt exploration for oil
in the state. One problem now with the renewed interest in drilling
is finding experienced crews to do the drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices ``decimated the infrastructure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams, a geologist for the Kansas Corporation
Commission, agreed that there was a shortage of crews.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas produces more energy _ oil and gas _ than it uses. But
depending on older oil and gas fields without new drilling had put
that position at risk. Kansas oil production, much of which occurs
in the western part of the state, totaled 34 million barrels in
1999, down 8 percent from the previous year, according to the
Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said higher prices made it easier to keep open wells that
produced less than five barrels a day _ the production of most
Kansas wells.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes it easier to get the financing to drill wells and
to try new technologies that can boost production.
</P>
<P>
   For example, horizontal drilling allows a rig to drill sideways
once it hits a formation containing oil. The process produces
additional oil, but it costs twice as much as traditional wells.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique is injecting carbon dioxide to force out
additional oil. There's now a pilot project in Russell County to
test the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``With prices at these levels, alternatives like carbon dioxide
flooding become much more attractive,'' Carr said.

U.S., MEXICO COULD BENEFIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG  
 and CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After Sunday's historic change south of the
border, both Mexico and California could experience monumental
economic changes, a majority of economists and politicians
forecasted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is one more step in Mexico's maturing as a
vibrant democracy,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills.
``It's great news, not because of who won or who lost, but because
the election was held without substantial reports of irregularities
or fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, a member of the House International Relations Committee,
credited the leadership of outgoing Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo. He noted that Zedillo ordered open primary elections to
choose his successor and also allowed international observers,
including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, to monitor Mexico's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Isaacson, a managing principal with the Los Angeles-based
international investment firm of Payden and Rygel, said the
election of National Action Party (PAN) nominee Vicente Fox was a
``historic'' event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very significant change that approaches the
significance of the falling of the Berlin Wall,'' said Isaacson,
who traveled to Mexico just before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory was the first presidential defeat for the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in 71 years. The former
Coca-Cola executive will take office in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is surprising is the margin of victory,'' said Isaacson.
``If the contest had been closer, there would have been anxiety on
the world markets that the race would have been contested, sending
the Mexican economy downward.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that with such a large margin of victory, the Mexican
economy should avert a repeat of the declines that have frequently
occurred after a change in administration, even though the ruling
party, the PRI, has not changed in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Zedillo as well as both candidates have done a
good job at getting the word out to foreign investors that the
process of change will be smooth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has the second-largest economy in Latin America behind
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a new administration and a stable economy, hopefully they
will be able to move to a more free market-style economy,'' said
Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A prosperous economy will mean continued good news for
California exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   California exports to Mexico continue to be driven by shipments
of electronics and electrical equipment and industrial machinery
and computer equipment. In the first quarter of this year, exports
in these two sectors totaled $2.2 billion, or 52 percent, of total
state exports to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by the California Trade and
Commerce Agency in Sacramento, California exports to Mexico in the
first six years of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
have increased nearly 129 percent or $8.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, California exports to Mexico directly and indirectly
support approximately 179,000 jobs in California, with more than
100,000 of these jobs resulting from export growth under NAFTA, the
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question NAFTA has meant a tremendous amount for
Mexico,'' said Isaacson. ``However, Fox has made it very clear that
they'll have to spread the wealth of NAFTA throughout the society
for continued economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said NAFTA has also helped increase exports in agriculture
and transportation equipment to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can have true economic reform that would allow the
benefits of growth to be felt by everyone, major problems,
including immigration, tax reform and education, would begin to be
solved,'' said Isaacson.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser, however, warned that since the new administration doesn't
take office until December, it will be at least five years before
any major changes are seen in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican government has to eliminate the problems of
corruption and crime,'' he said. ``If they can develop a middle
class in Mexico, it will have an impact on illegal immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are those who remain skeptical that a new
political party and president will bring about significant change
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see a big difference between the two parties in
Mexico,'' said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills. ``But getting
some new blood into Mexico City could reduce corruption and the
drug trade. These may be the most significant elections this year,
other than our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong interest in the prosperity of Mexico,'' added
Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof that Mexico needs a new government is evidenced by
the thousands of Mexicans who are leaving their country for the
U.S.,'' he said. ``Our economy values their skills and they can
earn $8 to $10 an hour. In Mexico, the system pays those people $2
a day for the same work.''

MEXICO CONFRONTS SHOCK WAVE OF CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  MEXICO CITY _ The nation awoke to a new era Monday as Mexicans
of all political persuasions tried to make sense of the changes in
store after the historic defeat of Mexico's ruling party.
<P>
   Although President-elect Vicente Fox reached out to the defeated
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), repeating earlier pledges
that the end of its 71-year rule does not mark oblivion for its
members, many wondered whether the PRI would survive.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the PRI will mean wrenching changes throughout
Mexican society as the regime that has exercised enormous control
enters its final months before Fox's inauguration on December 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a portent of the PRI's impending dire straits _ the end of
its generous under-the-table federal government subsidies _ the
party began making layoffs Monday in the central bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unclear how the PRI will survive in the future,'' said
political analyst Sergio Sarmiento. ``The PRI is not organized
around an ideology but around the capacity of maintaining itself in
power. Without power, it will lose its coherence on a national
level.''
</P>
<P>
   For many millions of Mexicans, the PRI is not just a party _ it
is their sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   After Fox takes office December 1, farmers will no longer go to
the PRI to solve their problems, and an army of bureaucrats will no
longer migrate between the PRI's massive headquarters in Mexico
City and federal and state bureaucracies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   PRI-controlled labor unions that for 65 years have been
subservient to the government must suddenly fend for themselves.
Leonardo Rodriguez Alcaine, a conservative, old-guard labor leader
who leads the Confederation of Mexican Workers, a 2 million-member
PRI union that is widely viewed as corrupt, quickly backtracked
Monday from his campaign threats to call a nationwide strike if Fox
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I merely meant to draw a line in the sand,'' he said. ``I just
want Fox to take into consideration the interests of the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox never made clear exactly what would
replace the PRI machine. His stands on the issues were generally
middle-of-the-road, avoiding the conservative ideology of his
National Action Party (PAN). Many of his policy proposals were
hardly different from those of Francisco Labastida, the PRI
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday's developments failed to give a clear indication of
Mexico's future, they at least gave Mexicans a better idea about
what had just happened:
</P>
<P>
   -- READING THE POLLS _ As election results and detailed
exit-poll information became available Monday, it was clear that
millions of young voters had swung toward Fox out of a vague desire
to simply get rid of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Fox voters said their main reason for supporting
him was the desire for change, while 28 percent primarily were
drawn to the candidate and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   According to an exit survey conducted at voting stations by the
Reforma newspaper chain, Fox's voters were overwhelmingly young and
well-educated, either private-sector workers or students.
Labastida's voters, on the other hand, were concentrated among the
elderly, those with little schooling, housewives and those who
voted out of mere loyalty to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox even seems to have dented the PRI's traditional stronghold
in rural Mexico, where the ruling party's support fell below 50
percent for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's voting results proved that public opinion polls carried
out before the election had lied _ or perhaps the people who
participated had. Most of the polls conducted in the weeks before
Sunday's vote indicated that Labastida would win by a margin of
several points. Fox's 7-point margin of victory led many analysts
to conclude that some poll participants felt afraid to tell their
questioners their real opinions. Only in the curtained voting
booth, the analysts surmised, did people feel protected enough from
the PRI's coercive party machinery to vent their anti-PRI feelings.
</P>
<P>
   -- PRI'S DIGNITY _ The ruling party came out defeated but with
its head held high. Labastida and President Ernesto Zedillo earned
the surprised respect of many Mexicans and foreign observers by
immediately admitting the PRI's defeat as soon as initial results
were released Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, Fox lauded Zedillo _ whom he had never praised
before, to anyone's memory _ for his ``honor and democratic
maturity.'' Fox himself made a gracious victory speech, pledging to
name members of the PRI and the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution (PRD) to his Cabinet. At his victory rally, when
supporters broke into spontaneous chants of ``The PRI is going to
hell,'' Fox scolded them: ``We agreed to bid it farewell with
happiness, without rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's newfound respect may not save it from internal
divisions and witch hunts, however. Some party officials bitterly
criticized Zedillo and Labastida, saying that the leadership's
democratic reforms should be reversed and the PRI should return to
its old-fashioned, populist ways.
</P>
<P>
   -- DEMOCRACY AT LAST _ International observers heaped praise on
all sides in the elections and said that with reforms instituted in
recent years _ a freer press, fairer campaign rules and a new
voting system to combat fraud _ Mexico now can be considered a
full-fledged member of the democratic community of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who led an observer
delegation, was especially effusive, calling the election ``a
historic turning point of the most profound significance for all
who love freedom and democracy in Mexico and throughout this
hemisphere and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The smoothness and fairness of Sunday's election was a welcome
development for the Clinton administration, which had worried that
post-election cries of fraud would create instability in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   American politicians and officials fell over themselves Monday
with compliments for Mexico's new leader. President Clinton phoned
Fox to congratulate him, and Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush offered their congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House drug control
office, called Fox ``enormously determined'' to stop narcotics
trafficking and ``extremely smart, dedicated and bold,'' and added
that Fox is ``determined not to turn Mexico over to the
narcotraffickers.''

 STRONG BONES LINKED TO TEEN EXERCISE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study has found that hip bone density in adult women is
affected by how much daily exercise they got during their teenage
years, while high calcium intake seems to make little difference.
</P>
<P>
   The research suggests that teenagers who engage in some form of
weight-bearing exercise nearly every day stand a much better chance
than sedentary youth of avoiding osteoporosis and fractures later
in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean you have to be on the soccer team or that you
have to go out and become a gold medalist in field hockey,'' said
Tom Lloyd of Pennsylvania State University, co-author of the new
study. ``It means 25 minutes of walking around the block.''
</P>
<P>
   The study appeared Monday in Pediatrics, the medical journal of
the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence is a critical period for bone health because the
average woman gains 40 to 50 percent of her skeletal mass during
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Height and weight, not diet or exercise, are the main factors
determining total body bone-mineral content. But the researchers
focused special attention on the amount of bone material measured
at the hip _ a common site of debilitating fractures in older women
with osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year study was based on evaluations of 81 girls enrolled
in a continuing young-women's health study at Penn State. The girls
all were within about six months of their 12th birthday when the
study began.
</P>
<P>
   Dietary records were collected at regular intervals until the
girls turned 18. Participants were part of a separate,
well-controlled study of calcium supplementation, which allowed the
researchers to track calcium intake closely by counting pills and
the like. The amount of sports activity was determined by
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with other studies, the research found no evidence
that daily calcium intake above 900 milligrams _ roughly two
glasses of milk _ has any lasting effect on bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a ``biologically important'' link between bone
mass at the hip and regular exercise. All told, exercise by itself
was significant enough to explain 18 percent of the variance in hip
density among the young women in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said further studies are under way that point to
beneficial structural changes from exercise, changes that seem to
augment density gains as insurance against fracture risk later in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at bones as you would a truss or a support
timber,'' Lloyd said. ``We're just beginning to focus more
intensely on what bone strength is really all about.''

 GUIDELINES CREATED FOR `INTERSEX' BABIES  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confronting some of the most highly charged issues in child
development, the nation's leading group of pediatricians issued its
first-ever guidelines Monday for treatment of newborns with
ambiguous genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the American Academy of Pediatrics called the birth
of such a child a ``social emergency'' that demands a circumspect
approach and specialized medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Profound harm can be done if doctors and nurses use dehumanizing
language or assign a gender to an ``intersexual'' child too soon,
the doctors group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because words spoken in the delivery room may have a lasting
impact on parents and their relationship with their infant, it is
important that no attempt be made to suggest a diagnosis or offer a
gender assignment,'' the report cautioned. ``The infant should be
referred to as `your baby' or `your child' _ not `it,' `he' or
`she.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The report was written by a committee of medical experts
including pediatric endocrinologists, urologists and geneticists.
It appears in this month's issue of Pediatrics, a medical journal
published by the 55,000-member pediatrics academy.
</P>
<P>
   The report reflects a deep rethinking under way in the medical
community toward issues of physical appearances and gender
identity. Those issues can become most difficult in cases of
genital anomalies, which can result from various genetic and
hormonal causes. Diagnoses include testicular feminization,
cliteromegaly, micropenis, Klinefelter syndrome and adrenal
hyperplasia.
</P>
<P>
   According to many estimates, 1 out of every 2,000 or 3,000
infants is born with ambiguous genitalia _ which adds up to at
least a couple thousand babies in the United States a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical experts and patient advocates call for an immediate
halt to early surgeries to ``correct'' an anomalous appearance,
preferring to let the child make up his or her own mind at an
appropriate age.
</P>
<P>
   The new report stopped short of any such sweeping
recommendations, suggesting instead a step-by-step approach to
individualized diagnosis, starting with careful physical
examination, laboratory studies and sensitive discussion with
parents. In most cases, the report notes, intersexual children and
their families will need specialized care and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The pronouncement comes with strong warnings against using words
or taking actions that might tend to foreclose medical options for
the family _ or stigmatize children who don't fit the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make comments without a lot of thought sometimes,''
said Dr. Christopher Cunniff, a geneticist at the University of
Arizona who, as chair of the pediatrics academy's genetics
committee, was a co-author of the report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens all the time in the medical field. We get somewhat
inured to some of the difficult things that might be going on, and
we can sometimes lose sight of the human level.''
</P>
<P>
   For most family practitioners and delivery room personnel,
Cunniff noted, cases of severe genital anomalies are so rare that
``people don't have a frame of reference, or they say things they
shouldn't out of discomfort. Here, we're trying to give people a
vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the medical community is still debating the
appropriate standard of care, goaded in part by vocal demands of
some intersexual or transgendered adults who view surgery, unless
chosen by the individual, as a form of genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   An organization called the Intersex Society of North America,
for example, demands ``a world free of shame, secrecy and unwanted
surgery'' for people whose anatomy merely ``differs from cultural
ideals of male and female.'' The group's Web site is at
 &UR; isna.org. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also received attention through the recent
appearance of the book, ``As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was
Raised as a Girl,'' by John Colapinto (HarperCollins, 2000), about
the case of a child's failed surgical transformation.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, Cunniff acknowledged that ``the status quo
is unsettled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of issues have been going on during the last three or
four years that have highlighted the need to bring some information
about this to the general pediatric community,'' he said. ``This is
a controversial subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, parents of children with ambiguous genitalia
would be urged to choose the child's gender as quickly as possible,
and to have them undergo surgery as appropriate. Now, research
suggests that a child's identity may not be so easily manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be an idea that gender is somewhat malleable,''
Cunniff said. ``With the right hormones, a certain style of
dressing and hair, the idea was that one could relatively easily
reassign gender with minimal disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been challenged on a number of fronts, Cunniff
acknowledged, which prompted the doctors group to conduct the
formal inquiry that led to Monday's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concepts of `male' and `female' may be a little different
as we understand them now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Chase, founder of the Intersex Society, said the new
report does not go far enough in condemning early surgery. But she
welcomed the message that premature attempts at gender-assignment
can lead to family discord and a lifetime of harrowing
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   The key problem, she said, occurs when people decide that
``sexual ambiguity is shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened in her own case, Chase said, recalling a confused
childhood when she looked like a girl but felt like a boy,
following mysterious operations she said were never explained to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to avoid assigning a sex until you can decide
what sex to assign,'' she said, adding that before a surgical
option is taken, ``the child has to be old enough to understand
what the trade-offs are.''

one of the few remaining copies of the Declaration from the limited
first printing.
</P>
<P>
   Lear will probably send the document out to his writers, ask 'em
to punch it up a little. King George III will be referred to as
``Meathead.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DECLARATION of Independence is the greatest pink slip in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Wig Boy: You are so fired as our king, effective
immediately, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Your severance check is in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Should you wish to appeal your severence to the union grievance
committee, please do so immediately, because we could use a good
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   We've got your grievance committee right here.
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON and the boys get all the credit for the Declaration,
but they couldn't have done it without George III.
</P>
<P>
   Had the king been merely heavy-handed and tyrannical, the
colonists probably would have endured British rule forever,
bitching and moaning about stamp taxes but going along with the
program.
</P>
<P>
   But no, George squeezed and squeezed until the founding fathers
cried out, ``R-e-s-p-e-c-t, find out what it means to we.''
</P>
<P>
   George III wrote the handbook on how to lose colonies. It is
believed that he was the inspiration for the term ``royal pain in
the butt.'' John Malkovich would make a great George III.
</P>
<P>
   NOT THAT any of the Georges were a bargain. George I was
obstinate and lazy. George II was stubborn and stupid. George W was
a below-average student and a party boy. ... No, wait, George W. is
from a different royal family of Georges.
</P>
<P>
   George III, in keeping with the family tradition, was a few
raisins short of a scone. He suffered from a mental disease that
made him emotionally unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God for that.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists needed a big push to take the huge leap they took.
This was no bungee jump.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody but a world-class control freak and power tripper like
George III could have provided the inspiration for these gentlemen
to pledge ``our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor, not that
you would know diddly about sacred Honor, That last part was added
by Norman Lear's writers.
</P>
<P>
   HAD WE HUNG in there under British rule, this would have been a
duller country.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July, instead of being a day for fireworks and
wonderful parades and barbecued chicken, would simply be the date
when our British income taxes are due.
</P>
<P>
   If we were still attached to Britain like a swollen polyp, our
judges, instead of Marv Albert and Sam Donaldson, would wear funny
wigs. Our cars would break down every week, whether we drove 'em or
not.
</P>
<P>
   INSTEAD OF getting excited about the baseball pennant races,
right now we would be checking out ESPN for the highlights of the
American and National cricket leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket is like baseball, but without baseball's dizzying pace.
In cricket, both teams wear the same uniform, which kills the
merchandising industry. If a kid wants to show support for his
beloved Tottenham Teaslurpers, he wears a plain white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket players don't even have numbers on their shirts. They
probably don't even have agents or shoe contracts or groupies.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids would be playing Little League polo, and we parents
would be on the sidelines exhorting junior to ``Swing the damn
mallet!'' And the kid would be whining, how can we expect him to
make the big leagues riding this sway-backed pony?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hundreds of crazed Laker fans rampaging through the
streets, we'd have thousands of soccer hooligans rampaging through
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT A colossal mismatch: Jefferson and Ben Franklin and the
Boys vs. George III.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson invented the french fry. Jefferson, bless his heart,
said if he had to choose between a government without newspapers
and newspapers without a government, he'd go with ``B,'' and that
was before Doonesbury.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a parade today, eat watermelon and apple pie and chicken,
even though Jefferson said, ``We never repent of having eaten too
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Wave a flag. Happy birthday to us.

Comets' Cooper to retire at season's end
<TEXT>
<P>
   By W.H. STICKNEY JR.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Less than happy with her diminished role in the
Comets' offense, three-time WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player
Cynthia Cooper said Monday night that she will retire at the end of
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last year in the league,'' Cooper said. ``I will
retire after this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With different things that have happened this year, and
obviously last year, just the things that are going on now, I think
it's time for me to move on. I know it's going to make a lot of
people happy that I'm, to use a cliche, passing the torch. It's
just time for me to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the WNBA's two oldest players, Cooper, 37, has reigned as
the league's scoring champion in each of its previous three seasons
and was the regular-season Most Valuable Player in 1997 and '98. In
this year's season opener, she became the first player in the
league to reach 2,000 career points.
</P>
<P>
   But the past 21 months have been among the toughest for Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, her mother died after a long fight with breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   During the four months prior to that, Cooper was involved in a
late-night auto accident that caused nearly $30,000 in damages to
her Mercedes-Benz convertible, and one of her two homes in Sugar
Land burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And while coping with those traumas, Cooper learned that her
best friend and Comets teammate, Kim Perrot, had lung and brain
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 19, Perrot died at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center with
her mother, several family members and Cooper at her bedside. Two
weeks later, the Comets won their third WNBA championship, a
tribute Cooper had hoped she and the team could give Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   Once the season was over, Cooper dropped out of the spotlight.
Although invited to be on the United States women's national
basketball team competing in the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, she chose to use the offseason as a time to get her life
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper reported for Comets training camp in early May bearing a
temperament closer to the one she brought along over the WNBA's
first two years. But in camp, she became increasingly disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Janeth
Arcain as more potent weapons than ever before, Cooper felt her
role with the Comets was beginning to get altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've thought about (retirement) since preseason,''
Cooper said. ``I made the decision after we went to Seattle (for
the third game of the regular season).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who is close to me told me to think about it, think
about it, think about it before I made an announcement. So I've
thought about it, and I've made the decision. Now, I'm making the
announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Cooper makes good on the retirement vow, it will bring
to an end a 15-year professional career that began shortly after
she came out of Southern Cal as an unheralded member of a two-time
NCAA championship team featuring Hall of Famer Cheryl Miller.
</P>
<P>
   During 11 years of pro ball overseas, primarily in Italy, Cooper
established herself as one of the world's premier offensive players
and one who Comets coach Van Chancellor says has talents unique to
the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind,'' Chancellor has said,
``Cynthia is the greatest player in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But news of Cooper's intentions caught Chancellor by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much a shocker,'' he said. ``If this is true,
it will be a loss for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see us lose one of the top five people who have
ever played this game. She's a player _ there's just nobody who's
played this game that makes plays any better than Cynthia Cooper.
She can create for herself, but she's better than anyone else at
creating for her teammates, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said he hasn't considered how Cooper's announcement
will affect the Comets, now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really caught me off-guard. I'd really have to think
about that,'' he said. ``I don't know what it will do to us right
now. I haven't thought about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always in the future, any time you lose a great player, I
think it's a tremendous loss. It's a compensation we'll have to
find some way to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper heads up a number of companies and organizations that are
involved with activities ranging from providing literary enrichment
for the underprivileged to building structures in impoverished
areas of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she'll do after entering retirement, Cooper said,
``I'll always be around basketball. I really want to get into (TV)
broadcasting, begin a career in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to coach,'' she said. ``I want to start coaching
in the NBA, as an assistant, get my feet wet, get some experience
there and then move on, try something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper discounted the possibility of being traded, or after
entering retirement, returning to play for another WNBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot more basketball in me, but I'm not
happy,'' she said. ``And I'm not going to play for another team.
Houston is where I started. This is where I want to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love (Comets/Rockets owner) Les Alexander and (his wife)
Nanci, everything they've done for the Comets and the WNBA. They've
been wonderful, even with Kim's family. They've just been awesome.
The Lord couldn't have blessed me with a better organization to
play for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 115,000 percent happy that I fell in Houston and started
playing for the Comets,'' added Cooper, who was born in Chicago and
raised in Los Angeles. ``Obviously, this is bittersweet. The bitter
part is I have a lot of basketball left in me; I'm still on top of
my game. But the sweet part is this is something new I'm getting
ready to embark on. It's special, and I'm excited about it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Conn. _ Mike Meehan, a geologist who once explored for
coal in the Appalachian Mountains, is supervising a crew of four
men and a canary yellow backhoe, clawing away at the cliffs of the
country's only operating brownstone quarry, trying to fill the
orders that come pouring in every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those chunks with the CU on 'em?'' he asked, pointing to
some big rocks the color of fudge and the size of a Doberman's
doghouse. ``They're for the Cooper Union in New York City. And
those over there are going to the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul
in Providence, and that's a stoop going to Yale. Those pieces there
are for the cornice trim on a new house going up in the Farmington
Valley.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brownstone is back. That somber yet elegant cloak for more than
50,000 row houses, from Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the
so-called Brown Decades of the mid-19th century, then reviled by
the century's turn, when gleaming white limestone and marble
captivated the public.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six decades, Portland's quarries _ which produced
an estimated 80 percent of New York City's brownstone _ have been
largely forgotten by the outside world. Already moribund by the
start of the Great Depression, they filled with water after the
flood of 1936 and the hurricane of 1938, were discovered by
teen-agers as a make-out spot and were adopted by fishermen who
stealthily hunt big bass near the towering brownstone cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   But preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new
future for the formidable stone. Architects have started using it
to give a touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments like the Cooper Union on Astor Place in Manhattan, where
Abraham Lincoln addressed crowds before the 1860 election. On May
16, the Department of the Interior gave three quarries in Portland
status as a national historic landmark, recognizing a role that
dates to colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   But just as this Connecticut River town in the center of the
state sponsors brainstorming sessions on how to lure visitors to
its first would-be tourist attraction, the two defunct quarries,
the re-opening of the third Portland quarry has set off a debate on
whether brownstone should be used at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because the terrible secret is that brownstone _ ``the very
blood and fiber of New York City,'' in the words of Vincent Scully,
a professor emeritus at Yale University _ is not really much good
as a building material. The same quality that gives brownstone its
charm, making it easy to quarry and easy to carve, also makes it
exquisitely vulnerable to harsh weather and the passage of time,
especially if the stone is installed improperly and is maintained
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, built
in 1848 from Portland stone, its preservation architect, John
Mesick, said, ``you can take your hand and pull off chunks as big
as apple pies.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, many of the most magnificent
brownstone houses, the ones that date from the Civil War era, are
in danger of losing their sweeping balustraded staircases and their
entire facades. At the National Arts Club, in Gramercy Park in
Manhattan, the brownstone, like a chocolate bar left on the
dashboard on a summer day, just seemed to melt.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Herrera, director of technical services at the New York
Landmarks Conservancy, said that the brownstone veneer on the
facades on some of the houses began to fall off a few years after
they were built. ``Historical records state that some started
deteriorating 10, 20, 30 years later,'' he said. ``Brownstone is
not a consistent material: some of it is OK, and some is perfectly
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is building all-new brownstone houses; the
architect Philip Johnson was the last to use it in a major way, for
the Bobst Library at New York University back in the 1960s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is brownstone repair and replacement that is being
debated in classrooms, at special seminars and landmark
commissions. Should the real brownstone be used, or a cheap ``cut
and cover'' brown stucco coating favored by contractors?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very controversial subject right now,'' said Paul
Byard, dean of Columbia University's preservation program, and the
architect for the Cooper Union's $12 million brownstone
restoration, the largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Byard has chosen Portland brownstone, which he says is authentic
and should last for at least six decades if maintained, and the
joints kept properly full of mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Mesick says he will not use it on the Albany Cathedral and is
combing the Ruhr Valley in Germany and southern Scotland for
brownstone that doesn't spall, or flake off, the way he says the
Connecticut stone does. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is even a long-running debate on whether it is
aesthetically pleasing. While many still find the stone beautiful,
Edith Wharton could not stand the stuff. In a memoir published four
years before the Portland quarries shut down, she told of her
childhood return to New York from Europe, her writer's voice
dripping with disappointment at ``this low-studded rectangular New
York, cursed with its universal chocolate-colored coating of the
most hideous stone ever quarried.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The brownstone of the Portland quarries was formed roughly 200
million years ago, when Connecticut was a hot and humid savanna,
with a major rainy season that created streams and rivers that
eroded the Paleozoic rocks of the Eastern Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the rains tapered off, the dinosaurs lumbered through,
leaving their footprints in the mud _ footprints that are still
being uncovered by Meehan's crew at the quarry, who spend part of
their time each day showing off the prints to schoolchildren and
other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The streams left deposits of mudstone, shale and sand. This
sediment, composed of quartz, mica and feldspar, became
brownstone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The English first settled Portland in the 1600s, using the
reddish-brown stone _ far easier to carve than granite _ for
gravestones. During the 1700s, the town operated one of the
quarries and offered the stone free to its inhabitants. By the
mid-19th century, the quarries were controlled by three main
companies, and they employed 1,500 workers, a third them Irish.
Over the years, the quarries sent more than 5 million cubic yards
of brownstone down the Connecticut River.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some blasting was involved, much of it just fell away from
the cliffs, not unlike the way it is now falling from facades.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lewis, a geologist who was in Portland for a recent
seminar on the quarries, said brownstone ``erodes very quickly,
it's very soft,'' adding, ``And if you build with the wrong layer,
it flakes off.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with so many of New York City's
brownstones _ they were built with the wrong layer.
</P>
<P>
   Everett H. Ortner, who in 1968 helped found the Brownstone
Revival Committee in New York City, said, ``In the beginning, they
selected the very best material.'' But with the speculative rush in
the post-Civil War years, the quality went downhill fast. ``Stone
had always been the material of the aristocracy, and wood or brick
that of the middle class,'' Ortner said. ``Suddenly the middle
class could have the permanence _ an impression of permanence that
wood never could have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brownstone heydey, quarries operated up and down the East
Coast, from Patterson, N.J., to Longmeadow. Mass., and beyond.
Portland's was the biggest, but alas, its stone was one of the
softest. Ten years ago, the Society for the Preservation of New
England Antiquities bluntly declared in a brochure on brownstone
care, ``Portland brownstone is notorious for its poor durability.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, the quarry owner, as well as the local town officials
here, dispute that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, 50, plans to ship 1,250 tons from his small quarry this
year, about $500,000 worth of stone. He just sent out 11 truckloads
of brownstone to add decorative accents to a 40,000-square-foot
house going up in Michigan. A new saw from Italy is on order,
designed to bore down into the rock after he has exhausted the
cliffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about brownstone's reputation as a fragile building
material, Edward L. Kalinowski, Portland's First Selectman, said
``I don't believe it.'' Kalinowski's grandfather worked in the
quarries until the mid-1930s, when a giant slab of rock crushed his
leg.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Portland stone did not last, he and others say,
was either because it was installed improperly, or because bad
stone was used.
</P>
<P>
   When the quarries were running at a normal pace, half of the
brownstone was thrown away, used for railway embankments or crushed
for gravel. But in the mid-1800s, the pressure was on to produce
more and more stone for building facades in America's major cities.
According to historians, Portland began shipping some substandard
material. ``In the brownstone heyday, the speculators didn't
care,'' said Alison Guinness, the curator of the Connecticut River
Museum and the author of a paper on the Portland quarry history.
``They just wanted it, and they slapped it up,''
</P>
<P>
   The brownstone was meant to be installed with its striations
facing out and the flat side facing up. Unfortunately, it was
easier, quicker and cheaper (and better looking, too) for the
builders to place it on the front of a building with its flat side
facing out. Meehan, the quarry owner, explained: ``It's like a
book; if you put it out in the rain with its spine facing up, the
water will run down the pages. If you lay it down flat, the water
won't get inside.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why there are so few gravestones left: they were stuck
in the ground with the flat side facing the front. The rain soaked
into the striations, and the stone fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, decaying stone was largely repaired by
chipping it off and applying a brown-colored stucco. How many row
houses have been treated this way? ``Are you kidding?'' Herrera
responded. ``Thousands.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the patches fade and change color, they begin to look like
camouflage. The stucco mixture also must be perfect, he said,
``otherwise, it's like chocolate pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, experts say, masonry contractors are persuading
some homeowners to chip away everything and replace the whole
facade with a stucco that includes cement, at a cost that can range
from $20,000 to $60,000, depending on the contractor. This
approach, which critics say lasts 20 years at the most, makes
preservationists tremble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially since they re-opened the Portland quarry, I like to
see real stone for replacement,'' said Ivan Myjer, a stone
conservator from Boston who directed the restoration at St. John
the Divine in New York City. Myjer, who hand-picked the stone for
the Cooper Union and is supervising its use, argues that real
brownstone can be installed for probably no more than $60,000 and
lasts longer than a concrete job, between 60 and 100 years, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the favored method in New York City is still concrete, even
for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Adami, a masonry contractor who specializes in brownstone
restoration, recently finished a brownstone-colored concrete job
and total renovation on Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn,
which he said cost over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's in the stock market _ he makes $300,000 a minute _
and he had his own face, his wife's face, his two daughter's faces
cast and put at the top of columns in front of his house,'' the
contractor said. ``Now that's a brownstone restoration job!''

MAYOR OF UTICA, N.Y., RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The colorful mayor of the chronically depressed upstate city of
Utica, N.Y., Edward A. Hanna, resigned Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hanna, 78, has been fending off allegations of sexual
harassment by four male city employees, he said in a statement that
the move was ``strictly a health decision,'' prompted by ``my
serious heart condition along with my age, the execution of and
stress in the regular routine as mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, whose efforts to rebuild Utica were often overshadowed by
the publicity he got for actions like calling the city ``a lousy
place to live,'' bolstered the contention that his decision to
resign was health-related by including a list of his daily
medications in his news release.
</P>
<P>
   He also stated that he had been having increasingly frequent
chest pains in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also attached a 1992 note from his cardiologist
stating that he had blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, a Democrat-turned-Republican who made a fortune off a
photo developer he perfected, governed Utica, an old factory town
of 64,000 along the Mohawk River 240 miles north of New York City,
from 1975 to 1977 and again from January 1996 until 11:59 Monday
night. He also served as city comptroller in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Under Utica's charter, the City Council president, Tim Julian,
now becomes mayor and a special election for mayor will be held in
November, The Utica Observer-Dispatch reported.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment accusations against Hanna, who has been
married for more than 50 years, came June 14 in notices of intent
to sue him and the city, according to the Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   The men contend that the mayor threatened their jobs if they
refused his sexual advances, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed by Hanna's former executive assistant,
23; a 24-year-old Parks Department employee; a 22-year-old former
development administrator; and a 35-year-old former executive
assistant with the city, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a fax to the Observer-Dispatch, Hanna called the accusations
``a scam, loaded with outrageous lies.'' The men's lawyer, Joseph
Policelli, countered by telling the Observer-Dispatch, ``People
don't blackmail people by claiming that they had homosexual
activities with somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna's statements and actions included the brash and the
mysterious. On one hand, he proposed closing down the city
government. On the other, he built a Tower of Hope next to City
Hall to honor Bob Hope, who has no particular connection to Utica.
</P>
<P>
   But he nurtured a reputation as a watchdog against fiscal
incompetence and corruption, and his many supporters credited him
with forcing Utica to confront its difficult situation. When the
city's bonds received the poorest rating of any city in the country
in 1996, the mayor opined, ``We got just what we deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna's resignation statement ended with an epitaph-like
sentiment: ``I would hope to be remembered as a mayor who had eyes
that could see what needed to be done and a heart that cared.''

<P>
   The news out of Mexico is almost unbelievable. For Mexicans and
for anyone else who has watched our problematic neighbor with an
uneasy mix of hope and horror, a different day has finally dawned.
</P>
<P>
   Que pasa, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   The world's longest ruling party has been driven out of power by
disgusted voters with long memories. In truth, the voters had
probably intended to do this at least twice before, in the
elections of 1988 and 1994, but electoral fraud most likely
postponed the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, in what may have been the first fair national
vote in years, Mexicans rejected the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, and its lackluster presidential contender, Francisco
Labastida. They turned to the longtime opposition National Action
Party, or PAN, and its more magnetic candidate, Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   What was supposed to be a squeaker, judging by the final public
opinion polls, turned into a landslide. Smashing, crushing,
seismic. Pick your adjective and rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   As always, however, celebration must be tempered with reality.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be easy for Fox to translate his victory into an
effective national government and to address Mexico's difficulties
and divisions. The biggest is economic disparity _ the issue that
the PRI swore for seven decades it would address but which it
quickly grew to exploit cynically to cement its hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has pledged to attempt to spread around the relatively good
times. Like much of his program, details were left vague. But to
make good on the promise, whatever it means, he will have to
carefully meld his innate belief in the free market with a program
that seeks to ensure that the prosperity that has come to many in
northern and central Mexico flows south and to the rural poor all
over the nation. Decades of PRI's economic mismanagement will not
make this any easier.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's problem will be complicated by cross-cutting political
pressures. Fox's constituency is the urban and northern middle
class who rightfully equated PRI with a government that did not
respond to their needs. These voters will want an even lighter hand
from the central government. The neediest are from PRI fiefdoms in
the south and the countryside and in the slums of Mexico City where
the Party of the Democratic Revolution and its also-ran
presidential contender Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the former mayor, are
popular.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had a dog in this fight. It was Fox _ and,
more broadly, the chance for fundamental change in Mexico that he
represents. Bureaucratic calcification in Mexico City and in many
of the state capitals, not to mention outright corruption, that has
grown up under the PRI made a charade of many cross-border
dealings, including the key issues of pollution, immigration, drugs
and crime.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the Clinton administration fully grasped
the importance of this Mexican election to our country. But at any
rate the White House and State Department thankfully kept quiet.
Ditto the Republicans on Capitol Hill who have been more vociferous
over the years in their denunciations of PRI shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his successor should move quickly to make
clear that the United States supports the basic outlines of a
reform agenda that Fox has put forward. We should assist as
requested in helping him flesh out those proposals and do nothing
to complicate his fulfilling them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the last time that Mexico and the United States briefly
had presidents-elect at the same time, then-Vice President George
Bush arranged an informal meeting with the incoming Mexican leader,
Carlos Salinas. That could be a useful model for the victor in the
U.S. election on Nov. 7 as Fox will not be sworn in until Dec. 1,
and it wouldn't hurt for the new leaders to accent the importance
of the two nations' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   With Fox, that cross-border tie could become steadier and even
more productive after seven decades of PRI regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, as President Porfirio Diaz continued his despotic rule,
a touring guide to Mexico quoted ``a patriotic Mexican writer'' as
saying: ``With the restless, inconstant character of our race, the
long tenure of office by one man is one of the greatest dangers of
the peace of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   After 71 years, one party proved to be just as bad. Goodbye and
good riddance.

<P>
   Of course it's distressing American college students, as a
recent survey proves, have little knowledge of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Distressing, but far from surprising.
</P>
<P>
   As an abundance of news leading up to this country's
Independence Day all-too-easily demonstrated, a huge majority of
U.S. citizens have not just forgotten their history, they have
little or no concept of the fantastic willingness of our historic
leaders to assume responsibility for themselves, their actions and
the nation which their beliefs led them to conceive and fight for.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most brutally obvious denial of responsibility came
Friday from President Clinton. He didn't even deign to respond
personally to the recommendation of an Arkansas Supreme Court
committee's suit contending Clinton should be stripped of his law
license for lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only reaction that came to the case against Clinton
came from his attorney, who announced, ``We ... will defend
vigorously against it.'' Remember, this is the president who, in
giving a deposition in another sexual misconduct case, said he had
not had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, only to tell a
federal grand jury eight months later he had, in fact, had an
inappropriate intimate relationship with the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   What is especially stomach-wrenching is less that the president,
by his own word, lied, than that the majority of the American
public has never comprehended it is the willful lie under oath _
not the sex _ that betrayed the founding of this country. It seems
few see the true horror of a president unprepared to take
responsibility for his blatant lie and his inability to grasp he
broke faith with the risk those who formed our union accepted for
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the president is not alone. Less and less do we see
Americans willing to accept the responsibility for their own
actions. More and more, we see a wild and weird inclination on the
part of many to insist that any who disagree with them are evil,
most likely part of a dangerous, un-American conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a columnist, an editorial writer, a newspaper publisher. We
are inundated daily with often-filthy sentiments denouncing us for
crimes we have not committed. We must take responsibility for what
we write and publish, but so must our critics take responsibility
for being able to comprehend what is written.
</P>
<P>
   You want to hate me for what I write, fine. But understand what
I write before slandering me with ignorant declarations I am
un-American.
</P>
<P>
   Un-American. Ha.
</P>
<P>
   What is un-American are those who know only how to hate, who can
only denounce for, too often, the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What is un-American are crowds running amok and then arguing it
is unfair to prosecute them for destroying property, endangering
lives and resisting, sometimes with violence, agents of the law.
</P>
<P>
   What is un-American is the absurd organization of protests _
demonstrations performed on a schedule in a designated area. If
there are those who are determined to insult the beliefs of a major
political party, let them take responsibility for their dissension.
What value is a belief you're only willing to express with police
protection?
</P>
<P>
   Why should millions of dollars in public funds be used to
provide protection and control for those who come to protest?
Shouldn't the protesters be responsible for their own ways of
demonstrating _ responsible for choosing between a peaceful and
self-confined protest and a destructive, uncontained attack on
those attending political conventions _ or any other legal activity
in this country, such as a licensed family-planning facility?
</P>
<P>
   And if they select the latter form, should they not be deemed
responsible for their foul actions and held accountable for them?
</P>
<P>
   What is un-American? It is a gang of heavily armed men who march
about, claiming _ and being given _ protection under the law to
menace others. Oops, I forgot. I'm only menaced if the loaded gun
is pointed _ maybe fired _ directly at me.
</P>
<P>
   College students don't know American history? Of course, they
don't. How can they learn something so many have forgotten how to
live?
</P>
<P>
   What has brought us to this point?
</P>
<P>
   There may be as many answers to that as there are Americans
still responsible enough to know there is such a question.
</P>
<P>
   I fear it started to fall down around us the day we first were
told it was our responsibility to remove the keys from ours cars so
none would be tempted _ hey, even lured _ into stealing them. &QL;

U.S. WOMEN BEAT BRAZIL, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Having relied on a coin toss to prevail over
Brazil earlier in the Gold Cup, the United States achieved a more
satisfying result Monday night with a 1-0 victory in an important
tuneup for the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A half-volley by forward Tiffeny Milbrett in the 44th minute
gave the Americans the championship in this regional tournament
before 20,123 at Foxboro Stadium. It was their fifth tournament
victory of the year and an encouraging send-off for a series of
matches this month in Europe against China, Norway and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday the United States and Brazil played to a scoreless
tie, finishing group play with identical records, and a coin flip
gave the group title to the United States. Monday night, the
Americans labored to put away a flurry of chances provided by the
assertiveness of Milbrett and the passing of Mia Hamm and escaped
with a shutout victory after a smothering save in the 60th minute
from goalkeeper Siri Mullinix.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday night, China, the 1999 Women's World Cup
runner-up, struggled against Canada in the consolation match before
prevailing, 2-1. The Chinese played this tournament without their
star forward, Sun Wen, who has a knee injury, and the team appeared
tired and overtrained. China's Olympic prospects remain uncertain
with the Summer Games beginning in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Coach April Heinrichs of the United States continued to
experiment with a three-forward lineup, putting Cindy Parlow
alongside Milbrett and Hamm instead of Shannon MacMillan, who has
the hardest shot on the team and who scored two goals in a 4-1
semifinal victory against Canada on Saturday. The Americans had
repeated chances to score in the first half but could not put the
ball into the net until the 44th minute, while Brazil threatened
twice as midfielder Sissi hit the crossbar on a 22-yard shot and
forward Katia volleyed another shot just high in the 29th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett, the Americans' leading scorer on the victorious 1999
World Cup team, spent much of the half in front of the Brazilian
goal, blasting a left-footer just over the crossbar in the 40th
minute. She has great vision and a searing burst of speed in tight
spaces, and it seemed inevitable that she would get a goal. Four
minutes later, Hamm angled a low bouncing pass into the penalty
box, and this time Milbrett expertly one-timed it past the
Brazilian goalkeeper, Andreia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we catch ourselves watching her, she's so
explosive,'' Hamm said of Milbrett. ``I think she's even faster
with the ball at her feet than without.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she led the team in scoring last year, Milbrett has
said that she felt somewhat constricted by the style of Tony
DiCicco, who coached the Americans to the 1996 Olympic title and
the 1999 World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   With Heinrichs, Milbrett and Hamm say, there is more opportunity
to be creative and to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the freedom to go out and express ourselves and not to
worry about making mistakes,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Milbrett scored, the Americans had a paucity of goals
against the world's top teams in recent months, scoring once
against Norway in March and failing to score against China and
Brazil in previous matches. Hamm is the career leading scorer in
the women's game, but she ranks fifth on the American team this
year, with seven goals. When she is not scoring, the United States
often finds it difficult to manufacture goals, but one
characteristic of Hamm's career has been her continued willingness
to pass the ball and play defense when her offense eludes her. Her
assist to Milbrett Monday night gave her 10 this year, tops among
the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix, the American goalkeeper, whose play has been notable
for her aggressive roving in the penalty box, prevented the tying
goal in the 60th minute after Sissi played a pass to Cidinha behind
the American defense. Left alone in front of the U.S. goal, Cidinha
hesitated slightly, and Mullinix charged six yards off her line to
smother the ball.

   BROWNSTONE-REVIVAL (Portland, Conn.) _ Brownstone is back. That
somber yet elegant cloak for more than 50,000 row houses, from
Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the so-called Brown Decades
of the mid-19th century, then reviled by the century's turn, when
gleaming white limestone and marble captivated the public. But
preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for
the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a
touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments. But the revival has sparked a debate on whether
brownstone should be used at all. Because the terrible secret is
that brownstone isn't really much good as a building material. By

   SYPHILIS-ERADICATE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ Even here, where the
syphilis rate is the second-highest in the country among major
cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the numbers are less than
staggering: Only 250 cases of new _ and thus still infectious _
syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they dropped below 7,000,
down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in 1990. But that is the
very point, health officials say. Now, when new cases are at an

<P>
   DIMAGGIO-PARK (San Francisco) _ The playground is still your
basic city model: Two and a third acres of asphalt, with swings and
monkey bars, a baseball field. The playground probably looks a lot
as it did when Joe DiMaggio, the fisherman's son, was learning how
to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball into a whirling
dervish. He played baseball here and made the North Beach
playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great
baseball players of all time. So when DiMaggio died last year, it
seemed natural to rename the playground in his honor. What DiMaggio
would make of the fight over the renaming of the playground is
anyone's guess. But Morris Engelberg, the Florida lawyer in charge
of guarding the Joe DiMaggio name, apparently believes his old
friend deserves more and is fighting a legal battle to stop the
renaming. By Evelyn Nieves.

New Economy. From health care, to education, to tax cuts to Social
Security, Bush and Gore are placing before the voters significant

Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-SIGNATURES (Undated) _ The law that President Clinton
signed last week allowing businesses and consumers to seal a wide
variety of legally binding arrangements with electronic rather than
handwritten signatures raised the speed limit on e-business
development, analysts say. They project that many enterprises awash
in documents, especially financial services, real estate and
government itself, will accelerate efforts to use computer
transactions to limit paperwork once the law takes effect in
October. Such a transition is expected to save billions of dollars
annually in administrative costs and cut some online transactions _
like setting up a trading account or applying for a home loan _
from days to minutes. By Barnaby J. Feder.

   SCI-GREEK-FOSSILS (Undated) _ A classical folklorist and
independent scholar has dug deep into the past and found literary
and artistic clues _ and not a few huge fossils _ that seem to
explain the inspiration for many of the giants, monsters and other
strange creatures in the mythology of antiquity. Greeks'
perceptions about fossils, she discovered, were quite amazing for
prescientific people. Her years of research thus challenge the
widely held view that natural historians in classical Greece and
Rome lacked the knowledge to interpret large vertebrate fossils as
organic remains of the past. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-PROTEIN-SHAPES (San Diego) _ With the human genome sequence
nearly complete, scientists are gearing up for a follow-on project
that some say could be every bit as ambitious. The endeavor is
known as structural genomics and involves trying to determine the
three-dimensional shapes of thousands upon thousands of proteins,
much as genomics determined the sequences of genes en masse.
Knowing the shape of the protein lock could make it easier to
design drugs that act as keys, binding to some particular protein
and turning it on or off. By Andrew Pollack.

<P>
   SCI-PROTEIN-XRAY (Undated) _ Protein shapes are usually

resembles a CAT scan. An X-ray is taken from multiple angles and a
computer uses that data to calculate a three-dimensional image.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAGE-GROUSE (Undated) _ A new species of bird has emerged
from research in the sagebrush ecosystem of western Colorado and
eastern Utah, according to scientists working there. The bird, the
Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of Colorado where it was
discovered, has been in plain view all along _ seen, hunted as a
game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at sunrise every spring as
part of one of the avian world's oddest courtship rituals. But it
had long been assumed to be the same species as the related
northern sage grouse, even though the two differ starkly in size,
appearance, behavior. By Jon Luoma.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ENVIRON-RIVETS (Undated) _ In trying to illuminate what
humans are doing to the natural environment, scientists and
conservationists over the years have come up with a number of
descriptive images. One of the best known is the metaphor of the
rivets. In this formulation, an ecosystem is likened to an
airplane: Each act of environmental destruction _ the extinction of
a species of plant or animal, for instance _ is akin to removing a
rivet from the plane. At first, the losses make little difference,
because there are lots of rivets. But if enough are removed or a
few are taken away at crucial spots, the plane will crash. An essay
by William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YOUNG-FISH (Undated) _ The typical saltwater fish's
childhood is something of a lost time, at least for scientists
trying to study it. Not much is known about what happens during
most fishes' larval stages, when they are tiny and floating in the
plankton in the swirling waters. And that has led to a great
question in marine ecology: Are fish populations open, with young
fish shuttling in and out across great distances, or closed, with
juveniles largely settling back where they were born? By Henry
Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VIRTUAL-MEDICINE (Seattle) _ Virtual reality now is being
used in medicine: It's helping distract burn patients so they feel
less pain, it's being used to alleviate phobias and it's even
helping people to relax and unclog blood vessels. By Jim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LOCAL-ANESTHESIA (Undated) _ Doctors recently performed a
heart bypass on a patient using only a local anesthesia. It was
believed to be the first such operation in the United States, but
some doctors are optimistic that many more now can be done, at
least in certain circumstances, like a single bypass. By Denise
Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHIATRY (Undated) _ A complex but pervasive problem in
psychiatry: It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh impossible,
to sort out where ``reality'' lies in the no man's land between the
patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and those of
the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic relationship
between patient and therapist, the events of the outside world can
become surprisingly elusive. The case of a patient claiming to be a
famous European artist illustrates the point. By Anna Fels, M.D.

   BROWNSTONE-REVIVAL (Portland, Conn.) _ Brownstone is back. That
somber yet elegant cloak for more than 50,000 row houses, from
Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the so-called Brown Decades
of the mid-19th century, then reviled by the century's turn, when
gleaming white limestone and marble captivated the public. But
preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for
the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a
touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments. But the revival has sparked a debate on whether
brownstone should be used at all. Because the terrible secret is
that brownstone isn't really much good as a building material. By

   SYPHILIS-ERADICATE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ Even here, where the
syphilis rate is the second-highest in the country among major
cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the numbers are less than
staggering: Only 250 cases of new _ and thus still infectious _
syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they dropped below 7,000,
down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in 1990. But that is the
very point, health officials say. Now, when new cases are at an
all-time low, is the time to try to wipe it out altogether. By
Carey Goldberg.

<P>
   DIMAGGIO-PARK (San Francisco) _ The playground is still your
basic city model: Two and a third acres of asphalt, with swings and
monkey bars, a baseball field. The playground probably looks a lot
as it did when Joe DiMaggio, the fisherman's son, was learning how
to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball into a whirling
dervish. He played baseball here and made the North Beach
playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great
baseball players of all time. So when DiMaggio died last year, it
seemed natural to rename the playground in his honor. What DiMaggio
would make of the fight over the renaming of the playground is
anyone's guess. But Morris Engelberg, the Florida lawyer in charge
of guarding the Joe DiMaggio name, apparently believes his old
friend deserves more and is fighting a legal battle to stop the
renaming. By Evelyn Nieves.

   DIGITAL-SIGNATURES (Undated) _ The law that President Clinton
signed last week allowing businesses and consumers to seal a wide
variety of legally binding arrangements with electronic rather than
handwritten signatures raised the speed limit on e-business
development, analysts say. They project that many enterprises awash
in documents, especially financial services, real estate and
government itself, will accelerate efforts to use computer
transactions to limit paperwork once the law takes effect in
October. Such a transition is expected to save billions of dollars
annually in administrative costs and cut some online transactions _

   SCI-GREEK-FOSSILS (Undated) _ A classical folklorist and
independent scholar has dug deep into the past and found literary
and artistic clues _ and not a few huge fossils _ that seem to
explain the inspiration for many of the giants, monsters and other
strange creatures in the mythology of antiquity. Greeks'
perceptions about fossils, she discovered, were quite amazing for
prescientific people. Her years of research thus challenge the
widely held view that natural historians in classical Greece and
Rome lacked the knowledge to interpret large vertebrate fossils as
organic remains of the past. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-PROTEIN-SHAPES (San Diego) _ With the human genome sequence
nearly complete, scientists are gearing up for a follow-on project
that some say could be every bit as ambitious. The endeavor is
known as structural genomics and involves trying to determine the
three-dimensional shapes of thousands upon thousands of proteins,
much as genomics determined the sequences of genes en masse.
Knowing the shape of the protein lock could make it easier to

   SCI-SAGE-GROUSE (Undated) _ A new species of bird has emerged
from research in the sagebrush ecosystem of western Colorado and
eastern Utah, according to scientists working there. The bird, the
Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of Colorado where it was
discovered, has been in plain view all along _ seen, hunted as a
game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at sunrise every spring as
part of one of the avian world's oddest courtship rituals. But it
had long been assumed to be the same species as the related
northern sage grouse, even though the two differ starkly in size,
appearance, behavior. By Jon Luoma.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ENVIRON-RIVETS (Undated) _ In trying to illuminate what
humans are doing to the natural environment, scientists and
conservationists over the years have come up with a number of
descriptive images. One of the best known is the metaphor of the
rivets. In this formulation, an ecosystem is likened to an
airplane: Each act of environmental destruction _ the extinction of
a species of plant or animal, for instance _ is akin to removing a
rivet from the plane. At first, the losses make little difference,
because there are lots of rivets. But if enough are removed or a
few are taken away at crucial spots, the plane will crash. An essay
by William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YOUNG-FISH (Undated) _ The typical saltwater fish's
childhood is something of a lost time, at least for scientists
trying to study it. Not much is known about what happens during
most fishes' larval stages, when they are tiny and floating in the
plankton in the swirling waters. And that has led to a great
question in marine ecology: Are fish populations open, with young
fish shuttling in and out across great distances, or closed, with
juveniles largely settling back where they were born? By Henry
Fountain.

<P>
   SCI-VIRTUAL-MEDICINE (Seattle) _ Virtual reality now is being
used in medicine: It's helping distract burn patients so they feel
less pain, it's being used to alleviate phobias and it's even
helping people to relax and unclog blood vessels. By Jim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LOCAL-ANESTHESIA (Undated) _ Doctors recently performed a
heart bypass on a patient using only a local anesthesia. It was
believed to be the first such operation in the United States, but
some doctors are optimistic that many more now can be done, at
least in certain circumstances, like a single bypass. By Denise
Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHIATRY (Undated) _ A complex but pervasive problem in
psychiatry: It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh impossible,
to sort out where ``reality'' lies in the no man's land between the
patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and those of
the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic relationship
between patient and therapist, the events of the outside world can
become surprisingly elusive. The case of a patient claiming to be a
famous European artist illustrates the point. By Anna Fels, M.D.

GRIND TAKES ITS TOLL ON ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 GLAUS' STATS IN FOURTH GRAF-LBPT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Big Five the Angels have counted on for
most of their offense --- Darin Erstad, Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon,
Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus --- have also been counted upon to
be in the lineup everyday.
</P>
<P>
   They've missed a total of eight games this season, which reached
the halfway point Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy load, however, may be taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who played in the first 71 games, sat out back-to-back
games last week with back spasms and is 2 for 26 with 16 strikeouts
since.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Erstad, the Angels best player in the first half, who
is sidelined with a bad back. He was in the DH spot on Sunday and
was slated to play there again Monday, but was scratched just
before game time.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad leads the American League in hits (130), is second in
batting average (.371) and has driven home 59 runs --- tied for
second on the team --- from his leadoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker has likened the last week before the
All-Star break to the final minute of a basketball team --- it's a
chance to carry some momentum into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia couldn't disagree more with his former
Dodger teammate. Even as the Angels embarked upon a four-game
series with the first-place Mariners leading up to next week's
break, Scioscia isn't putting any extra importance on this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put a lot of stock in the leading up to the All-Star
break,'' Scioscia said. ``I put a lot of stock in the grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (former Notre Dame basketball coach) Digger Phelps
the last time we were in Seattle and he'd look at the schedule and
say we had to be 4-1 in this group. There's a lot of successful
coaches who look at it like that, but I never have as a player,
coach or in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does two things. First, it set in complacency if
you approach your goal. Second, it ignites a little panic if you're
behind. I think you play the game hard, try to carry some momentum
if you can and turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Game starters will be announced today, and pitchers and
reserves will be announced Wednesday for next week's game in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, the expected starter with leading vote-getter Cal Ripken
out, and Erstad, as a reserve, are locks. If the Angels get a third
player, it could be rookie Bengie Molina, who is having a terrific
season at bat and behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Molina entered Monday night's game batting .309 with 8 homers
and 35 RBI, and had thrown out 36 percent of runners trying to
steal.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Gil Meche (4-4, 3.49 ERA) vs. Kent Bottenfield (4-7,
5.60), 7:05 p.m.; TV: Fox Sports Net. Radio: KLAC/570 AM and
XPRS/1090 AM.

MARINERS HOLD ON TO CLIP ANGELS; SASAKI EARNS 17TH SAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A day at the beach was just what Seattle
manager Lou Piniella thought he needed, so the Florida beach bum
that lurks just under Piniella's skin set out for a two-mile walk
Monday afternoon on Newport Beach, just 20 miles from the Mariners'
team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But if Piniella thought Monday night was going to be another
kind of day at the beach, he quickly lost that illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Three different five-run leads proved to be castles made of sand
as the Mariners had to fight relentlessly to keep Anaheim at bay
for an 8-6 victory that pushed Seattle's lead over Oakland in the
AL West to 2{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki preserved what his teammates had built, getting
the final three outs of the game with the tying runs on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about Sasaki from Pat Mahomes when I was in New
York,'' Mariners left fielder Rickey Henderson said. ``He said the
guy was great, but I didn't believe him. But I know what he was
talking about now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps his poise out there. He doesn't give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his 17th save went into the books, Sasaki opened the
ninth by being nicked for a single that Mo Vaughn somehow sneaked
through the right side of the infield, with three infielders
stacked to prevent just that. Then after getting ahead of Tim
Salmon with two quick strikes, Sasaki walked Salmon by missing with
the next four, although he was clearly far from enamored with the
calls of home-plate umpire Mike Winters.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Garret Anderson, who had homered twice and doubled,
Sasaki missed with his first pitch. Piniella told pitching coach
Bryan Price to go out and settle Sasaki down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him not to overthrow,'' Price said. ``If he throws
his good stuff, that was going to be enough to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who had obviously consulted Tarot cards before the
conversation, was dead on. Anderson flew out. Troy Glaus, who had
snapped an 0-for-20 streak earlier, struck out on three pitches.
And Benjie Molina, who had homered, brought the game to a close
just six minutes short of four hours when he flew out to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He impressed me with his poise and the way he rebounded in
that situation,'' Price said of Sasaki. ``They've got a formidable
lineup, a lot of thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Sasaki, the night belonged to John Olerud. The Mariners
first baseman drove in four runs with a sacrifice fly and a
three-run double as the Mariners built up a lead of 5-0 after 1{
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But after those leads, and margins of 6-1 and 7-2, had all but
been washed away by the relentless Angels, Olerud came up with a
defensive play to save the day. With two on and one out in the
eighth and Seattle clinging to an 8-6 lead, Olerud dived headlong
to his left to steal a game-tying, two-run double from Angels
pinch-hitter Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, batting with runners at first and second with one out,
seemed to have gotten the ball past Olerud. But Olerud used all of
his 6 feet, 5 inches to spear the ball, popped up and threw to
reliever Jose Mesa covering first base for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have been a triple if it gets by him,'' Piniella
said. ``That was a terrific play, because the game was going to be
tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Once past that obstacle, the Mariners soldiered on for their
third straight win and 11th victory in their past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to close out the first half strong,''
Henderson said. ``It's important for us to go from here to the
All-Star break (Sunday) good and hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Jamie Moyer (7-3) was gifted thrice by leads of
five runs _ 5-0, 6-1 and 7-2 _ but the Angels are a team that
generally hits the left-hander hard, and with center fielder Garret
Anderson leading the way, they did it again.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit solo homers off Moyer in the second and fourth
innings, then added an RBI double in the sixth as the Angels scored
four times, cutting the deficit to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Moyer had been doing what he does best _
grazing the boundaries of the strike zone with all manner of
pitches fast and slow, keeping the Angels off balance and, with the
exception of Anderson, off the scoreboard as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels' offense, one of the most potent in the game,
refused to be denied. Again, Anderson was in the middle of it.
Salmon and Anderson doubled with one out in the sixth for a run,
Troy Glaus singled a run home and Molina hit a first-pitch homer
off Moyer to get Anaheim close.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Moyer, who entered the game with a 6-7 record and
career 5.91 earned-run average against the Angels, turned the ball
over to Brett Tomko. The right-hander, making just his third
appearance since coming off the disabled list June 25, struggled a
bit but managed to keep the game ever so slightly in the Mariners'
favor at 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson got the Mariners a bit of a cushion with a two-out RBI
double in the seventh for an 8-6 lead. It could have been more than
that, but Anderson made a terrific running catch against Mike
Cameron to take a double and a run away from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That was just part of Anderson Night at Edison Field _ in
addition to two homers and a double, he made a nice running catch
against Joe Oliver with the bases loaded in the first.

ANGELS FALL SEVEN GAMES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The state of the Angels' pitching rotation
these days is making Manager Mike Scioscia's stomach churn, as Ken
Hill joined the growing legion of veteran starters who look lately
as if they're over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Tim Belcher was knocked out in the first inning by
Oakland, Hill was tattooed by Seattle for five runs in 1 fr 2/3
innings, which sent the Mariners on their way to an 8-6 victory
Monday night before 20,919 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Angels a season-high seven games back in the
AL West and a few more this week could drop them out of sight by
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who attacked the plate in his first start off the disabled
list --- a 3-2 victory last week at Seattle --- never had command
of any of his pitches, routinely bouncing breaking balls and
missing high and wide with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Hill walked five and allowed five hits, the last of which was
John Olerud's two-out, bases loaded double on a 3-2 pitch that gave
Seattle a 5-0 lead. He was so lost he went into the tunnel between
innings and threw balls into a screen, searching for a better feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a week can make,'' said Hill, who insisted
the strained rib cage muscle that sidelined him for 42 games was
fine. ``I just didn't feel good. My body was tight. It was one of
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Angel veterans in the rotation, Belcher and tonight's
starter Kent Bottenfield, have been having too many of those days
lately. Each has struggled in his last two starts and over the past
month, Manager Mike Scioscia's most reliable starters have been a
pair of 25-year-olds, Brian Cooper and Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``His velocity was good,'' Scioscia said of Hill. ``But he was
behind too many hitters and he couldn't make a pitch to put some of
their guys away.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he was thinking of when he walked to the dugout after
being pulled, Hill smiled and said, ``The bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After Belcher's short start, ``the last thing I want to do is go
and inning and two-thirds,'' Hill said. ``At least if I struggle, I
can go five or six innings. Those guys are doing the best they can,
but they get tired too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rode a spectacular effort by center fielder Garret
Anderson to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made an over-the-shoulder catch of Joe Oliver's
two-out, bases-loaded drive to center field that limited Seattle to
two runs in the first. In the seventh, he made a similar catch to
rob Mike Cameron of a double and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, Anderson hit solo homers in the second and fourth,
both times pulling fastballs from left-hander Jaime Moyer into the
right-field seats. In the sixth, he went with a changeup into the
left-center gap for an RBI double that closed the Angels' gap to
7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus snapped an 0 for 20 skid, going the opposite way on a
3-2 changeup and Bengie Molina followed by hitting Moyer's next
pitch over the left-field fence and suddenly the Angels were within
7-6.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariner relievers Brett Tomko, Arthur Rhodes, Jose Mesa and
Kazuhiro Sasaki shut out the Angels the rest of the way, though
they did get a huge assist from John Olerud. The Seattle first
baseman made a diving stop to rob pinch hitter Adam Kennedy of a
game-tying double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club is mentally tough,'' Scioscia said. ``Even when we
were down four or five runs, we were working to get back into it.
But their bullpen has been doing the job all year. They tough when
you get down there.''

The Scottsdale City Council moves one step closer to naming its
first female city manager.1st female city manager likely
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottsdale ready
</P>
<P>
   to begin talksScottsdale could name its first female city
manager as early as July 11.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour behind closed doors Saturday, the City Council
unanimously voted to start negotiations with Jan Dolan, 47, the
longtime city manager in Menlo Park, Calif. Dolan retired from that
post Friday after leading the Silicon Valley suburb for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   A formal appointment could come at the council meeting on July
11. If selected, Dolan would be the first woman to run a major
Valley city, operating a budget of $894 million and overseeing
2,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with her as a human being and as a
manager,'' Mayor Mary Manross said. ``At this point, I don't
anticipate any sticking points in hiring her. She is a top-notch
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park officials and neighborhood activists praise the
Montana native for her fiscal skills and her work in low-income
neighborhoods. Dolan spearheaded a library and health clinic
project in Belle Haven, once called the ``other'' Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, one of 70 people who applied for the job, worked for six
city councils and 11 mayors during her 10 years in Menlo Park. She
was paid $120,000 annually.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S PLAN FOR PEACE WITH CUBA

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ We tried to exempt cigars,'' John Kennedy told
me in early 1961 when I brought him the order that imposed an
embargo on trade with Cuba, ``but the cigar manufacturers in Tampa
objected. I guess we're out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right _ I was out of luck. But not the president. Somehow
he never seemed to run out of Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo was part of our continuing effort to overthrow Fidel
Castro, one weapon in an arsenal that included assassination,
sabotage of the Cuban economy, guerrilla infiltration _ a kind of
state-sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked. The reason was simple. An overthrow required
a strong, organized internal opposition. And that didn't exist.
Indeed, we had helped neutralize it by our attempted invasion of
the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you for the Bay of Pigs,'' Che Guevara told me
in Uruguay during an unexpected meeting at a party for a Latin
American diplomat in 1961. ``It solidified our rule and discouraged
our middle-class enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're welcome,'' I replied. ``Now, maybe you'll invade
Guantanamo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Cold War, and with strong Communist
movements in other Latin American countries, the unanticipated
transformation of Cuba into a Communist outpost seemed a potential
threat to our security. The policy of containment had broken down
only 90 miles from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Yet little more than a year later, the withdrawal of Soviet
missiles from Cuba changed the atmosphere, and Kennedy dispatched
an emissary to talk with the Cuban delegate to the United Nations,
in hopes of laying the groundwork for some rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president died, and the embargo was frozen in place for
four more decades, long after the reasons for it had evaporated. In
this time, Soviet communism weakened and tumbled. The Communist-led
movements in Latin America disappeared. We welcomed trade with the
Soviet Union and China. Yet through it all the embargo on Cuba
stayed in place, the historical artifact of a Cold War that had
ended.
</P>
<P>
   This anomalous policy owed its durability to Florida politics. A
large and passionate exile community in Miami turned against any
party and any politician who seemed willing to dilute our hostility
toward the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had foreseen this when he made a futile effort to
persuade new exiles to settle in other parts of the country. But
they continued to come to Miami, and their intransigence and voting
power threatened any presidential candidate with the loss of
Florida's crucial electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   No president and no candidate for president was willing to take
that risk. So for political reasons _ and only for political
reasons _ the embargo has remained. And since Cuba was small and
weak, politics could be allowed to determine policy.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the embargo has only strengthened the rule of
Fidel Castro, the lone surviving leader of the '60s, and enhanced
his not inconsiderable stature in Latin America. A few years ago, I
went to a conference of Latin American leaders and functionaries in
Cartagena, Colombia. When Castro entered the room, the audience of
committed capitalists stood and cheered. And not for ideological
reasons. He had stood up to the Yankees and won.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent he has become an almost mythical figure, that myth
rests on his defiance of our hostility. There can be no doubt that
opening Cuba to a flow of American business and travelers would
have a wholly salutary effect on the life of that country. It would
also greatly improve the prospects that the Cuban people will
someday move toward a market economy and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after all, the dominant lesson of recent history. The
Cuban people have endured hardships and deprivation for decades. It
is time to welcome them back into the American community, not
grudgingly, but with the generosity of spirit that we like to think
characterizes our nation.
</P>

Kennedy and Johnson.)

<P>
   WETHERSFIELD, Conn. _ I am about to commit a new millennium
offense for which there is no punishment. In fact, I am sure many
will hail me as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I'm going to do: The next time I'm in the grocery
store and see someone yakking away on a cell phone, oblivious to
the fact that her grocery cart is blocking the aisle, I will reach
out and press the off button.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about road rage. I am afflicted with a new syndrome, let's
call it ``cell phone rage.'' Try driving behind one of these
wireless scofflaws on the highway as he drives 20 mph, too busy
talking to obey the speed limit. I would feel justified pulling out
a bullhorn and directing, ``Hang up the phone. Hang up the phone
now!''
</P>
<P>
   I am not alone. Signs are beginning to pop up prohibiting cell
phones in certain areas. One New Jersey town has even introduced
one of the country's first local ordinances banning the use of cell
phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners are creating special sections for cell phone
users. School districts are cracking down on students talking on
phones in the hallways and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many phone users continue to talk loudly _ and
anywhere. People seem to think every place is a good place to talk
on the phone: the doctor's office, the theater, even funerals. My
cousin told me about one encounter with a man who was sitting under
a sign prohibiting cell phone use and took a call anyway. When my
cousin pointed to the sign, the man apologized and hung up. But a
few minutes later the man's telephone rang again and he took the
call, without even moving from the prohibited area.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who use cell phones are also guilty of broadcasting
too much private information. I don't care about the hives on your
elbow or your Saturday night plans to dine with Joe and Ethel. Save
the gossip about your brother-in-law cheating on your sister with
her best friend. I don't need to know. Lower your voice; you are
not at home or in a telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   It seems we need more than laws to change this kind of
discourteous _ and even dangerous _ behavior. I say it is time for
the cell phone police to step forward and devise some cell phone
etiquette.
</P>

and missing bodies. Then there are racing dogs, rescue and show
dogs. There are dogs that herd cattle and sheep, and dogs that
serve as companions for patients in nursing homes and hospitals. Of
course, most dogs do duty as family pets, and that role should not
be made light of. By Fred Brock.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Wednesday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)

<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ The Institutional Revolutionary
Party, which lost the presidency in Sunday's elections after more
than 70 years in power, will meet Tuesday to choose a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-POLITICS (Havana) _ A top Cuban official, Ricardo Alarcon,
says in an interview that the government wants to capitalize on the
momentum created by Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba to create
anti-U.S. embargo fervor. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-SPY (Paris) _ A French state prosecutor has launched a
preliminary judicial investigation into the workings of the United
States global surveillance system, Echelon, which is said to be
capable of sifting through millions of telephone calls, faxes and
e-mails a day. By Suzanne Daley.

   SUMMER-SCHOOL (Undated) _ More students than ever before are
enrolled in summer school this season, as districts throughout the
country _ led by those in major cities _ require or strongly
encourage younger and younger students to attend classes to shore
up basic reading and mathematical skills. Educational experts
believe summer school helps address the yawning academic gaps
between poor, minority students and white middle-class ones, by
slowing the ``summer slide,'' in which children forget study
skills, discipline habits and vocabulary words between Memorial Day
and Labor Day. But many are worried that the mushrooming programs,
many of which are mandatory for students who fail to meet promotion
standards, will simply repeat ineffective instructional approaches
and frustrate struggling students with endless drills for
high-stakes exams. By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-GUNS (Denver) _ A ballot initiative to close the gun show
loophole is approved in Colorado and the NRA vows to fight it. By

   LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT (Undated) _ Babies born weighing less than five

Sociological Review. By Tamar Lewin.

<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-MEMORIAL (Washington) _ Thousands of Vietnam veterans
whose names never made it onto the wall at the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington because they did not die from battle-related

name. By Renwick McClean.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALZHEIMER (Undated) _ A new study reports that people with
advanced Alzheimer's Disease who break a hip or develop pneumonia

   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ Faced with fresh evidence that the economy

rates, which have been at an effective rate of zero for more than a
year. Such a move would be the first rate increase in Japan in
nearly a decade. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TELEPHONE (Undated) _ A look at Internet telephony, the
growing use of the Internet to make telephone calls, basically for
free. By Simon Romero.

some preliminary steps to make a bid for Sprint if its merger
agreement with WorldCom is scrapped. By Edmund L. Andrews and

and puzzled educators, law schools have gained the advantage in
their long tug of war with business schools for the attention of
corporate America's future elite. At virtually every top business
school, the number of applicants fell last spring, and some of the
numbers are startling. At the University of Chicago, they dropped
24 percent. At Cornell, the dip was 23 percent, and at Stanford, it
was 18 percent. As a result, it is considerably less difficult to
gain admission to some business schools than it was a few years
ago, and school officials have relaxed their requirements for work
experience and stepped up overseas recruiting efforts. By David
Leonhardt.

is not when anyone wants to hear about the health hazards of eating

that there is some evidence that they may have the same effect on
humans. And while health professionals still recommend cutting back
on overall meat consumption to reduce the risk, recent research
suggests that there are more appealing ways to make grilled meat
less hazardous. By Marian Burros.

   I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAD AT WIFE
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three years ago I met a 45-year-old woman in China. I
arranged for her to come to New York. We were married within two
weeks. Since that time, she has refused to disrobe in front of me
or to have sexual intercourse. We do not sleep in the same room.
She refuses to visit a Chinese-speaking female therapist. If I
divorce her, she will lose her immigration status and be forced to
return to China. Would it be unethical to divorce her?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.S.,Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: A whirlwind courtship, a quick trip to the altar, a romance
gone sour _ you know the old saying: marry in haste, repent in
China. But that is a harsh stricture to impose on a woman with whom
you've lived for three years and for whom you seem to have some
feeling. If the facts are as you describe, you are right to seek a
solution to your intimate problems that does not involve a
deportation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step should be to get some legal advice so she can
learn her options for remaining in the country and so neither of
you ends up on the wrong side of the immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Even if divorce would not lead to deportation, you should make
every effort to understand and improve your marriage. This cannot
be done if you feel that your unhappy circumstances are solely your
wife's fault. It is not just she who should talk to a therapist;
resolving this conflict is something you must undertake together.
</P>
<P>
   If she married you simply to get to the United States, or if you
married her as a kind of mail-order bride, the origins of your
union are less significant than what you've made of it. If these
efforts fail, you might consider an accommodation that allows you
to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere while staying married _ that
is, without having your wife put on a plane to China. While her
eagerness to remain in America does not trump your desire for
marital happiness and a fulfilling erotic life, you should seek a
solution that does not provide for one person's felicity at the
expense of the other's.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that your wife will neither disrobe nor have
sexual intercourse because love is absent or because of her sexual
orientation. There is also an odder possibility to consider, a
subject that is explored with great tact in ``M. Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: At a sales meeting on e-technology, a presenter said that to
be successful, we should disregard those with minimal income in
favor of those with substantial income. How does one deal with this
social injustice?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A: I assume the presenter was encouraging you to disregard the
poor in your marketing efforts rather than to run them over with
your Lexus should anyone making under $15,000 fail to scurry out of
the crosswalk quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   There is, on the face of it, nothing unethical about promoting
goods or services that only a few can afford _ hence the existence
of Tiffany's, the Four Seasons and Patricia Duff. Indeed, most of
the world's people are unable to afford pretty much everything on
sale in American department stores.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that fortunes have been made by producing things
many people can enjoy: paperback books, ballpoint pens, fresh
peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while catering to the rich is an option, it is not the
only option. The best way to respond to what you see as social
injustice is to have the courage of your convictions and find a
different job, one that allows you to live your values.

 Secrets Of Success: Give Us Liberty's Cream Pie   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If I had to name one dessert I crave above the
rest, it's the Banana Cream Pie at Liberty Cafe. It doesn't even
matter that banana is far from my favorite fruit _ when it's paired
with the rich cool custard, frothy whipped cream and flaky crust at
Liberty Cafe, it's nothing short of perfect.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes the pie so special is how owner Cathie Guntli has
tweaked a great recipe by creating a better crust and a richer
cream filling.
</P>
<P>
   The all-American cafe does the same with many of its
specialties. After three years as the pastry chef at Zuni Cafe,
Guntli decided it was time to open her own restaurant and found a
cozy 32-seat space in Bernal Heights. While not fancy, the interior
has a homey quality that fits the demeanor of the food.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the restaurant has expanded and now features an
outdoor patio and wine bar, and a bakery where you might even be
able to find the Banana Cream Pie to take home _ if it's not
already sold out. But now you can have it any time with this
recipe.

BANANA CREAM PIE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Crust
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups all-purpose flour + flour for rolling
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled
</P>
<P>
   4 to 8 tablespoons ice water
</P>
<P>
   Pastry Cream
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   The Topping
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 bananas, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate shavings for garnishing
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the crust:  &LR; Combine the flour and salt in a food
processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the shortening and
butter and process using on/off pulses until the mixture is the
size of peas. Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time, processing
until the dough just begins to come together.
</P>
<P>
   Form the dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic
and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Let soften
slightly if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch
round, about 1/8-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie dish. Crimp the edges
decoratively. Line the dough with foil and pie weights or dry beans
to keep the crust from bubbling up during baking. Bake until the
edges of the crust are lightly browned, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove the weights and foil and continue to bake for 5 to 7
minutes, until the whole crust is golden brown. Transfer to a rack.
Let cool completely.

sugar and continue to warm until small bubbles form around the edge
of the pan, about 5 to 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, beat together the flour, cornstarch,
eggs and remaining 1/4 cup sugar until smooth. Slowly whisk the
warmed milk into the egg mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Return the mixture to the saucepan. Stir over low heat until
thick and slightly bubbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Strain into a large bowl. Add the butter and stir until melted.
Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pastry cream.
Let cool, then refrigerate until chilled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the topping:  &LR; Beat together the cream, sugar and
vanilla in a large bowl until stiff peaks form.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assembly:  &LR; Spread a thin layer of pastry cream in the crust.
Top with a layer of bananas. Continue to layer bananas and pastry
cream until you reach the top of the crust, finishing with the
pastry cream to prevent the bananas from turning brown.

 Bay Area Classics: Burgundian Chardonnay Inspires Couple to 
 Create Stony Hill   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 ST. HELENA, Calif. _  When Eleanor and Frederick McCrea planted
Chardonnay grapes on the old goat farm high above the Napa Valley
they had purchased a few years earlier as a rustic getaway, wine
experts were skeptical.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chardonnay? In California? Better plant some other grapes, too _
grapes that are suited to our soil and climate, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1947, and there were all of 200 acres of Chardonnay
in the entire state. But the McCreas wouldn't be dissuaded. They
loved the white wines of Burgundy that are made from Chardonnay
grapes, and they had a hunch that the volcanic soil and the micro
climate of their particular land on Spring Mountain _ intense
sunshine alternating with cooling breezes and a bit of fog _ might
just make it possible to produce wines in that style.
</P>
<P>
   They obtained bud-wood from one of Northern California's oldest
wine-growing families, the Wentes of the Livermore Valley, whose
founder had introduced Burgundian vines to the area in the late
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, they made their first wine, and two years later they
released it, 50 cases of what then was called Pinot Chardonnay.
They sent a newsletter to friends, offering the wine at $23.40 a
case or (after a discount) $21.69, delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many plantings and harvests and prizes later, a bottle of
1997 Stony Hill Chardonnay retails for close to that amount, and
the Chardonnay grape has become the work horse of California's
white wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the vineyards with Peter McCrea, the son of Fred and
Eleanor, who now owns and operates the winery with his wife,
Willinda, it's easy to understand why his parents chose the name
Stony Hill. Bordered by stands of redwood and Douglas fir, the
rolling terrain 600 feet above the floor of the Napa Valley is
nothing if not rocky. But that is the very condition that results
in a small harvest of grapes with concentrated fruit flavors.
</P>
<P>
   It's this intense character that has gained Stony Hill wines a
devoted following (most wine, if not snapped up by restaurants, is
sold by subscription). The McCreas' winemaker, Mike Chelini, who
was trained by Fred McCrea and has been with the winery for 25
years, takes pride in his wines' pure flavors. He eschews
malolactic fermentation, which he says reduces the natural acid
structure of wine, and uses old French oak barrels for aging so the
wines are not dominated by the strong oak flavor of young barrels.
The Stony Hill crew calls theirs a ``non-interventional'' style of
winemaking _ if Mother Nature (aided and abetted by the
vineyardist's skill) gives you delicious fruit, don't doctor it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McCrea still works as an oil company executive, commuting
between his San Francisco home, the Chevron office in Danville and
the house his parents built at Stony Hill.
</P>
<P>
   That house, spacious yet unpretentious, is a far cry from the
old farm house where Eleanor McCrea took her children each summer.
Homesteaded in 1890 with the typical allotment of 160 acres
stipulated by the Homestead Act of 1862, the land may have had
various uses but, to the best of the McCreas' knowledge, no grapes
were ever grown there before they started their vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   True to the name of Spring Mountain, there was plenty of natural
water on the property, but it boasted neither electricity nor phone
service during their first summers. ``We children were expected to
pull our weight,'' Peter McCrea says.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Peter McCrea went on to Dartmouth for an
engineering degree, then met and married Willinda. His oil company
work took the young couple to Saudi Arabia for three years and
later to Holland, but they were back in California by the time Fred
McCrea died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother's death in 1991, the younger McCreas took over
operation of the winery, with Willinda heading up the office. Their
two children, Frederick, 33, a bank research analyst, and Sarah,
31, who works in retail marketing, are on Stony Hill's board of
directors and, their parents hope, will take the family tradition
of winemaking into the third generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has already redesigned the label for her parents to
``update the winery's image,'' and a Web site tells the history of
Stony Hill and explains the wines and how they are produced.
Selling most their wines direct to customers (some loyalists have
been on the mailing list since the '50s), the winery has no public
tasting room and doesn't need a lot of promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Says vintner McCrea with a grin, ``No T-shirts.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; History: &LR;  Homesteaded in 1890, the 160-acre farm straddles a
stage coach route used by volunteers fighting General Mariano
Vallejo's forces in Sonoma during the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846. It
was acquired by San Francisco advertising executive Frederick
McCrea and his wife, Eleanor Wheeler McCrea, in 1943 as a rural
getaway. Four years later, they planted their first grapes,
pioneering Chardonnay cultivation in California. The vineyard now
boasts 45 acres of dry-farmed grapes, and is owned and operated by
the McCreas' son and daughter-in-law, Peter and Willinda McCrea.
Winemaker is Mike Chelini, who was trained by Fred McCrea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Specialties: &LR;  Stony Hill's elegant, fruity Chardonnays are its
mainstay, but the annual 4,000-case production also includes White
Riesling, Gew &LR; u &LR; rztraminer and the dessert wine, Semillon de
Soleil. The dry wines are $13-$24 when ordered directly from the
winery; the 375-milliliter bottles of Semillon are $12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Look: &LR;  Situated 600 feet above the valley floor, the winery
and the McCrea's house are low-slung buildings that fit into the
landscape of rolling vineyards bordered by redwoods and Douglas
fir. The house and spacious deck afford charming views of the
valley and the hills on the opposite side.

 Wine Potpourri: Grapes of Ancient Rome Thrive Again in Southern 
 Italy   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Scratch a lover of Italian wine and the first
words of admiration are not likely to be about the wines of
Campania. Tuscany and Piedmont are the standard choices for the big
reds that seem to characterize modern Italian wine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the distinctive wines of Campania, a southern region known
as ``the ankle of the boot,'' predate any Tuscan Chianti and
Piemontese Barolo. About 3,000 years ago, the Greeks first planted
vines near what is now Naples, the major city in Campania. When the
Romans arrived 1,000 years later, they planted more vines. The
culture spread throughout the country, but thrived in the  &LR; campania
felix &LR; , or happy countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Modern winemaking in Campania is closely identified with
Mastroberardino, a specialist in the wines of antiquity. The
Mastroberardino family's involvement in winemaking can be traced
back to 1580. In the late 1700s, the family built a winery in
Atripaldacq &LR; , although it was not until 1878 that the winery was
formally established.
</P>
<P>
   Today, brothers Antonio and Walter, and sons Piero and Carlo run
the winery 40 miles northeast of Naples. Using the family's
extensive library of ancient books on viticulture and winemaking
during Greek and Roman times, the Mastroberardinos have
successfully cultivated grapes that were popular centuries ago. In
recognition of the dedication to the wines of antiquity, the
Italian government has awarded them the project of replanting
ancient vineyards amid the ruins of Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   Employing modern winemaking techniques, such as refrigerated
stainless-steel tanks and rotary fermenters, Mastroberardino
produces intense and distinctive wines from grapes like Aglianico,
Fiano di Avellino, Coda di Volpe and Greco di Tufo.
</P>
<P>
   Aglianico is the grape of Mastroberardino's flagship red,
Taurasi, a rich wine with pronounced tannins that often is compared
to the Nebbiolo-based wines of Piedmont. In fact, Taurasi sometimes
is called the ``Barolo of the South.'' Aglianico also is the
primary grape in Mastro Rosso, the winery's entry-level unwooded
red.
</P>
<P>
   Fiano di Avellino grapes were introduced to the region 2,000
years ago by the Romans. Roman writer Pliny The Elder noted the
grapes were irresistible to bees, and thus dubbed the vine Vitis
Apiana, or ``beloved by bees.'' Fiano di Avellino has a honeyed
aroma and the subtle flavor of hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Greco di Tufo was brought to the region by the Greeks and takes
part of its name from the tufo soil of the region. Greco di Tufo is
dry and rich with the intriguing taste of toasted almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Coda di Volpe, a white grape from Roman times that thrives in
the volcanic soils on the lower slopes of Mt. Vesuvius, is the
grape of Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio Bianco. Noting the clusters of
grapes resembled a fox tail, Pliny the Elder dubbed the vine Coda
di Volpe. The grape also is used to make Mastro Bianco, the white
companion to Mastro Rosso.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroberardino wines are available in restaurants and fine wine
shops. Prices range from a high of $40 for Taurasi to $20 for Greco
di Tufo and $12 for Mastro Rosso and Mastro Bianco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Tears of Christ &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many stories are told about the origin of the name for Lacryma
Christi del Vesuvio, one of the popular wines from Campania. My
favorite is the one that has God casting Lucifer out of heaven,
with the devil falling from grace and landing in the water off
Southern Italy, forming the Bay of Naples. God was so sad that when
he wept, vines sprang up where his tears struck the soil on the
slopes of Mt. Vesuvius.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Viva Vya &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Quady, the determined and venturesome winemaker who
convinced the wine world that California was capable of making
top-quality fortified wines, scored a coup recently with his Vya
Vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   Quady took on Martini, the traditional Italian producer of
vermouth, at ``The Heavyweight Vermouth Championship of the World''
at Boisdale Scottish restaurant in London, and came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   The judges, mainly barmen from some of London's leading
restaurants, declared Vya (Sweet and Extra Dry) superior to Martini
(Sweet and Dry). Both styles of Vya, priced at $15, are available
in wine retail shops throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spirits Contest &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The first San Francisco World Spirits Competition will be
September 15-17 at the Park Hyatt Hotel. An off-shoot of the San
Francisco International Wine Competition, the spirits competition
will employ 30 judges to taste and rate hundreds of spirits,
brandies and liqueurs. For more information, call (415) 345-9000 or
log on to  &LR; www.sfspiritscomp.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Under Italian law, wines are approved in four categories. The
least definitive are  &LR; vino da tavola &LR; , wines that may not specify a
grape variety, vintage or place of origin, and IG ( &LR; indicazione &LR; 
 &LR; geografica &LR; ) wines, those that express the ``typical'' character
of a region or commune. Next come the  &LR; denominazione di &LR;   &LR; origine
controllata &LR;  (D.O.C) wines; and finally  &LR; denominazione &LR;   &LR; di origine
controllata e garantita &LR;  (D.O.C.G), the highest ranking,
guaranteeing the authenticity of wines of ``particular esteem.''
There are others, but these are the basic four.
</P>
<P>
   DOCG status has been granted to only 15 wines, including Taurasi
from Campania. The others are Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di
Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano _ the original four _
and Albana di Romagna in Emilia Romagna; Chianti, Carmignano and
Vernaccio di San Gimignano in Tuscany, Asti Spumante, Moscato
d'Asti and Gattinara in Piedmont; Torgiano Rosso Riserva and
Sagrantino di Montefalco in Umbria. And on June 15, the legislature
added Frascati in the Latium region to the prestigious list.

 Best Way: Summertime Margaritas   By Andy Lax 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Love or hate Jimmy Buffet, you have to admit he's
on to something _ a good margarita. With its quenching pucker of
lime, a cool pitcher of margaritas is the perfect drink for a
summer celebration.
<P>
   Though the summer may encourage laziness, that doesn't mean you
should slack off when it comes to making your margaritas. In order
to bring you the perfect margarita, willing Food staffers sampled a
number of variations.
</P>
<P>
   For our tests, we based our margarita on the following recipe: 2
ounces tequila, 11/2 ounces lime juice, and 3/4 ounce orange
liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   Our first step was to determine the best orange liqueur to use _
Triple Sec, Cointreau or Grand Marnier. Although it's traditional,
we found the Triple Sec margarita too sweet. On the other end of
the spectrum, the Grand Marnier was too tart. Our favorite was the
margarita made with Cointreau, which struck a good balance and
provided the brightest flavor.
</P>
<P>
   While the classic recipe doesn't call for sweet-and-sour mix,
many bartenders add it to their margaritas, and department tasters
found that adding about 1 tablespoon of the commercial mix made for
a better drink. In comparison, the one without it tasted a bit
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   As California food-lovers, we always proclaim the virtues of
fresh ingredients, so we were surprised that most of us preferred
the margarita made with Rose's sweetened lime juice rather than the
one made with freshly squeezed juice.
</P>
<P>
   While the bottled juice gave the margarita a neon color, the
drink was smoother and more balanced. On the other hand, the
fresh-juice margarita did have a markedly fresher taste. The extra
sweetness of the Rose's version, however, gave it the advantage. If
you want the sweetness but want to use fresh juice, mix the juice
with a simple syrup made with equal parts of sugar and water.
</P>
<P>
   All tequilas are not created equal. Fine sipping tequilas are
made with 100 percent blue agave, while less refined tequilas need
only contain 51 percent. We tested a margarita made with Herradura
Silver, a 100 percent blue agave tequila, against Cuervo Gold,
which includes added fermented cane juice. Though the Herradura is
a superior spirit, it does not necessarily make a superior
margarita. It tasted clean and crisp, but those staffers with a
penchant for sweets liked the added sugar in the Cuervo Gold
margarita. However, many bars use Cuervo Gold so it may be what
most people are used to.
</P>
<P>
   As a last test, we took our winning recipe and tried it two
ways: strained over crushed ice and blended. Here, personal
preference rules. Some like the refreshing iciness of the blended
margarita, likening it to an ``adult Sno-Kone.'' Others feel the
blended drink is too diluted and prefer the version on-the-rocks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There was no clear-cut favorite, but the following recipe was
the overall winner. Your own taste may call for alterations.

 Cook's Books: McNair Salutes the Wine Country   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the interest of full disclosure, I have to
preface this review with a confession: I am a devoted James McNair
fan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether this Renaissance man of the kitchen trains his sights on
newfangled pizzas or old-fashioned cakes, the resulting volumes are
everything a cookbook should be: precise and concise, easy to
follow, interesting without getting precious, and accessible for
the home cook.
</P>
<P>
   His latest _ number 35 _ is no exception, though it is somewhat
of a departure. As the title implies, ``The Sutter Home Napa Valley
Cookbook'' is a cooperative effort between the author and the
Trinchero family, the people who own Sutter Home Winery. While
McNair remains true to his usual style, many of the recipes hark to
the Trinchero clan's Italian heritage and some come from the
winery's in-house chef, Jeffrey Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a Napa Valley book, it is oriented toward wine (but no
overt pitch for Sutter Home or the costlier M. Trinchero wines).
Brief sidebars address wine topics (and some Trinchero/Sutter Home
history), and wine is an ingredient in many recipes. Other recipes
are for dishes with an affinity toward wine.
</P>
<P>
   A leg of lamb, for example, destined for the outdoor grill is
marinated in Zinfandel with rosemary, shallots, olive oil, Dijon
mustard, soy sauce, brown sugar and salt and pepper. It is served
with a fusion mint pesto that incorporates soy sauce, sesame oil,
garlic and roasted peanuts. Logically, the suggested accompanying
wine is Zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   Another lamb recipe, this one for braised shanks, has a
Mediterranean pedigree, including the finishing touch of
parsley-lemon zest-garlic  &LR; gremolata &LR; . Inspired by the same region,
Gina Trinchero Mee's sauteed shrimp with red and green peppers and
feta cheese doesn't take longer to fix than the time it takes to
cook the rice or couscous suggested to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuscany is the country of origin for the grape harvest flat
bread that is featured on the cover of the well-illustrated book.
Moderately sweet, this specialty from the Chianti region goes with
a late-afternoon glass of Pinot Noir as well as with morning
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to wait around for yeast dough to rise? You couldn't
do better than the peach and fig galettes, made with a rich
butter-and-egg-yolk pastry partially folded over the fresh fruit
filling.
</P>
<P>
   And for hot nights in the Napa Valley (or anywhere else), try
McNair's rich and luscious lavender gelato _ with or without the
suggested sparkling wine.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The Sutter Home Napa Valley Cookbook,'' by James McNair,
with &LR;   &LR; photographs by Zeva Oelbaum (Chronicle Books; 152 pages; &LR; 
 &LR; soft-cover; $22.95). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FRESH FIG &AMP; PEACH GALETTES
</P>
<P>
   While the combination of peaches and figs is especially nice,
James McNair says you can use just one of these fruits or
substitute other soft fruit such as raspberries or nectarines.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Tart Pastry
</P>
<P>
   31/2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons iced water
</P>
<P>
   Filling
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ripe figs, stemmed, cut lengthwise into halves or
quarters
</P>
<P>
   About 6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cornstarch, potato starch or quick-cooking tapioca
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Sugar for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Position racks in center of oven and preheat oven to 400
degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, sugar, salt, lemon zest and butter in food
processor. Pulse just until the mixture is well blended and
resembles cornmeal. With the machine running, add the yolks through
the feed tube, then add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until
the dough begins to gather into a shaggy mass.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, mix the dry ingredients with a pastry blender or
your fingertips; add the yolks and water with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, form the dough into a ball and divide into 6 or
8 pieces. Shape each piece into a disk and cover with a kitchen
towel or plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   One piece at a time, roll the dough out on a lightly floured
board into rounds about 1/8 inch thick (7 inch diameter if making 6
tarts). It is not necessary to trim any rough edges. Transfer to
the prepared sheets. Cover the baking sheets to keep the dough from
drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the peaches, figs, sugar to taste, starch or tapioca and
the vanilla, if using, and mix gently. Spoon the mixture onto the
center of the dough rounds, dividing equally and leaving a 2-inch
border. Bring the edges of the pastry up and over the fruit as far
as possible, leaving the fruit exposed in the center. Pinch the
dough to form pleats that make the pastry fit snugly around the
fruit. Sprinkle the exposed pastry generously with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the fruit is tender
and bubbling, about 25 minutes.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main

 The Working Cook: Wanderlust Leads to Pasta, Couscous and 
 Scaloppine  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; A friend just returned from a culinary tour of
Sicily, and her trip got me thinking about the olive oil- and
cannoli-filled trip I took there a few years ago with my father.
<P>
   My dad is also a ``food fiend,'' so we let our taste buds guide
our travels. In Agrigento, we couldn't resist having a second
cappuccino in a charming outdoor cafe and wound up missing a bus
that ran only once every few hours. And we stayed an extra day in
the not-so-interesting town of Trapani to revisit the  &LR; cuscusu &LR; 
(couscous) with fish we tasted at an amazing restaurant there.
</P>
<P>
   Our very first meal was in Palermo, behind a crumbling villa in
a courtyard lined with scraggly palm trees. We ordered Pasta alla
Norma, a local specialty supposedly created at the debut of the
eponymous opera by native son Puccini.
</P>
<P>
   This quintessential dish makes the most of the profusion of
produce that grows on the lush, hot island: robust globe eggplants,
plummy tomatoes, fresh basil. These usually are combined with penne
and ricotta salata, a dry version of ricotta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I won't be going back to Sicily any time soon. So
I created this week's Lasagna alla Norma, a baked version of my
favorite Sicilian dish. If I can't be in Sicily, at least I can eat
as if I were there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ricotta salata, my version has fresh ricotta inside
and grated pecorino on top. I also use roasted eggplant rather than
the traditional fried, which not only is healthier (much less oil)
but far easier to prepare in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   More in the Northern European tradition, Food Department intern
Andy Lax's Pork Scaloppine with Fennel, Apple &AMP; Cabbage is the kind
of recipe that takes little time and produces a lot of intricate
flavors. A hit of bourbon, cream and caraway adds depth to the
sauce, while the fennel and apple cider vinegar help cut through
any richness.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Chicken Sausages &AMP; Green Couscous came from my
colleague Karola Saekel. She uses seafood sausages instead of
chicken, but I found that their quality can vary from market to
market. If your store offers high-quality seafood sausages, the
fresh dill and lemon flavors in the couscous are a great match.
</P>

30-MINUTE MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   PORK SCALOPPINE WITH FENNEL, APPLE &AMP; CABBAGE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe was developed by Food Section intern Andy Lax. Some
grocers sell pork scaloppine (pounded thin like veal scaloppine).
If they don't, ask your butcher to prepare some for you, or buy
boneless pork chops and cut them lengthwise into thin pieces, about
1/4 inch thick. Sandwich each piece between two lengths of wax
paper. Pound gently until each slice is about 1/8 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 small apple
</P>
<P>
   1 small fennel bulb, fronds intact
</P>
<P>
   About 1/4 head red cabbage (1 cup sliced)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   8 pork scaloppine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup apple juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup bourbon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds fresh potato gnocchi (or vacuum-packed)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large pot with salted water and set over high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and core the apple, then cut into 1/2-inch dice.
</P>
<P>
   Core the fennel, reserving the lacy fronds. Cut the bulb into
thin crosswise slices.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cabbage into long, thin strips.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the onion.
</P>
<P>
   Set a skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Season the pork generously on both sides with salt and pepper.
Add to the skillet, working in batches if necessary, and cook until
almost done, about 30 seconds per side. Remove the pork from the
skillet and tent with foil to keep it warm.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add the
apple, fennel slices, the cabbage, onion and caraway seeds. Stir in
the sugar. Saute until the vegetables are softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the vegetables are cooking, chop about 11/2 tablespoons
fennel fronds and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the apple juice, bourbon and vinegar to the vegetables and
bring to a boil. Cook until the liquid has reduced and the mixture
has thickened slightly, about 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and
pepper. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the gnocchi into the pot of now-boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pork to the skillet to finish cooking, which should
take 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the gnocchi float, after about 30 seconds to 1 minute,
drain them.
</P>
<P>
   Portion the pork onto serving plates.
</P>
<P>
   Add the gnocchi to the skillet and toss with the vegetables.
Spoon onto the plates. Garnish with the chopped fennel fronds.

   LASAGNA alla NORMA
</P>
<P>
   The sausage in this recipe may be omitted, as the sauce,
vegetables and cheeses offer plenty of flavor on their own. To
freeze, assemble the lasagna and tightly wrap the portion you wish
to save for later, label it and place in the freezer. Bake the
other portion and serve for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 large globe eggplants
</P>
<P>
   Salt, as needed
</P>
<P>
   5 Italian sausages, casings removed (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil + olive oil to grease pans
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   3 yellow onions, cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   4 red bell peppers, deveined and cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   3 boxes (26 ounces each) Pomi chopped tomatoes, or equivalent
amount of canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch basil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   About 16 sheets lasagna noodles
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups grated pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the eggplants and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place the
slices in a colander, salting each layer. Weight with a heavy
object to extract the eggplants' bitter juices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Brown the sausages in a Dutch oven,
crumbling them into bite-size pieces. Remove from pan with a
slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to
the pan. Adjust heat to medium-low. Add the pepper flakes and
oregano; saute for 1 minute. Add the onions and saute for 5
minutes. Add the bell peppers and saute until tender, 10 to 15
minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease 2 large sheet pans (or more, as needed) with
olive oil. Transfer the eggplant slices to the sheet pans,
arranging them in a single layer. Season with salt. Roast for 15
minutes. Turn the slices over, return to the oven and roast until
tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly chop 6 basil leaves. Add them and the sausage to the
sauce and simmer a few minutes to combine flavors. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble: &LR;  Reduce oven temperature to 350. Spoon a little of
the sauce in two 9 x 13-inch casserole dishes, spreading it with
the back of the spoon to coat the bottom of the dishes. Layer one
quarter of the noodles in each casserole, top with eggplant slices,
more sauce, some ricotta and a few basil leaves. Repeat layering
with the remaining noodles, eggplant, sauce, ricotta and basil. Top
each casserole with grated pecorino.
</P>
<P>
   Bake uncovered until bubbly and golden, about 30 minutes. If the
cheese does not brown in the oven, place under the broiler for a
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 Food In The News: Giant Food Portions Equal Giant People   By Kim Severson 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The culprit behind America's weight problem may
not be what we eat but how much we eat.
<P>
   Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the
nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a
leading cause of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much
higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a
registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer
Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link
between diet and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from
an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the
average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002. If
exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of
15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major reason people are getting bigger,'' Polk says, ``is
that their servings have gotten larger, and commercial food
portions are a major culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   French fries from McDonald's offer a clear example of the
phenomenon. An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26
grams of fat. When the company began selling french fries in the
1950s, a small order _ the only one available _ had 220 calories
and 12 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also  &LR; recently &LR;  surveyed croissants &LR; , quesadillas &LR; 
and bagels, popular  &LR; American &LR;  foods adopted from other countries.
In each case, the item grew in size and calories when it was
adapted for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an
ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference. The typical
American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures
181/2 inches. And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar
and fat, Polk says.
</P>
<P>
   The bagel, seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast
pastries, has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe. Even in
its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its
European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces. But today some bagels
have more than doubled in size. National bagel-maker Lender offers
a 41/2-ounce ``Big and Crusty'' bagel; Dunkin Donuts' plain bagel
is four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   And people rarely eat bagels plain. Adding fat-laden spreads
like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content. And
the bigger the bagel, the more spread it can take.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their
immigration from Mexico, Polk says. Small corn tortillas filled
with potato, cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico, and
cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour
tortilla filled with cheese. Polk estimates the typical
American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70
grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In other studies, nutritionists and researchers are nudging
out the concept of ``bad foods'' like soda and fat in favor of
focusing on the huge portion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers
from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that
overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared,
carbonated soft drinks than than children who weren't overweight,
and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood
obesity, then we should point our fingers at the real culprits _
huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity,'' says
Maureen Storey of the &LR; Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to eliminate certain foods isn't a practical way to help
children or adults lose weight, she says. ``We should get over this
good food-bad food silliness and move on.''

 At The Source: Getting the Short Skinny On Long Beans  By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Whoever named them yard-long beans was
exaggerating, but not by much. Although growers say these slender
beans can indeed reach three feet, a true yard-long specimen is a
rare sight.
<P>
   Still, the 18- to 24-inch beans are long enough to make them a
curiosity to consumers who grew up on Blue Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, yard-long beans _ also known as Chinese long beans _
aren't even related to the familiar garden green bean. They're a
sister to black-eyed peas, and like those Southern specialties,
they prefer hot weather. In California, they're grown primarily in
Fresno County by Hmong farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong refugees from Laos who settled in the Central Valley
20 years ago brought a knowledge of long beans with them. Farmers
in their home country, they began farming here, too, growing the
crops they knew and needed for their own cooking. County extension
agents like Richard Molinar in Fresno County helped them establish
farms and master American-style marketing and distribution. At one
point, there were 80,000 Hmong in Fresno County alone.
</P>
<P>
   The county still has more Hmong, more Hmong farmers (about
1,000) and more acreage in long beans than any other county in the
state, says Molinar. But the numbers are declining. Lured by
higher-paying technical jobs in Minnesota and elsewhere, many Hmong
are leaving agriculture and California behind, and Fresno's Hmong
population has fallen to between 30,000 and 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The county's long-bean acreage has plummeted, too, from 450
acres in 1990 to 119 acres last year. Molinar believes that's a
function of low demand and poor return. An acre planted to long
beans might yield $2,000 to $3,000, with plenty of hand labor
required; an acre of cherry tomatoes or lemongrass might gross
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers who love long beans' crisp-chewy texture and meaty
taste, these numbers are sobering. Still, some supermarkets and
specialty produce markets carry them; Asian markets always do, and
in summer you'll also find them at many farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Most growers plant the familiar dark-green variety, but you may
also spot pale-green, purple and reddish long beans. Michael Yang,
who is Hmong and an assistant to Molinar, says the dark-green beans
are somewhat sweeter and longer-lasting; the other varieties are
more delicate and more prone to swift decline. Produce cookbook
author Elizabeth Schneider suggests using the pale beans for quick
cooking, the darker green ones for braising.
</P>
<P>
   Yang says Hmong often eat the beans raw, in green papaya salad
or as a snack. But they also are commonly stir-fried with bits of
pork or chicken and seasonings, or deep-fried, as in the Sichuan
recipe for ``dry-fried'' beans.
</P>
<P>
   Food writer Grace Young says long beans are one of the only
vegetables that Chinese women are supposed to eat after childbirth
because the beans are neutral _ neither yin, nor yang. Peruse an
Italian seed catalog and you may find long beans there, too; in
Puglia, cooks braise them in tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   California farmers plant long beans from April to June and
harvest them from July to November. They are a pole variety, grown
on trellises and hand harvested.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, don't expect long beans to be firm, like Blue
Lake beans. They are always somewhat floppy and flexible, but they
shouldn't be limp. Avoid any that are excessively blemished,
rusty-looking or withered. At home, store them in a loose plastic
bag in the refrigerator crisper and use them as soon as possible;
they are not long keepers. Trim the ends, then cut the beans into
desired lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Long beans usually are not blanched before cooking, but rather
are stir-fried from the dry state. Low in calories, high in vitamin
A and richly flavored, they are a vegetable worth getting to know.

LAX MILITARY SECURITY PERMITTED BOMBINGS IN CHECHNYA, RUSSIAN
OFFICIAL SAYS  
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Negligence by Russian commanders enabled Chechen
suicide bombers to carry out the devastating attacks on Sunday that
killed more than 30 soldiers, the chief of Russia's intelligence
service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Patrushev, the director of the Federal Security Service,
said that his agency had alerted the Russian military that
terrorist attacks were being planned but that the military had
failed to take proper precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mistake on the part of commanders in the field,''
he said. ``We have to act in a coordinated fashion to prevent such
things from happening in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Five trucks loaded with munitions exploded in Chechnya Sunday
night, catching the Russian military by surprise and shocking the
nation. Russian officials on Tuesday put the final toll at 33 dead,
84 wounded and three missing.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to restore control over Chechnya's towns and settlements,
Russian officials on Tuesday issued a ``shoot on sight'' order for
any vehicle that breached a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. New
checkpoints have been set up, and many Chechen residents were
reportedly staying at home.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people have been detained, but it is not clear if the
Russian authorities have found any of those who organized the
bombings. In Moscow, the authorities ordered the police to take
special precautions against terrorist bombings.

buildings in September helped build public support for the war.
Russian officials said then that the rebels were to blame, but
there is no conclusive proof of their role.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sunday bombings, most of the casualties were in Argun, a
town east of Grozny, where a truck bomb slammed into a dormitory
occupied by a militia unit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite terrorist alerts, there was no concrete barrier or other
obstacle to stop the truck from approaching the building.
</P>
<P>
   Providing new details of that attack, Russian television
reported Tuesday night that 22 militia members had been killed in
that attack and 48 wounded. Many of the dead and wounded were
buried under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   After the bomb exploded, Chechen snipers began shooting at the
building, and a gunfight continued for one-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials agreed that negligence was a factor,
they said that it was the fault of local commanders, not Gen. Ivan
Babichev, the military commandant of Chechnya.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The destruction in Argun ``resulted from the failure to comply
with an order by General Babichev that additional security measures
were to be taken,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the senior Russian
government spokesman on the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to put the best face on a worsening situation, Akhmad
Kadyrov, the Russian-appointed administrator of Chechnya, described
the bombings as a desperate act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebel leaders are seriously concerned that the people have
lately begun to nurture hope for Chechnya's peaceful development,''
Kadyrov told the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Others took a more pessimistic view. Boris Berezovsky, the media
tycoon and a parliamentary deputy who represents a region in the
North Caucasus, said that Russia would not be able to win a
military victory in Chechnya. During the Yeltsin administration,
Berezovsky served as a negotiator in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the jingoists' loud statements, most of Russian
society believes the war in Chechnya is leading our country to
defeat,'' he said. ``There can be no military victory in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chechnya, it is necessary to reach an agreement with the
most extremist element of the Chechen population, as well. If the
political process is dragged out, it will be hard on Russia,
including our president's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept a low profile in
recent days and has little to say about the bombing attacks, which
have challenged the Kremlin's claims to control the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, for their part, were more vocal. They promised more
attacks, warning civilians to move away from Russian bases and
command posts.
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord, demanded that Russian
authorities hand over a Russian officer accused of the rape and
murder of a Chechen woman, according to a Chechen spokesman,
Movladi Udogov. Otherwise, he vowed, there would be more bombing
attacks.

 The Fifth Flavor: Elusive taste dimension can mean the
difference  between balance and blah   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Your restaurant lunch arrives and for once the
Caesar salad is perfect. Crisp hearts of romaine, faintly sweet
with a bitter edge; tangy lemon; a shower of Parmesan; and that
salty and intensely savory background note of anchovy.
<P>
   Sweet, sour, salty, bitter _ all four primary tastes are in
impeccable balance. But according to a growing number of chefs and
scientists, it's a fifth taste _ the almost indescribable
savoriness of anchovy and aged cheese _ that makes Caesar salad and
many other dishes taste so good.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, chefs, food professionals and scientists are
acknowledging the existence and impact of umami, that
hard-to-define fifth taste. Earlier this year, neuroscientists at
the University of Miami reported finding the taste-bud receptors
for umami, effectively validating its existence and the human
ability to taste it.
</P>
<P>
   For some chefs, a growing awareness of umami is changing the way
they approach cooking, and at least one wine expert says the
``fifth taste'' has dramatic implications for wine and food
pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the flavor itself, umami is hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that meaty, mouthfilling, savory sensation,'' says Marcia
Pelchat, a sensory psychologist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But like the heat in a chile pepper, umami has an identifiable
and measurable source. In 1908, a Japanese researcher at Tokyo
Imperial University traced the savory taste primarily to
L-glutamate, an amino acid found in high-protein foods such as
meat, milk, mushrooms and seafood. In consumer language, this
chemical is the controversial monosodium glutamate (MSG), which
occurs naturally in many foods. To produce the savory quality, the
glutamate must be present in free form, not bound with other amino
acids.
</P>
<P>
   By this clinical definition, it is possible to determine in a
laboratory that Danish blue cheese has more umami than a hot dog,
that shiitake mushrooms have more umami than onions. Aging, curing
and fermenting enhance umami. So does ripeness. A dry-aged steak
has more umami than fresh hamburger, to no one's surprise. A ripe
nectarine has more measurable free glutamates than an unripe one.
And two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano is practically off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Other common foods high in umami include anchovies, the fish
sauce used in Southeast Asian cooking ( &LR; nam pla &LR;  in Thai,  &LR; nuoc
mam &LR;  in Vietnamese) and other fermented fish products, fresh
tomatoes, grapefruit (it has more free glutamates than other
citrus), soy sauce, dried seaweed, cooked potatoes, green tea,
Gruy &LR; e &LR; re cheese and fresh clams.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pelchat, umami is so much a part of our sensory
experience of eating meat that if you add MSG, salt and yellow food
coloring to boiling water, ``You can make people think they're
eating chicken broth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The human desire for umami is profound, experts say. In many
cultures, fermented shrimp paste or fish sauce provide the umami
element that diners &LR; taste buds crave.
</P>
<P>
   When meat became scarce in Australia during World War I, the
food industry created Vegemite, a high-umami product made from
spent yeast in brewing beer. It has become a national favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the food industry has been convinced for many years
that umami exists,'' says Nirupa Chaudhari, one of the University
of Miami scientists who identified the umami taste receptor. That's
why snack-food manufacturers routinely add hydrolyzed proteins, a
form of glutamate, to their products. ``That's what generates the
umami taste,'' says Chaudhari, and keeps people buying more.
</P>
<P>
   But is umami a fifth taste? For a long time, scientists
disagreed whether umami was a primary taste on a par with sweet,
sour, bitter and salty. (A primary taste, by definition, can't be
produced from a combination of other tastes.) Because umami
substances tend to be aromatic _ as in sauteed mushrooms or a
grilled steak _ some thought umami might have an odor component.
But when studies showed that umami substances could produce
electrical signals in taste nerves, the scientific community began
to embrace it as a fifth taste, Pelchat says.
</P>
<P>
   To many chefs, however, umami is more philosophical than
empirical, an approach to food and cooking that has its roots in
Zen Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A food has umami when it has become all that it can be,''
writes Jon Rowley, a Seattle food consultant. The Japanese, who
talked and wrote about umami long before scientists knew how to
measure it, have a hard time translating it into English. ``They
use words like taste, flavor, deliciousness and essence,'' Rowley
says, ``but then they will say, `But that's not it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley chef David Vardy, who has lived in Japan, calls umami
the essence of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of umami is one of fullness, of food reaching its
capacity,'' says Vardy, the chef-owner of O Chame. ``It's like your
idea of the perfect taste. If you take strawberries picked from
different places, you'll find one that is the umami of
strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese imbue umami with a metaphorical meaning beyond
food, Rowley says. A good stock tip can have umami.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the measurable umami that has induced some chefs to
reconsider their cooking and some experts to rethink the rules of
wine and food pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody came to me 10 years ago and said, `Here, put some
fish sauce in (your dish),' I'd smell it and say they were crazy,''
says Bill Briwa, chef-instructor at the Culinary Institute of
America at Greystone in St. Helena. ``Now I'm in love with the
stuff, and I know plenty of people who put it into bouillabaisse or
Caesar salad dressing. We're discovering that quality that makes
your mouth water, that makes you want to take another bite. It's
more than just salt.''
</P>
<P>
   For other chefs, the awareness of umami validates long-held
beliefs and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been cooking for 25 years,'' says Gary Jenanyan, a chef
and consultant in the Napa Valley, ``but it wasn't until two years
ago that I learned there was a reason why some foods had this other
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenanyan mentions Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, lobster and
Roquefort cheese _ all high in umami _ as foods that have
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they're in more vivid color,'' says the
chef. Before he knew about umami, he would add these ingredients to
dishes to help fill a flavor hole. Now he knows why they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say, `This dish needs that dimension.' If it's
possible, I'll add some cheese to it, or scallops, or wild
mushrooms. If I'm not thinking about umami, I'm not getting as far
as I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tim Hanni, a Master of Wine who spent 11 years lecturing on
wine and food pairing for Beringer Vineyards, umami has been a
life-changing discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Hanni believes that if a dish is perfectly balanced between all
five tastes, it will go with any wine. When a dish compromises the
taste of a wine, it's usually because the dish is too high in umami
or sweetness. Those two flavor elements make wines taste stronger,
heightening tannin or bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Take boiled shrimp with tomato-based cocktail sauce, for
example. It's a dish high in both sweetness and umami. Hanni pours
a pleasant, moderately tannic Zinfandel with the shrimp _ a choice
that most experts would deem a disaster _ and, indeed, the wine's
tannin is overemphasized. But by adding salt and lime juice to the
cocktail sauce to balance the umami and sweetness, Hanni gets the
Zinfandel to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuscans instinctively understand this, Hanni says. Consider
the classic  &LR; bistecca alla Fiorentina &LR;  _ a well-seasoned steak
served with a wedge of lemon. Without salt and acid on the beef,
the accompanying Chianti would taste too tannic.
</P>
<P>
   Now an independent consultant, Hanni says this approach is
revolutionary for consumers and the wine industry. If chefs would
just balance their dishes in the kitchen, keeping umami in check,
diners could happily order whatever bottle appealed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost sight of how easy it is for dishes to be delicious
with wine,'' says Hanni, who encourages consumers to do the
doctoring at the table _ adding a squeeze of lemon or rice vinegar,
or a dash of salt or soy sauce _ if their dinner makes their
favorite wine too aggressive. Alternatively, diners can resort to a
pinch of sugar if an overly acidic dish makes the wine seem to lose
its fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him do his demo, I was very skeptical,''
Pelchat says. ``We know through rigorous scientific study that salt
will block bitterness, but those studies were done in the lab with
solutions. (Hanni's theory) is that salt in food improves the
flavor in wine, and I think he has something there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, executive chef Sarah
Scott says Hanni's principles have changed the way she cooks. In
her pre-umami days, Scott says she studiously tried to contrive a
bridge between wine and food _ adding tarragon to a seafood dish
served with Chardonnay, for example, or mushrooms to a beef dish
destined for Pinot Noir. Such efforts now seem forced and
unnecessary. Instead, she concentrates on balancing all five
flavors, convinced that a balanced dish will go with anything.
</P>
<P>
   She points to a dish of seared scallops with a confit of leeks
and cream. The scallops are sweet, full of umami, with a bitter
edge from the searing. The leeks are sweet and salty. To balance
the dish, she adds a squeeze of lemon just before serving and
perhaps a pinch of sea salt. That final correction with lemon and
salt has become almost a habit, says Scott, and she sees other
chefs doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had (New York City chef) Jean-Georges Vongerichten
here,'' says Scott. ``That guy never said the word umami, but his
cooking reflected exactly what this is about. Before each dish went
out, he added a bit of acid, a bit of salt. Each dish had a little
sweet, sour, bitter. We never thought about the wines, about how to
make this dish go with that wine. It just went because his food was
perfectly balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott calls this ``the liberated enjoyment'' of wine with food
because it frees the diner from worrying about a bad marriage. Now
the onus is on chefs to achieve balance, and on consumers to
suspend their firmly held beliefs about what goes with what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke about `tongue shui,' '' Scott says. ``You've got to
understand all the elements and line them up just right. It's a
little radical in a way. It is simplifying things a lot, but it's a
complicated route to get simple again.''

THAI SEAFOOD IN CURRIED COCONUT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   In this recipe from wine consultant Tim Hanni, Hanni
demonstrates how changing the balance of a dish alters your
perception of wine. Serve with steamed jasmine rice or as a seafood
sauce on top of grilled salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Thai red curry paste
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
</P>
<P>
   2 limes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, or 1 pound scallops
</P>
<P>
   1 cup medium-diced mango
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the coconut milk, curry paste, garlic, ginger, 2
tablespoons of the nam pla and juice of 1 lime in a saucepan. Cook
over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and simmer for
5 minutes until they turn pink and are cooked through. Add the
mango and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the dish with the wine of your choice (a wine that you
generally find delicious in the first place). You probably will
find that the wine becomes less fruity, more bitter, astringent and
acidic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, balance the dish for wine: Stir in the remaining 1
tablespoon nam pla, the juice of the second lime and the rice
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Try the same wine with the dish again and notice how the
fruitiness has returned to the wine and the bitterness, astringency
and acidity have been tempered, thus returning the wine to its
original balance.

<P>
   Wine consultant Tim Hanni has altered a basic chocolate mousse
recipe by adding balsamic vinegar _ high in umami and acid _ to
make it more compatible with wine. Hanni says that during their
tests, the mousse matched well with Pinot Noir, late-harvest
Riesling and Chardonnay, and that the Pinot, which was mediocre to
begin with, was improved by the mousse.

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 pint heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the espresso powder, salt, vinegars and cream in a
stainless-steel bowl. Beat until the mixture holds medium-stiff
peaks. Set aside in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the egg whites and sugar in a mixing bowl. Place over
simmering water and heat to 140 degrees, whisking constantly to
prevent the egg whites from cooking. Remove from heat and beat
until the whites form soft peaks. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely
simmering water, stirring frequently so the chocolate will melt
evenly. Remove from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the corn syrup to boiling. Whisk the egg yolks to break
them up, then gradually pour the hot syrup into the yolks while
whisking constantly. Whisk until the mixture is thick and fluffy.
Fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   Fold one third of egg whites into the chocolate to lighten it,
then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Quickly fold in the
whipped cream, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl to
incorporate all the chocolate mixture.

CLEAR SOUP WITH SHIITAKE AND MITSUBA
</P>
<P>
   Seaweed and dried bonito are naturally high in umami. From chef
David Vardy of O Chame restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   One 3 x 4-inch piece of dried kombu seaweed
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts + 3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   31/2 ounces shaved dried bonito flakes (may also include sardine
and mackerel)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Japanese soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup mirin (sweet cooking wine)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch mitsuba (trefoil)
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 kumquat, finely grated
</P>
<P>
   4 large or 6 medium-size fresh shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Make the Soup:  &LR; Combine the seaweed and water in a large
pot and slowly bring just to the boiling point. Remove from heat
and remove the kombu. (The kombu acts the way bones do in Western
stocks, creating a kind of suspension in the water that enhances
the flavor of the bonito flakes. If the water is boiled, this
suspension will not occur.)
</P>
<P>
   Add the bonito flakes and bring the liquid back up to the
boiling point. Quickly skim to remove any scum, then remove from
heat. Let stand for about 30 seconds, then strain through
cheesecloth or a fine sieve.
</P>
<P>
   Return this dashi (stock) to moderate heat. Add the soy sauce,
salt and mirin. Simmer briefly to cook off the alcohol. The soup
may be cooled and refrigerated at this point and reheated at
serving time.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch the mitsuba in boiling unsalted water for a few seconds,
then plunge into ice water to chill. Drain and cut into 1/2-inch
pieces, including the stems and leaves. Divide the mitsuba equally
among serving bowls. Add a pinch of kumquat zest to each bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the shiitakes as thinly as possible just before serving.
Heat the soup to a slow simmer, then add the shiitake slices. Cook
until the white part of the mushrooms becomes almost translucent,
30 seconds to a few minutes, depending on thickness. Add the green
onion, then ladle the soup into the bowls.

<P>
   &UR; To make the caponata:  &LR; Sprinkle the eggplant with salt and
drain in a colander for about 20 minutes. Pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over
moderate heat. Add the bell peppers, celery and shallots. Saute
until softened, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer
the vegetables to a bowl. Wash the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Return the clean skillet to moderate heat. Add the remaining 2
tablespoons olive oil. When hot, add the eggplant and cook,
stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the cooked vegetables to the skillet and stir in the
vinegar-sugar mixture, the tomatoes, tomato paste, capers and
anchovies. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until the ingredients are fully cooked,
about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the parsley
and drizzle in extra virgin olive oil to taste. You may also need
to add more vinegar if the caponata is not tart enough.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool until barely warm or room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas
grill. Brush the herb mixture off the lamb, then season the lamb
with salt and pepper. Grill the chops over direct heat to sear,
then move to indirect heat to complete the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the lamb with caponata alongside.

GRILLED TUNA NICOISE SALAD WITH TARRAGON MAYONNAISE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from Sarah Scott, chef at Robert Mondavi Winery,
demonstrates her belief that balancing umami ingredients, such as
tuna, with lemon and salt can create a dish that doesn't alter the
taste of a wine.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Tarragon Mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg + 1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 to 2 cups olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
</P>
<P>
   The Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small red potatoes (creamers) or small Yukon Gold
potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound green beans
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound yellow wax beans
</P>
<P>
   4 tuna steaks, about 11/4 inches thick and 3 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, as needed
</P>
<P>
   1 head frisee, torn into salad-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula, torn into salad-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   Lemon juice, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pint basket cherry tomatoes (mixed colors), halved
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, halved and very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup nicoise or kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 hard-cooked eggs, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Prepare the tarragon mayonnaise:  &LR; Place the garlic in a
food processor and process until finely chopped. Stop the machine
and add the egg, egg yolk, tarragon vinegar and lemon juice.
Process 30 seconds, then, with the motor running, begin adding
olive oil gradually through the feed tube until the mayonnaise
reaches desired consistency. Taste for seasoning; add salt and
pepper as needed. Add the tarragon and process until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the salad:  &LR; Steam or boil the potatoes in salted water
until tender. Drain and cool, then slice medium-thin.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the green beans and wax beans in salted water until tender.
Drain and transfer to ice water until cool. Drain again and pat
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. Brush
the tuna steaks with olive oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the frisee and arugula in a bowl; drizzle with lemon
juice and olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bed of greens on each serving plate. Divide the sliced
potatoes, beans, cherry tomatoes, red onion, olives and eggs
attractively on the plates.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the tuna close to the heat to sear, 2 to 3 minutes, then
turn and repeat on the second side. The tuna should still be rosy
in the center. Remove from the grill, squeeze a little lemon juice
over the tuna and sprinkle with a little salt.
</P>
<P>
   Place a tuna steak in the center of each plate and top with a
dollop of tarragon mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 The Fifth Flavor: Elusive taste dimension can mean the
difference  between balance and blah   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Your restaurant lunch arrives and for once the
Caesar salad is perfect. Crisp hearts of romaine, faintly sweet
with a bitter edge; tangy lemon; a shower of Parmesan; and that
salty and intensely savory background note of anchovy.
<P>
   Sweet, sour, salty, bitter _ all four primary tastes are in
impeccable balance. But according to a growing number of chefs and
scientists, it's a fifth taste _ the almost indescribable
savoriness of anchovy and aged cheese _ that makes Caesar salad and
many other dishes taste so good.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, chefs, food professionals and scientists are
acknowledging the existence and impact of umami, that
hard-to-define fifth taste. Earlier this year, neuroscientists at
the University of Miami reported finding the taste-bud receptors
for umami, effectively validating its existence and the human
ability to taste it.
</P>
<P>
   For some chefs, a growing awareness of umami is changing the way
they approach cooking, and at least one wine expert says the
``fifth taste'' has dramatic implications for wine and food
pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the flavor itself, umami is hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that meaty, mouthfilling, savory sensation,'' says Marcia
Pelchat, a sensory psychologist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But like the heat in a chile pepper, umami has an identifiable
and measurable source. In 1908, a Japanese researcher at Tokyo
Imperial University traced the savory taste primarily to
L-glutamate, an amino acid found in high-protein foods such as
meat, milk, mushrooms and seafood. In consumer language, this
chemical is the controversial monosodium glutamate (MSG), which
occurs naturally in many foods. To produce the savory quality, the
glutamate must be present in free form, not bound with other amino
acids.
</P>
<P>
   By this clinical definition, it is possible to determine in a
laboratory that Danish blue cheese has more umami than a hot dog,
that shiitake mushrooms have more umami than onions. Aging, curing
and fermenting enhance umami. So does ripeness. A dry-aged steak
has more umami than fresh hamburger, to no one's surprise. A ripe
nectarine has more measurable free glutamates than an unripe one.
And two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano is practically off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Other common foods high in umami include anchovies, the fish
sauce used in Southeast Asian cooking ( &LR; nam pla &LR;  in Thai,  &LR; nuoc
mam &LR;  in Vietnamese) and other fermented fish products, fresh
tomatoes, grapefruit (it has more free glutamates than other
citrus), soy sauce, dried seaweed, cooked potatoes, green tea,
Gruy &LR; e &LR; re cheese and fresh clams.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pelchat, umami is so much a part of our sensory
experience of eating meat that if you add MSG, salt and yellow food
coloring to boiling water, ``You can make people think they're
eating chicken broth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The human desire for umami is profound, experts say. In many
cultures, fermented shrimp paste or fish sauce provide the umami
element that diners &LR; taste buds crave.
</P>
<P>
   When meat became scarce in Australia during World War I, the
food industry created Vegemite, a high-umami product made from
spent yeast in brewing beer. It has become a national favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the food industry has been convinced for many years
that umami exists,'' says Nirupa Chaudhari, one of the University
of Miami scientists who identified the umami taste receptor. That's
why snack-food manufacturers routinely add hydrolyzed proteins, a
form of glutamate, to their products. ``That's what generates the
umami taste,'' says Chaudhari, and keeps people buying more.
</P>
<P>
   But is umami a fifth taste? For a long time, scientists
disagreed whether umami was a primary taste on a par with sweet,
sour, bitter and salty. (A primary taste, by definition, can't be
produced from a combination of other tastes.) Because umami
substances tend to be aromatic _ as in sauteed mushrooms or a
grilled steak _ some thought umami might have an odor component.
But when studies showed that umami substances could produce
electrical signals in taste nerves, the scientific community began
to embrace it as a fifth taste, Pelchat says.
</P>
<P>
   To many chefs, however, umami is more philosophical than
empirical, an approach to food and cooking that has its roots in
Zen Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A food has umami when it has become all that it can be,''
writes Jon Rowley, a Seattle food consultant. The Japanese, who
talked and wrote about umami long before scientists knew how to
measure it, have a hard time translating it into English. ``They
use words like taste, flavor, deliciousness and essence,'' Rowley
says, ``but then they will say, `But that's not it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley chef David Vardy, who has lived in Japan, calls umami
the essence of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of umami is one of fullness, of food reaching its
capacity,'' says Vardy, the chef-owner of O Chame. ``It's like your
idea of the perfect taste. If you take strawberries picked from
different places, you'll find one that is the umami of
strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese imbue umami with a metaphorical meaning beyond
food, Rowley says. A good stock tip can have umami.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the measurable umami that has induced some chefs to
reconsider their cooking and some experts to rethink the rules of
wine and food pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody came to me 10 years ago and said, `Here, put some
fish sauce in (your dish),' I'd smell it and say they were crazy,''
says Bill Briwa, chef-instructor at the Culinary Institute of
America at Greystone in St. Helena. ``Now I'm in love with the
stuff, and I know plenty of people who put it into bouillabaisse or
Caesar salad dressing. We're discovering that quality that makes
your mouth water, that makes you want to take another bite. It's
more than just salt.''
</P>
<P>
   For other chefs, the awareness of umami validates long-held
beliefs and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been cooking for 25 years,'' says Gary Jenanyan, a chef
and consultant in the Napa Valley, ``but it wasn't until two years
ago that I learned there was a reason why some foods had this other
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenanyan mentions Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, lobster and
Roquefort cheese _ all high in umami _ as foods that have
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they're in more vivid color,'' says the
chef. Before he knew about umami, he would add these ingredients to
dishes to help fill a flavor hole. Now he knows why they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say, `This dish needs that dimension.' If it's
possible, I'll add some cheese to it, or scallops, or wild
mushrooms. If I'm not thinking about umami, I'm not getting as far
as I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tim Hanni, a Master of Wine who spent 11 years lecturing on
wine and food pairing for Beringer Vineyards, umami has been a
life-changing discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Hanni believes that if a dish is perfectly balanced between all
five tastes, it will go with any wine. When a dish compromises the
taste of a wine, it's usually because the dish is too high in umami
or sweetness. Those two flavor elements make wines taste stronger,
heightening tannin or bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Take boiled shrimp with tomato-based cocktail sauce, for
example. It's a dish high in both sweetness and umami. Hanni pours
a pleasant, moderately tannic Zinfandel with the shrimp _ a choice
that most experts would deem a disaster _ and, indeed, the wine's
tannin is overemphasized. But by adding salt and lime juice to the
cocktail sauce to balance the umami and sweetness, Hanni gets the
Zinfandel to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuscans instinctively understand this, Hanni says. Consider
the classic  &LR; bistecca alla Fiorentina &LR;  _ a well-seasoned steak
served with a wedge of lemon. Without salt and acid on the beef,
the accompanying Chianti would taste too tannic.
</P>
<P>
   Now an independent consultant, Hanni says this approach is
revolutionary for consumers and the wine industry. If chefs would
just balance their dishes in the kitchen, keeping umami in check,
diners could happily order whatever bottle appealed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost sight of how easy it is for dishes to be delicious
with wine,'' says Hanni, who encourages consumers to do the
doctoring at the table _ adding a squeeze of lemon or rice vinegar,
or a dash of salt or soy sauce _ if their dinner makes their
favorite wine too aggressive. Alternatively, diners can resort to a
pinch of sugar if an overly acidic dish makes the wine seem to lose
its fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him do his demo, I was very skeptical,''
Pelchat says. ``We know through rigorous scientific study that salt
will block bitterness, but those studies were done in the lab with
solutions. (Hanni's theory) is that salt in food improves the
flavor in wine, and I think he has something there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, executive chef Sarah
Scott says Hanni's principles have changed the way she cooks. In
her pre-umami days, Scott says she studiously tried to contrive a
bridge between wine and food _ adding tarragon to a seafood dish
served with Chardonnay, for example, or mushrooms to a beef dish
destined for Pinot Noir. Such efforts now seem forced and
unnecessary. Instead, she concentrates on balancing all five
flavors, convinced that a balanced dish will go with anything.
</P>
<P>
   She points to a dish of seared scallops with a confit of leeks
and cream. The scallops are sweet, full of umami, with a bitter
edge from the searing. The leeks are sweet and salty. To balance
the dish, she adds a squeeze of lemon just before serving and
perhaps a pinch of sea salt. That final correction with lemon and
salt has become almost a habit, says Scott, and she sees other
chefs doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had (New York City chef) Jean-Georges Vongerichten
here,'' says Scott. ``That guy never said the word umami, but his
cooking reflected exactly what this is about. Before each dish went
out, he added a bit of acid, a bit of salt. Each dish had a little
sweet, sour, bitter. We never thought about the wines, about how to
make this dish go with that wine. It just went because his food was
perfectly balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott calls this ``the liberated enjoyment'' of wine with food
because it frees the diner from worrying about a bad marriage. Now
the onus is on chefs to achieve balance, and on consumers to
suspend their firmly held beliefs about what goes with what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke about `tongue shui,' '' Scott says. ``You've got to
understand all the elements and line them up just right. It's a
little radical in a way. It is simplifying things a lot, but it's a
complicated route to get simple again.''

</P>
<P>
   _ Taste the dish just before serving, and add a squeeze of lemon
and a dash of salt to bring out full flavors.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the table, add some lemon or rice vinegar, and salt or soy

THAI SEAFOOD IN CURRIED COCONUT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   In this recipe from wine consultant Tim Hanni, Hanni
demonstrates how changing the balance of a dish alters your
perception of wine. Serve with steamed jasmine rice or as a seafood
sauce on top of grilled salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Thai red curry paste
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
</P>
<P>
   2 limes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, or 1 pound scallops
</P>
<P>
   1 cup medium-diced mango
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the coconut milk, curry paste, garlic, ginger, 2
tablespoons of the nam pla and juice of 1 lime in a saucepan. Cook
over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and simmer for
5 minutes until they turn pink and are cooked through. Add the
mango and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the dish with the wine of your choice (a wine that you
generally find delicious in the first place). You probably will
find that the wine becomes less fruity, more bitter, astringent and
acidic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, balance the dish for wine: Stir in the remaining 1
tablespoon nam pla, the juice of the second lime and the rice
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Try the same wine with the dish again and notice how the
fruitiness has returned to the wine and the bitterness, astringency
and acidity have been tempered, thus returning the wine to its
original balance.

<P>
   Wine consultant Tim Hanni has altered a basic chocolate mousse
recipe by adding balsamic vinegar _ high in umami and acid _ to
make it more compatible with wine. Hanni says that during their
tests, the mousse matched well with Pinot Noir, late-harvest
Riesling and Chardonnay, and that the Pinot, which was mediocre to
begin with, was improved by the mousse.

<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 pint heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the espresso powder, salt, vinegars and cream in a
stainless-steel bowl. Beat until the mixture holds medium-stiff
peaks. Set aside in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the egg whites and sugar in a mixing bowl. Place over
simmering water and heat to 140 degrees, whisking constantly to
prevent the egg whites from cooking. Remove from heat and beat
until the whites form soft peaks. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely
simmering water, stirring frequently so the chocolate will melt
evenly. Remove from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the corn syrup to boiling. Whisk the egg yolks to break
them up, then gradually pour the hot syrup into the yolks while
whisking constantly. Whisk until the mixture is thick and fluffy.
Fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   Fold one third of egg whites into the chocolate to lighten it,
then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Quickly fold in the
whipped cream, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl to
incorporate all the chocolate mixture.

CLEAR SOUP WITH SHIITAKE AND MITSUBA
</P>
<P>
   Seaweed and dried bonito are naturally high in umami. From chef
David Vardy of O Chame restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   One 3 x 4-inch piece of dried kombu seaweed
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts + 3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   31/2 ounces shaved dried bonito flakes (may also include sardine
and mackerel)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Japanese soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup mirin (sweet cooking wine)
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch mitsuba (trefoil)
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 kumquat, finely grated
</P>
<P>
   4 large or 6 medium-size fresh shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Make the Soup:  &LR; Combine the seaweed and water in a large
pot and slowly bring just to the boiling point. Remove from heat
and remove the kombu. (The kombu acts the way bones do in Western
stocks, creating a kind of suspension in the water that enhances
the flavor of the bonito flakes. If the water is boiled, this
suspension will not occur.)
</P>
<P>
   Add the bonito flakes and bring the liquid back up to the
boiling point. Quickly skim to remove any scum, then remove from
heat. Let stand for about 30 seconds, then strain through
cheesecloth or a fine sieve.
</P>
<P>
   Return this dashi (stock) to moderate heat. Add the soy sauce,
salt and mirin. Simmer briefly to cook off the alcohol. The soup
may be cooled and refrigerated at this point and reheated at
serving time.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch the mitsuba in boiling unsalted water for a few seconds,
then plunge into ice water to chill. Drain and cut into 1/2-inch
pieces, including the stems and leaves. Divide the mitsuba equally
among serving bowls. Add a pinch of kumquat zest to each bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the shiitakes as thinly as possible just before serving.
Heat the soup to a slow simmer, then add the shiitake slices. Cook
until the white part of the mushrooms becomes almost translucent,
30 seconds to a few minutes, depending on thickness. Add the green
onion, then ladle the soup into the bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

GRILLED LOIN LAMB CHOPS WITH CAPONATA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from Sarah Scott, chef at Robert Mondavi Winery,
demonstrates the principles of balance that she applies to cooking.
The lamb is high in umami. The caponata is a careful balance of
sweet, salty, acid and bitter. Scott believes that a dish thus
balanced can go with either red or white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   For the Lamb
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fennel seed, crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dried lavender blossoms, crushed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 loin lamb chops, about 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   The Caponata
</P>
<P>
   1 pound eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Salt, as needed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups peeled, seeded and diced plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovies, rinsed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the crushed fennel, lavender, thyme, basil, salt,
pepper, garlic and shallots.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the lamb chops with olive oil, then massage the herb
mixture into the meat until evenly coated. Let stand at least 1
hour at room temperature, or refrigerate for several hours (remove
from refrigerator 1 hour before grilling).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the caponata:  &LR; Sprinkle the eggplant with salt and
drain in a colander for about 20 minutes. Pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over
moderate heat. Add the bell peppers, celery and shallots. Saute
until softened, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer
the vegetables to a bowl. Wash the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Return the clean skillet to moderate heat. Add the remaining 2
tablespoons olive oil. When hot, add the eggplant and cook,
stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the cooked vegetables to the skillet and stir in the
vinegar-sugar mixture, the tomatoes, tomato paste, capers and
anchovies. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered,
stirring occasionally, until the ingredients are fully cooked,
about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the parsley
and drizzle in extra virgin olive oil to taste. You may also need
to add more vinegar if the caponata is not tart enough.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool until barely warm or room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas
grill. Brush the herb mixture off the lamb, then season the lamb
with salt and pepper. Grill the chops over direct heat to sear,
then move to indirect heat to complete the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the lamb with caponata alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

GRILLED TUNA NICOISE SALAD WITH TARRAGON MAYONNAISE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from Sarah Scott, chef at Robert Mondavi Winery,
demonstrates her belief that balancing umami ingredients, such as
tuna, with lemon and salt can create a dish that doesn't alter the
taste of a wine.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Tarragon Mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg + 1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 to 2 cups olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
</P>
<P>
   The Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small red potatoes (creamers) or small Yukon Gold
potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound green beans
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound yellow wax beans
</P>
<P>
   4 tuna steaks, about 11/4 inches thick and 3 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, as needed
</P>
<P>
   1 head frisee, torn into salad-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula, torn into salad-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   Lemon juice, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pint basket cherry tomatoes (mixed colors), halved
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, halved and very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup nicoise or kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 hard-cooked eggs, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Prepare the tarragon mayonnaise:  &LR; Place the garlic in a
food processor and process until finely chopped. Stop the machine
and add the egg, egg yolk, tarragon vinegar and lemon juice.
Process 30 seconds, then, with the motor running, begin adding
olive oil gradually through the feed tube until the mayonnaise
reaches desired consistency. Taste for seasoning; add salt and
pepper as needed. Add the tarragon and process until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the salad:  &LR; Steam or boil the potatoes in salted water
until tender. Drain and cool, then slice medium-thin.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the green beans and wax beans in salted water until tender.
Drain and transfer to ice water until cool. Drain again and pat
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill. Brush
the tuna steaks with olive oil, then season to taste with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the frisee and arugula in a bowl; drizzle with lemon
juice and olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bed of greens on each serving plate. Divide the sliced
potatoes, beans, cherry tomatoes, red onion, olives and eggs
attractively on the plates.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the tuna close to the heat to sear, 2 to 3 minutes, then
turn and repeat on the second side. The tuna should still be rosy
in the center. Remove from the grill, squeeze a little lemon juice
over the tuna and sprinkle with a little salt.
</P>
<P>
   Place a tuna steak in the center of each plate and top with a
dollop of tarragon mayonnaise.

 The Working Cook: Wanderlust Leads to Pasta, Couscous and 
 Scaloppine  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; A friend just returned from a culinary tour of
Sicily, and her trip got me thinking about the olive oil- and
cannoli-filled trip I took there a few years ago with my father.
<P>
   My dad is also a ``food fiend,'' so we let our taste buds guide
our travels. In Agrigento, we couldn't resist having a second
cappuccino in a charming outdoor cafe and wound up missing a bus
that ran only once every few hours. And we stayed an extra day in
the not-so-interesting town of Trapani to revisit the  &LR; cuscusu &LR; 
(couscous) with fish we tasted at an amazing restaurant there.
</P>
<P>
   Our very first meal was in Palermo, behind a crumbling villa in
a courtyard lined with scraggly palm trees. We ordered Pasta alla
Norma, a local specialty supposedly created at the debut of the
eponymous opera by native son Puccini.
</P>
<P>
   This quintessential dish makes the most of the profusion of
produce that grows on the lush, hot island: robust globe eggplants,
plummy tomatoes, fresh basil. These usually are combined with penne
and ricotta salata, a dry version of ricotta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I won't be going back to Sicily any time soon. So
I created this week's Lasagna alla Norma, a baked version of my
favorite Sicilian dish. If I can't be in Sicily, at least I can eat
as if I were there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ricotta salata, my version has fresh ricotta inside
and grated pecorino on top. I also use roasted eggplant rather than
the traditional fried, which not only is healthier (much less oil)
but far easier to prepare in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   More in the Northern European tradition, Food Department intern
Andy Lax's Pork Scaloppine with Fennel, Apple &AMP; Cabbage is the kind
of recipe that takes little time and produces a lot of intricate
flavors. A hit of bourbon, cream and caraway adds depth to the
sauce, while the fennel and apple cider vinegar help cut through
any richness.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Chicken Sausages &AMP; Green Couscous came from my
colleague Karola Saekel. She uses seafood sausages instead of
chicken, but I found that their quality can vary from market to
market. If your store offers high-quality seafood sausages, the
fresh dill and lemon flavors in the couscous are a great match.

</P>
<P>
   Start cooking the sausages on a grill or grill pan over
medium-high heat. They should take 8 to 10 minutes to cook through.

30-MINUTE MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   PORK SCALOPPINE WITH FENNEL, APPLE &AMP; CABBAGE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe was developed by Food Section intern Andy Lax. Some
grocers sell pork scaloppine (pounded thin like veal scaloppine).
If they don't, ask your butcher to prepare some for you, or buy
boneless pork chops and cut them lengthwise into thin pieces, about
1/4 inch thick. Sandwich each piece between two lengths of wax
paper. Pound gently until each slice is about 1/8 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 small apple
</P>
<P>
   1 small fennel bulb, fronds intact
</P>
<P>
   About 1/4 head red cabbage (1 cup sliced)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   8 pork scaloppine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup apple juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup bourbon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds fresh potato gnocchi (or vacuum-packed)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large pot with salted water and set over high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and core the apple, then cut into 1/2-inch dice.
</P>
<P>
   Core the fennel, reserving the lacy fronds. Cut the bulb into
thin crosswise slices.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cabbage into long, thin strips.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the onion.
</P>
<P>
   Set a skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Season the pork generously on both sides with salt and pepper.
Add to the skillet, working in batches if necessary, and cook until
almost done, about 30 seconds per side. Remove the pork from the
skillet and tent with foil to keep it warm.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add the
apple, fennel slices, the cabbage, onion and caraway seeds. Stir in
the sugar. Saute until the vegetables are softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the vegetables are cooking, chop about 11/2 tablespoons
fennel fronds and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the apple juice, bourbon and vinegar to the vegetables and
bring to a boil. Cook until the liquid has reduced and the mixture
has thickened slightly, about 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and
pepper. Reduce heat to medium and stir in the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the gnocchi into the pot of now-boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pork to the skillet to finish cooking, which should
take 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the gnocchi float, after about 30 seconds to 1 minute,
drain them.
</P>
<P>
   Portion the pork onto serving plates.
</P>
<P>
   Add the gnocchi to the skillet and toss with the vegetables.
Spoon onto the plates. Garnish with the chopped fennel fronds.

   LASAGNA alla NORMA
</P>
<P>
   The sausage in this recipe may be omitted, as the sauce,
vegetables and cheeses offer plenty of flavor on their own. To
freeze, assemble the lasagna and tightly wrap the portion you wish
to save for later, label it and place in the freezer. Bake the
other portion and serve for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 large globe eggplants
</P>
<P>
   Salt, as needed
</P>
<P>
   5 Italian sausages, casings removed (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil + olive oil to grease pans
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   3 yellow onions, cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   4 red bell peppers, deveined and cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   3 boxes (26 ounces each) Pomi chopped tomatoes, or equivalent
amount of canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch basil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   About 16 sheets lasagna noodles
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups grated pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the eggplants and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place the
slices in a colander, salting each layer. Weight with a heavy
object to extract the eggplants' bitter juices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Brown the sausages in a Dutch oven,
crumbling them into bite-size pieces. Remove from pan with a
slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to
the pan. Adjust heat to medium-low. Add the pepper flakes and
oregano; saute for 1 minute. Add the onions and saute for 5
minutes. Add the bell peppers and saute until tender, 10 to 15
minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease 2 large sheet pans (or more, as needed) with
olive oil. Transfer the eggplant slices to the sheet pans,
arranging them in a single layer. Season with salt. Roast for 15
minutes. Turn the slices over, return to the oven and roast until
tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly chop 6 basil leaves. Add them and the sausage to the
sauce and simmer a few minutes to combine flavors. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble: &LR;  Reduce oven temperature to 350. Spoon a little of
the sauce in two 9 x 13-inch casserole dishes, spreading it with
the back of the spoon to coat the bottom of the dishes. Layer one
quarter of the noodles in each casserole, top with eggplant slices,
more sauce, some ricotta and a few basil leaves. Repeat layering
with the remaining noodles, eggplant, sauce, ricotta and basil. Top
each casserole with grated pecorino.
</P>
<P>
   Bake uncovered until bubbly and golden, about 30 minutes. If the
cheese does not brown in the oven, place under the broiler for a
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 Food In The News: Giant Food Portions Equal Giant People   By Kim Severson 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; The culprit behind America's weight problem may
not be what we eat but how much we eat.
<P>
   Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the
nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a
leading cause of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much
higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a
registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer
Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link
between diet and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from
an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the
average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002. If
exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of
15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major reason people are getting bigger,'' Polk says, ``is
that their servings have gotten larger, and commercial food
portions are a major culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   French fries from McDonald's offer a clear example of the
phenomenon. An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26
grams of fat. When the company began selling french fries in the
1950s, a small order _ the only one available _ had 220 calories
and 12 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also  &LR; recently &LR;  surveyed croissants &LR; , quesadillas &LR; 
and bagels, popular  &LR; American &LR;  foods adopted from other countries.
In each case, the item grew in size and calories when it was
adapted for the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an
ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference. The typical
American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures
181/2 inches. And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar
and fat, Polk says.
</P>
<P>
   The bagel, seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast
pastries, has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe. Even in
its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its
European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces. But today some bagels
have more than doubled in size. National bagel-maker Lender offers
a 41/2-ounce ``Big and Crusty'' bagel; Dunkin Donuts' plain bagel
is four ounces.
</P>
<P>
   And people rarely eat bagels plain. Adding fat-laden spreads
like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content. And
the bigger the bagel, the more spread it can take.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their
immigration from Mexico, Polk says. Small corn tortillas filled
with potato, cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico, and
cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour
tortilla filled with cheese. Polk estimates the typical
American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70
grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In other studies, nutritionists and researchers are nudging
out the concept of ``bad foods'' like soda and fat in favor of
focusing on the huge portion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers
from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that
overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared,
carbonated soft drinks than than children who weren't overweight,
and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood
obesity, then we should point our fingers at the real culprits _
huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity,'' says
Maureen Storey of the &LR; Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to eliminate certain foods isn't a practical way to help
children or adults lose weight, she says. ``We should get over this
good food-bad food silliness and move on.''

A DIRECTOR   EXPANDS   SHAW FEST   IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada, England)   By SUSAN CATTO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario _ Sipping a glass of pinot meunier
in a local winery, Christopher Newton reminisced about his first
few seasons as artistic director of the Shaw Festival. Audiences
walked out of his 1980 production of ``The Philanderer,'' and his
1981 plan to stage ``St. Joan'' without its epilogue failed when
the Society of Authors threatened to withhold the rights to the
play. One critic suggested that Newton be fired or that the Shaw
Festival change its name.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years after he was hired, Newton, 64, still holds the
job, and the Shaw Festival is one of the largest theater events in
North America, attracting nearly 350,000 people a year to this
old-fashioned village 8 miles downstream from Niagara Falls and 35
miles north of Buffalo. The 11-play festival opened in April and
ends on Dec. 10. More than a third of the audience comes from the
United States. Festival memberships, which include advance purchase
privileges, have nearly doubled to 9,000 in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, a native of Kent, England, who has been awarded the
Order of Canada, the country's highest honor, is credited with
``keeping together a strong ensemble of actors and fostering a very
striking, very intelligent visual and aural style of production,''
in the words of Robert Cushman, theater critic for The National
Post.
</P>
<P>
   With just three seasons left until his retirement in 2002,
Newton is leading the festival through a major expansion of its
mandate. Since its inception in 1962, the festival has focused on
plays written during Shaw's lifetime, 1856 to 1950, which meant
Wilde, Coward, Ibsen and Chekhov and musical greats like the
Gershwin brothers and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   This season, however, he opened the festival to more modern
plays. Nigel Williams' adaption of William Goldings 1955 novel
``Lord of the Flies'' opens July 5, and Joe Masteroff's musical
``She Loves Me'' is running through the festival's last day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rethink yourself and reinvent yourself all the
time,'' Newton said, adding, ``This seemed a good opportunity with
Shaw coming out of copyright.'' The festival has paid $168,000 to
$335,000 a year in copyright fees to Shaw's estate. Since the
copyright expires 50 years after Shaw's death, the festival can use
that money to commission new works and to buy rights to more recent
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Newton directed three plays this season, though only one is a
product of the new mandate. Shaw's exploration of medical ethics,
``The Doctors Dilemma,'' has had three previous stagings at the
festival, and Noel Coward's ``Easy Virtue'' was repeated from last
year. ``The Matchmaker'' by Thornton Wilder, set in 1880s Yonkers,
was written in 1954, four years after Shaw's death.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the playbill is vintage festival material:
Shaw's political satire ``The Apple Cart,'' Wilde's melodrama ``A
Woman of No Importance,'' Coward's ``Still Life,'' J.B. Priestley's
family drama ``Time and the Conways'' and Luigi Pirandello's ``Six
Characters in Search of an Author.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not terribly experimental,'' Newton said. ``We never
will be, because our audience isn't. Most of the plays they've
never heard of, they've never seen. They've got to trust that there
will be good acting and that it will be done sensibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a sommelier bringing obscure vintages from the cellar,
however, Newton ventures beyond classics and crowd-pleasers.
``Where are you going to see `Ivona, Princess of Burgundia' except
here, and where are you going to see any plays by Henry Arthur
Jones?'' he asked. ``You're blowing the dust off things, and in any
major cultural center, that's what you spend a lot of time doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I must admit, I couldn't quite see what the
relevance was of the Shaw Festival. Then when I got here, the point
suddenly became a lot clearer to me. Shaw's lifetime has given us
all insights and clues into how we live today.''

CAUTIOUS RESPONSE TO IDEA OF DECLARING PALESTINIAN STATE IN
SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis and Palestinians alike reacted cautiously
Tuesday to a declaration on Monday by the Palestinian leadership
that a Palestinian state would be declared by mid-September,
uncertain whether it was a promise, a threat or another deadline
that could be massaged.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Ramallah, many Palestinians tried to keep in
check their enthusiasm, which was egged on by headlines across the
tops of newspapers proclaiming, ``Palestinian State on 9/13!''
Several Palestinians said they were ready to shed blood, if
necessary, but they warned each other not to put too much stake in
a deadline, given that other supposedly sacred dates have come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   And then were those like Ziyyad, a 26-year-old shopper who would
not give his last name. He said that Palestinian leaders would be
irresponsible to make a unilateral declaration of statehood because
they would trigger a harsh Israeli response that would ultimately
cause the Palestinian people to suffer. ``More border closures,
separation again between the West Bank and Gaza, economic hardship,
more settlements and no prisoners released,'' he said. ``Our
leaders should be more rational.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, even dovish leaders like Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin recoiled from the idea that the Palestinians might abandon
the peace effort and proclaim an independent state. He warned that
a Palestinian state would be meaningless if Israel did not
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will exist only on paper even if the entire world
recognizes a unilateral Palestinian state,'' Beilin said, in
unusually confrontational words.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Palestinian Central Council unexpectedly
affirmed its commitment to declare a Palestinian state by Sept. 13,
whether a final peace deal had been reached with the Israelis. That
is the target date for a completed deal, although it is highly
unlikely that it will be met.
</P>
<P>
   The council, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
had not been expected to attach such significance to the Sept. 13
date. Rather, it was believed that it would vaguely endorse the
idea of a state by year's end so as to defuse the mounting
anxieties that September will bring violence if it does not bring
peace. Instead, its members took a risky decision that locks Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, into a tight timeframe and raises
the hopes of his people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Israel Radio Tuesday, Bassam Sayeh, a member of Arafat's
Fatah party, said that while the Palestinians preferred to achieve
statehood through negotiations, they were prepared to do so through
military conflict if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And several men interviewed in Ramallah Tuesday said that they
were ready to fight. One old man said: ``We have been waiting for
more than 50 years. Nobody will accept postponing this anymore. We
started the intifada,'' the uprising that lasted from 1988 to 1993,
``with stones, and now we are ready to use stones and rifles.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Tuesday and taken late last month, before
Monday's declaration, showed a very sober-minded Palestinian
people. Slightly more than half said that they expected nothing to
happen in September _ not the declaration of a state and not a
peace agreement. The poll also found that trust in Arafat remains
relatively low _ at 31.8 percent _ but that he is still considered
the most trusted Palestinian figure.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was done by Jerusalem Media and Communication, whose
researchers interviewed 1,200 randomly selected Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been pushing for an immediate three-way,
retreat-style summit meeting in the United States to move the
stalemated peace talks into a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians have resisted, saying that the two sides
are too far apart and that a summit meeting now would be doomed to
failure.

`EXOTIC'? PERHAPS, YET NEITHER PRIMITIVE NOR PURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Wielding the persuasive weapon of money, Western
art dealers and collectors appear to have vanquished ethnologists
in the battle over so-called primitive art.
</P>
<P>
   Objects created for religious, ritualistic or tribal reasons,
like African fertility statues, pre-Columbian stone figures and
Oceanic masks, are now routinely traded _ and admired _ as works of
art. Even the Louvre has begun displaying primitive art exclusively
on aesthetic merit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it comes to contemporary art from outside the Western
world, the lines are far more blurred. This new art is created as
art, it often relies on Western techniques _ its creators may even
live in New York and Paris _ yet its strength still lies in its
identity with a non-Western reality. At the same time, as
multiculturalism has become fashionable in the West, artists
trained in a Western tradition have found inspiration in the
``magic realism'' of much third world art.
</P>
<P>
   This at least is the thesis of ``Sharing Exoticisms,'' the name
given to the Fifth Lyon Biennial of Contemporary Art, which is
being held in the cavernous Halle Tony Garnier through Sept. 24. In
a world ``globalized'' by information, consumerism and migration,
cultures no longer stay put. ``Exoticism'' has ceased to be a
euphemism for folkloric backwardness: it now works both ways.
Anthropology, proclaim the biennial's artistic directors, Thierry
Prat and Thierry Raspail, has defeated aestheticism.
</P>
<P>
   The show's poster image illustrates this with a photograph of a
blond German dressed as a Native American, part of a series called
``German Indians,'' taken by Andrea Robbins and Max Becher in the
German town of Radebeul during its annual Wild West festival. The
colorful geometric mural at the entrance to the show, on the other
hand, is signed jointly by Esther Mahlangu, a South African wall
painter, and the American Sol LeWitt, with no indication as to
which parts were done by which artist.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial's guest curator, Jean-Hubert Martin, who now heads
the Kunst Palast Museum in Duesseldorf, Germany, has long
encouraged this eclectic approach. In 1989, while director of the
Pompidou Center's Modern Art Museum, he organized a show called
``The Magicians of the Earth'' that took the unusual approach of
treating first and third world artists as equals. Then, in the
mid-1990s, while running the Museum of African and Oceanic Art in
Paris, he began adding contemporary art to the colonial collection.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Sharing Exoticisms,'' he formed a committee of five
anthropologists who helped him define 22 ethnological categories,
all linked to human behavior, into which he eventually slotted
works by 120 artists from 30 or so countries. With generic titles
like ``To Dress,'' ``To Love,'' ``To Cure,'' ``To Pray'' and ``To
Die,'' each section opens with an iconic work, in most cases taken
from ``primitive art,'' as a way of demonstrating the continuity of
symbols and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The work that greets the public in the opening section,
``Exotiser,'' or ``To Make Exotic,'' sets a mischievous tone. An
installation placed in what appears to be an open-sided tribal hut
includes copies of Western paintings, statues and art objects and
is called ``Somewhere in Africa there is a great black man
collecting art from Europe and America.'' Its author, though, is
not African: it is Nedko Solakov, a Bulgarian artist living in
Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from LeWitt, the biennial includes works by other well
known artists, among them Gilbert and George, Annette Messager,
Antoni Tapies and Anish Kapoor. Yet this is a show in which
individual artists are less important than the voyage through the
theme park of exoticisms. Blue curtains dividing the space more or
less force visitors to follow a prescribed route.
</P>
<P>
   The categories allow works from different continents and
cultures to be confronted, but they also serve as a guide for
interpreting individual pieces. In ``Exotiser,'' for instance, the
colonial view of the exotic is spoofed by the Swiss artists Marcel
Biefer and Beat Zgraggen, who photograph themselves as white
``native'' warriors, naked except for their armor of old cans and
assorted industrial detritus.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Ocampo, a Filipino artist working in Berkeley, Cal.,
paints large primitive-style tableaux that, on closer inspection,
are anticolonialist protest works.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Tattoo'' reminds how the West has embraced a form of body
decoration that was discovered by Westerners in the Pacific Islands
only in the 19th century. Gerald Minkhoff and Mureil Olesen, a
Swiss couple, photograph themselves in mises-en-scene using
Minkoff's tattooed body. Greg Semu, a New Zealand artist of Samoan
extraction, photographs the complex tattoos of the pe'a male
initiation ritual that cover his own body. Farid Belkahia, a
Moroccan artist, works more symbolically, tattooing large hands
made of lamb's skin placed on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of materials used is impressive. The French artist
Serge Goudin-Thebia has created human forms with old leaves held
together by long wooden pins. Wenda Gu, a Chinese artist living in
New York, has brought ``United Nations'' (renamed ``Temple of
Exoticism'' here), a large room in which chairs have television
screens as seats and the walls are covered in words of many
languages written with human hair and held together by glue.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese artist, Liang Shaoij, uses real silkworms in an
installation in which human forms appear to have been smothered in
silk.
</P>
<P>
   One striking work in ``To House'' is ``Exotica 2000,'' an
installation by the French artists Anne and Patrick Poirier, who
have built a vast industrial complex in miniature and entirely in
black (binoculars are available to look into what resembles an
archaeological find). Even larger is a ``United Nations'' by the
Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn, an installation showing destroyed
towns and villages in numerous countries where the United Nations
is struggling to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Two artists have found unusual ways of bridging the gap between
first and third world cultures. Ghada Amer, an Egyptian artist
working in New York, creates large delicate embroideries that seem
abstract from afar but in fact show naked women in sensual poses.
Pascale Marthine Tayou from Cameroon has traced the final days of
an imported car in a short film called ``Old New.'' The car, he
pointed out, was considered scrap in Europe, but it began a new
life when it arrived in Africa. Now a rusting carcass, the car is
on display.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition does not have sections called ``To Travel'' or
``To Migrate,'' but in a sense they would have best sustained the
premise of ``Sharing Exoticisms.'' So many of the third world
artists in the show live or have lived in first world capitals,
while many Western artists now have made a point of discovering
different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Still more striking, while early 20th-century artists like
Gauguin, Derain, Vlaminck and Picasso borrowed from ``primitive
art'' and made it Western, today third world artists have assumed
control over their own cultures. Indeed, not only do they define
their own ``exoticism,'' but they have also discovered a good deal
of the exotic in the ``advanced'' societies of the United States
and Europe.

</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the world of empty calories, quick energy jolts,

WHEN THE AMBIENCE IS THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By   FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I used to say that my favorite picnic site was a good French
restaurant with the windows open. Nowadays, though, I prefer
something more exposed to the elements _ like a terrace in
Provence, or perhaps the garden at Barbetta on West 46th Street.
Or, more realistically, my own backyard with its rusted Weber
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Food is no problem in these verdant settings. Volumes have been
written about summer victuals, and no magazine lacks for stories on
color-coordinated dinners for 12 among the vines in Napa, or on a
deck in Amagansett. No, the challenge is always to find wines that
can stand up to the rugged outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple matter in restaurants. The choices are laid out
for you on the wine list and there is usually, though not always,
someone standing by to help.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, recently, after a morning at the Prado, my wife and I
had lunch in the garden at the Ritz, almost next door. In Spain, on
a warm summer afternoon, there is only one choice, rose: in this
instance, the beautiful Rosado Gran Fuego from Bodegas Julian
Chivite in Navarre. Chivite has always had a way with roses, and
this 100-percent grenache, well chilled, is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, at the only Roman garden on 46th Street, I
would ask the owner, Laura Maioglio, for something from the
Piedmont, an Arneis perhaps, from the Langhe. A good Arneis, like
Bruno Giacosa's, along with a few others choices, like Antinori's
Della Sala chardonnay and the Ronco dei Gnemiz pinot grigio, have
some flavor and body. Alas, so many Italian white wines are watery
and forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor dining at home, on a beach, on the afterdeck of
someone's boat or in the woods is another matter. Since it's
usually at least a bit casual, no one expects much from the wine.
It should be chilled and, like the conversation, uncomplicated and
light-hearted. It doesn't hurt if the price is easy-going as well.
Accordingly, few of the wines discussed here reach $20; most are
$10 to $12.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say picnic wine shouldn't be stylish. For
example, why have just another sugary California chardonnay when
there are so many beautiful rieslings available from Alsace, from
Germany and even from New York's Finger Lakes? Riesling is lighter
bodied than most American chardonnays; its flavors are intense but
more subtle, and the wine is generally lighter in alcohol, between
9 and 11 percent, an important consideration in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   Trimbach and Hugel are two of the best-known Alsatian producers,
and their rieslings, even at the lower end of the price scale, are
impeccable. Good German rieslings at the modest kabinett level are
not always easy to find, moderately priced. Labels to look for
include Egon Mueller, Robert Weil, J.J. Prum, Lingenfelder and
Burklin-Wolf. The German rieslings are not as dry as the Alsatians,
but they are excellent with food; their touch of sweetness is
invariably balanced with good acidity. Closer to home are the
Finger Lakes rieslings. Some of the best come from Hermann J.
Wiemer of Dundee, N.Y. His rieslings are lean and intense in the
best traditions of the Rheingau which is where he is from.
</P>
<P>
   What about red wines when dining al fresco? Are they too heavy,
too wintry? Well, let me answer with a question. Suppose you were
grilling a thick steak or a butterflied leg of lamb or just a juicy
hamburger _ would you want to drink a white wine with it? Possibly,
but I hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will, red meat cries out for red wine. It doesn't
have to be a great Bordeaux or an imposing pinot noir, French or
American. But just about anything else red: zinfandel, of course,
or one of the dozens of sirahs that have popped up from France,
Australia and California.
</P>
<P>
   Why not an old-fashioned petite sirah, one of California's few
remaining untamed red wines? A bit rough, perhaps, but with lots of
color and flavor. Foppiano, an old-line Sonoma County winery, has
long championed petite sirah and knows how to make it. Benziger has
a good one, too.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an all-purpose red wine for outdoors, it's
Beaujolais. Not the chichi single-vineyard and old-vine Bojos that
have been turning up recently: I'm talking about the unadorned,
grapey, purple-red Beaujolais and Beaujolias-Villages one has come
to know and love. Serve them from jelly glasses or Baccarat, chill
them if you prefer, drop in an ice cube when no one is looking.
Many have tried, but no one has come up with any wine to match the
versatility, the availability and the still-reasonable price of
Beaujolais. Georges Duboeuf is Beaujolais, but he has lots of
worthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes: barbecue and chili. Outdoor foods, yes, but
wine-friendly? Let's say they present a challenge. It's a bit of a
stretch, but maybe one of those macho 16.5 alcohol zinfandels from
California might do the trick. Cecil Deloach makes them when
conditions are right. Since beer has always been the traditional
fire extinguisher for these delicacies, switch to wine at your own
risk.
</P>
<P>
   There is another possibility. Once, at a garden party, I was
served a succession of incendiary Thai dishes accompanied by beer,
of course, and, of all things, Gallo Hearty Burgundy, the wine of
my misspent youth. Amazingly, it worked. Hearty Burgundy has a big,
uncomplicated taste and just enough sweetness to defuse, partially
anyway, that fiery fare.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have a screw top anymore, but I wouldn't serve it to
the directors of your wine society. Well, maybe from a decanter.

THE RETURN OF AIR-DRIED BEEF FROM ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROZANNE GOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bresaola isn't exactly a household word in America.
So when the real thing began being imported three weeks ago, there
wasn't much fuss about it. But Bresaola, air-dried beef from
Valtellina, in northern Italy, is moist and delicate, and
completely unlike the salty and slightly leathery domestic
versions, or the dryish Swiss bundnerfleisch that Americans have
had to make do with for so long.
</P>
<P>
   True bresaola, pronounced brez-OW-luh, lays gently on the
tongue, almost like carpaccio, and then melts away. It has an
intriguing, musty bouquet. Unlike prosciutto, bresaola is utterly
lean, with no discernible striations of fat. When sliced
paper-thin, it is almost translucent.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it extraordinary, Lou DiPalo of DiPalo's Fine Foods
in Little Italy section of Manhattan says, is the microclimate of
the Valtellina area in northern Lombardy, where it has been made
for more than 600 years. Lean cuts of beef from the hindquarter are
cured in salt and flavorings _ which ones is a carefully guarded
secret that its producers refused to reveal _ and hung out to dry,
in big houses, in Valtellina's Alpine breezes. It is then aged
three to four months, taking on a deep garnet color and a texture
similar to a good prosciutto. It is this brief aging process that
provides the allure. The domestic and Swiss air-dried beef are aged
considerably longer, making them drier.
</P>
<P>
   Italian bresaola hasn't been available in the United States
since 1930, when a provision of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
stipulated that only cooked beef from Italy be allowed into the
United States, a restriction that expired in October 1996. At that
time, another embargo against Italian beef, because of
foot-and-mouth disease, also was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But the doors slammed shut again in December 1997, when all beef
products from Italy were banned, and still are, because of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, also known as mad cow disease. Although
there has never been a case of mad cow disease reported in Italy,
the Agriculture Department instituted the ban after identifying
substantial risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, two Italian bresaola makers have come up with a way
to satisfy all those concerns: they use beef imported from South
America. The Agriculture Department approved their products for
import on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Italian bresaola made by Rigamonti and Negroni are both
identified as Bresaola della Valtellina and each one bears a
blue-and-yellow government seal of authenticity. In New York, their
product is available at DiPalo's Fine Foods, Todaro Brothers, Agata
&AMP; Valentina, Fairway and Balducci's markets. Prices range from
about $16 to $19 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   A little goes a long way. One ounce of thinly sliced bresaola
will cover a 10-inch plate nicely _ which is the way bresaola
purists like it best, al naturale, eaten with the fingers, just as
it is.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also delicious draped over soft-scrambled eggs, or
dressed with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, sliced in a
julienne atop an arugula salad, showered with shards of Grana
Padano cheese or, in autumn, gilded with shaved white truffles.

 &HT;    The cosmopolitan Oxford: Mississippi town boasts more than
literary life
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ The stone Confederate soldier still stands on
the square as a silent memorial to Lafayette County's Civil War
dead, but that's about all that hasn't changed in William
Faulkner's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sleepy community famous only for its literary heritage
and Ole Miss football games, Oxford is rapidly becoming a trendy
urban center for music, art, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   You can still get collards and chicken-fried steak at the Ajax
Diner or Smitty's, but you also can get cappuccino, shrimp and
grits and gourmet meals at the elegant, white-tablecloth City
Grocery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one of the best meals in my life at the City Grocery,''
says Oxford author Larry Brown (``Fay,'' ``Father and Son'') during
a recent outing to hear a local bluegrass band perform at Off
Square Books. ``They cooked pheasant and some other wild game. It
was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's main literary celebrity (besides Faulkner, of course)
now that John Grisham has moved to Virginia, Brown is a frequent
visitor at Richard Howorth's Square Books or the nearby Off Square
Books, where customers can find used books as well as signed first
editions by Grisham and dozens of other authors.
</P>
<P>
   Named one of the ``100 Best Small Towns'' by USA Today, Oxford
is a walker's _ and shopper's _ paradise. A shady town square built
around the 150-year-old courthouse offers a variety of shops and
restaurants as well as wrought-iron-enclosed second-floor balconies
where restaurant patrons can take their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxford is seen as a quaint Southern town, but it's more than
that,'' says Howorth, who is credited with attracting crowds to the
square with special events and author signings at his bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole nightlife scene has changed,'' Howorth says. ``For a
long time, there were no bars, then there was a Holiday Inn bar.
Now there are more bars on the square than a drinking person could
go to in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the town's population is around 10,000, the University
of Mississippi adds 11,000. The result is an eclectic mix of
locals, students and tourists who come to shop, soak up the
literary atmosphere at Faulkner's Rowan Oak plantation or attend
the numerous music events.
</P>
<P>
   The home of Fat Possum Records, Oxford has become a center for
musicians playing blues, rock, folk and jazz at a number of other
clubs in town. The music scene changed dramatically, Howorth says,
after Proud Larry's opened on the square seven years ago and began
booking big-name acts on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   All the extra traffic and influx of residents have been great
for business, but there's a downside, says Na-Ann Watts, owner of
Na-Ann's New Look, a frame and accessory shop just off the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Property values have shot up astronomically,'' says Watts, a
former insurance agent who turned her interior decorating hobby
into a profession. ``You have the parents of students coming to
Oxford and liking the town so much they move here. A lot of folks
are retiring here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the square, shoppers can find the South's best assortment
of blues CDs at Uncle Bucks Records; folk art, antiques and weather
vanes at, of course, the Weather Vane; and hand-thrown pottery,
gourmet cookware and kudzu jelly at Mississippi Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Depite the changes and the gentrification of the town, Oxford
hasn't forgotten the man that put it on the map. The annual
Faulkner &AMP; Yoknapatawpha Conference July 23-28 is expected to
attract several hundred scholars, students and lovers of
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial in life, Faulkner has managed to create a fuss
even in death. When some of his supporters announced plans to erect
a bronze statue of the author in front of City Hall,
environmentalists were upset because it meant the removal of a
magnolia tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the statue is in place, Faulkner devotees complain that
the likeness is all wrong; and the writer's relatives say he would
have hated everything about it.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Getting there

   Attractions
</P>
<P>
   A must-see attraction in Oxford is Rowan Oak, the house that
William Faulkner bought in 1930. He christened the house after the
Celtic legend of the rowan tree, which was thought to have magic
powers of protection. While living at Rowan Oak, Faulkner wrote
``Absalom, Absalom!'' and ``The Sound and the Fury.'' The stately
old house is now owned by the University of Mississippi and is open
to the public 10 a.m.-noon and 2-4 p.m. Tuesdays-Saturdays and 2-4

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With our allegiances to cow butter, oils and lard, a
new butter is bound to be met with suspicion. How will it behave in
cooking? Can it be used in a cake? Does it taste as good as cow
butter?
</P>

   This could be why Fairway in Manhattan has carried goat butter
on and off for 10 years and it still moves like pig's knuckles.
Goat butter doesn't make much of a visual impression, either: it is
pure white, like commercial lard.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting it, though, is like tasting pinot noir for the first
time when all you've ever had is merlot. It's creamy, gentle,
lighter than cow butter and, goaty. It doesn't have as much tang as
goat cheese but it does have a little, and it maintains much of the
earthy fragrance of the milk.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new goat-cheese makers in the United States,
there is still very little goat butter available, said Steve
Jenkins, the cheese buyer for Fairway, which sells it for $15.15 a
pound. He imports it from Celles-sur-Belle, a cheese maker in
Poitou-Charentes, in western France. Cooks there treat goat's
butter like cow's butter, Jenkins said, swirling it in hot pans to
make beurre noir for skate and sole, and blending it into dough for
torte au fromage.
</P>
<P>
   Goat butter's moisture content is higher than cow butter's, and
it is always unsalted. But otherwise the two are interchangeable in
most dishes. With sauteed spinach, goat butter coated the leaves
and emulsified with the spinach juices at the bottom of the pan. It
tasted rich and round and yet leaner. I liked it better than cow
butter with a minerally green like spinach. Slim carrots glazed
with the butter got a thinner coating but were delicious, and you
could taste the butter's faint sour tang.
</P>
<P>
   When I browned some butter in a small pan, it turned the color
of a hazelnut and had the same nutty aroma that you get from cow
butter. In a recipe for sables, which are delicious with cow
butter, it might take a dairy farmer to notice the difference in
flavor. The cookies were not as golden when I used goat butter, but
they were just as heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   The butter's real nuance came through when I spread it on a
piece of bread, sprinkled a little sea salt on top and ate it with
a glass of Pineau des Charentes, a wine made near where the French
goats roam. The wine is honey sweet, and it led me to my next plan
for the butter: toast with goat butter and honey.

<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 1 hour's standing time
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces unsalted goat butter
</P>
<P>
   Finely grated rind of 1 large, cold, firm lemon
</P>
<P>
   \ cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted unbleached flour
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Line two flat or inverted baking sheets with parchment paper.
Set aside. Place egg yolks in a small pan, and cover with water.
Bring to a simmer, and let cook for 2 minutes; then, remove from
heat and let stand for a minute. Remove yolks with a slotted spoon,
and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a food processor, combine yolks and butter. Process for 10
seconds, scraping sides if necessary, until smooth. Add lemon rind,
sugar, flour and salt, and process for 15 to 20 seconds, until
ingredients hold together.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn dough out onto a floured pastry cloth or lightly floured
counter, and with floured hands, form into a firm square shape. Use
a floured rolling pin to roll out to a 10-inch square (about [ inch
thick). To straighten sides, press a ruler or a long metal spatula
against them.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a long knife, cut square into four strips, then in the
opposite direction into fourths, making 16 squares. Cut each square
on an angle, making 32 triangles. Using a thin metal spatula,
transfer triangles to baking sheets, spacing them apart. Dip a fork
in flour, and with the underside of prongs, mark a ridged design on
top of each cookie. Let stand for one hour.
</P>
<P>
   5. Adjust oven racks in upper-third and lower-third positions.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake cookies, one sheet on each rack,
for about 15 minutes, until only sandy colored. Change racks, and
reverse sheets front to back once during baking to ensure even
browning.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remove sheets from oven. Slide parchment off sheets, and let
cookies stand until almost cool. With a spatula, turn them over,
and let stand until completely cool. Store in an airtight
container.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 32 cookies.

`DREAM STUFF': WARY AND UNSETTLED IN A GHOST-RIDDEN LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No contemporary literature is more insistently permeated by the
spirit of the land than Australia's.
</P>
<P>
   It is a spirit, though, that instead of forming and fortifying,
deforms and weakens. In the works of such novelists as Rodney Hall,
Janette Turner Hospital and David Malouf, the setting is a canvas
whose chemical makeup reacts upon the figures painted on it,
causing the pigment to wrinkle and curl away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land was not ours before we were not the land's.'' So an
unlikely Australian Robert Frost might have written. A harsh, even
weird geography _ the vast barren outback, Martian rock formations,
rivers that narrowed instead of widening seaward and sometimes
disappeared altogether _ resisted settlers who pushed beyond the
narrow coastal belt.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty was more than material. What the writers and some
filmmakers register is a flaw of morale, a vulnerability of the
imagination. They evoke the sense of inhabiting a geographical and
historical fault line, haunted by aboriginal ghosts that the
settlers' culture, availing itself of massacre and repression, was
never sufficiently confident of its own identity to dislodge. (What
a contrast with the confidently indifferent majority tradition of
Americans.) Most of the Australian settlers had arrived from
Britain not as pilgrims but as penal deportees; not having sought
freedom, but having lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Malouf, the finest and most expansive of these writers, shares
some of their darkly violent images of estrangement. In his best
and most recent work, though (the novels ``Remembering Babylon''
and ``The Conversations at Curlow Creek''), he goes beyond the
stranger-in-a-strange-land theme to suggest with a few of his
characters a beginning of wisdom, a rumor of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a note he shares to an extent with Michael Ondaatje. In
different ways, each launches upon the tidal wave of nightmare a
tiny raft-borne human figure, paddling if not prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the short stories in ``Dream Stuff'' evoke the curse
of landscape and history with no reconciliation at all. In ``Lone
Pine,'' an elderly couple on vacation are brutally murdered by a
young tough who, with his wife and child, forces his way into their
camper to steal it, walks them out into the woods and shoots them.
What in another context would be a breath-stopping account of a
sadistic crime _ Malouf remarkably manages to make the pity even
more stunning than the terror _ here seems more than that. It seems
foreordained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacksoil Country,'' set more than a century ago, is the
finest story in the collection, a precursor, perhaps, of
``Remembering Babylon.'' It tells of MacIvor, a rough, bitter
farmer who moves from homestead to homestead without making a go of
any of them. His failures build into rage against the itinerant
bands of aborigines who wander across his property following their
ancestral routes. The practice has become a kind of right,
respected if not welcomed by the other farmers.
</P>
<P>
   MacIvor, though, threatens them with a shotgun until one day,
seeing a band approach with a dead sheep and assuming they've
poached it, he shoots one of them dead. It is blind and tragically
senseless; another settler, hoping to calm his neighbor, had given
the aborigines the sheep to bring as a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
   The truce is broken. Jordan, MacIvor's 12-year-old son, who
until then had wandered the countryside free and unharmed, is
killed by the aborigines. The white farmers, reluctantly perhaps,
start a season of pursuit and massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told _ and it is Malouf's triumph _ in Jordan's
wondering, dead voice. Double victimhood makes him one of the
writer's wraithlike reconcilers:
</P>
<P>
   ``The blacks in every direction are hunted and go to ground.
They too have lost their protection _ what little they had of it.
Me all that while lying quiet in the heart of the country, slowly
sinking into the ancientness of it, making it mine, grain by grain
blending my white grains with its many black ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Malouf's engine may be overpowered for a short track. There are
clever turns in many of the stories but a certain tire shriek on
corners. The ones furthest from his theme of haunted unsettlement
seem most contrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sally's Story,'' set during World War II, portrays the
alienated feelings of an Australian woman employed to provide
weeklong ``marriages'' to American soldiers on combat leave. The
situation is journalistically provocative, at least to an American
reader (Who employed these women? Was it an official program?), but
the story is sketchy and flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night Training'' is a slight piece about a studious draftee
sadistically abused by his training officer. ``Jacko's Reach'' is a
nostalgic sketch of the conversion into a shopping mall of a bit of
city wasteland used for teen-age adventures with drink, drugs and
sex. More interesting is the title story, but its attempt to
compress in 30 pages the memories and emotions of an expatriate
writer returning for a visit and getting mugged suffers from
forcing. Too much is signaled, too little received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Day,'' by contrast, gives expansive range to its story
of the passing of a class and a generation. It takes the form of
the annual reunion of a privileged and gifted clan to celebrate the
birthday of Audley Tyler, its patriarch. He is a man of
discriminating temper and shrewd judgment, formerly the highest of
civil servants and adviser to six prime ministers, and still much
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Individual vignettes weave through the reunion; a familiar
device that Malouf employs effectively, though with more power than
subtlety. It develops a lovely grave complexity, nonetheless, as
Audley presides over not only the reunion but also his own
stock-taking.
</P>
<P>
   His brief, restless visit to the nearby family museum adumbrates
the frailty of privilege and its mementos. (Museums are levelers:
whether an old court dress or an old shepherd's tunic, the
governing word is ``old.'') It evokes Audley's own aging weariness
with who he is. Malouf touches, though indirectly, on his abiding
theme: how frailly the conquerors, about to become ghosts
themselves, have inhabited this ghost-ridden land.

TIME TO POLISH YOUR SPOONS
</HEADLINE>
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago, I sat at the bar at Village and
ordered an ice cream sundae. Minutes later, the bartender came
barreling toward me with what looked to be the classic, from the
whipped cream on top down to the tall, thick glass and long thin
spoon. I could have been on a stool at a soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities stopped there. My first taste, a languorous
spoonful of whipped cream, was not too sweet. The ice cream beneath
was a true, eggy vanilla and was draped with a bitter chocolate
sauce. These were mingling with coarse bits of nut brownie and a
cherry sauce sharpened with kirsch and balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream sundae had shed its youthful, frivolous shell.
This was a balanced, thoughtfully constructed dessert, something
that nourished the intellect and the palate, not just the pangs of
the stomach. It was, in essence, as plain and dutiful in its
purpose as a sundae should be, and yet it intimated just how many
possibilities there are with such a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   It made me wonder what it could be in the hands of a great
pastry chef. Would he reform its parts and turn it inside out?
Would he add new components? Or would he snicker, and act as if I
had asked him to take a stab at toast?
</P>
<P>
   I got on the phone, called seven of New York's top chefs and
pastry chefs and asked them to create their own interpretations of
the dessert, to ruminate on every detail, from the density of the
ice cream to the design of the serving dish.
</P>
<P>
   After what seemed like many long pauses, all but one _ who
dismissed it as ``a study in sugar'' _ agreed, turning out sundaes
that were astonishing both in their ability to stretch the
definition of the dessert and their devotion to the classic design.
</P>
<P>
   For some chefs, like Luis Bollo at Meigas, who recently moved to
New York from Spain, this meant working from what he had read, and
impressions he had formed about sundaes, rather than from
experience eating them. With Roni Ross, the pastry chef at Nobu, it
was a matter of using ingredients familiar from her Asian fusion
repertory and sculpturing them into a sundae. And then there was
Florian Bellanger, the pastry chef at Le Bernardin, a recent
immigrant from France, who had to climb from an abyss: His single
sundae experience was at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Sundaes, as it turns out, are not strictly American, and so some
chefs drew on desserts from other countries to help improve the
design.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Klinger, the chef at Al Di La in Brooklyn, had already been
working hard on a sundae recipe for her menu when I called. She and
her husband, Emiliano Coppa, had been trying to recreate a dessert,
called gianduiotto, served at a couple of the old cafes in Venice.
Gianduiotto has all the necessary components of a sundae: the ice
cream, the crunch, the whipped cream, the wonderfully sloppy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   She makes a pleasantly gooey ice cream with gianduja and bitter
chocolates, layers it in a baking pan with chopped toasted
hazelnuts, freezes it and cuts it into thick bars. Then, she pipes
whipped cream into a juice glass and presses the bar into the
glass. As she does this, the cream squeezes around it, filling up
all the spaces in the glass and billowing out the top like a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream bar starts out hard and softens, but it's creamy
like a toffee and never really falls apart. The nuts appear at
random but not in every bite. And the whipped cream, barely
sweetened, inserts tactile relief, making each taste feel like a
foamy milk shake in the top of your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The textures and temperatures in the dessert are as crucial as
the actual flavors. ``The crunch is very important with the one
that we do,'' Klinger said. ``The ice cream feels very cold, and
somehow the cream doesn't feel very cold and there's something nice
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarela Martinez, the owner of Zarela's, a Mexican restaurant,
aimed to fix the sundae with heavy Mexican influences and an
emphasis on peanuts, a crop brought to Mexico by African sugar cane
workers. Rather than a peanut ice cream, she made a peanut ice
milk. ``There are so many fabulous fruits and ices in Mexico,'' she
said, ``and I don't like cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sundae, however, does not suffer from a lack of richness.
For a sauce, she turned to a drink called torito, from Veracruz.
It's a loose, boozy liquid of condensed milk, evaporated milk,
peanut butter and sugar-cane liquor. The scoops of the peanut ice
swam in it, and tiny ice crystals formed around it as in an ice
cream soda. On top she sprinkled pieces of peanut brittle. The
repetition of flavor gave it structure; the variation of texture
gave it life.
</P>
<P>
   Where many sundaes go wrong is in the blending of flavors. Most
sundaes are served in a tall glass or deep bowl. The sauces are
warm and the ice cream is slippery, so it is only a few bites
before everything starts melding into a thick soup. Each component
must be able to mix with the population of other flavors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sundae that Bollo at Meigas assembled was a surprising
juxtaposition of typical Spanish flavors. He served it in a martini
glass with a shot of flame orange kumquat sauce at the bottom,
covered by a mound of coffee-colored crema catalana ice cream, two
thin slivers of almond cake and a jagged shard of caramelized sugar
that glistened like a pane of stained glass. It was beautiful to
look at, but the chances of the components mixing together
successfully seemed slim.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream was a rich, lazy cream, scented with nutmeg. The
kumquat sauce was aggressively sharp and bitter. The sugar shard
had a burned flavor and crackled like dry leaves. When they mixed
together, though, the jarring contrasts came together like a
Creamsicle. A serious, grown-up Creamsicle.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Bollo said, he would have used Seville oranges, but
kumquats are a fine substitute. The ice cream, he said, needs that
kind of acidity to balance its richness.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling was what Ross at Nobu came up with. Her
sundae, served in a tall parfait glass, looked like a child's dream
Bomb Pop with layers of colors _ pale green, pink, white, caramel.
It was leveled cleanly at the top and crowned with a yamamomo
berry, a Japanese mountain berry, flecked with gold leaf. She makes
clean layers by freezing it after each layer.
</P>
<P>
   Ross chose flavors that she uses regularly and ordered them so
that the colors would contrast nicely. That order was also the most
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a layer of whipped cream and tiny bits of
pistachio. It tasted uncannily like Lucky Charms. Then things got
serious. A minerally green tea ice cream followed, then a ginger
caramel sauce. A pink layer in the middle turned out to be a red
bean ice cream, sort of the starch of the dish. More caramel sauce
lingered beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Just when things began to seem heavy, the next layer, a lemony
yuzu ice cream, shook it all up. And then there was the kicker: a
base of what looked like pesto. It was shiso leaf, chopped and
marinated in a simple syrup. After it all, you eat the yamamomo
berry, which looks and tastes like a cross between a cherry and
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it a treasure trove of surprises, but each spoonful
was like a geological sample. Only when you got way down into it
did it get mixed up and mushy.
</P>
<P>
   A good sundae should transfix you, as you dig and work and
uncover all of its parts. Eating Nobu's sundae was just that way.
It was impossible to carry on a conversation, impossible to take in
surroundings, impossible to think about anything else but the glass
and getting to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Only Dan Barber and Alex Urena, the chefs at Blue Hill, chose to
serve their sundae unconstructed and in the unpredictable hands of
the diner. They turned it into an interactive playground of
toppings, each with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to me to have the overabundance and then feel sort
of sick and full,'' Barber said. ``I wonder if that's not part of
the pleasure, getting to mix and match what you like and then
feeling kind of full.''
</P>
<P>
   With theirs, it's inevitable. You are served a large deep bowl,
with quenelles of chocolate sorbet, vanilla ice cream and
apricot-pit ice cream that lie like rocks in a well. A little
banana foam is sprayed on top in lieu of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is up to you to fill that well, choosing from a long
rectangular tray of condiments. There were tiny homemade
marshmallows, coated in coconut and as soft as feather pillows; a
hot, bitter chocolate sauce; a warm milk jam; a minty, winey cherry
sauce; crackly coin-shaped pralines; and Scharffen Berger chocolate
nibs for bitterness and crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Self control is pushed to its most fragile limits, but it's a
frantic, delicious circus.
</P>
<P>
   Bellanger, whose sundae journey began with a dud, ended up
sticking very close to the classic, sanding down the rough edges
and refining it with detail work.
</P>
<P>
   He began with a single flavor in mind. Then, he said, ``I decide
other flavors, but they are there to support and enhance the main
flavor.'' And he limited those supporting flavors to five. ``After
that,'' he said, ``it gets confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   His focus was the very un-French flavor of peanuts. He made a
chunky salted-peanut ice cream that was heavier on the milk than
cream, so that it wouldn't be too heavy and wouldn't get too hard.
Over small golf-ball size scoops in a martini glass, he drizzled
thin ribbons of a caramel sauce seasoned with fleur de sel from
Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped in whole salted peanuts and pieces of
chocolate-covered wafers, bought in the grocery store (better,
Bellanger said, than anything he could make because they are crisp
and as light as air). The chocolate coating adds a dimension of
flavor but also protects the wafers from becoming soggy. ``By the
time you finish your ice cream,'' Bellanger said, ``you should get
different sensations of temperature, of consistency, of crunch.''
With his sundae, you do. Every bite was crunch, crunch, crunch.
</P>
<P>
   On top, there was a sprawling dollop of whipped cream, left
unsweetened to counter the sweet in the ice cream and the salt in
the caramel sauce. ``To add sugar in the whipped cream,'' he said,
``makes the sensation that it is more heavy.'' Such deceptions are
permissible in a sundae.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bellanger conceded that the McDonald's sundae has a
``perfect texture,'' its influences were not evident.
</P>
<P>
   As he assembled his creation, working intensely but excitedly,
Bellanger suffered teasing from others in Le Bernardin's kitchen.
If he was making ice cream sundaes, one cook taunted, were banana
splits next?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope so.

GOVERNMENT HOPES CUBANS MAINTAIN ANTI-U.S. FERVOR DESPITE ELIAN'S
RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Now that Elian Gonzalez is home and has begun to
reclaim his young life, officials say that it will be difficult to
sustain the emotional commitment Cubans had to that case as the
government presses its latest battle with the United States over
its trade embargo and immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo and the Cuban Adjustment Act are emerging as the
centerpieces of a post-Elian era, and officials intend to continue
the public rallies and televised discussion that were a staple of
daily life throughout the seven-month custody battle over Elian.
But in an acknowledgment that the issues are different, Ricardo
Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly and the main
adviser to the Gonzalez family, said the events would be scaled
down somewhat in time and size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ask if there can be the same emotional level? No,'' he
said in a 90-minute interview late Monday afternoon. ``You cannot
ask people to have the same emotional level about a boy without a
mother, separated from his father, for a discussion of the
adjustment law. It is more abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alarcon, who was the highest-ranking Cuban official to
greet Elian when he arrived at Jose Marti International Airport
last week, said the public events staged on behalf of Elian had
proved useful in mobilizing people and reaching out to Cuban youth.
It was an opportunity, he said, born of the campaign by
Cuban-Americans and their congressional supporters to keep Elian in
Miami after he was rescued from an inner tube last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave it to us on a silver platter,'' he said. ``This is a
battle of ideas that we appreciate clearly. This did not begin in
November or in the first days of December. The denunciations
started with Elian, and at that time we did not think it would go
so long. But those seven months have allowed us to discover new
forms, methods and actors, and a lot more youth, above all. Why
stop that when there are so many problems to resolve?''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems, officials contend, stem from the economic havoc
wreaked by the embargo and exacerbated by policies that allow
Cubans who reach U.S. soil to apply for asylum. Others, including
ordinary Cuban citizens, feel the real problem is a lack of
enthusiasm for the revolution among a people who have been fed a
diet of slogans while adjusting themselves to the daily struggle of
inventing ways to resolve their personal economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said it was ``simplistic'' to believe the rallies were
intended to revive the revolution's flagging domestic appeal. But
he acknowledged that Elian's case had intense support among the
young, who have been featured players in the rallies and other
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth will continue to be the protagonists, but that is
the march of life,'' he said of the new campaign. ``Elain touched
almost all the youth. Elian was five years old. His mother,
Elisabet, was around 24. His father Juan Miguel was 31. The
grandparents are in their 50s. They were children at the triumph of
the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the public support for Elian paid off with his
return, which he said some young people likened to Jan. 1, 1959,
when Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries took power.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the youth, January 1, 1959, was something they read about
of their parent's generation,'' he said. ``This is theirs. We speak
about how youth are into other things. But no one could imagine how
the events here firmed up people of both generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials want to capitalize on that attention, although
at a rally in Manzanillo Saturday, many in attendance seemed to be
going through the motions, waving flags during speeches filled with
familiar scorn for U.S. policy. Just in case, officials have
reduced the time of the televised discussions to one hour and
forty-five minutes from two hours, as well as freeing up one of the
country's two state-run television stations for regular
programming. Nevertheless, Alarcon made it clear, as have several
speakers and commentators at the government-organized events, that
the policy issues will not be downplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask why continue into a new phase?'' he said. ``The
question is, why stop it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the interview, Alarcon took issue with how a recent
congressional agreement allowing U.S. food sales was portrayed as a
softening of the embargo, which he called a blockade _ the
preferred official Cuban term. He insisted it would make sales of
wheat and rice more difficult unless U.S. banks are allowed to
finance the transactions and ships are allowed to make deliveries
without being penalized. Currently, ships cannot dock at U.S. ports
for six months after going to Cuba .
</P>
<P>
   ``How will they get these products to Cuba,'' he asked. ``Grain
by grain?'' He also said that unless Cuba was allowed to use those
ships to also send their products to the United States, Cuba's
costs would increase because the boats would have to return empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have credit or you are allowed to pay for it with
what you can earn from selling your products in their market,'' he
said. ``This agreement hardens the blockade. For the sake of
rhetoric they had to say that conceptually there could be sales to
Cuba, but these conditions make it impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   As officials turn their attention to the new priorities of trade
and immigration, the Gonzalez family may find it difficult to
attain its own goal of being a normal clan after having captured
the world's attention. For now, they are in a seaside Havana home,
where Elian and some of his classmates are wrapping up their
first-grade studies before going off on a vacation with the
eventual plan being that the Gonzalez family will return to its
hometown of Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the government media has been filled with
praise for Juan Miguel and Elian as model citizens, raising the
question of whether greater things are in store for Gonzalez.
Alarcon, who said he had grown close to Gonzalez, said the
government would continue to help the family adjust to life back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel will be able to do whatever he wants,'' was all
Alarcon would say about the future. ``He was a normal person who
was turned into something else. Returning to what he was before
will not be easy.''

   MEXICO-ELECTION _ MEXICO CITY _ Sweeping historic reforms
designed to crack down on corruption and drug trafficking, improve
police and bring in large quanties of investments to help lift the
economy are in store for Mexico, president-elect Vicente Fox told
foreign reporters Tuesday. Fox is using head hunters in a broad
search to find and name cabinet members in the next two months,
well before he takes office Dec. 1. In an effort to alter 71 years
of government under one party, Fox will seek modern checks and
balances. He'll strip the federal government of the power to audit
itself and give it to Congress. He's creating a new ministry for
police and security, taking that power away from the Internal
Affairs Ministry, a political department he said engaged in
espionage and other abuses. Judicial powers will be taken away from
the Attorney General's office. Fox will push for the end of U.S.
certification of drug-fighting partners and the adoption of a
multi-lateral system of mutual approval among countries. With a
vision for a European Union-style relationship with the U.S. and
Canada, Fox will also urge negotiations to establish a development
fund for Mexico and more free transit of Mexican migrant workers.

FRANCE BEGINS INVESTIGATION OF U.S. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French prosecutor has begun a preliminary
investigation into whether the U.S. global surveillance system,
which listens in on millions of telephone calls, faxes and e-mails
each day, is a threat to French well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, has ordered France's
counter-intelligence agency, DST, to appraise the actions of the
system, Echelon. The system links computers in at least seven sites
around the world to receive, analyze and sort information captured
from satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   If the French agency finds the system ``harmful to the vital
interests of the nation,'' legal proceedings could begin, though it
is difficult to see how a U.S. government agency could be sued in a
French court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue is taken very seriously in Europe. Many fear
that America's vast surveillance system, developed during the Cold
War, is now being used to further U.S. economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have repeatedly denied that. But the issue
continues to arouse passions here. This is particularly true in
France, where even the Justice Minister, Elisabeth Guigou,
contended in February that Cold War-era spy systems had been
converted to ``economic espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the European Parliament held hearings on the
subject, which led to an emotional debate. A report commissioned by
the parliament and written by a British journalist said there was
evidence that the Echelon system had twice helped U.S. companies
gain an advantage over Europeans, though few details were provided.
Some of the members of the parliament expressed skepticism over the
18 page report. But others did not.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament is deciding whether to create a commission to
continue its investigation of Echelon.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dintilhac, Marie-Annick Darmaillac, said the
prosecutor had decided to begin his own investigation after
receiving a letter from a member of the European Parliament who is
a former French judge, Thierry Jean-Pierre. Darmaillac said the
letter had contained enough information for the prosecutor to feel
an investigation was warranted. But she said she could not discuss
what steps might be taken next as it was up to the prosecutor to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   In Strasbourg, Jean-Pierre told Agence France-Press that he
believes that either the Echelon system should be dismantled or
Europe should have a hand in governing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echelon is used by the National Security Agency for strategic
and economic gains,'' Jean-Pierre said. ``You cannot make me
believe that the information is not passed on to American
companies.''

   This is not the first time that France has reacted to
allegations of U.S. spying. In 1995, France expelled five U.S.
diplomats and officials, one of them the alleged Paris station
chief for the Central Intelligence Agency, in connection with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that many Europeans are particularly galled that the
British are partners with the United States in the Echelon system.
</P>
<P>
   Recently declassified information shows that Echelon is a
network of surveillance stations stitched together in the 1970s by
the United States with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.
The system listens and watches for key words on a topic requested
by a country. Some experts have said that the most extravagant
claims against the Echelon system make little sense, because the
National Security Agency is overwhelmed by the proliferation of
information over the internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that France operates its own surveillance
system, which some have dubbed ``Frenchelon,'' though it is
believed to be much smaller than the U.S. system. However, it is
thought to do much the same thing, eavesdropping on private and
public communications.

   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.
</P>
<P>
   This story, for papers on Thursday, July 6, will be filed on
Wednesday, in full and abridged versions:

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop _ not just rap music but
fashion, break-dancing, graffiti and the magazines that chronicle
it all _ blossomed into the radiant center of youth culture, Billy
Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it a way to flee
their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more provocative
one. Like many young hip-hop heads, he regarded hip-hop, with its
appeal to whites and blacks, as a bold modern hope to ease some of
the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young black
man, had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. As a writer and
editor, he too had spent much of his adult life thinking about
hip-hop. And not just hip-hop, but race and hip-hop. Race was
unavoidable in hip-hop. Hip-hop had inspired him to believe that,
precisely because he was black, he could achieve what whites simply
assumed was theirs by birthright _ a gainful life over which he
asserted control. By N.R. Kleinfield. (6775 words, plus an abridged
version of about half that length)

part of a team of reporters for The Akron Beacon Journal that had
explored the racial attitudes of this city. Their series earned the
paper the Pulitzer Prize. The Beacon Journal also tried to lead by
example, and shortly after the series ended, it introduced a lineup
of columnists reflecting ``the perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put
it. They included a black woman and a white woman as well as
Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is white. The paper, it
seemed, had become a proud model of racial enlightenment. Which
made it all the more startling when just a year later, the
jubilation began to fade. By Dana Canedy.

more complex one has replaced it, and now the system rewards

Generations of whitewash were peeling in ugly patches from the

were gaping holes where doors and windows used to be. Obscured by
rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories

 &HT;    Peachtree Road Race 2000: New winners, old traditions
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson and Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Peachtree Road Race of 2000 _ call it our Y2K
10K _ is any indication, the next 30 years of the world's largest
road race might be more remarkable than the first 30.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 31st edition of the Peachtree had some big winners:
</P>
<P>
   Alene Emere. The 20-year-old Ethiopian never had set foot on
U.S. soil or run a 10K race on the road before winning Peachtree
2000 by one second over course record-holder Joseph Kimani of
Kenya. Emere beat one of the deepest, most competitive men's fields
in Peachtree history and won in 28 minutes, 4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Lornah Kiplagat of Kenya. She won her first Peachtree in her
fourth attempt and ran away from the women's field so much that she
briefly considered slowing down to make the race more competitive.
Kiplagat thought better of it and tied the women's course record of
30:52.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Driscoll. She felt ``euphoric'' after winning the women's
wheelchair division for the sixth time in record time. ``My goal
was to reclaim this hilly course,'' said Driscoll, 33, who broke
her own course record with a time of 24:16.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's Franz Nietelispach. He held off defending champion
Saul Mendoza of Mexico by a second in 19:27 to capture his third
wheelchair Peachtree in four years.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of swift 40-year-olds, Kenya's Andrew Masai and 1989
Peachtree winner Judi St. Hilaire. They won the masters divisions
in 29:37 and 34:16, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   They were the swiftest of the 55,000 who sallied forth down
Peachtree on a warm, but not oppressive, Fourth of July morning,
relatively benign by past Peachtree standards.
</P>
<P>
   The race featured its customary cast of patriotic characters.
Abigail Snead, 17, of Cumming, Ga., dribbled a red-and-blue
basketball the entire way. A group of veterans, chanting and
showing some fancy footwork, occasionally went backwards. Various
runners were Uncle Sams and Statues of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Patti Lott, who drove from Clarkesville, Tenn., to
stay with relatives in Decatur, Ga., for their 16th Peachtree, said
they wanted to do something special to mark the 2000 Peachtree.
They went to the pre-race expo and stocked up for the holiday: red,
white and blue bandannas, shorts adorned with American flags and
Patti's tank top with a swirling Old Glory across her chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happening,'' Frank Lott said. ``We are way back in the
pack, but we're just runners who love to have a good time. It's a
great tradition, and we just have a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not alone.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Potent but widely separated thunderstorms, a few with large hail
and damaging winds, will erupt over eastern Montana and western
North Dakota Wednesday as moist winds from the southeast glide up
the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of heavy thunderstorms will develop across parts of
Iowa and Illinois as very warm and humid air interacts with a
stationary front. A separate system of thunderstorms will produce
heavy rains early Wednesday over the lower Ohio River Valley. The
system will gradually weaken as it slips southeast toward western
Virginia and the western Carolinas late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity will ease Wednesday across the Northeast in the wake of
a front moving off the coast. In the West, isolated but potent
thunderstorms will develop over the Sierra Nevada and Klamath
Mountains of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RECORD GUSTS
</P>
<P>
   Winds from a severe thunderstorm gusted to 82 mph on Monday at
Glasgow, Mont., setting a record at that town nestled in the
state's northeast corner. The previous record gust was 76 mph in
1997. Towns like Glasgow, which are immune from the supercharged
winds of hurricanes, powerful coastal storms in winter and
destructive downslope windstorms in the foothills of the Rockies,
typically set records for gusts in severe thunderstorms. Localized
winds in tornadoes seldom qualify since they are usually estimated
by assessing the extent of damage.

$25 AND UNDER: OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, THE STREETS OF EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The name `Knoedel' should be set minus the first 'e' and with
an umlaut over the `o'.) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a dedicated follower of fast food fashions, I was
at the head of the line when overstuffed burritos first landed in
New York and when sandwiches changed their names to wraps. Last
year, when Belgian frites shacks started appearing on every corner,
I was dipping fries into mayonnaise all over Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The smorgasbord is always expanding, and no matter how novel it
seems, it is always rooted in traditional street food. The newest
arrivals are admirable versions of great old European standards,
like waffles, sausages and crepes _ all served with American speed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new kiosks, cafes and restaurants are F&AMP;B in Chelsea,
which calls itself a ``European-style eatery'' devoted to ``gourmet
hot dogs.'' In the East Village, Bulgin' Waffles is making the case
that the waffle is every bit as Continental as its more glamorous
cousin, the crepe, which, by the way, has also seen a surge in
restaurants promoting it recently, the latest being Rue des Crepes
in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   And in Grand Central Terminal, Christer Larsson, the owner of
Christer's on West 55th Street, has opened Knoedel, a kiosk that
treats American-style sausages with European veneration. These
restaurant owners clearly recognize the value of European patina,
even when applied to fast food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that American appetites have become more refined, and
they associate that with European culture,'' said Jeffrey Starin,
the owner of Bulgin' Waffles, who decided to forsake computer
programming for the waffle business after reading a Goldman, Sachs
report a few years ago noting that frozen waffle sales were
increasing by 12 percent a year. ``The crepe has been exploited,
and so has the pancake, but not the waffle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the waffle is now ready for prime time, how about blini? They
are the specialty at Blini Hut in lower Manhattan, along with other
Russian dishes like borscht and pirogi. And where once the sandwich
stood proud as the epitome of the quick American meal, little
Italian panini are encroaching at places like Via Quadronno on the
Upper East Side, Il Posto Accanto in the East Village and numerous
other cafes.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone knows who remembers Zum Zum, a 1960s-era fast-food
chain serving German sausages, the current wave of restaurants is
not an entirely new phenomenon. And of course, hamburgers and
frankfurters reflect their onetime immigrant status in their names.
But as Americans have shifted their critical gaze to include not
only fine wines but also items that were once taken for granted,
like beer, bagels and cigars, these entrepreneurs are setting their
sights on a higher order of fast foods.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Starin's spare corner restaurant, which most resembles
an American college-town coffeehouse, serves wonderful waffles. The
namesake Bulgin' Waffle ($4), the kind you might find in Belgium,
is indeed big and thick, yet it's airy and fluffy. Even better are
the smaller buckwheat wafflettes ($1.75), exquisitely light and
crisp, with more flavor than the big, white-flour waffles. You
won't find those in Belgium, which is Belgium's loss. The biggest
drawbacks at Bulgin' are that the waffles are served on paper
plates with flimsy plastic cutlery and that you have to pay 85
cents for pure maple syrup or any of the excellent fruit syrups.
</P>
<P>
   F&AMP;B, a sleek storefront decorated in soothing pastels with
pleasant lighting, offers a more self-consciously European visage.
The name stands for frites and beignets, but hot dogs are the
centerpiece, including the excellent Great Dane ($2.85), a slender,
red Danish sausage with bright snap to it. It is eaten just as it
is in Denmark, on a roll with frizzled onions, marinated cucumbers,
mustard, ketchup and remoulade.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a lot, but it's an easy mouthful, especially
compared with the Top Dog ($2.85), a plumper German-style sausage
topped with tame sauerkraut and crumbled bacon. Frites ($1.75 to
$5) are crisp and savory, and for an extra 50 cents, they are
served with toppings including aioli, blue cheese and truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   If truffle oil on frites is your idea of heaven, you may as well
also indulge in a small bottle of champagne ($12). I'd stick with
fresh lemonade ($2.10) or Belgian-style beer ($4).
</P>
<P>
   The sausages are plumper, richer and more expensive at Knoedel,
Larsson's kiosk in the Food Court at Grand Central. Larsson's
restaurant is Scandinavian, but his sausages are American, served
on fresh potato rolls with assorted toppings like hot dogs, though
derived from the European tradition of creative sausage making.
</P>
<P>
   The fine Knoedel brat ($6.95), for example, is mostly savory
pork, with pureed fig for a bit of sweetness and softer texture
and, surprise, pine nuts, which fit in perfectly. Knoedel also
serves an excellent smoky, spicy andouille ($6.95) and a sweet and
smoky chicken-and-apple sausage ($6.95), both from Aidells Sausage
Co. Sides include sesame-scented Asian slaw ($2), with red cabbage,
carrots and raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Knoedel, by the way, is the German word for dumpling. It has
nothing to do with sausages, but Larsson said he likes the way it
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, crepes have been associated more with kitschy
French-American restaurants of the 1950s than with French street
food, and Rue des Crepes does little to remedy that. The little
dining room resembles a cobblestone Left Bank street by way of
Disney World, complete with street signs and other contrived cues.
But it matters little, because the crepes are very good. Savory
combinations, wrapped in soft buckwheat crepes, include merguez
sausage with white beans and garlic ($7.95) and chewy flank steak
with caramelized onions ($7.95). I especially enjoyed sweet
fillings, like Nutella and banana ($5.50), and the simple lemon and
butter ($2.95) wrapped in white-flour crepes.
</P>
<P>
   You won't think you're in Paris, but you won't think you're in
the '50s anymore, either.

 LAX MILITARY SECURITY PERMITTED BOMBINGS IN CHECHNYA, RUSSIAN
OFFICIAL SAYS (SUBS 6th graf to delete last line; 9th graf to add

   MOSCOW _ Negligence by Russian commanders enabled Chechen
suicide bombers to carry out the devastating attacks on Sunday that
killed more than 30 soldiers, the chief of Russia's intelligence
service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Patrushev, the director of the Federal Security Service,
said that his agency had alerted the Russian military that
terrorist attacks were being planned but that the military had
failed to take proper precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mistake on the part of commanders in the field,''
he said. ``We have to act in a coordinated fashion to prevent such
things from happening in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Five trucks loaded with munitions exploded in Chechnya Sunday
night, catching the Russian military by surprise and shocking the
nation. Russian officials on Tuesday put the final toll at 33 dead,
84 wounded and three missing.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to restore control over Chechnya's towns and settlements,
Russian officials on Tuesday issued a ``shoot on sight'' order for
any vehicle that breached a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. New
checkpoints have been set up, and many Chechen residents were
reportedly staying at home.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people have been detained, but it is not clear if the
Russian authorities have found any of those who organized the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   A series of devastating explosions in Russian apartment
buildings in September helped build public support for the war.
Russian officials said then that the rebels were to blame, but
there is no conclusive proof of their role.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sunday bombings, most of the casualties were in Argun, a
town east of Grozny, where a truck bomb slammed into a dormitory
occupied by a militia unit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite alerts of possible attacks, there was no concrete
barrier or other obstacle to stop the truck, which may have been
operated by two suicide bombers, from approaching the building.
</P>
<P>
   Providing new details of that attack, Russian television
reported Tuesday night that 22 militia members had been killed in
that attack and 48 wounded. Many of the dead and wounded were
buried under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   After the bomb exploded, Chechen snipers began shooting at the
building, and a gunfight continued for one-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials agreed that negligence was a factor,
they said that it was the fault of local commanders, not Gen. Ivan
Babichev, the military commandant of Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The destruction in Argun ``resulted from the failure to comply
with an order by General Babichev that additional security measures
were to be taken,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the senior Russian
government spokesman on the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to put the best face on a worsening situation, Akhmad
Kadyrov, the Russian-appointed administrator of Chechnya, described
the bombings as a desperate act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebel leaders are seriously concerned that the people have
lately begun to nurture hope for Chechnya's peaceful development,''
Kadyrov told the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Others took a more pessimistic view. Boris Berezovsky, the media
tycoon and a parliamentary deputy who represents a region in the
North Caucasus, said that Russia would not be able to win a
military victory in Chechnya. During the Yeltsin administration,
Berezovsky served as a negotiator in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the jingoists' loud statements, most of Russian
society believes the war in Chechnya is leading our country to
defeat,'' he said. ``There can be no military victory in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chechnya, it is necessary to reach an agreement with the
most extremist element of the Chechen population, as well. If the
political process is dragged out, it will be hard on Russia,
including our president's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept a low profile in
recent days and has little to say about the bombing attacks, which
have challenged the Kremlin's claims to control the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, for their part, were more vocal. They promised more
attacks, warning civilians to move away from Russian bases and
command posts.
</P>
<P>
   Shamil Basayev, the Chechen warlord, demanded that Russian
authorities hand over a Russian officer accused of the rape and
murder of a Chechen woman, according to a Chechen spokesman,
Movladi Udogov. Otherwise, he vowed, there would be more bombing
attacks.

LEMONADE, FROM PLAIN TO PERFECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a drink that seems quintessentially American,
lemonade is at its purest in France. Any cafe there will serve what
is called a citron presse, a glass filled partway with pulpy,
freshly squeezed lemon juice along with a carafe of water and a jar
of simple syrup or superfine sugar for diluting and sweetening to
taste. It is the essence of fresh lemons, the antithesis of the
artificial or too-sweet lemonades so common in this country, where
even children are considered capable of making a pitcherful to sell
at a sidewalk stand.
</P>
<P>
   Citron presse, though, is always the same. In New York, now that
imaginative chefs have embraced the concept, lemonade is becoming
more of a many-splendored drink, made in myriad fruit flavors. What
these chefs are concocting are tart, lemony beverages that easily
rival the French ideal. Their innovations could reawaken interest
in homemade lemonade, and not just for children.
</P>
<P>
   City Bakery off Union Square has been ahead of the curve for
years, serving an excellent version of lemonade as a summertime
sales builder to replace the hot chocolate dispensed in cold
months. The owner, Maury Rubin, is so passionate about lemonade
that he offers at least two types every day, one plain and one
flavored with the juice of a seasonal fruit. Last week the seasonal
fruit drink was a pale red cherry lemonade, just slightly sweeter
than the plain.
</P>
<P>
   Esca, in the theater district, is also using cherries in
lemonade, although the chef, David Pasternack, started out in the
spring _ when the restaurant opened _ by flavoring it with rhubarb
pulp. As apricots and peaches become more available, he says, he
plans to continue varying the recipe. Esca also offers lemonade
spiked with Campari, which may be the best adult version ever
created.
</P>
<P>
   At Gotham Bar and Grill, the house lemonade is flavored with
fresh ginger and whatever berries are in season. The ginger lends a
peppery note to the combination, whether strawberries, raspberries
or both are used. Joseph Murphy, the pastry chef and lemon
squeezer, says the summery drink sells well at lunchtime as an
alternative to bottled water when diners are drinking less wine and
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants are relying on other fruit flavors for
lemonade. Avenue on the Upper West Side makes a sweet strawberry
version to serve in a glass coupe with a ripe red berry perched on
the rim. Bayou in Harlem adds lime and mint, while Rustic in
Brooklyn is using pomegranate juice. Throughout this whole month,
Cucina at Macy's is featuring a different lemonade flavor every
day, from mango to cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Daniel Silverman at Union Square Cafe simply
heightens the pure lemon flavor by adding dried lemons and lemon
grass. ``The lemon grass has a bright, citrusy element to it, while
the dried lemons add a deeper, base note,'' he said. ``But you
can't actually taste them. In the end it just tastes like really
good lemonade.''
</P>
<P>
   So does the old-fashioned plain lemonade at Good in Greenwich
Village, which is tart but not sharp and filled with thinly sliced
lemons. The chef, Steven Picker, first makes a simple syrup by
boiling and stirring a cup and a half of sugar with a cup of water
until the granules dissolve. After it cools, he combines it with 2
cups of juice freshly squeezed from about 16 lemons, adds 6 cups of
water and chills it completely to make enough lemonade for 10
people or one sidewalk stand.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's finished and poured over ice, it's even better than a
citron presse, since you don't have to mix it yourself.

IN LONDON, A FULL HOUSE FEELS EMPTY TO CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While some commercial theatrical producers are accusing
nonprofit theaters in the United States of abandoning their mandate
to take risks and of playing it safe to fill seats, at least one
government-subsidized theater is the subject of similar attacks in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Trevor Nunn, whose credits as director include
``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Nicholas Nickleby'' and who
headed the Royal Shakespeare Company for 18 years, has come under
considerable fire in the London papers for his three-year-old
stewardship of the Royal National Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In general, critics have taken Nunn to task for what they call
cautious programming that they say leans too heavily on
crowd-pleasing musicals and not enough on new work and younger
playwrights. Writing in The Guardian in April, Michael Billington
said: ``What one craves from the National is some alternative to a
musical-dominated commercial culture rather than a duplication of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billington compared the current National with that of Nunn's
formidable predecessors, Sir Peter Hall and Richard Eyre,
suggesting that Nunn had abandoned the institution's mandate to
break new ground and had failed to make a home for up-and-coming
talent. ``The irony is that under Peter Hall and Richard Eyre, new
writing was the National's strongest card,'' Billington argued.
``Under Trevor Nunn it has become its Achilles' heel.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Nunn does showcase new work, some critics say, he
misfires. ``Nunn's choice of new work _ Stephen Poliakoff's abysmal
`Remember This' and Nick Stafford's `Battle Royal,''' wrote
Nicholas De Jongh in The Evening Standard, ``reminded us what a
feeble judge of new plays he is.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is coming while the National, on London's South Bank,
has had a banner year by any standards. In February it won won a
record nine Olivier Awards, the London equivalent of the Tony
Awards, including one for best director for Nunn. The new musical
``Honk!,'' based on ``The Ugly Duckling,'' beat ``The Lion King''
for best new musical.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the theater's 43 productions this past season received
stellar reviews, including ``The Merchant of Venice'' and
``Summerfolk.'' The National also exported three productions to New
York: ``Copenhagen,'' which won the Tony Award for best play;
``Rose,'' a one-woman play with Olympia Dukakis, which had a less
successful run; and ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' a critically praised new
Irish drama off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Nunn sent over ``Not About Nightingales,'' a
previously unproduced play by Tennessee Williams that was widely
praised by critics. And, next season, Nunn's acclaimed production
of ``Oklahoma!,'' produced by Cameron Mackintosh, is expected on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In The Evening Standard, Nunn answered his critics with a
1,500-word explanation of his goals for the National and how he is
trying to achieve them. In the piece, he quoted Laurence Olivier,
who once told him, ``Make no mistake, my boy, running a
state-subsidized theater will always be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my darker moments at the South Bank, I feel I know just
what he meant,'' Nunn continued, ``but most of the time I recognize
the flak for what it is: a necessary and ongoing debate about what
a national theater ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter said that catching flak was part of the job
description and that what Nunn had suffered so far was
comparatively mild. ``It's a political appointment, and you get a
lot of mud thrown at you,'' Sir Peter said. ``I'm sure Trevor would
love to take risks in the National's two main houses, but he'd get
run out of town if he didn't balance the books.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office on a break between rehearsals recently,
Nunn acknowledged that taking the risk to produce untested work
demanded more bravery now than it once did. ``The effort to come to
new plays is greater than it ever used to be,'' he said. ``You have
to these days recognize the consequence that you could be doing
considerable damage to your box office figures if you do that. But
one's got to be able to dare. This is not a time to be timid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn is constantly aware of the financial pressure. He succeeded
in getting the government's Arts Council, which distributes
treasury money to the arts, to increase its annual grant to the
National to about $21 million; the grant had been frozen at $19
million for six years. Still, Nunn has said, he has to raise $3.5
million more from private sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonstop,'' he said. ``It's a sword of Damocles that
dangles above us by a thread and you're constantly imagining that
the thread is going to break, it's going to slice you in two.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn suggests that the critics have pigeonholed him as populist
because they associate him with ``Cats'' and Andrew Lloyd Webber,
who is known for appealing to middlebrow tastes. He also defends
his decision to do musicals, having long disputed any distinction
between what is artistically worthy and what is commercially
popular. Nunn maintains, for example, that ``Oklahoma!'' is not
only a palatable piece of entertainment but also a pivotal work
that changed musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   As for new work, Nunn said that up-and-coming playwrights were
welcome and that he was committed to producing venturesome
material. ``At least 50 percent of the work should be new
writing,'' he said. ``We should be commissioning more, we should be
developing and encouraging more new writing in all sorts of
different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nunn said, it is not easy to tap into a new
generation of Gorkys or Marlowes, writers who changed the form with
their plays. ``You can't just bring about such an age because you
want it,'' he said. ``It has to be a confluence of people wanting
it and talent and interest being present and available. But I sense
that is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the latest slings and arrows, Nunn clearly takes
refuge in the work itself. Perhaps his greatest point of pride is
in bringing on an ensemble of 50 actors, each with an unusually
diverse series of roles in the company's repertory, from a small
part in Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' to a lead role in
the Leonard Bernstein musical ``Candide.'' The whole group agreed
to stay for 18 months, from January 1999 to June 2000. ``I think
that alone is evidence that something special is happening here,''
Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn has received considerable praise for this ensemble. Writing
in the The Times of London, Benedict Nightingale called Nunn's
troupe ``the most exciting innovation of his two-year reign.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blakemore, who directed ``Copenhagen'' and has known
Nunn for many years, said that getting to know cast members over an
entire season adds a layer of loyalty to the theatergoing
experience. ``You can follow individual actors like you follow
members of the sports team,'' he said. ``It's the first time the
National has been a resident company.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any advice Blakemore might have for Nunn, he said,
it would be to enlist some help and attempt less himself. ``I'm a
little surprised he hasn't taken on board a small group of
associate directors,'' Blakemore said. ``He may be trying to do too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn, 60, conceded that the job had taken a personal toll, that
he had had less time than he would have liked to see his five
children _ ages 4, 9, 11, 14 and 19 _ and his wife, the actress
Imogen Stubbs. ``You need to feel there are rewards, that you're
making some progress,'' he said. ``I've become a bit of an Eeyore
these days. There's a looking on the grimmer side.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels there is much left to accomplish. While he has stepped
up the National's touring, he hopes to do still more as well as to
showcase the best of Britain's regional theaters. (The National
imported the Birmingham Rep's version of ``Baby Doll,'' which
subsequently moved to the West End, and West Yorkshire's revival of
``Singin' in the Rain,'' which plays till July 20.)
</P>
<P>
   Nunn also wants to attract younger and more diverse audiences
with special offers. ``There is a perception that the National
Theater is for affluent middle England,'' he said. ``It's a
perception that I'm determined to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nunn's tenure expires in 2002, there is no obvious
successor in view. Would he be interested in a second term, as has
been rumored? ``Thoughts about leaving are connected to thoughts
about succession,'' Nunn said. ``One has to know the organization
is going to go from strength to strength, rather than by certain
calendar day. I'm a believer in organizations finding their future
from within. That takes nurturing time.''
</P>
<P>
   While he could fill his time at the National simply dealing with
administrative matters like raising money and programming, he
continues to direct (he staged three productions last season) and
believes the two roles are complementary. ``The only place from
which the theater can be led is the rehearsal room,'' he said. ``I
say that in as doctrinaire a way as you care to report it. Doing
work, creating work in the rehearsal room is where all the energy
of a theater organization proceeds from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Planning a repertoire can only be done by artists,'' he
continued. ``Artists with passions, artists with visions, artists
with obsessions. Then all of those things have to be rationalized
and made possible. They have to be enabled.''

TWO DESSERT COOKBOOKS PROVIDE PLENTY OF TIMELESS FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer turns the clock back. We recapture childhood, eat hog
dogs at street fairs, have picnics, sip lemonade and hanker for
old-fashioned treats like strawberry shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you like your strawberry shortcake? Made with layers
of feathery golden spongecake slathered with whipped cream and
studded with berries? Or with a rich, crumbly biscuit as the
underpinning for the cream and fruit?
</P>
<P>
   Today, both are considered shortcake, though technically a
shortcake is a sweet biscuit-style cake made with a lot of
shortening _ hence the name _ or butter. If the spongecake style is
for you, so is ``Retro Desserts'' by Wayne Harley Brachman (Morrow,
$27). It claims its recipe, called ``diner-style strawberry
shortcake,'' is the one diners always used. But in ``Diner
Desserts'' (Chronicle Books, $18.95), Tish Boyle begs to differ,
saying her biscuit-style strawberry shortcake is the true diner
classic. Can we take a vote?
</P>
<P>
   Both of these new cookbooks are filled, cover to cover, with
mostly timeless favorites, many of which _ like the shortcakes, all
sorts of ice cream specialties, a sumptuous fresh strawberry
chiffon pie and moist crumb-topped blueberry muffins _ are suited
to summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retro Desserts'' has fancier sweets, like crepes suzette,
brandy Alexander pie, eclairs, cherries jubilee and baked alaska,
but no recipes for coffeecake, cobbler, doughnuts or muffins. The
source for those, as well as for German chocolate cake, is ``Diner
Desserts.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's plenty of overlap in the books: Boston cream pie,
coconut layer cake, black-and-white cookies, rum-raisin rice
pudding and butterscotch pudding show up in both.
</P>
<P>
   I was delighted to find finely tuned recipes in each book.
Brachman, who worked as the executive pastry chef at Mesa Grill and
Bolo in Manhattan and now has the same position at Michael
Jordan's: The Steakhouse, Tapika and the Strip House, which will
open soon, is a rare restaurant chef: he has written a book without
the help of a professional cookbook writer. He obviously tested his
recipes with great care on home equipment. It's no surprise that
Boyle, the food editor of the magazines Chocolatier and Pastry Art
&AMP; Design, knew what she was doing when it came to recipe writing.
</P>
<P>
   Though I loved some of Brachman's innovations, like using white
chocolate in brandy Alexander and grasshopper pies, I was not
tempted by some of his more cock-eyed numbers, like cookies made
with chow mein noodles, rocky road ``pizza'' on a chocolate crust,
or cornflake macaroons. And I wish I could have prepared his
Nesselrode pie using commercially prepared fruit instead of having
to concoct a liquor-soaked mixture at home, with canned chestnuts,
no less. On the other hand, I wanted to make his mousse-like
mile-high peach pie from scratch with fresh fruit, but he called
for frozen fruit only.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, though the peach cobbler in ``Diner Desserts'' calls
for fresh peaches, the cherry pie uses canned fruit. That's the
downside to throwback baking. It's too bad the author did not
suggest fresh fruit as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diner Desserts'' updates peach cobbler with crystallized
ginger, which I liked, but I omitted the orange zest in that book's
black-and-white cookies. I preferred Brachman's version, which
calls for a touch of lemon. I also liked his rice pudding, made
simply with half-and-half, better than Boyle's custardy version.
</P>
<P>
   If pushed, I'd have trouble picking one book over the other,
because the recipes are never highfalutin, and are so reliable that
they're truly fun to prepare and serve. That's what summer's all
about.

BUILDING A SALAD CLEVERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whole-meal salads always feel like a bit of trickery. The best
ones are as interesting and varied as a well-conceived meal, and
they invariably leave guests impressed that a mere salad could be
so satisfying. But the fact that the base is a pile of greens makes
me feel as if I'm getting away with something. And I suppose I am.
This one, for example, made with grilled scallops and a mesclun
mix, takes only 10 minutes longer to make than an ordinary green
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Good whole-meal salads have several things in common. There are
a range of textures _ crunchy greens, a toothsome meat or fish, a
creamy dressing _ and ingredients cut into a variety of sizes and
shapes. The flavors are usually simple, but they build on one
another to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   This salad accomplishes that with few ingredients. The greens
are basic; you can use any combination, or a single lettuce, but a
mesclun mix is the easiest and best choice. The dressing is
powerful and delicious. You might call it a soy-sesame vinaigrette,
but there's more to it than that. Although it will taste exotic to
most people, it's prepared with fairly common ingredients like soy
sauce, sesame paste, ginger and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   I use a blender to assemble the dressing for two reasons: It
makes quick work of dispersing the sesame paste throughout the
liquid ingredients _ something that can be difficult to do with a
fork or a whisk _ and because the blender purees the garlic and
ginger, it eliminates the need to mince them.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled scallops are almost ludicrously fast and easy, and their
texture and flavor complement the greens and the dressing. But you
could also use shrimp, steak or boneless chicken _ preferably
thighs, which have better flavor than breasts and are less likely
to dry out over the grill's heat. Whichever you choose, you could
also cook it on top of the stove in a grill pan or a regular
skillet.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe's timing is one of its strengths. Start the grill, or
heat a pan on top of the stove, and while it is getting warm, make
the dressing and wash the greens. When everything is ready, sear
the scallops just long enough to brown the exterior _ a couple of
minutes a side is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPLE SESAME SALAD WITH SCALLOPS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rice wine or other vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sesame tahini or smooth peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne or ground chilies,
or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon peeled and chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon peeled and chopped ginger
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 cups mesclun or other salad greens, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   \ cup torn Thai or other basil, washed and dried, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill. Place soy, vinegar, tahini,
sesame oil, red pepper, honey, garlic and ginger in a blender, and
blend until smooth. When the grill is hot, sprinkle scallops with
salt and grill about 2 minutes a side; they should remain tender
and undercooked in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine greens and basil, and divide among 4 plates. When
scallops are done, place them on top of the greens. Drizzle with
dressing, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

THE CHEF: TUNA BURGERS REQUIRE CAREFUL PREPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the third second of eight columns by Michel
Richard, the chef and owner of Citronelle in Washington.) By MICHEL
RICHARD   
 With Marian Burros   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I had my first restaurant in Los Angeles 20 years ago,
every time I sent a piece of tuna out to the dining room, the dark
portion would return to the kitchen. No one liked the dark part,
because it tastes more fishy than the rest of the tuna. So I
started cutting out that section, which meant I had leftover
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   First, I tried making tuna tartare; even though it may be on
every menu today, no one would touch it in those days. Then I
decided to turn the chopped-up tuna into patties, sear them briefly
and serve them on sliced brioche as ``tuna burgers.'' They turned
out to be very popular and are still on our lunch menu.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lots of chefs have started making them. Mine are
different in a couple of ways: they are flavored with fresh herbs
and seasonings mixed into the patty, and the fish is cut with a
very sharp knife, not a food processor. A food processor will leave
you with a very dense, heavy patty.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other techniques for preparing the tuna burger
that make the difference between one that tastes exceptional and
one that is just run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to use a small pan and just one tablespoon of oil; if
the pan is too big, there will not be enough oil and the burger
will burn.
</P>
<P>
   Saute the garlic over very low heat to remove the raw taste
without burning it, and chop the basil with a very sharp knife so
it does not blacken. Don't cut it on a wooden surface; use marble,
plastic or stone. Otherwise it will oxidize.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even today some people still want their tuna well
done, but when you overcook it, it tastes like cardboard. A brief
sear leaves it soft and creamy.
</P>
<P>
   I serve the burgers on a slice of brioche, because I find most
burger buns too soft. French bread isn't good, either; it's too
hard. The texture of brioche is just right, and its flavor is so
much richer. Toast it on one side only, so the untoasted side can
sop up the juices of the burger.
</P>
<P>
   TUNA BURGERS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh tuna fillet
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovies, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced basil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons good-quality mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 cups mesclun
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   8 slices brioche or 4 hamburger buns
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large ripe tomato, trimmed and cut into 4 slices.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a large, sharp knife, thinly slice tuna. Chop it until
it is the texture of hamburger and presses into a compact ball.
Place in a large mixing bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add garlic, 4 tablespoons olive oil, anchovies, basil, and
salt and pepper to taste. Mix well, shape into 4 circular patties
and set aside. (Patties may be placed on a baking sheet lined with
wax paper and covered and refrigerated for as long as 8 hours.
Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before sauteing.)
</P>
<P>
   3. If preparing rare burgers, preheat oven to 300 degrees.
(Other burgers will not need finishing in oven.) In a small bowl,
combine mayonnaise with soy sauce. In a mixing bowl, combine
mesclun with 2 remaining tablespoons olive oil and vinegar. Toast
brioche or buns on one side, and spread with seasoned mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place a small nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, and
add grapeseed oil. Add burgers, and saute 1 minute a side for rare,
1 1/2 minutes a side for medium-rare. Transfer rare burgers to oven
for 2-3 minutes to be sure centers are not cold. To serve, place a
slice of tomato on a slice of brioche, and top with a tuna burger
and a portion of mesclun. Place a second slice of brioche to one
side. Repeat to make a total of 4 burgers, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER ARE ENROLLED IN SUMMER SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., La., Fla., Mo., Texas, Mass., Ohio, Minn.,
Ga., Mich.)   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More students than ever before are enrolled in summer school
this season, as districts throughout the country, led by those in
major cities, require or strongly urge younger and younger students
to attend classes to shore up basic reading and mathematical
skills.
</P>
<P>
   About one in five of the nation's 53 largest urban districts
said their students will be facing homework and tests this month,
with some places, notably Chicago, Miami and St. Louis, keeping
more than 40 percent of pupils in class during what once was
vacation. Other areas have multiplied attendance markedly in recent
years as they add programs in both remediation and enrichment:
Cleveland's enrollment jumped to 18,000 students this year, from
just 1,000 in the summer of 1998; New Orleans has gone to 11,000
today from about 500 in 1995; Boston expects about 12,000, up from
2,800 five years ago. New York is expecting 260,000 students,
nearly a quarter of its enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Several districts begin classes Wednesday. Most last about five
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The push for summer school is a byproduct of the national
movement to raise academic performance, increase standardized
testing and end automatic promotion based on age rather than
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But as educators try to bridge the yawning achievement gaps
between poor minority students and white middle-class ones, some
are worried that the mushrooming summer programs _ many of which
are mandatory for failing students _ will simply repeat ineffective
instructional approaches and frustrate children with endless drills
for high-stakes exams. Others fear the safety net of summer school
will let teachers and administrators off the hook for problems
during the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids need additional time, they need additional time, but
they also need, during the September to June period, good teachers
and good curriculum,'' said Amy T. Wilkins of the Education Trust,
a Washington organization focused on equity among students of
different races and income levels. ``A little summer school thrown
on top is not going to make up for the deficiencies in either of
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a sort of dreaded lockup for teen-agers who failed
chemistry or skipped too many gym classes, summer school has become
a mix of test-preparation seminars and day-camp substitutes,
serving students as early as kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Research has documented a ``summer slide'' in which children _
particularly those from low-income backgrounds _ forget study
skills, discipline habits and vocabulary words between Memorial Day
and Labor Day. Educators are eager for the extra class hours, while
many parents who work full-time are often thrilled to have
somewhere to send their children.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of summer school also reflects increasing concerns
that America's school calendar _ which falls short of the more than
200 days required by Japan, Korea, Germany and Israel, never mind
China's 250 _ is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion of a 180-day school year is really obsolete,''
said Judith Johnson, deputy assistant secretary of the Department
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop thinking about summer school as an activity
separate from the regular school year,'' Johnson said. ``All
children do not learn in the same way, nor do all of them learn
along the same developmental timelines.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no current figures estimating the number of students
enrolled in summer school, but most agree it has risen
substantially from the 9 percent of America's schoolchildren who
attended in 1996. An informal telephone survey by The New York
Times found some 1.3 million students, or 19 percent, are scheduled
for classes this summer in the 53 largest districts, which have a
total enrollment of 6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though the phenomenon is growing in suburbs as well as cities,
it is most prevalent in low-income areas; in 1998, 27 percent of
all school districts, but 52 percent of those with large numbers of
poor pupils, offered summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of our kids, they're city kids, and sometimes their
opportunities are not so many,'' said Patrick Bryan, a summer
school principal at Dayton Bluffs Elementary School in St. Paul,
Minn. ``It would be a long, dry summer if they did not have summer
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Chicago in 1996 and New York last summer, more and more
states and school districts require students to attend summer
classes or risk being left back. Fourteen states recently enacted
legislation expanding summer school requirements, and 24 of the 53
districts in the Times survey have mandatory attendance for some
students.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, third-graders who do not meet standards must stay
through the summer in order to move on. Washington, D.C., requires
students in all grades with low standardized test scores to
participate in its 3-year-old ``Summer Stars'' program _ and to
pass the test at season's end to be promoted. Administrators in
Boston, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles and New Orleans all ordered
struggling students in specific, benchmark grades to report for
summer classes, though they cannot make them show up. (Detroit
expected 36,000 in its ``mandatory'' program and ended up with
25,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be motivated to be here,'' said Linda Miller, who
teaches an intensive reading and math class at Douglas High School
in Parkland, Fla., part of the Broward County school district,
which requires summer school for those who fail the state
Comprehensive Assessment Tests. ``Those who stay, stay because they
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Janicia Jackson, 15, a student at the school, said she benefits
from studying the same subject for four straight hours each day.
``I understand things a lot better the second time around,'' she
said. ``All this information is floating around the back of my
head, but being in summer school brings it out.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Anchorage, 7-year-old Adrian Ramos, who speaks Spanish at
home and is enrolled in a Japanese immersion program, is spending
summer school working on his English.
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard me on the phone trying to enroll him, and he said he
didn't want to go,'' said Adrian's mother, Yadira Ramos. ``But
yesterday, as soon as he got out, he told me he really likes being
in summer school.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the nation's 100 largest school districts by
Geoffrey D. Borman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, found
that 59 percent offer summer school as an alternative to social
promotion, and 55 percent are using the extra weeks to help
students meet more challenging state and local standards. Only 16
percent said the aim was enrichment, and just 1 percent of programs
were designed to addressed summer learning losses.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they design summer classes focused on math and
language literacy, with an eye toward the tests students failed
before arriving, many districts are searching for innovative
curriculums to keep students engaged and motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis offers a menu of 73 courses, including ``Real and
Alternate Histories of World War II.'' In Fort Worth, Texas,
multi-age classrooms of elementary students tackle topics including
``Bubbleology'' and ``Tool Time for Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   At Houston's Macario Garcia Elementary School, children learn
about the digestive system and body temperature by working at a
mock hospital. ``Science can be dry and boring,'' said Adriana
Castro, the principal. ``All these lessons are designed to be
hands-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago in Newark, N.J., summer school was basically a
rehash of the previous year's lessons. ``If they didn't get it the
first time, we were trying to teach them the same way the second
time around, and it didn't work,'' said Jerry Bruno, a district
administrator. Now, reading, math and science are filtered through
thematic units: first- and second-graders will study sunlight and
shadows, while third- through fifth-graders examine rain forests
and weather, and middle school students do robotics. ``It's all new
material that the kids are exposed to during the summer,'' Bruno
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As districts have expanded their summer programs, they have
tripped over a host of problems, from students sweltering in
schools without air conditioning to a lack of money for
transportation or a dearth of teachers. Last year, thousands of New
Yorkers were wrongly forced to enroll because of test scores that
turned out to have been improperly reported.
</P>
<P>
   Effectiveness is also unclear: In Chicago last year, nearly half
of those forced to attend summer school still failed to meet the
district's promotion requirements afterward. Seattle abandoned its
``academic boot camp'' for 500 fifth-graders after the summer of
1998 because only a few improved enough to go on to sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Cooper, author of ``Making the Most of Summer
School''(Blackwell Publishing, May 2000), said small classes, good
teachers, parental involvement and rigorous evaluation were crucial
to success. Middle-class students tend to benefit more from summer
school than low-income children, according to Cooper's study, but
overall, 85 percent of the students who attended outperformed their
peers who did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are learning all year long,'' said Cooper, chairman of
the psychology department at the University of Missouri at
Columbia. ``They're learning every day. The question is, really,
what is it that they're learning?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Karl L. Alexander, a Johns Hopkins sociologist who has been
following a group of Baltimore schoolchildren since 1982, said
tests taken each spring and fall showed that low-income children
kept pace with their better-off peers during the year, but
stagnated during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In upper-income families, they more often go to the library
during the summer, they more often go on summer vacations, they
more often attend summer camps _ and there's more reading material
in the household, more of them have computers,'' Alexander said.
``The summer period is a chunk of time, and it's like a black box.
What you drop into it is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Johnson, of the Department of Education, recently
ran a summer program in White Plains, N.Y., that wrapped a basic
skills curriculum around field trips and guest speakers, and even
included free tennis lessons. ``If I could have taken them to the
opera, I would have taken them to the opera,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over ``summer slide'' and other worries about the
calendar have also nourished separate movements to extend the
school year beyond the United States' 180 days. Dozens of schools
and districts around the country are adding days to the calendar,
while others run classes year round, typically with three- or
four-week vacations sprinkled every few months.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ballinger, director of the National Association for
Year-Round Education, said nearly 3,000 schools in 43 states _
serving more than 2 million students _ use a year-round schedule
now, compared to just 411 schools serving 354,087 students in
1985-86.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reducing the vacation, obviously you reduce the chance of
forgetting to occur,'' he said. ``If students learn anything on a
given day, one has to make the assumption that more days would
allow more learning.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French director Francois Ozon has made thrillers
about homicidal house guests and high school killers. In satire,
he's explored the lighter sides of cannibalism, sadomasochism and
incest. But his latest film tackles the horrors of la vie a deux.
``Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' is his screen adaptation of a play
written by the German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder at the age of
19 _ an utterly disillusioned teen-age vision of a couple's
intimate life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water Drops'' will begin its New York run on July 12.
(``Criminal Lovers,'' Ozon's previous film, opens July 21.) This
chamber piece for four players is set in Germany during the 1970s.
One evening, Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), an insurance salesman and
aging Lothario, brings the 19-year-old Franz (Malik Zidi) back to
his apartment and seduces him. Six months later their relationship
has calcified: Leopold ceaselessly bickers and complains, while
sensitive, intellectual Franz is meekly loving. When Franz's
ex-fiancee (Ludivine Sagnier) and Leopold's former girlfriend (Anna
Thomson) show up at their apartment, the older man's frightful
egotism and sexual charisma spark a lot of black humor and a few
grim consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 19, Fassbinder had already formed his view of the world and
human relationships _ already, he didn't believe in love,'' Ozon
said over coffee one recent morning in SoHo. ``He never staged or
filmed that play, but the seeds of all his later works are in it.
Perhaps it was just too personal. When I presented `Water Drops' at
the Berlin International Film Festival in February, members of
Fassbinder's circle were in the audience; they told me that in his
youth he resembled Franz, but when he got older, he became
Leopold.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassbinder died in 1982 at the age of 36, leaving behind more
than 40 films that dissect and demystify every aspect of postwar
German society, from transsexual love and the aspirations of
anarchists to the workings of major corporations. At 32, Ozon's
career has made a quick start. Three years ago, his short film,
``See the Sea'' _ a taut psychological drama about a new mother
whose vacation house on a beautiful island is suddenly invaded by a
sullen hitchhiker _ earned its writer and director comparisons to
Chabrol and Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sitcom,'' a comedy and Ozon's first feature, a typical
bourgeois French household dissolves into a den of perversion when
a pet white rat unleashes the family members' pent-up libidos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminal Lovers'' was loosely inspired by a murder that took
place in the French provinces. ``A few years ago, an adolescent boy
and girl killed a fellow student,'' Ozon said. ``They were great
admirers of Oliver Stone's film `Natural Born Killers.' And they
wanted to commit a senseless crime. I didn't want to present a
realist version of these events, to offer psychological or social
explanations, but rather to tie them to something deeper and more
symbolic, like a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   That film's style gradually shifts from ``Bonnie and Clyde'' to
``Hansel and Gretel,'' as Alice (Natacha Regnier) and Luc (Jeremie
Renier) kill Said (Salim Kechiouche), an Arab classmate, then take
refuge in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Alice, who incites her boyfriend to murder, takes her cues not
from Hollywood but from the poetry of that troubled French
teen-ager Arthur Rimbaud. ``In real life, the girl wrote very
beautiful poems,'' Ozon said. ``Excerpts from her diary were
published in the press. She wrote of her desire for this Arab boy,
and how she had to kill him because she wanted him so much. It
reminded me of Jean Genet. At the same time, it was frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozon remains fascinated by adolescence. ``It's virgin
territory,'' he said. ``A blank page. Anything can happen.'' He
grew up in Paris (where he still lives), the oldest child in a
family of bourgeois intellectuals, and describes his own youth as
``turbulent.'' ``I was in revolt against my parents,'' he said,
``at once very aggressive and introverted. My Catholic education
had given me a taste for sin.''
</P>
<P>
   His earliest films starred his siblings and were shot with his
father's Super-8 movie camera. By the time he graduated from Femis,
the prestigious, state-run French film school, he had made more
than 40 shorts on film and video.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon's boyish charm seems purely Parisian, but his outre and
somber preoccupations have made him something of an anomaly among
French directors of his generation. ``Intimate dramas inspired by
the Nouvelle Vague and set in Parisian apartments are not his
thing,'' said Olivier Delbosc, whose company, Fidelite Productions,
has produced or co-produced all of Ozon's features. ``And he loves
to work very fast,'' Delbosc added. ``He's like a bulldozer; we
just follow along with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A bulldozer with a light touch, however. ``Francois is very
playful, very joyful to work with,'' said Malik Zidi, who plays
Franz in ``Water Drops.'' ``He's both intellectual and childlike.
Fassbinder's text is very heavy. But on the set, Francois made it
seem fresh and almost buoyant.''
</P>
<P>
   Too young to have seen Fassbinder's films when they first
opened, Ozon discovered the German director's work retrospectively.
``Fassbinder spoke of Germany in a way that no other filmmaker has
spoken of his country, of its wounds and hurt,'' he said. ``And I'm
attracted to his way of working so quickly, his cinematic bulimia,
using a small band of the faithful, and with or without money. Of
course, there was a dark side to his method. Sometimes when he was
broke, he'd ask his actresses to work as prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   With its deadpan humor, single setting and claustrophobic focus
on a few characters, ``Water Drops'' recalls the style of such
Fassbinder classics as ``The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant.'' At
the same time, Ozon's version is distinctively French, far more
tightly controlled and lighter than the original, closer to farce
than tragedy. He also moved the play's setting up to the 1970s.
``Fassbinder wrote it in the early '60s, but he was so far ahead of
his time,'' Ozon said. ``The men's homosexuality is not an issue.
They're a couple like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   That period is also linked to Ozon's childhood memories of
Germany. ``We went there almost every year to visit friends of my
father's,'' he said. ``The daily life fascinated me, the beer and
sandwiches, the cleanliness and the colors, which were so sad. The
country was still in the midst of postwar reconstruction. People
worked a lot. They were still caught in the guilt of what had
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ozon, the ravages of German history lie behind Fassbinder's
ruthless portraits of sexual opportunism and failed intimacy.
``Fassbinder often repeated that there was no such thing as a
marginal existence,'' he said. ``In `Fox and His Friends,' for
example, he showed a homosexual milieu in 1970's Germany as a
culture entirely apart, yet reproducing the same traps as classic
heterosexual society. It's fascinating, and also deeply disturbing.
Because when you're on the margins, you can imagine for yourself a
certain liberty. But he showed that it wasn't so.''

TEA? TURMERIC? THE QUEST FOR SAFER BARBECUE
</HEADLINE>
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The height of the barbecue season is not when anyone wants to
hear about the hazards of eating meat with a nicely blackened crust
hot off the grill. But scientists have long known that substances
created when meat and poultry are cooked at high heat can cause
cancer in animals and that there is some evidence that they may
have the same effect on humans.
</P>
<P>
   While health professionals still recommend cutting back on
overall meat consumption, recent research suggests that there are
more appealing ways to make grilled meat less hazardous. Some are
common-sensical, like eating it rare (though this is not
recommended for chicken or hamburger) or medium instead of well
done, or cooking it at lower temperatures for shorter periods. But
others are more startling, like sprinkling meat with tea powder, or
mixing ground meat with cherries, or just marinating meat before
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, scientists are now so aware of the potential risks that
they are looking into every corner of the kitchen for solutions.
But their research is in its earliest stages, so they are not
really sure how or why some of these techniques work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for scientists to say we don't know,'' said Dr. Mark
G. Knize, a member of the Biology and Biotechnology Research
Program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,
Calif., who is conducting some of the research on the effects of
marinades.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, though, he and other scientists have found
that one of the most promising techniques for meat and poultry is
marination. Done even briefly, it reduces the cancer-causing
compounds called heterocyclic amines, or HCA's, formed when
creatine in muscle meats reacts with amino acids at high
temperatures. (Fish is much less a problem than meat or poultry.)
But marination does nothing to reduce the level of other
carcinogens that arise when fat falls on a fire and causes smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have not yet deconstructed all their marinade
ingredients to pinpoint the anti-cancer agents. They suspect that
the antioxidants in certain foods like garlic, onions, chives,
turmeric, thyme, rosemary and oregano, as well as vitamins C and E,
are responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In studies last year at the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii in
Honolulu, three different sauces were used to marinate steaks
overnight. One was a teriyaki sauce, another contained turmeric and
garlic powder and the third was a commercial sauce made of honey,
high-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, concentrated tomato juice,
modified food starch, salt and seasonings. Four-ounce pieces of
marinated and unmarinated steak were cooked on a propane gas grill
for varying times at varying temperatures. The marinades were not
reapplied during cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter the cooking time and the lower the heat, the lower
the levels of the suspect amines in meats marinated in the teriyaki
and turmeric sauces, compared with unmarinated meat. Steaks
marinated in the commercial sauce and cooked similarly had much
higher levels of the amines than the other marinated meats; the
researchers said this may have been partly because the corn syrup
and honey caused the steaks to burn and char faster and more
extensively.
</P>
<P>
   I conducted taste tests on the teriyaki and turmeric sauces. The
turmeric marinade adds flavor to tender but otherwise tasteless
steak, while the teriyaki makes meat slightly sweet, although the
brown sugar it contains causes the meat to burn faster.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 study at Lawrence Livermore, researchers marinated
chicken breasts in a mixture including garlic, salt, citrus juice
and olive oil that also contained considerable sugar, and they
concluded that the sugar was probably responsible for an increase
in one of the amines. Using sweet commercial barbecue sauces may be
just the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are looking into other antidotes. Dr. John
Weisburger, director emeritus of the nonprofit American Health
Foundation in New York, has done studies indicating that sprinkling
tea powder, either green or black, on meat before grilling could
help reduce the formation of the amines. He surmises that it might
even help to drink very strong tea while eating grilled meat. Tea,
of course, is a powerful antioxidant. (Powdered tea is available in
specialty and Asian markets.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the cherry solution, devised in 1999 in
Michigan, a big cherry producer. It substitutes ground fresh
cherries for 11.5 percent of the ground beef for hamburgers. J. Ian
Gray, a food scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing
who worked on the study, said that there was nothing magical about
cherries and that many tree fruits, like plums, would also reduce
the amines because they contain similar antioxidants. (I found that
adding cherries made hamburger extremely soft, almost mushy.)
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that mixing 40 milligrams of vitamin E from a
gelatin capsule into a pound of ground beef might also do the
trick.
</P>
<P>
   All these findings are still quite preliminary, of course, as is
the data linking heterocyclic amines with cancer in humans. Dr.
Elizabeth G. Snyderwine, a specialist in chemical carcinogenesis at
the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that research
on animals certainly supported the notion that the amines ``are
potential human carcinogens and further studies are needed to
determine the human risk,'' especially for breast, colon and
prostate cancers. But she added that different individuals might
react differently to the amines.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies have established a connection between
human cancer and meat that has been well cooked, as it is usually
done on a grill. Dr. Rashimi Sinha, a researcher at the National
Cancer Institute, said, ``We found a twofold risk of breast cancer
in women who consumed very-well-done red meat as compared to rare
or medium.''
</P>
<P>
   In another study, at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and
Public Health in Baltimore, researchers found that women who
regularly ate flame-broiled (charred) meat also had an increased
risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinha cautioned that ``these are just two studies, and in
epidemiological studies you need more than two small studies to
make a definitive statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In three to five years,'' she added, ``there will be a lot of
studies showing whether the association is real or not. At this
point there is no consensus.'' She said that eating an occasional
well-cooked steak is not harmful but that, even though the research
is still preliminary, ``eating well-cooked meat four times a week
from the grill is a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinha, Snyderwine and Knize offered other suggestions to reduce
exposure to carcinogens from high-heat cooking like grilling. One
is to cook chicken with its skin on and then discard the charred
skin. With all meat, avoid eating the charred surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Precook meat or chicken in an oven or a microwave oven until it
is half done to get rid of some juices that contain the precursors
of the carcinogens and to minimize the grilling time.
</P>
<P>
   Remove fat from steaks before cooking. (As the fat drips onto a
fire or coals it causes flare-ups and smoke, which contain other
carcinogens.) Keep flames from lapping meat and charring it. And if
possible use the indirect method of grilling, with the heat source
off to the side instead of directly beneath the food.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the more-is-better approach: serve a salad of
green leafy vegetables with grilled meat. Certain components of
many fruits and vegetables may mitigate the effect of the
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Green salad, marinated steak cooked medium-rare _ that's a
summer dinner that may not be a bad prescription.

IN UGANDA, AN UNCONVENTIONAL SEARCH FOR A BRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOBULENZI, Uganda _ Ahamadah Ntale has a vision for a new
compact between men and women in Uganda, starting with him. A few
weeks ago, he walked into the local office of one of Uganda's
national newspapers and left the reporter with a story that ran
with this headline: ``Man hunts old woman to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 25, a scooter taxi driver. He said he wanted a woman
between 35 and 45, loving and free of AIDS. Most important, she
would have to defy Uganda's tradition of men paying a dowry for
their brides. The bride-to-be must cough it up to HIS parents.
</P>
<P>
   The first call came at 7 a.m. the day the article was published,
from a 38-year-old businesswoman in the capital, Kampala. By
nightfall, there were 193 phone calls, he said, and in the next
week more than 400. One woman promised 10 cows if he chose her and
gave up the search.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why are women so interested in this anonymous
taxi driver from a small town? One answer is: because they can be.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, women in Uganda have made major strides
politically and economically, more so than in many African nations.
Literacy rates have shot up, and Kampala swims with middle-class
working women, chatting on mobile phones and making money. The vice
president of Uganda is a woman, as are several leading opposition
members. The president's wife, Janet Museveni, is said to wield
genuine power behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Uganda, people are saying we are now equal,'' said Zebia
Namugera, a 31-year-old youth counselor here. She also owns a
successful shop, selling cosmetics and handbags, something she said
would have been difficult even a decade ago. ``Men are now tired of
doing everything,'' she said. ``We have joined them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntale was standing in front of her, after a stroll through town
where he was cheered on by men and women alike as something of a
local hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' said Namugera, who is married, ``in fact he
is handsome. That is also why women are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nice yellow shirt and belt with a dubious Gucci label, he
looked perfectly acceptable. But his offer seems the intriguing
thing. Based on a few hours talking with him here, that offer
combines two passions in his life: women, particularly older ones,
and money. (For an interview he demanded, unsuccessfully, the
equivalent of $130 or a new mobile phone.) He said, however, he is
on a crusade for all men in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not after having a lot of money,'' he said. ``I am trying
to do this for the first time in Uganda. I need a wife to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if women could support me, as men have always
supported women after we have married them,'' he added. ``I want to
experience the way they treat us after marrying us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntale is the second child of his father's third wife. His
father, a Muslim, has 5 wives and 23 children. Every so often when
Ntale was growing up, one of his sisters would disappear with a
strange man.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to my mother one time: `Why do they take my
sisters?''' he said in Luganda, the language of the largest tribe
in Uganda. ``She said to me, `They take them to get married and
when they marry the men have to pay something.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one time, `Why don't they take us, the men?''' he
said. ``She replied to me, `The men pay for the women, not the
women for the men.'''
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction stuck with him. Five years ago, he joined a
local drama club and composed a song about the virtues of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was singing it in concert I saw that the women were
very much interested in this song,'' he said. ``The ladies were so
happy and would come and give me money. When you praise a woman she
begins to change and be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And particularly he sings the praises of older women.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my childhood, I used to think that older women were the
best,'' he said. ``They know what love is. They comfort you and
come for you, unlike younger women who will jump and go to other
men.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is now the oldest of his friends not to be married
(though he has fathered four children). He recently decided it was
time, and on June 8 went to see Rogers Mulindwa, the local bureau
chief for The Monitor, to get his courtship going.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I thought that he was joking,'' said
Mulindwa, who clearly knows a good story. ``But he stayed here for
over two hours. He proved to me that he was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The story ran eight days later, with the mobile-phone number of
one of Ntale's neighbors. The first call came when Ntale was still
asleep, and the calls, logged by name in a book, have not stopped.
The youngest caller was 27 years old, the oldest 60. (They actually
had lunch together but he disqualified her because she is possibly
a relative.) Several women have driven here, about 30 miles north
of Kampala, one in a Land Rover and another in a nice Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the cows, he will not discuss what he has been
offered. He has no idea how this will all end. His pick will have
to pay the dowry, though he said she would not necessarily be the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not after some rich woman,'' he said. ``I've seen a lot
of rich women but they were not my choice. She needs to love me
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In his small town, he said, he had not been mocked _ as when he
sang his marriage song five years ago _ but congratulated by men
and women alike. Dozens of men have begged him to send any extra
women willing to pay dowries their way, among them Christopher
Senkumba, 35, also an unmarried scooter taximan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked several times but so far he has not sent any,''
Senkumba said. ``Even if it was you, you would be so angry about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A local Muslim elder, Ahamadah Matovu, said he thought Ntale's
initiative was excellent, though he must love her and the marriage
must be strictly religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman must be willing to have only one man,'' he said.
Asked if Ntale would have to confine himself to only one woman,
Matovu gave a practical answer, though not in line with the current
thinking about sex equality: ``He is limited by his finances. I
don't think he has much money.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Lukiya Narwoga, 50, seemed amused by the idea, though
she said it demeaned the woman. ``It is like a prostitute going to
a man, selling herself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Ntale himself, she looked him over, up and down, in front of
her shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't take him,'' she said. ``He's not my size _ too young.
But this boy is handsome.''

 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fall of 1994, the Canadian director Jeremy
Podeswa and his producer Camelia Frieberg were heading down the
West Coast to promote Podeswa's first film, ``Eclipse.'' They
stopped to see a woman whom Frieberg had met when she was a
teen-ager on vacation; they had agreed, as a lark, to meet again in
20 years' time.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, they met the landscaper Larry Burkam, who was
working on the woman's property, and they all ended up having
dinner. ``And you could just see the lightning bolts over the
table,'' Podeswa recalled recently. ``When we got back to the hotel
that night, I looked at Camelia and said, `You know, I have the
funniest feeling that you're going to marry that guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frieberg did marry Burkam, and this random encounter _ like
something out of an Eric Rohmer film _ became one of the
inspirations for Podeswa's second feature, ``The Five Senses,''
which opens on Friday and which traces the tangled relations among
a group of people in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I witnessed with Camelia got me going on the idea of
destiny and what brings people together,'' Podeswa said when he was
in New York recently. ``We tend to lead our lives in a very
intellectual way _ but, in fact, our lives are irrational and there
are things we can't explain. I wanted to make a film about people
who are coming to understand those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Podeswa, who is warm and bitingly articulate,
has seen his own share of life's eccentricities. He struggled for
years in Canada to find financing for his feature films while he
worked as a journalist, a film publicist and an assistant film
editor. Though Podeswa is relatively unknown in this country, his
profile in Canada and abroad has changed dramatically with ``The
Five Senses'': the film was a hit at both the Cannes and Toronto
International Film Festivals, was sold in more than 40 countries
and earned Podeswa the Genie Award (Canada's version of the Academy
Award) for best director last January.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ackerman's 1990 book, ``A Natural History of the Senses,''
was the direct impetus for the film. ``I loved Ackerman's
enthusiasm for how the senses enhance our lives,'' Podeswa said.
``We tend to take our senses for granted, just as we can take other
people for granted. So I began to write about these characters who
are surrounded by a wealth of possibilities, and yet they all feel
that there is something missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Podeswa's five main characters in ``The Five Senses'' is
linked thematically to a particular sense. For hearing, there's an
eye doctor (Philippe Volter) who is going deaf; for taste, there's
a cake-maker (Mary-Louise Parker) whose gorgeous but bland cakes
only hint at her deeper emotional blockage. Smell is represented by
a bisexual housecleaner (Daniel MacIvor) who is convinced that love
has its own distinct scent. Touch is symbolized by a massage
therapist (Gabrielle Rose), who can soothe strangers but who is
unable to reach her teen-age daughter (Nadia Litz), a budding
voyeur who, in turn, represents sight.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of a little girl draws together these
interlocking stories. Her mother's (Molly Parker) desperate search
for the child galvanizes the other characters and throws into
relief their prickly, fervent attempts to connect with other
people.
</P>
<P>
   But the film also has a light touch in scenes such as the one
where MacIvor's and Mary-Louis Parker's characters avidly gossip in
a car. Their mutual list of romantic no-no's includes ``never fall
in love with someone who's too good looking'' and ``never fall in
love with someone who lives more than a bus ride away.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa has always been interested in the quest for intimacy,
whether it be through romance, friendship or family. Though his
films are not directly autobiographical, he calls each one ``a
snapshot of my psyche at a particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the generation of Canadian filmmakers that includes
Atom Egoyan, Patricia Rozema and Don McKellar, among others.
``Jeremy was an inspiration to me in the 1980s because of a
supremely assured short film he did called `David Roche Talks to
You about Love,''' said Egoyan, on the telephone from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``But Jeremy had a long apprenticeship. He went to
the American Film Institute, which I think gave him a different
outlook. As Canadians, we're very aware of making our films in
contrast to a dominant American cinema.'' He laughed. ``Jeremy was
one of the few who spent time in the belly of the beast, so to
speak, and then came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa spent a year in Los Angeles after graduating in 1984
from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto. ``It really
demystified the studio system for me,'' he said. ``But I also
discovered that there were films I wanted to make that I didn't
think could be made in that system. Canadian filmmakers tend to use
film as a form of personal expression, to say something that is
personal and idiosyncratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Podeswa's strongest signature as a director is his
insistence on pluralism, whether it be the range of languages
spoken by his characters or the variety of sexual relationships he
depicts. ``Eclipse,'' Podeswa's first feature (1995), was inspired
by Arthur Schnitzler's play ``La Ronde'' and featured a gallery of
lonely, questing characters who go from partner to partner. ``The
Five Senses'' also portrays both gay and heterosexual relationships
without judgment or stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for me to deal with sexuality in a
non-hierarchical way,'' Podeswa said. ``I always resented, when I
was younger, seeing films where the only gay character would be the
best friend, or the kooky neighbor. I wanted to move those stories
into the center and give them equal weight with the other
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa's producer, Frieberg, describes him as ``interested in
the diversity of experience, be it sexual or ethnic.'' But his goal
is not polemics, but, rather, universality _ to show how love and
longing cut a swath through everyone's life.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have shaped Podeswa's outlook _ ``being gay,
being Jewish and a first-generation Canadian,'' he said. ``My
parents are both immigrants and my father is a Holocaust survivor.
This background makes you very aware of what it feels like to be an
outsider. But I think it's also made me sensitive to other people's
issues as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa's father, who is from Poland, survived concentration
camps and emigrated to Toronto after the war, where he met
Podeswa's mother, who had come there from England. Both Podeswa's
father and his brother are painters, and he himself grew up, he
says, addicted to movies.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the American Film Institute, he moved back to
Toronto determined to start making films. But a musical feature
that he was planning fell through, and it took him considerable
time to finance ``Eclipse,'' and then, in turn, ``The Five
Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why it took so long, Podeswa said, `` `Eclipse' was a
multi-character tale with an unconventional story. `The Five
Senses' was even more ambitious. But feature film funding has also
really dried up in Canada. The government film funding agencies
have quite limited resources now, so they can't really support that
many movies a year.''
</P>
<P>
   What got Podeswa through was what he calls his ``monomaniacal''
nature: ``I'm like a dog with a bone,'' he said. ``I wouldn't let
go.''

   He now has a first-look deal with Alliance Atlantis, an
independent distribution and production company and one of the
principal backers of ``The Five Senses,'' and he is set to adapt
and direct Anne Michaels' acclaimed novel, ``Fugitive Pieces,''
about the legacy of the Holocaust, for the Toronto-based
Serendipity Point Films. He is also adapting Catherine Bush's first
novel, ``Minus Time,'' about the relationship between a young girl

   Emotional truth is Podeswa's priority. For him, ``The Five
Senses'' is his most affirmative film. ``I had done a film about
people who were unfulfilled and afraid,'' he said, ``and I wanted
to show people who were at the next stage, trying to engage with
life.'' At the same time, he deplores what he calls ``the tyranny
of happy endings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood-style endings can sometimes make an audience feel
really bitter,'' he said with a laugh, ``because they start to
think, `Why can't my life be more like that?' I'd like, instead,
for people to see themselves in my work. It's about the reality _
rather than the fantasy _ of how we live now.''

BRINGING ARGENTINA OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By LYLE REXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The room is dark, like the chamber of a camera
obscura. Hanging from a cord is a single flashlight. A visitor
approaches it, turns it on and shines it on the nearest wall. A
vague image appears, as grainy as a newspaper image, as if summoned
by the light itself. As the flashlight is moved toward the wall,
the image comes into focus, stark and confrontational: a man is
pointing a gun directly at the visitor. Wherever the light moves,
the gun moves with it. There is no escape except to click off the
light and plunge back into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine artist Graciela Sacco specializes in provocations
of light and shadow. She uses the most primitive forms of
photography to turn the tables on the spectator. In her art, images
sprout everywhere _ on suitcases, pieces of wood, Venetian blinds,
refrigerators, spoons, postage stamps and even from light itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sacco's current installation, ``Outside,'' at the Argentine
Consulate, surrounds visitors with unexpected metaphors and forces
them to question what they see and what they take for granted. For
Sacco, who began making art at the end of the most dangerous and
difficult period of recent Argentine history, photography is not
simply a means of personal expression but a tool for changing the
world by surprising the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The current installation, which occupies two large rooms of the
consulate on West 56th Street in Manhattan, testifies not only to
Sacco's growing reputation but to a transformed political climate
that has made her art a calling card for a nation that might once
have prohibited it, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   As a photographic artist, Sacco is not as well known in this
country as Latin American contemporaries like Flor Garduno and
Graciela Iturbide of Mexico or Sebastiao Salgado of Brazil. For
that matter, the painter Guillermo Kuitca is probably Argentina's
best-known contemporary artistic export. But outside the United
States, Sacco's work has been exhibited extensively in locations
from Brazil to Denmark, and she has recently represented Argentina
at both the Sao Paulo and Havana Bienals. Sacco came to maturity at
the end of a period in which the repression, murder and exile of
artists created ``a zone of artistic silence in Argentina,'' as she
put it in a recent interview at the consulate. Her task, as she
sees it, is to make sure this artistic oblivion is not permanent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a struggle she wages by rescuing familiar objects from
another kind of oblivion, the oblivion of being taken for granted.
Sacco makes the ordinary extraordinary. She employs what she calls
heliography, referring to William Fox Talbot's earliest description
of photography as ``sun writing.'' Sacco sensitizes the surfaces of
objects with light-reactive chemicals so they will register a
photographic image.
</P>
<P>
   The images _ usually photographed from newspapers _ that Sacco
projects onto those surfaces transform the objects into complex
metaphors, revealing the moral dimensions of everyday things,
places and experiences. The result can be as lyrical as a bird's
wing or as provocative as a clenched fist. In the 1993 exhibition
``Venus Empaquetadas'' (``Venus Packed''), for example, Sacco
covered suitcases with images of breasts, eyes and lips to
dramatize the fragmentation and commercialization of body images in
the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   In the consulate installation, visitors are confronted by, among
other things, a forest of small spoons hanging from a line. On each
spoon an open mouth has been heliographed. Sacco has used many
variants of the mouth image, and depending on where they appear,
they suggest a host of interpretations, from a protest against
hunger to a warning about political and artistic repression. She
has even placed them on postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sacco has a degree in visual arts, she had to master
heliographic techniques on her own, based on extensive research.
This is a comment more on the antiquated nature of the process,
however, than on Argentina's artistic provincialism, for her art is
nourished by contact with the work of conceptual artists ranging
from Marcel Duchamp to Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   For years that contact was secondhand. One of the most damaging
consequences of repression was the near silencing of Argentina's
truly cosmopolitan artistic conversation, a conversation that goes
back decades. Buenos Aires, the city of Jorge Luis Borges, had
always looked to Europe for cultural models, and since the 1920s
its artists had participated in every international avant-garde
movement. The critic Jorge Brest has written that at one time all
Argentine artists ``had to do compulsory military service in
Cubism.''
</P>
<P>
   For the city of Rosario, where Sacco was born and still lives,
the silence was especially heavy. Rosario has long cherished a
position closer to the cutting edge than the capital, and it
produced Argentina's two best-known modern artists, Lucio Fontana
and Antonio Berni. In the 1940s, Rosario even had its own club of
photographers who sought to revive obsolete techniques. In this, as
in so many other aspects of artistic life, says Sacco, ``we are
trying to recover what was effectively destroyed by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   That recovery includes coming to terms with the legacy of the
radical group of artists known as Tucuman Arde (Tucuman Burns).
Formed in Rosario and Buenos Aires in 1968 to protest conditions in
the poorest rural province, Tucuman, the group orchestrated a
highly visible campaign that included films, posters, newspapers
and public actions. Two military dictatorships suppressed knowledge
and discussion of Tucuman Arde, and the comparatively short-lived
movement subsequently assumed a mythic status. Sacco and other
contemporary artists set out to uncover the facts behind the myth.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a source not only of political but artistic
inspiration. ``Here was a body of work based on absolutely original
use of the mass media,'' Sacco says. ``It showed us how to join art
to daily life.'' It also showed that the past cannot be repeated.
Argentina has moved on. ``My art engages the dilemmas of my time,''
she says. ``I want to intervene on the level of sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sacco's ``political'' art transcends partisan labels and
seeks instead to align itself with broad issues of shared humanity.
One of her most provocative ``interventions'' came in response to a
1994 report on the poor conditions and performance of Argentina's
schools. She heliographed large sheets of paper with an image of a
bird's wing and bracketed school doorways and windows with them.
The wings became a symbol suggesting both lost possibility and the
hope of change. At the Havana Bienal in 1997, Sacco again courted
controversy when she sought to move her exhibition beyond its
approved space by covering walls along city streets with images of
a crowd of protesters and a man throwing a rock. In a nation that
still held to a revolutionary ideology, the political message was
provocative precisely for its ambiguity. ``To be political does not
mean you have to be didactic,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In a democratic Argentina, being an artist and politically
engaged means shouldering a burden greater than mere opposition. As
part of the consulate exhibition, Sacco has hung a series of clear
plastic rectangles imprinted with the images of eyes. They cast
haunting, interrogative shadows on the wall, as if the art were
looking at the visitor, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   According to Javier Goliszewski, the Argentine cultural attache:
``In our country, so much was denied for so long that people got
used to shrugging their shoulders and averting their eyes. Now
artists such as Graciela Sacco are more important than ever, to
bring us out of that, to help recover awareness, to enable us to
look.''

INCREASED HEATING FUEL COSTS ON THE HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for
another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and
natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to
heat American homes.
</P>
<P>
   With demand for fuel and electricity soaring, natural gas prices
have nearly doubled in the last year, to their highest levels in
more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen 10 percent just
in the last month. This winter, many homeowners could discover that
it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their homes than it did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a new pledge on Monday by Saudi Arabia, the world's
leading oil exporter, to increase production to help reduce global
petroleum prices, the effects of such a move on U.S. energy costs
remain unclear at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need to fear is the double whammy,'' said Steven
Parla, a natural gas analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``That's when prices rise 30 percent and it's cold, so you use 40
percent more gas.''
</P>
<P>
   While the prices of all fuels have risen recently, natural gas
is affected by a variety of factors, including its use in electric
power generation and in heavy industry, in addition to home
heating. Used in power plants in the summer to churn out
electricity to keep air conditioners whirring, natural gas warms
slightly more than 50 percent of United States homes in winter,
mainly in the Midwest, Sunbelt and Rocky Mountain states, according
to 1997 Census figures.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of new houses in the United States are
outfitted to use gas, according to Keyspan, the supplier of natural
gas to much of New York City and Long Island. Only about 10 percent
of homes burn heating oil, a large proportion of them concentrated
in the Northeast, where oil prices rocketed last winter during a
stretch of bitter weather.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to winter, rising heating fuel prices are likely to
generate political controversy, much as gasoline prices have done
recently. Consumer anger over gasoline prices especially in the
Midwest, has made the cost of energy an issue in the presidential
campaign and led to congressional hearings and federal inquiries.
Already, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa has asked the Federal Trade
Commission to monitor the increases in heating oil and natural gas.
The FTC declined to comment on the request.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases have been caused by an imbalance between
supply and demand that probably will not right itself soon.
</P>
<P>
   Energy usage is an important indicator of an economy's health.
U.S. industry uses prodigious amounts of oil, gas and electricity
each year, while consumers are buying larger houses and cars and
other products that demand more fuel. At the same time, critics of
the government charge that a series of Republican and Democratic
administrations has failed to construct a sound energy policy to
take into account shifts in demand and the complexities of the
supply of oil and gas. Now, the Clinton administration and Congress
are scrambling to find ways to undo or slow the increase in fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to energy, we only seem to wake up when there's
a crisis,'' said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens
Advisory Panel, an energy watchdog group in Long Island.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   High fuel prices have yet to slow the economy, and adjusted for
inflation, domestic prices are still much lower than can be found
in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale heating oil prices are now at about 84 cents a gallon,
compared with 49 cents a year ago. Wholesale natural gas prices are
now at about $4.44 per million British thermal units (Btus),
compared with $2.39 one year ago. Some analysts say that natural
gas prices will decline, while others contend that they have yet to
peak.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to cut back production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last year spurred the ascent of crude
oil prices, which helped push up heating oil prices. At the same
time, demand blossomed. Refineries usually begin in summer to store
distillate, which includes heating oil and diesel fuel. But this
year, surging demand for diesel has drawn distillate out of
refineries as quickly as it flowed in, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   To worsen matters, a refinery in Kuwait that supplies a
disproportionate amount of distillate to world markets was damaged
by an explosion last week, which markedly reduced supply at a time
of rising demand. The Energy Department reported last week that
inventories of distillate were 21 percent lower than last year.
This situation was unlikely to change even with the Saudi Arabia
announcement Monday about higher production.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of natural gas are also 10 to 15 percent below levels a
year ago. The shortfalls are partly the result of conditions over
the last couple of years, when oil and gas prices were so depressed
that few energy companies were drilling for new supplies. As prices
rose for oil and gas, however, companies speedily resumed drilling.
There are 65 percent more active drilling rigs in North America
than a year ago, and 75 percent of them are for natural gas,
according to the Natural Gas Suppliers Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas is used in manufacturing by its primary consumers,
heavy industry, including steel and fertilizer producers. But
natural gas prices are also reacting to shifts in electricity
generation and to increases in power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of the country's current energy needs are met
by natural gas. That proportion is expected to grow to 27 percent
to 28 percent in about three years, which analysts say is a huge
jump, driven mainly by the use of natural gas in new power plants.
Stricter environmental standards for clean fuels have also led to
more utility use of natural gas. Ninety percent of power plants to
be built over the next decade expected to run on the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Many so-called peaking plants, which provide additional power
during periods of particularly heavy demand, already run on natural
gas. And those periods have grown more frequent and intense.
Summers are longer and hotter, and more homes use air conditioning.
Natural gas not only fires the electricity to run commercial air
conditioners but because the gas itself is cold, it often serves as
a coolant for the air conditioning unit itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's double demand,'' said Donato Eassey, natural gas analyst
with Merrill Lynch. He explained that the accouterments of the new
economy demand more electricity. ``All the laptops, cellular
phones, Palm Pilots we use require a huge back office to run them,
which requires a lot of energy, and then they need energy for air
conditioning to keep those systems cool.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such summertime demand has kept natural gas stocks low and
pushed prices higher, analysts say. Through summer and into autumn,
when utilities adjust their rates to reflect higher use and fuel
prices, consumers will have to settle up. Some electricity
providers, such as Consolidated Edison Co. in New York, have
already warned customers about increases in their electricity bills
because of increased demand and costlier fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite higher gasoline prices, Americans continue to drive as
much as before, and they are expected to heat their homes as warmly
as always, albeit with some consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like it, and there's no reason why supply should be
so diminished,'' said Ben Whitley, 48, who paid about $130 a month
last winter to heat his Atlanta home with natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Steep energy prices would hurt low-income Americans, however,
especially those on a fixed income. A 78-year-old retiree, Lillian
Drummond and her husband live in Chicago, where gasoline exceeds $2
per gallon. With a combined monthly income of $1,500, they count
every cent paid for the gasoline they use to drive to the doctor a
few times a week. Last winter, the couple spent about $100 a month
on natural gas to heat their small, brick one-story house and were
spared even steeper payments by the mild weather.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond said she does not know how she or her many neighbors
who scrape by every month will pay higher heating bills this year.
``It would be terrible, because I don't know how we would handle
it. We barely manage to save anything now,'' she said. ``We keep
the thermostat at 60 degrees in the winter and stay under the
covers. Any lower and we would freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   High natural gas prices have also begun to frustrate, even
erode, certain industries. Steel makers, for example, are
scrambling to cut expenses to offset the cost of firing their
furnaces with natural gas. About 70 percent of the cost of making
nitrogen-based fertilizers, among the most widely used in
agriculture, is from natural gas. Already weakened by months of low
prices worldwide, some U.S. fertilizer plants have been forced to
close or downsize drastically because of high natural gas costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe prices of heating oil and natural gas will
gradually slide as supply catches up with demand. They point out
that the renewed drilling will send more gas into the market. But
others caution that the benefits of increased production will only
be felt deep into the winter, in January or February at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas companies say they thought they are behind in filling
supplies, they can catch up,'' Eassey said, ``but from what I see,
I'd argue that every day they are falling farther behind.''

AN UNUSUAL CHOICE FOR A STUDIO HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, July 9) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his jeans and V-neck sweater, Bryan Singer
walked into the commissary at 20th Century Fox at lunchtime this
spring resembling a youthful and eager production assistant. He was
escorted to a small table right beside the kitchen's swinging
doors. He removed his sunglasses and rubbed his eyes. Around him,
studio executives in more comfortable accommodations seemed
oblivious to the filmmaker _ ironic since the studio's fortunes
this summer have, to a degree, been placed firmly in the hands of a
director whose career has centered so far on low-budget and
independent-style films like ``The Usual Suspects'' and the less
successful ``Apt Pupil.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer's film, ``X-Men,'' which is based on characters from the
best-selling comic book series created by Stan Lee, is neither
low-budget nor indie style. The science fiction drama, opening
Friday, is one of the bigger extravaganzas of the summer, a film
that the studio is banking on after recent big-budget
disappointments like ``Fight Club,'' ``Anna and the King'' and
``The Beach.'' If successful, ``X-Men'' could also turn into a
franchise for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, Singer, who seemed alternately confident
and insecure, was not dwelling on how dependent those nearby studio
executives were on his talents to shape a successful franchise. He
didn't have the time. He was spending almost seven days a week
editing the futuristic film which, after his initial reservations,
now consumed and fascinated him. (Not only because of its 470
visual-effect shots, but also because of its subject matter.)
``It's actually about prejudice,'' said the 34-year-old filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on Marvel Comics' extraordinarily popular
saga about outcast _ or mutant _ superheroes who protect a world
that loathes them for being different. The characters themselves
are outsiders and misfits with supernatural powers: the allegory
about bigotry is not too subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Singer's boyhood friend from New Jersey, Christopher
McQuarrie, who also wrote ``The Usual Suspects,'' and Ed Solomon
(``Men in Black''), the movie's cast includes Sir Ian McKellen,
Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Bruce Davison and Anna
Paquin.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mechanic, chairman and chief executive of Fox Filmed
Entertainment (who resigned last month), said that partly because
the movie's stars are not high priced (neither is its director) and
partly because it was made on a tight budget, mostly in Toronto,
its cost had been whittled down to $75 million, which is relatively
inexpensive for such a project. (Its marketing costs, though, could
add at least $30 million to the budget.)
</P>
<P>
   Why did Fox select Singer? Mechanic said: ``We didn't want to
make a silly comic book film. Stars and cars and big bangs. We
didn't want an action director. These are anti-hero heroes, they're
outsiders. We wanted someone young and fresh and someone who would
take the material seriously. This movie was going to be about the
characters in it, not the effects. We wanted someone on the edge
and someone who's a bit on the outside. The characters in Bryan's
movies are very much like that. We wanted it to reflect an
outsider's sensibility. And if you look at all those things,
Bryan's like a fastball down the middle. He's exactly what we were
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential negatives of working with an untested director in
the big-budget league were obvious. Fox surrounded Singer with an
accomplished and experienced creative team on the set. But Mechanic
said candidly that working with a newer director is often easier
than dealing with a veteran: ``A lot of guys who do big-budget
movies just want to know, `How do I make it bigger, bigger,
bigger?' Which is what we didn't want at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer said he was unfamiliar with the comic book, and was
reluctant at first to get involved in the project. But one of his
producing partners, Tom DeSanto, was an ``X-Men'' fan since
childhood and urged him to meet Lee, who created ``X-Men'' in 1963
(and was a big fan of ``The Usual Suspects''). Singer also met with
executives at Marvel Comics and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   I started to explore structural ideas, story ideas,'' Singer
said. ``I started to realize that there was something quite serious
about this. It's basically about reluctant superheroes sworn to
defend the world that hates and fears them.''
</P>
<P>
   At an early stage, as Singer seriously considered the project,
he was invited to an acting showcase by a friend in Los Angeles. It
was the same day that Singer had met executives at Marvel Comics.
As he sat in the first row of the small theater, Singer said he
suddenly realized how he could open the film with a series of
sequences that would introduce the cast of characters, born
different from everyone else, who discover their supernatural
powers at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to see the opening sequences that would establish
that universe,'' he said. ``I needed to set the stage in my own
mind so I could move forward. It was such a tremendous undertaking.
I needed to visualize the opening. I had a kind of epiphany that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Singer told Fox he wanted to proceed with the
project.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, who had previously worked for Singer as a Nazi in
``Apt Pupil,'' plays Magneto, one of the key roles in ``X-Men.''
Magneto is a powerful mutant who had rejected society, believing
that the outsiders and humans can never coexist and that mutants
are the heirs to the world's future.
</P>
<P>
   The actor said that Singer's enthusiasm and even
unpredictability as a director made him popular among actors. ``I
don't always know with Bryan what he's been getting at, where he's
precisely going, until I've seen the dailies or the complete
film,'' McKellen said. ``He always has a vision of what he wants,
but it's rather a private thing. More than any director I know of,
you're on a roller coaster with Bryan. You're racing along but you
don't quite know where you're going. With other directors you're
following a map. Not with Bryan. He works in the moment. He eschews
planning and rehearsals. This might be very alarming for some
actors. Not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, by now a friend of Singer's, said with a laugh that
he's constantly amused by and impressed with Singer, who, at times,
has the air of a naif. ``Actors alarm him,'' McKellen said. ``He's
baffled by acting. I told him he ought to direct a play, and he
said, `But I don't know anything about acting.' And I said, `Yes,
exactly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He always speaks with huge enthusiasm about the actors he's
worked with and the performances he's seen. He's recently
discovered the talents of Bette Davis. He said to me the other day
_ and this is where his youth can be alarming _ he said, `Have you
ever seen a movie called ``All About Eve''?' I said, `Yes, I have
heard of it.'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Singer became a director because of Steven Spielberg. As a
child, Singer grew up in Princeton Junction, N.J. His father,
Norbert Singer, is a businessman and his mother, Grace, is an
environmental activist and former state environmental official. By
age 11, young Bryan was working with 35-millimeter cameras and had
his own dark room, and by his early teens was making 8-millimeter
films.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16, while at a friend's house, Singer saw a
television profile of Spielberg. ``He was this Jewish kid like me,
he lived in New Jersey for awhile, he had a drawer full of
8-millimeter movies too when he was young,'' he said. ``And I
thought, I make all these films for fun and I take all these
photographs and why don't I do this for a living, just like Steven
Spielberg?''
</P>
<P>
   Singer laughed. ``I remember walking home to my house in the
middle of the night feeling like, wow, if nothing else I've decided
what I want to do with my life,'' he said. ``Even if I weren't
successful I knew I would always make films.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan for two
years, and then transferred to the University of Southern
California. During that time he made a movie, ``Lion's Den,'' with
a New Jersey friend, Ethan Hawke. The film, which was shown in a
workshop at the Director's Guild in Los Angeles, proved fortunate
for Singer.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of a Japanese media company, Tokuma, was at the
screening. The company had decided to select six young directors
around the world and bankroll them with $250,000 each to make a
film. Singer, together with McQuarrie and Michael Felt Dugan, wrote
an offbeat story about a stranger who starts his own cable
television call-in show designed to unmask secrets in a town.
Singer got the money, made the film, titled ``Public Access,'' and
it shared the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in
1992 with ``Ruby in Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   His next film, ``The Usual Suspects'' (1995), about five men who
meet in a criminal line-up, was so stylish and highly praised that
Singer was promptly placed in the pantheon of hip, young and
sought-after Hollywood directors. The film won two Academy Awards,
including a best-supporting-actor Oscar for Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Singer was then heavily in demand. He passed up opportunities to
earn millions of dollars directing some high-profile films with big
stars, including ``The Devil's Own,'' with Brad Pitt and Harrison
Ford. He wanted to direct ``The Truman Show,'' but the movie went
to Peter Weir. Singer chose to direct a dark and wicked drama,
``Apt Pupil,'' based on a Stephen King novella, about an average
schoolboy (Brad Renfro) who discovers that a notorious Nazi
(McKellen) is hiding in his town and slowly turns into a monster
himself. The film earned mixed reviews and failed at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try to use the influence I had to make this
difficult and cold movie,'' Singer said. ``I don't regret it at
all. How can I? It has a base of fans. I have disappointment.
Plenty of disappointment. You want things to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer lives alone in a large unfurnished house in Los Angeles,
and seems ambivalent about it. ``I have always lived in a
rent-a-room in someone's house for $850 a month, I've always lived
like a college student,'' he said. ``But then I buy a house as an
investment. It's a beautiful, awesome house and I refinished it, I
did all these cool things except furnishing it. I keep putting it
off. It's been completely empty for two years except for a bed, my
television with a VCR and DVD and a fish tank. When I have friends
over we have pizza on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer is unsure of his next project. The outcome of ``The
X-Men'' will most certainly affect his career. He's been working on
the movie for nearly four years. ``You have to anticipate failure
with every film you do,'' he said. ``But whatever happens, I know I
care deeply about each movie I do, I know I bring a certain visual
style and control over the medium, and I know I'm careful with the
dollars. I feel confident weathering the successes, and I feel
confident weathering the failures. I do my very best. Give it my
all. That's all I can possibly do.''

<P>
   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: CURBING HOOLIGANS
</P>
<P>
   The government proposed emergency laws to give the courts and
the police power to restrict suspected soccer hooligans from
attending domestic matches and prevent them from traveling to games
outside England. With expected Conservative support, the bill
should become law before the end of the month. More than 950
English fans were arrested in Belgium during the just-ended Euro
2000 tournament, and organizers threatened to evict England from
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: ROYAL FREEZE
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II will have her taxpayer-supported income
frozen at its present $12 million a year for the next decade thanks
to cost-cutting by the royal family and Britain's low inflation
rate, Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament. The payout, called
the Civil List, is reviewed every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA: SANCTIONS REFERENDUM
</P>
<P>
   Austria will hold a referendum in the fall on citizens' opinions
of European Union sanctions. The curbs, more symbolic than
financial, were imposed to punish Austria for letting the rightist
Freedom Party into government. Citizens will be asked whether the
government should push for an end to sanctions, which amount to a
refusal by European ministers to meet their Austrian counterparts
formally.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE: WITNESS PROTECTION
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the June 8 terrorist attack against Britain's top
military envoy to Athens, Brig. Stephen Saunders will be given
special protection, including third-country relocation, according
to a government spokesman. Dimitris Reppas said the move ``will
pave the way for a string of ad-hoc counterterrorism measures''
that Washington and the European Union have been urging Greece to
adopt in its fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP BACK
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga, invoking an emergency decree,
has reintroduced censorship on local and foreign news media three
days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling that censorship was
illegal. The decree will cover whatever the government considers to
be against national interests or detrimental to the preservation of
public order, officials said. Censorship of war-related news was
imposed under emergency regulations in May, but removed from
foreign reporters a month later.
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR: AUTONOMY REJECTED
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Cabinet rejected a greater autonomy resolution passed
by Jammu-Kashmir state lawmakers last week. The resolution would
have restored the state's pre-1953 status, under which it had its
own president, prime minister and courts. The federal government
would have had control of defense, foreign affairs and
communications. Similar autonomy demands were made by Assam in
1940, Punjab in 1973 and Tamil Nadu in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: CABINET SHUFFLE
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori was reconfirmed as prime minister, a week after his
Liberal Democratic Party won a much narrower than predicted victory
in legislative elections. In what many analysts here saw as a
confirmation of Mori's weak position, he immediately named a new
cabinet in which the most powerful economic and foreign policy
positions were holdovers from his previous administration.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   CHAD: HABRE CHARGES DROPPED
</P>
<P>
   A Senegalese court dismissed charges of torture against Hissene
Habre, the former President of Chad who has lived in exile in
Senegal since being ousted in 1990. Senegal's judiciary, which has
been going through many changes since a new president, Abdoulaye
Wade, was elected in March, gave no reason for its decision. In
February, in a move inspired by the case against Augusto Pinochet,
several Chadian and international rights groups took Habre to
court.
</P>
<P>
   IVORY COAST: MILITARY PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers angry over pay took to the streets of Abidjan, firing
in the air and leaving the commercial capital deserted. The
military government led by Gen. Robert Guei, who seized power in a
coup last December after an earlier protest by disgruntled
soldiers, said the disturbances were started by soldiers who had
been demanding $8,700 each for having supported the general.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: GLOSSY IMAGES THAT BOTH MIMIC AND MOCK MALE
SEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   London can keep its YBA's, or Young British Artists. New York
may have a hip abbreviation of its own, the BYT's: Beautiful Young
Things. These are the good-looking 20-and 30-something artists
whose photographs have been cropping up in glossy magazines this
season. Their louche, carefully orchestrated images indicate that
it may take more than the usual amounts of glamour, sex appeal and
physical attractiveness to be a successful artist these days. And
the more exposed flesh, the better.
</P>
<P>
   In the January-February issue of i-D, a fashion-rock-art
magazine, photographs of female newcomers, including several
artists, often approached soft-core levels in their poses and
uncovered skin. In the February Vanity Fair, Inka Essenhigh, Cecily
Brown, John Currin and other artists bared various areas of
midriff, chest and leg in full-color photographs. In the February
Harper's Bazaar, eight young female photographers lounged around a
Chelsea restaurant, looking pretty much like a gang of disaffected
supermodels.
</P>
<P>
   The April Vogue brought the young, exceptionally beautiful
artist Rachel Feinstein, something of a regular in fashion magazine
society pages, perched on a bed in a glittering evening dress,
toying with little Play-Doh sculptures and looking like a cross
between a Hollywood starlet and the fairy princess she has played
in some of her homemade movies. (The incidence of female artists in
evening wear may be on the rise. An article previewing the Whitney
Biennial in the March issue of Talk magazine included the artist
Vanessa Beecroft in satiny palazzo pants and halter, and E.V. Day
in lame.) And in May there was Tracey Emin in British Vogue,
lolling about a hotel room with Kate Moss, although only Moss got
naked.
</P>
<P>
   These images make rich reading material. Many of them are right
in step with our unbuttoned, slouchy, increasingly eroticized
culture. These are the days of underwear as outerwear, X-rated
fashion photography, devolving standards of modesty and privacy,
and relentless image bombardment. These are also the days of
ubiquitous naked bodies, and sexual references in contemporary art.
The number of photography shows of people of all shapes, sizes,
colors, ages and genders in the altogether reaches double digits
nearly every month. Given such reflections of culture's changing
mores _ and photography's role in communicating them _ it's not
surprising that the photograph of the artist, that venerable art
world subgenre, should be shifting shape a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Some people want to take these images as signs of the nonart
world media's renewed interest in the art world, and therefore of
the return of an 1980s-style art boom. But the glossified '80s
artists were overwhelmingly male. The mediagenic artists of the
oughties, as the current decade is sometimes called, are often
women. And they are women who exude high levels of postfeminist
attitude and are as fearless about tackling sexual issues in their
work as they are about using their sexuality _ or general
attractiveness _ whenever the media look in their direction. Many
of them are putting their own spin on the highbrow seduction
implicit in the photographs of male artists.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, there's plenty to spin. After all, a male artist's
physique, his three-day stubble, his slightly dangerous or
mysteriously moody expression are no less sexual than the
provocative poses of women. But male sexuality and its power are
taken for granted, unremarkable and thus invisible. Women, in
contrast, continue to be identified more with their sexuality and
judged more by appearance and according to narrower ideals of
beauty. As a result, those without the proper looks or attitude
tend to lose out _ as in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for a much more complicated, intriguing and
confounding situation than that of the 1980s. It only adds to the
conundrum that many of the women in these images are themselves
photographers who frequently photograph young women like
themselves, dressed and undressed, and who also moonlight in the
commercial world for fashion and other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is fascinating and dismaying in equal parts. It's
fascinating when these women use the artist's photograph to comment
on the history of the genre. The dismay comes from the question of
who is using whom.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the artists' photographs in Vanity Fair and
Harper's Bazaar sent the unsettling message that only women who
were white, thin and pretty needed apply. Missing from Vanity Fair
was Lisa Yuskavage, whose paintings of weirdly distorted,
concupiscent female adolescents have attracted a lot of attention
but who lacks the sylphlike form of Brown and Essenhigh or Justine
Kurland and the other women in the Harper's Bazaar spread.
</P>
<P>
   But Yuskavage also had her say. In the Whitney Biennial preview
article in Talk magazine, she appeared in a photograph in which she
was closely flanked by two naked female models. The combination of
clothed and unclothed women was startling. We're so much more used
to seeing naked female models in the company of clothed male
artists _ most famously in the many photographs of Matisse at work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the ``girls just want to have fun'' rationale
_ fun similar to that enjoyed by successful boy artists. It's not
surprising that the girls may also want to parody what the boys do.
The precedent for such parody, which still looks shocking today, is
the advertisement that the video artist and sculptor Lynda Benglis
ran in a 1974 issue of Artforum. Hair cropped, body buffed and
oiled, she wore only rhinestone-studded sunglasses and flaunted an
enormous plastic phallus.
</P>
<P>
   Especially parodic among the recent photographs was that of a
young painter named Stella Schnabel in i-D, which showed her
stretched out on her studio floor, bare to the waist and wearing a
sarong. (She looked like something out of Gauguin.) It suggested a
direct retort to a famous 1980s photograph of her father, Julian,
and three other (male) Neo-Expressionists assuming bare-chested,
muscle man poses in Mary Boone's SoHo gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Cecily Brown's photographs often pun on conventional portrayals
of male artists. The photographs in Vanity Fair, which were taken
by Todd Eberle, show her reclining on a studio floor that is
splattered with paint and dotted with cigarette butts in a manner
that would have done Pollock proud. A photograph that appeared in
The New Yorker made a similar point. It showed Brown from the back
as she stood, cigarette in hand, studying one of her paintings _ a
pose frequently assumed by brooding male artists (Hopper, Rothko,
Brice Marden, whoever). Except that Brown was wearing a
close-fitting hot pink skirt and slouching her hip a bit teasingly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should think of artists like Brown and her colleagues
as presenting a kind of performance art package. They may fit
within the tradition of female artists who have parlayed their good
looks, sexual energy and artistic talent into an irresistible
force, or at least a semblance of one. Early '60s precursors
include Carolee Schneeman, known especially for chaotic, orgylike
performances, but also for provocative self-portrait photographs
and painted found-object assemblages. (Funnily enough, Brown's
paintings resemble documentary photographs of Schneemann's
best-known performances, with their masses of writhing, painted
bodies.)
</P>
<P>
   Another predecessor is Yayoi Kusama, who turned the Happening
into a kind of psychedelic love-and-paint-in while also making
pulsating abstract ``net'' paintings and walk-in environments in
which walls and objects were covered with stuffed fabric phalluses.
</P>
<P>
   These women fused art and personal identity in a way that many
people found unsettling, because it seemed to corrupt art's purity.
They also translated into conventional, easy-to-read female terms
the presumptive, palpable but rarely commented-on swagger of male
artists.
</P>
<P>
   In these post-Warholian times, Brown and her contemporaries
don't perform within the art world proper. They perform within a
much larger, more accessible arena: the media. In this respect they
may be taking their tips more from Madonna than from any art world
precedents. But it is still debatable whether they are using their
sexuality any more than their male counterparts always have.
</P>
<P>
   None of these issues can be neatly resolved. It would be nice to
think that the recent photographs of the Beautiful Young Things
indicate that as women become more comfortable with themselves, the
ways in which they can be comfortable, both in appearance and
behavior, can be more varied and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   But ambiguity, if not outright contradiction, is endemic in our
times, and may even reflect the increased influence of women. What
seems certain is simply this: women and photography are among the
most volatile, fluid elements in society today. Both seem to be
going places they haven't been before, doing things they haven't
done before. It should surprise no one that whenever they get
together _ in the artist's photograph or elsewhere _ almost
anything can happen.

FRENCH START INQUIRY INTO U.S. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French prosecutor has begun a preliminary
investigation into whether the American global surveillance system,
which listens in on millions of telephone calls, faxes and e-mails
each day, is a threat to French well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, has ordered the French
counterintelligence agency, called DST, to appraise the actions of
the system, named Echelon. The system links computers in at least
seven sites around the world to receive, analyze and sort
information captured from satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   If the French agency finds the system ``harmful to the vital
interests of the nation,'' legal proceedings could begin, though it
is difficult to see how an American government agency could be sued
in a French court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue is taken very seriously in Europe. Many fear
that America's vast surveillance system, developed in the Cold War,
is being used to further America's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have repeatedly denied that. But the issue
continues to arouse passions here. That is particularly true in
France, where even Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou contended in
February that Cold War spy systems had been converted to ``economic
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the European Parliament held hearings on the subject,
leading to an emotional debate. A report commissioned by the
Parliament and written by a British journalist said there was
evidence that the Echelon system had twice helped American
companies gain an advantage over Europeans, though few details were
provided. Some members of the Parliament expressed skepticism over
the 18-page report. But others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is deciding whether to create a commission to
continue its Echelon investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Dintilhac, Marie-Annick Darmaillac, said the
prosecutor had decided to begin his own investigation after
receiving a letter from a member of the European Parliament who is
a former French judge, Thierry Jean-Pierre. Darmaillac said the
letter had contained enough information for the prosecutor to feel
an investigation was warranted. But she said she could not discuss
what steps might be taken next as it was up to the prosecutor to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   In Strasbourg, Jean-Pierre told Agence France-Press that he
believes that either the Echelon system should be dismantled or
Europe should have a hand in governing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echelon is used by the National Security Agency for strategic
and economic gains,'' Jean-Pierre said. ``You cannot make me
believe that the information is not passed on to American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that many Europeans are particularly galled that the
British are partners of the United States in the Echelon system.
</P>
<P>
   Recently declassified information shows that Echelon is a
network of surveillance stations stitched together in the 1970s by
the United States with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.
The system listens and watches for key words on a topic requested
by a country. Some experts have said that the most extravagant
claims against the Echelon system make little sense, because the
National Security Agency is overwhelmed by the proliferation of
information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that France operates its own surveillance
system, which some have dubbed ``Frenchelon,'' though it is
believed to be much smaller than the American system. However, it
is thought to do much the same thing, eavesdropping on private and
public communications.

 &HT;    MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PLANS BIG REFORMS TO END CORRUPTION
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a dramatic attempt to move Mexico from 71 years
of one-party rule and end corruption, president-elect Vicente Fox
said Tuesday he plans to create an independent department to
command federal police and transfer the power for auditing federal
spending to Mexico's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mexican police are under the Department of Internal
Affairs, which handles the executive's relations with state
governors and political parties. Under one-party rule, it has long
been accused of mixing political ambitions with police power _ and
engaging in repressive activities and spying against perceived
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This separation is crucial to eliminating corruption and
pressure on citizens and espionage, which we have denounced
before,'' Fox said in a wide-ranging press conference with foreign
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of corruption, yes, we are going to end it in six
years,'' he said, referring to his presidential term. ``The
proposals are profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his other top commitment is reducing poverty _ half of
Mexico's population is poor _ by increasing investment and opening
up lines of credit closed off to most Mexicans. He plans to start
traveling soon to the United States and other countries, with a
goal of boosting foreign investment here to $20 billion from about
$12 or $13 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect said he also wants to pursue long-term
negotiations to open up the United States to legal Mexican guest
workers so that migrants don't have to work as undocumented aliens.
But he said his country also needs to urgently create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's goal has been to open the escape valve, avoid its own
responsibility to create jobs here, allow 350,000 young people to
cross the border each year, and wash its hands of responsibility,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was elected on Sunday and on Dec. 1 he will assume the
presidency, ending the seven-decade presidential reign of Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and agricultural businessman,
belongs to Mexico's conservative National Action Party, or PAN. But
he has pledged to build a plural ``transitional'' government to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He is using five international and national ``head-hunting''
firms to help him narrow his search for candidates for his cabinet
_ a new phenomenon in a country where cronyism is often the rule.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised political plurality in his cabinet, as well as
gender equality and geographic diversity so that people from all
parts of Mexico are represented.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he experienced ``an explosion of happiness'' in the
wake of his election. To assure a smooth transition where files
won't be destroyed or offices stripped, Fox said, ``I have to trust
in the open doors offered by President (Ernesto) Zedillo,'' who met
with Fox on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other reforms, Fox also wants to transfer police to a new
Department of Security and Justice and narrow the powers of the
Attorney General's office so it will focus primarily on
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   These reforms, Fox said, ``will assign specific responsibilities
to each one of these institutions, instead of having this
corruption or linkage between activities that do not correspond (or
make for) a real transparency in accountable government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's office has special police whose job it is
to investigate narcotics trafficking. Drug-related corruption
within that department, as well as all levels of Mexico's federal
and state police, are a major sore point between the United States
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's office works closely, but not always
smoothly, with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   When he travels to the United States soon to meet with President
Clinton, Fox said he also hopes to meet with Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore and Republican candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he recommends the United States scrap its annual
certification of countries it considers partners in the fight
against drugs and instead opt for a system of mutual scrutiny among
nations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his call for a freer flow of guest workers from
Mexico to the United States and Canada, he also raised the
possibility of creating a special development fund, backed by
foreign governments, to spur growth in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, we could sit down and say our goal is to
close the income gap'' among the North American countries, Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's domestic proposals, including his idea to give Congress
the power to audit federal spending, ``are all reforms that reduce
the power of the presidency,'' said Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies. ``This is a great advance. An
alternation in power will give Mexico the opportunity to really
reform government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great political capital that Fox has,'' Estudillo added,
``is his charisma and leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will probably have a Congress and Senate willing to approve
these ideas, Estudillo said, because all parties _ including the
PRI _ now have a greater interest in creating checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Fox's PAN party tried to enact legislation to give
Congress the power to audit federal spending but the PRI blocked
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has invited all lower-level federal employees to remain in
their posts when he takes office. But he plans on promoting
professionalism to root out corruption and make government more
responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ambitious program that takes time. But it is the
only way, at the end, you will have changed the culture,'' he said.
``The president has to (provide) the very first example of ethics,
ethical values and morality and behavior. Unfortunately, in this
country we haven't had that. The example has been the contrary.''

A PURE ARTIST IS EMBRACED BY THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By MICHAEL RUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I knew I was going to be either an artist or a
criminal,'' says Martha Rosler, the multimedia artist, critic,
theorist, teacher and art-world provocateur. In a career spanning
35 years, Rosler, whose disdain for the normal rites of passage
from galleries to collectors to museums struck many as criminal,
has clung tenaciously to a very personal art that refuses to
separate aesthetics from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to be represented by a gallery until 1993, Rosler
relented when Simon Watson, who then owned a gallery in SoHo,
approached her with an offer to preserve her work for history. ``He
made sense,'' she says, holding fast to a glass of cold water at
the Housing Works Used Books Cafe not far from Watson's old
gallery. ``So much of my work involved the Vietnam War that it
would have been obscene to show it in a gallery. But now, it's
different; it's important to remember and to enable the young to
discover what to some of us is still so present.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable affirmation from a museum world that she so
often criticized, Rosler is now receiving a major retrospective
organized by Elizabeth Ann Macgregor of the Ikon Gallery in
Birmingham, England, and Sabine Breitwieser of the Generali
Foundation in Vienna. After stops in England, France, Austria and
Spain, ``Martha Rosler: Positions in the Life World'' makes its
only United States appearance in a joint presentation by the New
Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo from Saturday through Oct. 8 and
the International Center of Photography on Fifth Avenue from July
29 through Oct. 1. ``Martha Rosler is one of the most important
artists of the last 25 years,'' says Brian Wallis, chief curator at
ICP, which will be focusing on Rosler's photography.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, where a broad survey
of Rosler's large installations, photos, videos and sculptures can
be seen, adds, ``She is a pioneering artist whose influence is
widely recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   While this burst of affection from institutions may seem at odds
with her reputed iconoclasm, Rosler has actually been represented
in about 10 nonprofit group and solo shows in Europe and America
since the early 70's. ``I was never against museum audiences,'' she
says. ``Only the nexus of cash that saw art principally as a
commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming of age in the late '50s and '60s (she graduated from
Brooklyn College in 1965), she was immersed in a culture of
protests from her early teens. ``I was a beatnik in high school,''
she says, ``always going to hear Allen Ginsberg and Thelonius Monk.
I also went to a lot of theater from Broadway to the Living
Theater, where I was exposed to Brecht, Pirandello and Beckett.
They showed me how you could dispense with excessive amusement in
favor of language and gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosler's mother was a New York City school teacher and her
father had ``a one-man law office.'' She credits her yeshiva
education (which she hated at the time) with her strong sensitivity
to the ``public and the political.'' If her broad range of work can
be characterized briefly, it involves bringing a critical eye to
public struggles, in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her most celebrated works, ``The Bowery in Two
Inadequate Descriptive Systems'' from 1974, Rosler challenges the
sentimentalism of postwar photography as represented by Robert
Capa. Instead of photographing the familiar ``Bowery bums,'' the
alcoholics and drug addicts who could be found lying in doorways
and on streets in lower Manhattan, Rosler took shots of shop
windows and disintegrating storefronts, void of people but
representing the life that is lived there by the neighborhood's
many diverse inhabitants. She placed the photos in a grid along
with texts containing synonyms for inebriation (loopy, groggy,
potted, pickled, etc.). The combination of photos and texts, placed
in a minimalist grid, forced a critique of assumptions about the
Bowery without offering any concrete alternatives. ``I wanted to
strip away any ornament,'' she says, ``and return power to the
viewer,'' something she felt had been contaminated by the overt
humanism of Capa and Walker Evans.
</P>
<P>
   This spareness of approach, often joined with a biting sense of
humor, was inspired partly by the films of Jean-Luc Godard, the
Swiss experimentalist who came to prominence in the early '60s.
Rosler met Godard a few times during her graduate studies at the
University of California in San Diego, where she also met the
filmmaker Roberto Rossellini and influential intellectuals like
Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Francois Lyotard and Fredric Jameson. In
Godard, the young Rosler found a model artist who resisted the
commercialization of ideas even as he dazzled with his command of
striking images, sounds and texts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosler spent a dozen years in southern California from the late
'60s to the early '80s, a time she says was immensely important to
her. ``I lost my New York provinciality,'' she says, ``and was let
loose from the strictures of being a middle-class Brooklyn Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   During this time she married, had a son, Joshua (now a
32-year-old comics artist and writer), and divorced after seven
years. After graduate school she taught art and began her lifelong
avocation of gardening. ``But I started dreaming of sidewalks,''
she says, ``so I knew it was time to go back East.'' She was
offered a job at Rutgers, where she is a professor of art.
</P>
<P>
   It was during her time in California that Rosler created some of
her most enduring work in performance, video and photography.
``Bringing the War Home,'' 1967-1972, is a series of 20
photomontages that places images of Vietnam War victims (girls with
missing limbs, mothers holding their dead children, wounded
soldiers) in the midst of tranquil suburban American interiors cut
from the pages of Life magazine. As the art historian Alexander
Alberro says of this series, ``She was, in effect, making concrete
`the war abroad, the war at home,' produced by the mass media,
which imported images of death from Vietnam into U.S. homes every
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Domesticity also played a role in ``Semiotics of the Kitchen,''
a 1975 video, in which a deadpan Rosler, dressed in an apron, sends
up culinary shows and the woman's place in the kitchen, performing
mannered gestures with a variety of cooking utensils. Like so much
of her early work, ``Semiotics'' is striking both for its innocence
as well as its sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Rosler's photographs and videos were fully formed from the
start, it seems, displaying a strong grasp of technique peppered
with youthful exuberance. In her 1977 performance and, later, video
``Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained,'' the artist
submits to having every inch of her nude body measured and recorded
by two white-coated men as a ``chorus'' of women stand to the side
watching silently. ``This is a work about how to think about
yourself,'' Rosler says in a voice-over on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Rosler has taken her cameras (moving and still)
to airports (producing stunning shots of architectural details in
empty terminals) and housing projects (a video study of Corbusier's
last development in Firminy, France), while maintaining her
commitment to the plight of the homeless (``Housing Is a Human
Right,'' a billboard display in Times Square) and politically
oppressed (``Chile on the Road to Nafta,'' a video made in Chile 25
years after the coup that deposed Salvador Allende).
</P>
<P>
   ``My art is a communicative act,'' Rosler says, ``a form of an
utterance, a way to open a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing a conversation with her, during which topics have
flown from Aristotle to Marx, Nicaragua to Kosovo, is like coming
to the end of a roller coaster ride. You're relieved, but you want
to go at it again. Her enduring vision linking art and public
purpose can be exhausting as well as exhilarating. As the New
Museum's chief curator, Dan Cameron, says of Rosler: ``She's the
purest artist there is.''

PLAQUE AT VIETNAM MEMORIAL TO HONOR ADDITIONAL VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of Vietnam veterans whose names never
made it onto the wall at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington because they did not die from battle-related injuries or
accidents will now be honored there, though not by name.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation signed by President Clinton on June 15, a
plaque will soon go up near the memorial to honor the veterans who
died after the war from exposure to Agent Orange, post-traumatic
stress disorder and other causes not directly related to combat
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that the number of veterans who died from those
conditions is at least equal to the number of names inscribed on
the wall _ 58,220.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque, which is expected to go up within a year, will be
paid for with private donations. It will not carry the names of the
veterans it honors, but instead will bear a short commemorative
inscription. The American Battle Monuments Commission will provide
the text and determine the plaque's design and its location on the
memorial site.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial rules allow people's names to be added to the wall, but
only after the Defense Department determines that those people died
from wounds directly related to hostilities or accidents in combat
zones. Since the wall was completed in 1982, 261 names have been
added.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calling for the plaque was passed unanimously in
the House and the Senate in May. The bills were sponsored by Rep.
Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the plaque has stirred controversy. The
organization that built the memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
Fund, said the plaque threatened to detract from the memorial's
power by lessening its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain works of architecture in the world that
should be allowed to make a statement without additions,'' said Jan
C. Scruggs, the president and founder of the fund. ``We must get
Congress to bring an end to permanent new additions to the Vietnam
memorial, just as France has done with the Eiffel Tower and Egypt
has done with the Pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs said he did not oppose the plaque but feared that it
would open the floodgates to more additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just concerned about the next plaque,'' he said. ``It's
just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans are also concerned about recognizing deaths
attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder. They consider that a
euphemism for suicide and believe it is an inappropriate subject
for a national memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque is a product of years of grass-roots efforts by
families of veterans. In 1993, Ruth Coder Fitzgerald began looking
for a way to honor veterans like her brother, John Keath Coder, who
had died the year before from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after being
exposed to Agent Orange in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs officially presumes that all
Vietnam veterans who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or certain other
diseases have been exposed to Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who lives in Fredericksburg, Va., said that after
years of writing letters, attending meetings and lobbying, she
finally got what she wanted: ``a place I can go to any day of the
year and honor people like my brother.''

INVESTIGATORS SAW TWO SIDES OF GORE IN FUND-RAISING INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his April interview with federal investigators,
two very different Al Gores seemed to be present, according to law
enforcement officials. One was a confident master of detail, the
other a defensive witness who could not recall basic facts about
his fund-raising activities in the months before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Gore remembered with precision how long he had
served as vice president and as a senator from Tennessee. ``I've
been vice president for seven years and two months and 28 days,''
Gore said. ``Before that, I was a member of the United States
Senate for eight years and 18 days.''
</P>
<P>
   But later in the April 18 interview, Gore said he did not know
whether the now-infamous luncheon that he attended at a Buddhist
temple in California was a fund-raising event. He disputed the
suggestion that White House coffees were used as fund-raising tools
by the Democratic Party _ although millions of dollars flowed from
the people who attended them. And the vice president said he
thought he had attended only one White House coffee when documents
showed that he had attended 23.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that Gore was so meticulous in
his recall of some matters (at one point describing himself as a
``stickler to a fault'' who sometimes corrected the grammar of his
campaign letters) that they doubted his vague responses to
questions about his campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   That contradiction fueled investigators' skepticism about Gore's
truthfulness. Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the Justice
Department's campaign task force, recommended that Attorney General
Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate the vice
president's veracity during the four-hour interview.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad is focusing on three principal areas of inquiry, law
enforcement officials said. None of the issues are new: the vice
president's appearance at a luncheon at the Buddhist temple, his
attendance at White House coffees and his fund-raising telephone
calls from the Executive Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, after he ordered his lawyers to release copies of
the 123-page transcript of his interview, Gore told reporters, ``I
think the truth is my friend in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the vice president's office, said,
``This isn't news. This is archaeology and it has no relevance to
the kind of issues that the vice president is working on and the
American people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a status report on the significant matters in
the Gore inquiry:
</P>
<P>
   Hsi Lai Temple Luncheon
</P>
<P>
   Issue: On April 29, 1996, Gore attended a luncheon organized by
John Huang and Maria Hsia, both of whom were Democratic
fund-raisers, at the Hsi Lai Temple, a Buddhist monastery near Los
Angeles in Hacienda Heights, Calif. The luncheon with about 100
community leaders was one of the first campaign finance
controversies to embroil the vice president, who was invited to the
temple by one of the leaders of the Taiwan-based group.
</P>
<P>
   The event raised the issue of whether the temple had held a
political fund-raiser in violation of its tax-exempt status as a
religious institution and whether temple monastics were illegally
reimbursed for contributions. There was also the question of
whether Gore knew it was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Gore said in an October 1996 interview with National
Public Radio that the luncheon was a ``community outreach'' event.
But in January 1997, a spokesman for the vice president said that
Gore ``knew it was a finance-related event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Investigation: Investigators found that Gore routinely
attended fund-raisers and community outreach events organized by
the Democratic National Committee. Some documents suggested
confusion among Gore's staff because the vice president initially
planned on attending two events in a single day in Los Angeles, one
a fund-raising luncheon and the other a visit to the temple. The
two stops were melded into one because of time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Reno decided against appointing an independent counsel to review
any of Gore's fund raising, although he was not questioned about
the temple event until last April. Justice Department prosecutors
brought criminal charges against the two fund-raisers involved in
the temple luncheon. Huang pleaded guilty for his role in
soliciting about $159,000 in contributions from people who attended
the event and from temple monastics. In an appearance before a
House committee, Huang testified that he had no evidence
implicating Gore in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, the other fund-raiser, was convicted in March of campaign
finance violations, including helping to arrange for donations to
be made in the names of monks and nuns who were later reimbursed by
the temple.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's comments: In one of the most caustic
exchanges of his April interview with federal prosecutors, Gore
angrily denied that he had been told by aides that the Buddhist
temple event was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore testified.
</P>
<P>
   Unresolved Questions: Conrad is said to be dissatisfied with
some of Gore's answers. Several documents indicate that Gore's
staff knew that the purpose of the temple luncheon was to raise
campaign contributions. Because of the discrepancy between Gore's
responses and some of the documents, Conrad has recommended that a
special counsel be appointed to investigate the matter further.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House Coffees
</P>
<P>
   Issue: Gore's attendance at White House coffees, which were used
by the White House in 1995 and 1996 to help the Democratic Party
raise millions of dollars in campaign contributions. From November
1995 to August 1996, the White House organized 103 coffees. Guests
contributed a total of $26.4 million, and $7.7 million was
contributed by guests within one month of attending a coffee,
usually held in the White House Map Room.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation: Charles G. LaBella, a former head of the Justice
Department task force, investigated the White House coffees, and
concluded that they required no further inquiry. And late in 1997,
Reno also decided that the coffees merited no further action.
</P>
<P>
   However, Conrad, who was appointed by Reno in late December,
decided to ask Gore questions about the coffees. Gore disputed
Conrad's suggestion that White House coffees were used as
``fund-raising tools'' by the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad asked: ``In your opinion, there simply was no quid pro
quo of attendance at a coffee, payment to follow?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``That is absolutely my impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad asked if it was true that Gore had served as host of 23
White House coffees and sat in with President Clinton at eight
others. ``Would that be an accurate statement?'' Conrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore said he could not recall attending any coffees.
``This was on the president's side of things,'' he said. ``That's
my memory and impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it ``was not my practice to go to any of these
coffees.'' He added, ``There may have been one that I attended
briefly, perhaps because some of the invitees were known to me and
wanted to say hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the interview, Gore's personal lawyer, James F.
Neal, acknowledged in a letter to Conrad that the vice president
misunderstood the question, and thought it dealt only with ``White
House coffees.'' Neal wrote that according to the vice president's
schedule, Gore had attended four White House coffees and he had
served as host of 21 coffees in the Old Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Unresolved Questions: The discrepancies between the documents
and Gore's hazy recollection of his role in the coffees have
prompted Conrad to recommend that Reno appoint a special counsel to
investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   White House Telephone Calls
</P>
<P>
   The Issue: From December 1995 to April 1996, Gore made 45
fund-raising telephone calls from his West Wing office in the White
House. The calls raised the issue of whether Gore had violated the
Pendleton Act, an 1883 civil service law that bars elected
officials from using federal property to raise campaign
contributions. The law was designed to prevent officeholders from
pressuring their subordinates into making political donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his fund-raising calls from his White House office.
Clinton made similar calls from his White House quarters, which is
not considered official government property.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Gore telephoned was Robert Johnson, chairman of
Black Entertainment Television. In one document disclosed by a
House committee, a call sheet prepared by the Democratic Party,
Gore was told to ask Johnson ``to write $30K for the media
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with FBI agents, Johnson said he took Gore's
call and then wrote a check to the Democratic Party for $30,000.
Later, a Democratic Party finance officer noted on a computerized
record of the vice president's fund raising: ``$30K in.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation: In 1997, Reno absolved Gore of any wrongdoing
in connection with the phone calls. She found that Gore's calls
were intended to raise money only for general party purposes, a
category known as ``soft money.'' She concluded that Gore did not
realize that part of the money was funneled into hard money
accounts that were used for Clinton-Gore re-election activities but
were restricted by federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Reno's findings were challenged when investigators
obtained a Nov. 21, 1995, memo written by David M. Strauss, then
the vice president's deputy chief of staff. On the memo were
Strauss' handwritten notes that suggested that Gore might have
known that a portion of the money raised by his calls was allocated
to direct re-election activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews with prosecutors, four participants in
the meeting, including Leon Panetta, the former White House chief
of staff, recalled that Gore was present for a discussion of the
how the money was to be allocated. But seven or eight others told
investigators they could not recall a discussion about money raised
by phone calls going to the restricted hard money accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Comments: When interviewed by prosecutors on Nov. 11,
1998, Gore said that he was sometimes inattentive and missed parts
of the fund-raising meetings. According to FBI notes on the
interview, Gore said that he ``drank a lot of iced tea during
meetings, which could have necessitated a restroom break.''
</P>
<P>
   Unresolved Issues: In December 1998, Reno cleared Gore of
wrongdoing. In reaching her decision, she rebuffed recommendations
from six senior aides and relied instead on the advice of single
trusted adviser, Lee J. Radek, the chief of the Justice
Department's public corruption unit.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several weeks, Conrad, urged on by the FBI,
concluded that Gore's truthfulness about the phone calls should
also be examined by an outside prosecutor.

ADVANTAGE WILLIAMS:IT'S VENUS VS. SERENA
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It was the sixth game of the third set when
a nervous murmur slipped out of the spellbound witnesses. A
desperate Martina Hingis had lunged to send back a shot that
fluttered like a harmless butterfly above the net, and they could
see what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing forward with a furious churn of arms and legs, the
intimidating Venus Williams materialized like a praying mantis to
devour Hingis' effort with a swinging forehand volley. On instinct,
Hingis guessed right at the angle, stabbed at the blur of yellow
only to flick a lob long. With a deep sigh, Hingis expressed her
hopeless state.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, beneath the ominous clouds suspended above Center
Court Tuesday, the powerful Williams made Hingis look as vulnerable
as a victim in a dunk tank. Hingis kept popping to the surface,
steeling herself for more, but she could only endure so much. In
the sixth game of the third set, Williams became the first of the
two to hold serve over an eight-game span. Once she grabbed the 4-2
lead, Williams never wavered on serve again.
</P>
<P>
   On match point, Williams reached back and uncoiled a 118 mph ace
to end a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 classic quarterfinal at Wimbledon. As her
serve rocketed past Hingis, Williams squealed for joy. Suddenly,
the ominous 20-year-old morphed into a child as she skipped to the
net with her ponytail bouncing and her smiling eyes fixed on the
friends' box.
</P>
<P>
   There was her giddy father, Richard, and her next opponent, too.
Not even an hour into her sister's match, Serena Williams sneaked
into the stadium and sat down next to their father after having
razed Lisa Raymond, 6-2, 6-0, in 41 minutes. On Thursday, Venus and
Serena Williams will meet in the semifinals at Wimbledon, marking
the third time sisters have met in the tournament's history. ``I
see it as an opportunity, not an opportunity against Serena,'' said
Venus, who was an emotionally detached spectator when Serena became
the first of the two to win a Grand Slam at the U.S. Open last
summer. ``She's been blazing past opponents _ no mercy. I want to
go in with that same attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of edge was there for Lindsay Davenport Tuesday.
Persevering through a troublesome start, she outlasted a
surprisingly focused Monica Seles, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-0, and will play
Jelena Dokic in the other semifinal. Typical Davenport, she has
made her way through the draw in wallflower fashion. In all
likelihood, she'll continue to be part of the background when the
Williams sisters meet for the fifth time since they arrived on the
pro tour..
</P>
<P>
   First there was Venus, then Serena. At least one of the parents
who guided them to this amazing point won't be in attendance on
Thursday. The eccentric Richard Williams plans to attend a funeral
on Thursday. He doesn't know the deceased _ it's a friend of an
acquaintance he met at Wimbledon this week _ but he said it'll be
his escape from a match he sees as a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was betting, I'd put 50 pounds on Venus and 50 pounds on
Serena; then I can't lose because one of them will be in the
final,'' Richard Williams said. ``I think they're excited to get
his far, but you have to understand human feelings. I don't think
they're excited about playing each other, but their family bond is
stronger than tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was anxiety between Venus and Serena Williams _ both of
whom dismiss the notion of a sibling rivalry _ they camouflaged it
Wednesday afternoon with giggles and jokes. Serena, 18, flashed her
half-moon grin when told of her father's match-day plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I would be heartbroken if my little Jackie had to play
my Star ... those are my two dogs,'' Serena said like a comic
delivering a punch line. ``Maybe it's too much pressure on him.
It's probably the same reason I wouldn't watch my dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter as Serena finished her monologue. She is the
more extroverted of the sisters, but even the more serious Venus
couldn't resist adding to the light-hearted atmosphere by
describing the strategy her little sister used when they were
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena was a cheater,'' Venus Williams said. ``I just rolled
with it. It's tough to argue against Serena because she was so good
at arguing, so good at cheating. It was no use. I don't think this
time we'll be calling the lines. Hopefully, I won't get any hooks,
and she won't be paying any line judges.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The level of play in the Hingis-Williams match even surpassed
the tension-filled, three-set semifinal the two played at the U.S.
Open last summer. Hingis won that day, but that victory only set
her up to lose to Serena in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   During the sixth game of the second set, Hingis was at her
clairvoyant best. As Venus Williams lined up an overhead, Hingis
paged through her mental scouting report, crept to her right and
was in position. As Williams smashed the overhead, Hingis lunged
and blocked it back down the line for a winner. The shot helped
produced the break of serve she needed to go on and take the second
set.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Hingis can shake an opponent's confidence by breaking
their spirit. But Williams just kept coming, kept taking the ball
in the air on swinging volleys and kept pounding her backhand for
14 winners. To keep pace, Hingis went for every line, as well. Both
players took risks with drop shots, and continued to aggressively
plant ground strokes into the grass like drill bits.
</P>
<P>
   The two were in an attack-and-response mode that produced
endless deuce games and few holds of serve. Hingis won 6 of 16
break chances, while Williams converted 7 of 20. At one overlapping
point of the second set and third, the players went eight games
without holding serve. With Williams going for every first serve,
she gave Hingis chances by making 61 percent. Although Hingis was
cautiously spinning in her first serve at 81 percent, it sat up in
the cross hairs for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to put a first serve in,'' Hingis said.
``It's going to be good enough usually, but not enough against
Venus today.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the sixth game of the third set, Venus Williams
stopped the trend and never looked back. In the end, Hingis
probably did the best she could do, and she still lost. A player
whose self-esteem was once impenetrable was left doused in
self-doubt. Over her last four Grand Slams, Hingis has lost to four
hard hitters: Serena Williams (U.S. Open), Lindsay Davenport
(Australian Open), Mary Pierce (French Open) and Venus Williams
Tuesday at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be enough just with my abilities I had at the
time,'' said Hingis. ``It has changed so much since the Williamses
started playing better. I guess as the No. 1, you're supposed to
win a Grand Slam. But now someone else probably deserves to be No.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one Williams sister can win a Wimbledon title this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this things boils down to is Venus and Serena,'' Richard
Williams said. ``Everyone else has to step aside.''

MARKETPLACE: GERMAN GIANT PLANS GLOBAL PHONE STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Ron Sommer, the chief executive of Deutsche
Telekom, has more than $100 billion to spend and wants to buy
something big in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with regulators in the United States and Europe vowing to
block WorldCom Inc.'s purchase of Sprint Corp., the dapper but
intense 50-year-old faces the biggest decision of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies fit better than Sprint into Sommer's dream of
transforming Deutsche Telekom from a big local player to a truly
global operator. Sprint's nationwide wireless network would
complete Telekom's European wireless operations, and its high-speed
Internet backbone network would shore up Telekom's ability to
deliver high-speed services on both sides of the Atlantic. At the
same time, few executives have been more outspoken in public about
their lust for making big acquisitions _ particularly in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Sommer has routinely described the United
States as a top priority and he recently boasted that he had a war
chest of more than $100 billion to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom executives also say the main reason they did not bid for
Sprint the last time around was their contractual agreement at the
time with France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Worldcom reached its agreement to buy Sprint,
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom had agreed not to increase
their existing 10 percent stakes in Sprint without the other's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement has since been abandoned by both sides, which
means that Deutsche Telekom is in theory free to make a bid for
Sprint. France Telecom, concentrating on its European operations,
has shown no interest in making a bid of its own for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But executives close to Deutsche Telekom caution that there are
a host of issues that could get in the way of a bid for Sprint. The
executives say Telekom has already sent indirect feelers to Sprint,
but has not made any decision about a bid and would not even
consider talks unless Worldcom and Sprint officially call off their
$119 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Telekom has also made new overtures to Qwest
Communications International, which operates high-speed fiber optic
networks and is now completing the purchase of US West Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer entered into talks with Qwest several months ago, but
abandoned the effort because of conflicts between Qwest and US
West. But Qwest apparently remains appealing to Sommer, and a deal
may be more feasible now that Qwest has fully acquired US West.
</P>
<P>
   Under its merger agreement with WorldCom, Sprint is prohibited
from entering talks with another company until the WorldCom merger
is officially called off by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives widely expect that to happen quite soon,
because the merger has been adamantly opposed by antitrust
officials at both the U.S. Justice Department and the European
Commission in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But one person close to Telekom cautioned Tuesday that Sprint
might still not be ready to discuss a new merger for some time to
come. Given the political sensitivities of a foreign company
acquiring a major American telecommunications carrier like Sprint,
moreover, Telekom executives are not about to consider a hostile or
unsolicited bid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Telekom executives have been rattled by anti-foreign
rumblings from Congress, where Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., has
petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to block foreign
companies from acquiring American telecommunication carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, once Germany's state-owned telephone monopoly,
is now a publicly listed corporation that faces intense competition
in every area except local telephone service. (The German
government still owns 57 percent of its stock.)
</P>
<P>
   Sommer has an enormous amount of capital at his disposal.
Telekom raised $14.5 billion in fresh cash last week from a global
bond offering that was carried out in dollars, euros and yen. That
comes on top of nearly $10 billion from a secondary stock offering
last year. Telekom has raised additional billions through the
initial public offering of its T-Online Internet subsidiary as well
as through the sale of several regional cable television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Telekom has approved the issuance of
billions of new shares, which can be used as currency to make
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no doubt that Telekom will make more than
$100 billion in acquisitions in the next 12 months,'' said one
industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Telekom also faces enormous capital outlays. It
will have to spend billions of dollars to acquire licenses for
``third-generation'' wireless services across Europe that cover
mobile phones that may be able to offer Web browsing and video
conferences. Following an auction for licenses in Britain earlier
this year, Telekom pledged to pay 4 billion pounds ($6.4 billion)
for a British wireless license _ not including the costs it will
assume for building a new network. Auctions in Germany, starting at
the end of this month, could yield even higher prices. And Telekom
appears intent on bidding in other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Sommer has signaled that he would pursue his
``international strategy'' even as he bids aggressively on new
European wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how he juggles his various goals remains to be seen.
Sommer is also mindful of the fact that his biggest international
expansion efforts have thus far been failures.
</P>
<P>
   His global alliance with France Telecom and Sprint, established
in the early 1990s, collapsed in bitter acrimony with his French
partners as all three companies found it impossible to chart a
coordinated strategy. His bid two years ago to merge with Telecom
Italia was rejected by the Italian company's shareholders. His bid
to acquire Qwest earlier this year was thwarted as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Sommer makes a big move on Sprint this time, people close to
him say, he wants it to succeed.

COLORADO COURT CLEARS WAY FOR REFERENDUM ON GUN SHOW CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ore., Fla.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Colorado Supreme Court has cleared the way for
voters to decide whether people who buy weapons at weekend gun
shows from private dealers must undergo the same criminal
background check that licensed dealers are required to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ballot measure is in the works in Oregon. If the
measures pass in November, the two states will become the first to
close the so-called gun show loophole. For now, the only state that
conducts background checks for private sales is Florida, where
state law gives counties the discretion to require them. Just a
handful do.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Colorado court's ruling, which was issued on Monday,
the effort to get a ballot initiative before voters in November had
stalled over challenges by several gun-owners' rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   But by dismissing the complaints, the court allowed proponents
to proceed with the collection of the required 62,438 valid
signatures by Aug. 7, the deadline. If that goal is reached _
sponsors say they have already collected 67,000 signatures _ voters
would have a chance to override the Republican-led state
Legislature, which this year defeated a package of gun control
measures that was supported by Gov. Bill Owens, a first-term
Republican. One bill provided for background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty confident about the outcome, but it would have
been very hurtful if the court had not ruled our way,'' said Tom
Mauser, political director for the group _ Sane Alternatives to the
Firearms Epidemic, known as SAFE _ that is sponsoring the ballot
initiative. ``It's a real relief to have this out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent independent polls _ three statewide and one in Colorado
Springs, a generally conservative city _ have shown overwhelming
support for the initiative, over 80 percent, despite an enduring
conflict nationally over background checks at weekend gun shows
between groups that favor tighter restrictions on gun ownership and
those that favor unfettered access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon measure, for which petition signatures are due on
Friday, also appears to enjoy strong public support, statewide
polls say.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed dealers are required by federal law to conduct the
checks, but it does not cover sales that typically take place at a
weekend gun show, people selling private collections or a single
gun that has been advertised. Efforts to eliminate the exceptions
have failed in Congress, as well as in several states, partly over
concerns that checks take as long as three days, and weekend gun
shows, where government surveys have found that a quarter of the
venders are not licensed, last only two.
</P>
<P>
   Gun rights advocates also object to any new restrictions on gun
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue has a particularly emotional resonance in Colorado
because of the mass killings 15 months ago at Columbine High School
in Littleton, where a dozen students and a teacher were fatally
shot and 23 others were wounded. All four weapons used by the
teen-age assailants, who also killed themselves, were purchased
through private sales at weekend gun shows, by intermediaries for
the teens.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the shootings, a bipartisan group of state
business and civic leaders formed SAFE to lobby the Legislature for
Owens' measures. Once they failed, the group turned to building
support for the ballot initiative. Mauser, who is on leave from his
job with the Colorado Department of Transportation, joined because
his son, Daniel, was one of the students killed at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Owens and Ken Salazar, the Colorado attorney general who is a
Democrat, were the first to sign the petition to get the initiative
on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Mauser and other proponents of the ballot initiative said they
anticipated at least one more hurdle before the initiative goes
before the voters, a signature challenge. The state conducts a
random check, but groups opposed to the measure, like the Colorado
Shooting Sports Association, an affiliate of the National Rifle
Association, are expected to mount their own investigation of the
signatures to ensure that they represent legally registered voters
in the state.

TEXT MESSAGES SENT BY CELL PHONES SWEEPS PHILIPPINES IN LATEST
DIGITAL TREND 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Muslim insurgents battling Philippine
troops in the south have a new weapon. When the shelling and
gunfire let up, they send a barrage of scathing insults to Manila's
forces by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a text war among the MILF and our forces,'' said
Brig. Gen. Eliseo Rio Jr., referring to the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, the larger of two rebel groups fighting for an independent
state. ``Our soldiers are texting insults to the MILF. And the MILF
are sending the insults back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Texting''? Yes, texting _ as in exchanging short typed
messages over a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Philippines, a verb has been born, and Filipinos
use it whether they are speaking English or Tagalog.
</P>
<P>
   Sending e-mail on mobile phones, has also taken off in richer
parts of the world: Europe, especially in Scandinavia, and in Japan
and other East Asian countries, particularly among teen-agers. But
in the Philippines, where incomes are far lower, it is even more
popular. And it has spawned an entire subculture, complete with its
own vocabulary, etiquette and tactical uses. It has become
particularly popular here, in large part because text messaging is
cheap while traditional telephone service is spotty and Internet
access by computer is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evolved into something similar to chatting on the
Internet,'' said Majidi John Bola, a 32-year-old company manager,
as he sat poking away at his mobile phone at a Starbucks in
Manila's business district.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that while chat-room denizens sit in
contemplative isolation, glued to computer screens, in the
Philippines the ``texters'' are right out in the throng. Malls are
infested with shoppers who appear to be navigating by cellular
compass. Groups of diners sit ignoring one another, staring down at
their phones as if fumbling with rosaries. Commuters, jaywalkers,
even mourners _ everyone in the Philippines seems to be texting
over the phone. Most use English, since messages usually can be
typed more quickly than in Tagalog.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Siytangco, a 23-year-old airline sales representative, was
not surprised when at the wake for a friend's father she saw people
bowing their heads and gazing toward folded hands. But when their
hands started beeping and their thumbs began to move, she realized
to her astonishment that they were not, in fact, praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were actually sitting there and texting,'' Siytangco
said. ``Filipinos don't see it as rude anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the practice puts the Philippines at the
forefront of wireless Internet usage, well ahead of much richer
countries. Already, people can use their phones to send text
messages to computers, and vice versa. Here as elsewhere, the
newest mobile phones have access to an abridged World Wide Web. And
not far away is new technology that is supposed to make browsing on
a hand phone as easy and as fast as it is on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   All this gives high-technology executives like Roy Buzon, an
American venture capitalist who is investing in local start-ups,
confidence that wireless technologies will help the Philippines
close the Internet usage gap with the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the new text message system so popular here? Many say it
is the high-technology Filipino equivalent of gesticulating _ body
language with an antenna. ``Filipinos are very gregarious _ we like
to talk a lot,'' said Rodolfo Salalima, a senior vice president at
Globe Telecom, the local cellular operator benefiting most from the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   They also love a good bargain. The craze for sending text
messages by phone started last year, when Globe introduced prepaid
cards that enabled students _ and soldiers _ too poor for a
long-term subscription to start using cellular phones, which can be
bought cheaply. Since talking on mobile phones costs 8 pesos a
minute, about 20 cents, and sending text messages from them was
free, people quickly figured out how to express themselves on a
phone's alphanumeric keypad.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Globe was handling 18 million messages a
day, roughly 26 per customer, more than all the messages sent in
Germany, France, Italy and Britain combined.
</P>
<P>
   After Globe's network ground to a halt a few times under the
load, it instituted a 1 peso-a-message charge to promote
``responsible'' use of text messaging. That cut the average
messages per customer in half, but the number of Globe customers
has doubled. Generation Text, as the media dubbed it, was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sending text messages does not require making a call. People
merely type in a message and the recipient's phone number, hit the
phone's send key and off it goes to the operator's message center,
which forwards it to the recipient. Because messages are exchanged
over the frequency the network uses to identify phones rather than
the frequencies their owners talk on, messages can be sent and
received the instant a phone is turned on _ and can even be
received when a phone call is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Sending text messages by phone is an irritating skill to master,
largely because 26 letters, plus punctuation, have to be created
with only 10 buttons. Typing the letter C, for example, requires
pressing the No. 2 button three times; an E is the No. 3 button
pressed twice; and so on. After the message is composed, it can be
sent immediately to the phone number of the recipient, who can
respond immediately by the same process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   People using phones for text messages have developed a shorthand
similar to that found in Internet chat rooms. ``Where are you?''
becomes ``WRU.'' And ``See you tonight'' becomes ``CU 2NYT.''
</P>
<P>
   People have different styles of keying in their messages. Some
use their index fingers, some one thumb, some both. Two thumbs is
the way to go for Rowena Bayangos, who sat outside a cafe recently
thumbing in an entire letter to a colleague from a draft she had
written out longhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go home or to an Internet cafe,'' she said.
``And I'm just spending a couple of pesos.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the truly sophisticated users, like 19-year-old
Tristan Sta. Ines, who sat recently outside a Subway sandwich shop,
a Marlboro Light cigarette dangling from his mouth and dark
sunglasses on his head, tapping away with one thumb without even
looking at his phone. ``I got used to it because I always text
while I'm driving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of sending text messages over talking becomes
obvious in a noisy bar or on Manila's noisy streets. But in
addition to conveying what cannot easily be heard, sending text
messages by phone is providing Filipinos with a way of conveying
what isn't easily said in Asia's only predominantly Catholic
nation. ``You can express yourself more freely,'' Bola said.
</P>
<P>
   Bola, for example, said he once asked a woman out on a date in a
text message over his phone. ``I was too shy to call her,'' he
said. There's flirtatious text messaging, text foreplay, text sex
and even text pornography. For some young lovers, text messages
over the phone are the first time they share those magic words, ``i
luv u.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Aguilar, a sociology professor at the University of
Santo Tomas, says such behavior is common. ``That's our culture,''
she said. ``We call this `hiya.' It means shy or ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Text messages over the phone are a high-technology veil,
protective yet provocative. The nonconfrontational nature of such
messages also makes them a hit in Indonesia, where politeness often
calls for ambiguity. The same goes for Japan, where NTT DoCoMo has
7.3 million customers using the Web on cell phones, sending an
average of five e-mail messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the messages Globe's customers send are appreciated. The
Philippine Department of Education finally had to ban the use of
mobile phones in grade schools to stop kids from cheating: they
were sending text answers to one another during exams. Police
complain that drivers busy typing in traffic are causing accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Some people busy themselves striking up exchanges with complete
strangers by guessing likely Globe subscriber numbers (the first
four numbers are all the same). And because pre-paid cards give
people a temporary telephone number that is not linked to a name or
billing address, they also confer an anonymity that can be abused.
People have been known to receive lewd messages and threats by
text.
</P>
<P>
   April Fool's Day rained tasteless text jokes. One said the Pope
had died, while another said President Joseph Estrada had. A
political joke followed combining the two, asking its readers to
pray the former was untrue and the latter was.
</P>
<P>
   Protests followed from the Presidential Palace and the church.
``Love of neighbor for the love of God is applicable even to
texters young and old alike,'' Archbishop Oscar Cruz wrote to a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes have not stopped, with current events offering new
grist. ``Muslim guerrillas have kidnapped Estrada,'' goes one of
the latest. ``They say that if they don't get a large ransom, they
will let him go free.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas may not have President Estrada, but they have a
direct line to his troops. Many soldiers eager to keep in touch
with their families while fighting in the southern island of
Mindanao took cell phones with them. To make sure they could get a
good signal, some brought two.
</P>
<P>
   With no regulations against carrying the phones into the field,
Gen. Rio said, cellular phones made their way to the front and, in
the heat of battle, turned up in enemy hands, complete with their
memory full of phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, the general said, before rebels started lobbing
text messages at soldiers. He declined to share any examples, but
said they tended to be ``childish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lighter side of this war,'' he said. ``But who knows,
maybe it's better that they fight by texting.''

   It is Idaho, more than any other state, that would bear the
brunt of a Clinton administration plan to bar future roadbuilding
across most remaining unroaded parts of the country's national
forest land. And while many here regard the plan as a gift to
future generations, in Idaho, with its tradition of stubborn
individualism, the plan is also being widely portrayed as a federal
assault on a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scum in Washington, D.C., are taking our freedom away from
us once again,'' Gaylen Hamilton, a logger and fifth-generation
Idahoan, said at a public meeting here last week where he and
scores of other timber workers voiced adamant opposition to the
Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   The session was among the last of more than 300 held by the
Forest Service around the country in the last 45 days to solicit
public comment about the proposal, and the anger reflected
opposition that could still emerge as an obstacle to the plan,
which President Clinton hopes will become part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we Pacific Northwesterners ought to tell them
Easterners to get the hell out of our area,'' said Larry Paulson, a
rancher in his 40s, at the session here last week. ``Clinton, Gore
and whoever else is managing things back there: Leave us alone!''
</P>
<P>
   The 9 million acres of roadless area in Idaho affected by the
proposal is the most of any state. Already, Idaho officials have
filed one suit against the proposal, and the state's congressional
delegation, including Sen. Larry Craig, a Republican, is trying to
push through legislation intended to postpone any rulemaking until
after Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to put the plan in place, the administration has
elected to bypass Congress, a tactic that has been loudly condemned
by many Western Republicans, including Idaho's governor, Dirk
Kempthorne. ``It's this kind of unilateral land-management decision
by the federal government that further deepens the mistrust and
skepticism that comes naturally to those of us in the West,''
Kempthorne wrote recently in a commentary in The Idaho Statesman,
the state's largest newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which Clinton announced last fall and the Forest
Service released in draft form in April, would put 43 million acres
of national forest land off limits to future roadbuilding, as a
step to protect them from development. That would comprise nearly
one-fourth of the entire forest system, including most of the land
not already crisscrossed by 386,000 miles of road built by the
Forest Service, usually to facilitate logging.
</P>
<P>
   With strong support from environmental groups, Vice President Al
Gore has said that he would go even further, by extending the ban
to include roadless areas of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,
the nation's largest, and by explicitly banning logging in all
areas deemed off limits to roads.
</P>
<P>
   At most public meetings across the country, according to Forest
Service officials and news accounts, supporters of that kind of
far-reaching measure have usually outnumbered opponents, and they
have made their presence felt with demonstrations like a
horn-honking parade in Pittsburgh's Market Square.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Mountain West, and Idaho in particular, the picture
is more complicated. Advocates of a roadbuilding ban have clashed
with loggers, state officials, advocates of off-road vehicles and
others who contend that a halt to new roads would squander a vital
resource.
</P>
<P>
   One hearing, in Missoula, Mont., near Idaho's eastern border,
attracted some 2,000 people, and included testimony so raucous that
an account on the Forest Service's own Web site bore the headline:
``Roadless Rage.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people showed up at the Nampa Civic Center on Thursday
night, including Cathy Nuxholl, a 43-year-old teacher and hiker
from Boise who argued that there was no need to build any more
roads. The Forest Service already maintains 30,000 miles of roads
in Idaho alone, she noted, pleading for the remaining roadless
areas to be protected as ``islands in a sea of human activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But such views were all but drowned out by the loggers, many of
whom had been bused to the event by Boise-Cascade, the largest
timber company in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't log it and you don't maintain it, it's going to
be destroyed,'' said Melvin Crabb, a third-generation timber
worker, echoing an industry argument about the danger of fire on
unlogged land. ``To take this away from me is to take it from the
fourth generation, my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in tiny Idaho timber towns like Orofino on the fringes
of the giant Clearwater National Forest in west-central Idaho,
where Konkolville Lumber Co. owns the mill, a steakhouse and motel,
it is almost impossible to find anyone who favors the roadbuilding
ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the use of having a natural area if you can't get to
it?'' asked Jerry Philpot, 59, as he sipped a late-afternoon beer
in the company-owned bar. A lifelong logger, Philpot said that
roads were vital not only to his livelihood, but also to his
recreation, as the routes to hunting and fishing.

</P>
<P>
   A scaling back in federal timber sales have forced deep cuts in
logging on federal land in Idaho and across the Northwest during
the last 10 years. Even so, Boise Cascade still relies on national
forests for half its harvest, and timber executives like Donald J.
Konkol, Konkolville's president, said they had been hoping that new
sales would be approved, including some which would have required
the construction of roads on what are now roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole future is at stake,'' Konkol said after testifying
last week at a hearing in the Orofino High School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike congressionally designated wilderness areas, where
logging, road construction and even off-road vehicle activity is
banned, roadless areas of the national forests have long been open
to a wide range of activities, subject to decisions by local forest
managers.
</P>
<P>
   An inventory by the Idaho Conservation League, released in
September, found that 95 logging projects in roadless areas were on
the planning books in the state's national forests. The projects
planned for the next five years would lead to the development of
another 70,000 acres of roadless forest, the organization reported,
adding to 1.1 million acres of forest in the state developed by
logging and road construction in the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if the Clinton plan is approved, according to
Forest Service estimates, annual timber sales from national forest
lands in Idaho could decline as much as 20 percent from current
levels, and could result in the loss of as many as 180 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho officials say the damage would be far greater, depriving
the state of at least $163 million in timber revenue in the next 30
years that would have been set aside for spending on roads and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service hearings, which began on May 17, were the
most extensive ever held by a Federal agency to solicit comment
about a proposed change in government rules; 30 meetings were held
in Idaho alone. A main reason for that approach, Clinton
administration officials have said, was to insulate the
decision-making process from legal or congressional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The public-comment period ends on July 17. After reviewing an
estimated 1 million letters and electronic-mail messages, the
Forest Service is planning to issue its final decision before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations on Thursday, opponents of the plan have said
they were glad to have a chance to shout but doubted that their
voices would be heard. And in this overwhelmingly Republican state,
few made much secret of their disdain for the current
administration.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, Roger Lord, complained that the proposal had been
drafted ``in a dark room of the White House'' by ``incredibly
arrogant and power-corrupted politicians and equally arrogant
environmental elites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to spit into the wind,'' Lord said.

TREATMENT OF SOME ALZHEIMER PATIENTS INVOLVES NEEDLESS PAIN, STUDY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   People with advanced Alzheimer's disease who are hospitalized
for a broken hip or pneumonia are often subjected to needless,
painful medical procedures and not given enough pain medication,
doctors are reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with aggressive treatment, these patients have a high
probability of dying within six months, making it more important to
keep them comfortable rather than trying to cure their infections
or injuries, according to Dr. R. Sean Morrison and Dr. Albert L.
Siu, of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Their
report is being published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Their study involved 216 patients who were treated for broken
hips or pneumonia at Mount Sinai Hospital from September 1996 to
March 1998. Of the 216 patients, 98 suffered advanced dementia; the
rest did not have any form of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   On average, people live 10 years after a diagnosis of dementia.
The condition is considered advanced when patients have trouble
communicating and identifying relatives, and can no longer eat,
dress, bathe or get out of bed by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and Siu found that compared with the patients who were
mentally intact, those who had severe dementia were far more likely
to die within six months of pneumonia or a hip fracture, even with
equal medical care. Only 12 to 13 percent of the patients without
dementia died within six months, compared with 53 to 55 percent of
those with advanced dementia. But the patients with dementia
underwent as many painful and invasive procedures as the other
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people with a terminal diagnosis,'' said Morrison,
an assistant professor of geriatrics and a specialist in palliative
care, which is treatment meant to control pain and other forms of
discomfort. ``But physicians and families focus on the acute
illness and ignore that this is occurring in the setting of a
terminal illness with an average survival of six months.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, he said, the best treatment may be to maximize
pain control and minimize repeated blood tests and the insertion of
intravenous lines and urinary catheters, which are painful and
frightening to demented patients. Some patients with severe
dementia may even be better off without surgery to repair a broken
hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the patient didn't walk and is not going to walk again, it
may be appropriate just to have analgesics and keep comfortable,''
Morrison said. ``We can provide them with good pain medication and
get them out of the hospital and back to the living environment at
home or in a nursing home where they feel safe and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison and Siu found that the patients with dementia did
not receive good pain control. They were given less than half as
much pain medication as the patients without dementia, even though
they probably needed at least as much. Morrison said the difference
may have occurred because patients with dementia cannot ask for
pain medicine, and doctors and nurses may not realize that they are
suffering. Such patients should be given ``standing orders'' for
pain medicine, he said, meaning that the drugs are given
automatically whether or not the patient requests them. Only 24
percent of the patients with dementia, however, had standing orders
in their charts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Ladislav Volicer, an expert on dementia and the director of
geriatric research at the E.N. Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in
Bedford, Mass., said the best solution to the problems described by
Morrison may be to keep patients with dementia out of acute-care
hospitals and let them stay in their homes or nursing homes, even
with a broken hip or pneumonia. Hospitals are geared toward
providing aggressive treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volicer said that at the Veterans Hospital dementia unit, which
provides long-term care, some patients had broken hips but did not
have surgery, and were kept comfortable with morphine. He also said
that most patients with pneumonia were not sent to the hospital,
and many did not receive antibiotics, which studies have shown do
not prolong life in people with advanced dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen McConnell, a spokesman for the Alzheimer's
Association, said Morrison's recommendations for better palliative
care were consistent with those of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that people get good care, but the definition
of that care may be different in the late stages of the disease,''
McConnell said. ``People with advanced dementia are near death.
Good palliative care is probably going to be much more important
than the standard medical treatments designed to fix people.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he began the study after noticing that after a few
days in the hospital, patients with dementia would flinch and
shrink away from anyone who touched them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' he asked. ``Every human touch is associated with pain
or discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said that because patients with dementia cannot
understand what is being done to them, they may perceive even a
blood test as an assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't communicate and no one can communicate with you,''
he said. ``Somebody comes in and grabs your arm, this painful
needle goes into you and you know no reason for it. It's just to
make sure the numbers are right. For a terminal illness, that may
not be an appropriate goal of care.''

<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ If any old master exudes a singular
detachment from the world, both this one and the next, surely it is
Vermeer: not for him were great tableaus inspired by the Bible or
Greek mythology, or portraits of monarchs or emperors, or even oils
of the powerful Dutch burghers of his day. Rather, to judge by his
30 or so surviving paintings, Vermeer preferred to express his
fascination with color and light in domestic scenes of
extraordinary intimacy, with at most a letter, being read or
written, suggesting a world beyond the window.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it would take a mighty dose of imagination to
turn Johannes Vermeer into the stuff of dramatic opera.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Greenaway, the experimental British movie director, and
Louis Andriessen, the Minimalist Dutch composer, have taken up the
challenge. Focusing on two weeks in May 1672 when Vermeer made a
rare trip away from his home in Delft to The Hague, they surmise
that he was kept abreast of family news by letters from his wife,
mother-in-law and model. They also presume that, while in The
Hague, he sensed the crisis gripping the Dutch Republic as it
prepared to breach the country's dikes to hold off invasion by
France. By confronting Vermeer's domestic tranquility with the
turbulence of his times, then, Greenaway and Andriessen found
something to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting 100-minute opera, ``Writing to Vermeer,'' first
presented by De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam's Muziektheater in
December, will have its American premiere at the New York State
Theater on Tuesday when it opens Lincoln Center Festival 2000. The
festival, now in its fifth year, will be offering 108 performances
of 29 different musical, theatrical, dance and other events through
July 30, including three additional performances of ``Writing to
Vermeer'' on July 13, 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A separate program, Peter Greenaway on Screen, is also showing a
handful of the director's best-known movies, including ``The Cook,
the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' through Wednesday at Makor on
West 67th Street.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The new opera, which might be called a work for music, screen
and water, is above all a feast for the eyes, no novelty perhaps
for Greenaway, whose recent movies include such visual fantasies as
``Prospero's Books,'' ``The Pillow Book'' and ``8{ Women.'' I 1994,
in his first operatic collaboration with Andriessen, ``Rosa: A
Horse Drama'' (renamed ``Rosa: The Death of a Composer'' in a
recent recording released by Nonesuch Records), Greenaway concocted
an equally bizarre stage-and-screen spectacle around the story of a
composer of music for Westerns who falls in love with his horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing to Vermeer,'' which was generally well received by
Dutch and other European critics, also began with a visual
inspiration, specifically when Greenaway, known for his fascination
with the 17th century, visited the Vermeer retrospective in The
Hague in 1996. Once again intrigued by the beguiling and timeless
mood of the paintings, he came up with the idea for a musical stage
work built around 18 fictional letters _ six from each of the women
in the artist's life _ sent to Vermeer during his brief absence
from home, a work initially conceived as ``an opera without
drama,'' a chamber piece on the same scale as the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then suggested that it might be possible to make the piece
more large-scale while still retaining a sense of intimacy,''
Andriessen, 61, explained in the production's program notes. ``We
could provide `windows' that break into the domesticity and
serenity of Vermeer's home life and thus allow the viewer to see
what was really going on in the world at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dutch, at least, 1672 was a tumultuous year. A century
of prosperity had enabled the United Provinces, as the Dutch
republic was then known, to shake off Spanish rule and emerge as an
international naval and trading power. But the republic's elder
statesman, Johan de Witt, and his brother, Cornelius, had just been
lynched by a mob in The Hague for trying to negotiate peace with
the French invaders. If the breaching of the dikes seemed like a
military stroke of genius, it brought on economic disaster. For
many historians, 1672 marked the end of the Dutch Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   To add still more drama, the opera uses large screens, placed
behind and at times on the stage, to remind viewers of traumatic
moments from earlier years, notably the crash of the speculative
tulip market, the gunpowder explosion that destroyed a good part of
Delft and religious riots in many Dutch cities. Just as the
``windows'' bring in a world far more disturbing than anything that
the painter chose to record, the staging and music of ``Writing to
Vermeer'' provide the drama absent in the libretto.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway's fascination with blood, apparent in ``Rosa: A Horse
Drama'' and its grisly abattoir scenes, now leads him to cover
performers with the blood of the De Witt brothers. Saskia Boddeke,
who directed the production with Greenaway and did much of the
actual staging, in turn displays a typical Dutch interest in water
and dikes: she places the sloping stage above a pool of water,
water runs down the stage and it also buckets down from above.
</P>
<P>
   There are more domestic liquids, too: the ink of the letters to
Vermeer (they frequently appear on screen as they are being
written); the varnish accidentally drunk by one of Vermeer's 10
children; and the milk poured by a kitchen maid in a momentary
tableau vivant of ``The Milkmaid,'' one of Vermeer's most loved
paintings (and naturally, many of the costumes designed by Emi Wada
that also mirror Vermeer oils). Put differently, a lot of visual
distraction is cooked up onstage.
</P>
<P>
   As in Amsterdam, Catherina Bolnes, Vermeer's doting wife, will
be sung in New York by Susan Narucki; Maria Thins, his
mother-in-law, by Susan Bickley; and Saskia de Vries, his model, by
Barbara Hannigan. The Asko and Schoenberg Ensembles, two Dutch
contemporary music groups, will be conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw,
himself chief conductor of the Schoenberg Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto, written in English and presented in New York with
English supertitles, is divided into six scenes (without
intermission) and comprises nothing more than the six letters sung
by each of the three soprano leads, along with a few asides by two
children onstage and a six-woman chorus in the orchestra pit. No
male voices are heard and Vermeer himself replies to none of the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, chatty in tone, offer news, gossip and loving doses
of nostalgia for the absent painter. The biggest development is
perhaps word that Saskia (herself a character invented by
Greenaway) has been summoned home by her father, who wants to see
her married, so her letters are sent from Dordrecht. Writing from
Delft, Catherina jokes saucily about Saskia's ``kissable lips''
(``And I know you have thought the same''), but also reports with
alarm that ``Cornelia has swallowed varnish.'' Maria, Vermeer's
mother-in-law, flirts and flatters (``You see, no sooner you are
away than we want you back'').
</P>
<P>
   With images of familiar Vermeer paintings appearing on screens,
the letters also include such pointed references to Vermeer the
artist as: ``The way you narrow your eyes when you stare so hard
into the light'' (Catherina) and ``You paint us all writing so
often _ we get into the habit and cannot stop'' (Maria) and ``I sit
here in the sunlight from the window'' (Saskia).
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters have been conceived to infer the possibility of a
supposed domestic idyll,'' Greenaway writes in the program. ``In
the later Vermeers, from the evidence of the paintings to be used
in the opera, the women sit and talk, play music, weigh pearls, try
on a pearly necklace, pour milk, crochet lace, write and read
letters. They are treated with dignity. There is no adverse
critical perspective, no attempt to sexually objectify the women,
no attempt to titillate the women for the male gaze.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the central trio of women, Boddeke has added a dozen more,
both to people the stage and to respond as a choreographic ensemble
to the disturbing news reaching the household. More puzzlingly, she
has also created three versions of Catherina, Maria and Saskia, all
dressed alike, although only one of each sings. But since all the
singers wear hidden head-microphones, the result is that the
audience cannot always identify which character is actually singing
on a crowded stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my idea,'' Andriessen said, ``and I don't really
like it. But Saskia wanted to have the singers running around the
stage, so you needed the head mikes. It also made it easier to
integrate the pre-recorded music.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriessen has incorporated excerpts of electronic music
composed and prerecorded by Michael van der Aa to symbolize moments
when the real world disrupts the ``domestic idyll.'' While
Stravinskian undertones typical of Andriessen's work often surface,
his own score for ``Writing to Vermeer'' is also full of conscious
references to other composers: he said he borrowed some musical
structures from John Cage's ``Six Melodies'' for violin and piano
and his ``Sixteen Dances'' and he adopted some melodies from a work
by the 17th-century Dutch composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck.
</P>
<P>
   There are also hidden influences. ``Although I do not think it
is audibly perceptible from the music,'' Andriessen said, ``I did
often think about Ravel when I was writing this opera. He is the
best example if you are striving to dress simple ideas in a
beautiful and refined way. But by far the most important motivation
for writing the music in the way I did was my love for Vermeer's
paintings. That is what it is all about, and _ if you do your very
best _ then perhaps you can succeed in creating something, albeit
an approximation, that is just as beautiful as the paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no doubt frustratingly for Andriessen, critical reaction to
``Writing to Vermeer'' to date has tended to depend on whether the
reviewer loves or hates Greenaway's work. Just as Greenaway's
movies provoke sharply contradictory responses, the opera drew
sharp criticism from some European critics, notably Andrew Clark of
The Financial Times of London, who complained about ``voices
disembodied by amplification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that,'' he wrote, ``Greenaway can't resist
illustrating every line of text with repetitive film footage and
choreographic routines, all thrown together in a sprawling jumble.
There's no sense of individual character, no development from one
scene to the next. What `Writing to Vermeer' amounts to is a very
expensive and very tedious charade.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dutch newspaper critics did single out Andriessen's
``tender and quite lyrical music,'' as Erik Voermans put it in
Parool. In general, they also praised the production, with Kasper
Jansen in NRC Handelsblad speaking of its ``extraordinarily
beautiful and occasional images of old Dutch life.'' Roland DeBeer,
in Volkskrant, described the music as ``masterful'' but noted that
``for spectators without a diploma in art history, it was hard to
identify all the various characters as they danced, sat down, read
and wrote, hunted around, blew out candles and played the
harpsichord.''
</P>
<P>
   For some British critics, everything seemed quite perfect.
``Greenaway creates continuous magic on the operatic stage,''
Adrian Mourby wrote in The Independent of London. In The Guardian,
Andrew Clements, who loved ``Rosa: A Horse Drama,'' considered the
new opera ``a far more substantial achievement.'' He added: ``What
is most impressive is the perfect integration of all the elements
in the work: how Greenaway has been able to carry over so much of
his cinematic technique into his stage pictures; how Andriessen's
music fleshes out the characterizations; and how everything is
superbly realized in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is to throw light, albeit speculative light, on the
mysterious figure of Vermeer. From his paintings, it is hard to get
a sense of the man, yet here he is brought to life by the women who
knew and loved him. There is no social or political reference in
his work, yet this opera argues persuasively that he painted his
``domestic idylls'' as a response to agitated times. In fact, in
the end, he does not have to appear onstage: he is ever present
anyway. &QL;

A LESSON IN TIME TRIALS SPANISH TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. NAZAIRE, France _ The ONCE team from Spain gave a classic
illustration Tuesday of how to ride a team time trial, winning by
45 seconds, finishing with all nine of its men together at the same
time and placing two of them atop the new standings in the Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   But ONCE also offered too obvious a picture of how to shield a
rider illegally from the wind. Because the team car blatantly rode
beside a rider, Marcos Serrano, offering him protection and a
forward draft when the Spaniard began to fall behind on a windy
uphill on a long bridge, all its riders were penalized 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise smoothly rotating riders at the head of its single
file, ONCE powered to victory over the 70-kilometer (43-mile) flat
course from Nantes to the shipbuilding center of St. Nazaire in
western France in 1 hour 25 minutes 35 seconds. Second was the U.S.
Postal Service team, 46 seconds behind before the penalty, with
Telekom from Germany third, 40 more seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that the new man in the overall leader's yellow
jersey is Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman who long reigned as No. 1
among the world's top 800 professional racers, but who has never
finished higher than fourth in previous Tours because of his
weakness in the highest mountains. Jalabert will most likely
continue to wear the jersey at least until the first of those
mountains, the Hautacam climb in the Pyrenees, is reached on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Second overall is his teammate David Canada, a Spaniard, 12
seconds behind, with Lance Armstrong, an American and the defending
Tour champion, third, 24 seconds behind. Abraham Olano, a Spaniard
with ONCE, is fourth, 35 seconds behind, and Slava Yekimov, a
Russian with Postal Service, is fifth, 43 seconds behind. Five
other ONCE riders rank in the first 11 since the entire team
received the time of its fifth man across the line.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first team time trial in the Tour since 1995. The
race against the clock, in which teams set out five minutes apart,
was dropped because it penalizes strong riders with weak teams and
those teams that have lost riders because of crashes in the early,
nervous days. There were no such casualties this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cofidis team from France finished seventh among the 20
entries, costing David Millar, a Scot, the yellow jersey he won
when the Tour began its three-week journey last Saturday. Tuesday
morning, Millar was guarded about his chances to remain the leader,
especially since his team had worked hard the past two days to
chase breakaways and protect his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode the course a couple of months ago to check it out,''
Millar said. There's a lot of headwind because of the prevailing
wind off the nearby Atlantic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've got winds like that all the way, it's going to be
fairly harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. Millar is now in 24th place, 2:27 behind Jalabert, whom
he led by 6 seconds when the teams set out.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also cited the wind as a big factor when he said a few
days ago: ``It's point to point, so if there's headwind, it'll be
there all the way. If it was start to finish in the same place, at
least part of the way you'd have tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's Postal Service team finished with only six of its
nine starters together, a perilous situation since the time of the
fifth man across counts for himself and anybody ahead of him. Johan
Bruyneel, the team's directeur sportif, or coach, said Armstrong
had gone too hard as the team approached the 4-kilometer-long
(2.5-mile-long) St. Nazaire bridge over the Loire River estuary
with the gray Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Three riders were unable to keep pace and dropped far behind
with a dozen kilometers (7.5 miles) to go. A fourth, Tyler
Hamilton, an American, managed to hang on through great courage and
willpower.
</P>
<P>
   A bull throughout the stage, Armstrong remained bullish about at
least part of the outcome. ``All is not lost,'' he said. ``The Tour
de France won't be decided by the team time trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's important that I picked up some more time on the
climbers and on Ullrich,'' he added, referring to Jan Ullrich, the
Telekom leader and the winner of the 1997 Tour. He appears to be
the rival the American most fears. &QL;

   PHILIPPINES-TEXTING (Manila, Philippines) _ Muslim insurgents
battling Philippine troops in the south have a new weapon. When the
shelling and gunfire let up, they send a barrage of scathing
insults to Manila's forces by cell phone. ``There is a text war
among the MILF and our forces,'' said Brig. Gen. Eliseo Rio Jr.,
referring to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the larger of two
rebel groups fighting for an independent state. ``Our soldiers are
texting insults to the MILF. And the MILF are sending the insults
back.'' ``Texting''? Yes, texting _ as in exchanging short typed

been born, and Filipinos use it whether they are speaking English

REFORMERS SCALE BACK AMBITIONS AFTER CRACK DOWN BY HARDLINERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ _ With most of their newspapers silenced and many
of their activists jailed by hardline courts, Iran's reformers have
scaled back their once-defiant agenda for change and are
concentrating on regaining a public voice through their control of
the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the vast high-ceilinged chamber where the lawmakers meet,
there is a sense of reduced expectations. It is a mood far
different from the euphoria that followed their sweeping victory in
the first round of parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the reformers pledged that they would soon make good on
all the vague promises of democracy and freedom that were made by
their hero, President Mohammad Khatami, when he was elected in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But their ambitions were visibly trimmed by a hardline backlash
_ the press crackdown, the detention of pro-democracy activists,
the voiding of more than a dozen races won by pro-Khatami
candidates and a three-month delay in certifying the election
results for many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have huge demands and expectations from this parliament
and government,'' acknowledged Mohammad Reza Tabesh, a newly
elected lawmaker from the reform movement and a nephew of Khatami,
in a recent conversation. ``It's almost too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paraphrased a Persian proverb to describe the Khatami
camp's operative strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who moves forward,'' Tabesh said, ``is not the one who
moves fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The new parliament _ Iran's sixth since the 1979 revolution,
which replaced the monarchy with a theocratic regime _ began work
on May 30. It has spent much of the time since organizing its
leadership and committee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Only 268 members have taken up their posts. The results of
elections for the remaining 22 seats in the 290-member body are
still being disputed by the hardline Council of Guardians, the
group that vets candidates, certifies elections and can block any
legislation that it deems offensive or contradictory to its
interpretation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hardline opposition controls only about 30 percent
of the parliament seats already decided, the cautious reform
majority has so far tried to postpone their inevitable head-on
collision.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, they elected a compromise figure, Mehdi Karroubi, a
turbaned cleric who ran on a pro-Khatami ticket but is also a
former hard-liner and past parliament leader. Karroubi has been
busy in the past few weeks shuttling from meetings with pro-reform
groups to get-togethers with hard-line religious leaders in Qom and
in the Council of Guardians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factions have to learn how to cooperate with each other _
and they will learn,'' said Abbas Salimi Namin, managing director
of the hardline Tehran Times daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's politicians, he added, are still new at competing as
pragmatic political adversaries and not as arch-enemies bent on
destroying one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much experience in this,'' said Namin. ``The
role of parties _ how they should be controlled, how they should
work with each other _ it's not very clear to us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the reformers try to build bridges, they also have toned down
their language on the more divisive social changes they once
championed, like lifting the ban on satellite television dishes and
limiting the intrusive power of the country's quasi-official morals
squads and hard-line courts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have said they will concentrate on reviving the
once lively national press, streamlining government ministries,
passing a national budget and devising legislation to encourage the
formation of political parties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Their first and main priority, they said, is to strip the
country's press law of restrictive amendments, added by hard-liners
in the last parliament, so reformers can defend themselves from
political attack.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tough press law, hardline judges have closed 20
reformist newspapers and magazines since the elections, leaving
mostly right-wing publications and the state television channels,
which regularly condemn the reform movement as un-Islamic and an
agent of U.S. imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The muting effect was demonstrated just last week, when a reform
member of parliament rose from his red leather seat and began to
denounce the state television operation as the ``mouthpiece'' of
only one political faction.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds into his speech, the television screens in the
chamber went dark as cameramen from the government broadcasting
company shut off their equipment. The lawmaker's comments slipped
into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed press law, which would effectively return Iran to
the regulations in force earlier this year, is energetically backed
by Khatami's government. But it is one of only a few pieces of
legislation that the administration has put forward for
consideration by the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's aides have spoken of the need to
depoliticize the court system and ensure that judges act according
to the law, they say he is not likely to offer any sweeping reforms
that might provoke a dangerous showdown with hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But their prudence is unlikely to avert clashes with the
hardliners. The Council of Guardians, for example, can cancel any
new reform legislation it does not like. The parliament can appeal
such decisions, but only to another potentially unfriendly body
called the Expediency Council. It is led by former President Ali
Akbar Rafsanjani, who has denounced the reformers as threats to the
Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the guardian council to approve of all the
laws we send them,'' said Ali Reza Nouri, a leading reform lawmaker
and the younger brother of a well-known cleric jailed by the
hardliners for his writings. ``We're not going to commit suicide,
but we won't stop passing new laws just because the guardian
council won't accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some reformers are reluctant to engage in full-scale
battle with the hardliners who control the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation of students at our religious seminaries
is quite advanced and progressive, but most of the older
generation, like those on the guardian council, have traditional
views,'' said Mohammad Taghi Fazel Meibodi, a reformist cleric who
is a close friend of Khatami's. ``This is a problem the government
is faced with. But the council should be respected because it's a
legal institution.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of hard-liners, including some in parliament and some
on the Council of Guardians, have already signaled that they will
fight the new press law. They have also said the parliament should
deal with the ailing economy rather than issues of political and
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Reform activists, who are badly split among themselves on
whether to pursue a state-controlled or free-market economy, said
they will try to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, economic issues are important and, separately, we
have to find solutions to the problems of inflation and
unemployment among our youth,'' said Jamileh Kadivar, a reformer
elected from Tehran. ``But to solve the economic problems, we must
create a stable and secure state in order to attract foreign
investment that would in turn create jobs.''

ZIMBABWE'S ECONOMIC WOES EXPECTED TO GET WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Just days after Zimbabwe's fledgling
opposition party splashed into Parliament, its jobless supporters
were still digging for dreams.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of gold hidden beneath the red soil on a deserted
farm here. And one recent morning, desperate men and women were
clawing into the earth, hunting for the glimmers that might buy a
bag of rice or a pair of secondhand shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is hopeless, backbreaking work, and the diggers pray that
their new representatives in Parliament will help ease
unemployment, which stands at nearly 50 percent, so they can find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking our lives will change now,'' said Francisca
Makumbe, 32, as she hauled a sack of the red earth to the river for
panning. ``There is no future in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the strong showing of the opposition in the
parliamentary election last week has heightened expectations among
the urban poor, economists predict that the coming months will only
bring more hardship to a country already staggering through its
worst economic crisis since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study, the U.N. Development Program reported that the
number of people living in poverty in Zimbabwe surged from 40
percent to 75 percent in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on health and education has dipped so
sharply that schools routinely run short of textbooks, hospitals go
without medicines and the sick are increasingly turning to
traditional medicine and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that the worst is yet to come. While neighboring
countries in southern Africa this year are expected to enjoy their
highest growth rates since 1996, Zimbabwe's economy is expected to
shrink, perhaps as much as 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which won 57 seats in the 150-member Parliament,
lacks a majority and control over the government's fiscal policy,
which has been characterized by chronic budget overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and business executives say economic recovery will
depend largely on foreign investment and financing from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But in a ranking of the
economic prospects of African countries issued last month by the
World Economic Forum, Zimbabwe placed next to last, dimming most
hopes for private investment.
</P>
<P>
   With President Robert Mugabe vowing to reinstate price controls
and to seize white-owned farms without compensation, there is
little chance that Western donors will rush to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   And so in an abandoned field of tall grass and white
butterflies, the prospectors here will likely cling to their dreams
and dig for gold while their children go to sleep hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of parliamentary debate, the coming of the opposition
is positive, but the power they have is limited,'' said James Jowa,
the research economist at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce. ``Things are getting worse and worse. We need urgent
rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors have already suspended most expansion plans. And
officials say the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
which cut off financing last year after the government
underreported the cost of its role in the war in Congo, want to see
signs of fiscal discipline before offering aid.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks donors will be watching to see how Mugabe
realigns his Cabinet, manages his budget and handles land
redistribution. They will be looking for significant changes,
particularly in fiscal management, in which the government's track
record has been dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which budgeted a one-third salary increase for
civil servants this year, has actually increased salaries by nearly
65 percent, according to an economic analysis conducted by Standard
Chartered Bank here. And the budget deficit, expected to total 3.8
percent of the gross domestic product, is now expected to soar to
12 percent by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the regime is dead,'' said one Western
official familiar with the negotiations between Western aid donors
and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any money flowing unless Mugabe
changes his ways,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The donors cannot go to their boards with a program
based on promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling economy has also been hurt by external factors
like the falling prices of tobacco and gold in recent years, two
droughts and a so-called structural adjustment program that was
applauded by the West but plunged many more people into poverty
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Under such programs, international lending organizations demand
that countries living beyond their means reduce spending on public
projects and cut subsidies that often keep the cost of living down.
``We all underestimated the social impact of the program,'' said a
Western economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``And when
we recognized it, we didn't get our act together quickly enough to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Mugabe's party, who still control the Cabinet and
Parliament, say they are keenly aware that they must address the
economic crisis. But the Cabinet is split between those who want to
move toward a socialist, managed economy and those who embrace the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt of the sense of urgency. Inflation stands
at about 50 percent and is expected to soar. For many of the
diggers here, meat and shoes without holes have become unimaginable
luxuries.

FRENCH START INQUIRY INTO U.S. SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS NOTE: This story was inadvertently repeated; no changes from
previous filing.)   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French prosecutor has begun a preliminary
investigation into whether the American global surveillance system,
which listens in on millions of telephone calls, faxes and e-mails
each day, is a threat to French well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, has ordered the French
counterintelligence agency, called DST, to appraise the actions of
the system, named Echelon. The system links computers in at least
seven sites around the world to receive, analyze and sort
information captured from satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   If the French agency finds the system ``harmful to the vital
interests of the nation,'' legal proceedings could begin, though it
is difficult to see how an American government agency could be sued
in a French court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue is taken very seriously in Europe. Many fear
that America's vast surveillance system, developed in the Cold War,
is being used to further America's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have repeatedly denied that. But the issue
continues to arouse passions here. That is particularly true in
France, where even Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou contended in
February that Cold War spy systems had been converted to ``economic
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the European Parliament held hearings on the subject,
leading to an emotional debate. A report commissioned by the
Parliament and written by a British journalist said there was
evidence that the Echelon system had twice helped American
companies gain an advantage over Europeans, though few details were
provided. Some members of the Parliament expressed skepticism over
the 18-page report. But others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is deciding whether to create a commission to
continue its Echelon investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Dintilhac, Marie-Annick Darmaillac, said the
prosecutor had decided to begin his own investigation after
receiving a letter from a member of the European Parliament who is
a former French judge, Thierry Jean-Pierre. Darmaillac said the
letter had contained enough information for the prosecutor to feel
an investigation was warranted. But she said she could not discuss
what steps might be taken next as it was up to the prosecutor to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   In Strasbourg, Jean-Pierre told Agence France-Press that he
believes that either the Echelon system should be dismantled or
Europe should have a hand in governing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echelon is used by the National Security Agency for strategic
and economic gains,'' Jean-Pierre said. ``You cannot make me
believe that the information is not passed on to American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that many Europeans are particularly galled that the
British are partners of the United States in the Echelon system.
</P>
<P>
   Recently declassified information shows that Echelon is a
network of surveillance stations stitched together in the 1970s by
the United States with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.
The system listens and watches for key words on a topic requested
by a country. Some experts have said that the most extravagant
claims against the Echelon system make little sense, because the
National Security Agency is overwhelmed by the proliferation of
information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that France operates its own surveillance
system, which some have dubbed ``Frenchelon,'' though it is
believed to be much smaller than the American system. However, it
is thought to do much the same thing, eavesdropping on private and
public communications.

TEACHER SALARIES STILL LAG, SURVEY FINDS

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Beginning and average teacher salaries rose more
than 3 percent last year, but they still fall short of earnings by
other college-educated workers and, adjusted for inflation, remain
below teacher salaries from 1972, according to a survey released
Tuesday by the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual paycheck for first-year teachers in 1998-99
was $26,639, while teachers with an average of 16.2 years on the
job earned $40,574, the survey showed. New Jersey, Connecticut and
New York led the nation for average teacher pay, around $50,000,
while Oklahoma, Mississippi and the Dakotas had the lowest average
salaries, below $30,000. Among cities with more than 100,000
residents, Yonkers, N.Y., had the highest starting salary for
teachers, at $37,045.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly, I think, a national emergency,'' said Sandra
Feldman, the president of the teachers federation, at the union's
biennial convention. ``We have to ask ourselves, what are our
priorities here as a nation?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the union has been conducting the salary survey for a
half century, this year's release comes amid an intense national
debate over how teachers should be compensated. Facing a national
shortage of some 2.5 million teachers over the next decade, school
administrators and state legislators have been searching for
creative ways to recruit and retain high-quality people in the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama recently enacted a law that will bring its salaries up
to the national average by 2007 (provided that tax revenues remain
flush). The governors of California and New York are essentially
engaged in a bidding war, offering tuition reimbursements, home
loans and incentives for advanced certification. Vice President Al
Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has
suggested unprecedented involvement by the federal government, with
$5,000 or $10,000 signing bonuses for teachers who agree to work in
hard-to-staff schools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, six states and about a dozen local districts are
experimenting with various types of merit-pay plans for teachers.
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley has suggested making teaching
a year-round profession _ automatically increasing the pay by about
20 percent for the added time at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're seeing state legislators in a growing number of
states, and governors in a growing number of states, being willing
to do something about it,'' said Robert Chase, president of the
National Education Association, the other major teachers union,
which expects a contentious debate over pay-for-performance at its
convention this week in Chicago. ``We're seeing the kind of
movement we want to see. Hopefully it will expand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the past year, Connecticut and the District of Columbia
each raised starting salaries for teachers more than 10 percent,
according to the American Federation of Teachers survey, while
Alabama's first-year pay rose 9.2 percent, Iowa's 8.2 percent, and
Minnesota and North Carolina both more than 7 percent. Overall
average salaries also shot up 11.3 percent in North Carolina, 9.1
percent in Alabama, 7.9 percent in Washington, D.C., and 7.1
percent in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not high enough,'' Feldman said. ``If it were, we
would be able to fill all the teaching vacancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was the only state where the average salary dropped, down
1.8 percent to $48,275. The starting salary dropped $10 in North
Dakota, to $19,136.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the starting salary for teachers has not recovered from
its inflation-adjusted high of $26,880 in 1972, and remains at 72
percent of what average college graduates expect to earn in their
first jobs. Comparing mid-career professionals with similar
experience, teachers earn 59 percent as much as engineers and
attorneys, 61 percent of the salary of computer analysts, and 82
percent of accountants' pay, according to the teachers federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot more money as a pretty bad salesperson than I do
as a pretty good teacher,'' said Julie Blaha, 30, a first-year
teacher in Anoha, Minn., who spent the previous five years selling
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ray, a history teacher at Lincoln High School in Yonkers
who is president of the union's local, said he has seen a change in
the quality of teachers as the school system has increased salaries
some 50 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, if you couldn't get a job elsewhere, you came to
Yonkers,'' Ray said. ``The new teachers we've been hiring over the
last six to eight years are top-quality people who look at Yonkers
as somewhere they want to spend their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yonkers previously lost teachers to the surrounding
Westchester suburbs and even New York City, ``now you almost have a
flip-flop,'' Ray said. New York's starting salary of $30,265 _ 18
percent below that of Yonkers _ ranked 23rd among the 100 large
cities. ``For New York City experienced teachers,'' Ray added,
``coming to Yonkers is a promotion.''

WEB SITE SPECIALIZING IN CRIME NEWS PLANS CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY
FILING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   APB Online, Inc., which operates a criminal justice news Web
site that foundered last month prompting executives to lay off all
the staff and scramble to find additional investors for the
debt-laden enterprise, plans to file for bankruptcy under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which the executives of APBnews.com said they would
announce as early as Wednesday, is designed to provide breathing
space for the cash-strapped Web venture, according to its chairman
and chief executive, Marshall Davidson. At the moment, APBnews.com
has recalled about two dozen staff members and is updating the site
_ this week, it featured a report from Sacramento about illegal
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   But the enterprise still has $7 million in debts. Davidson and
Mark Sauter, the site's chief operating officer, said in a
telephone interview that the terms of Chapter 11 bankruptcy could
help them attract reticent investors by providing assurances that
new capital would not simply be funneled into debt repayment, but
would ensure the site's viability. A business filing for Chapter 11
protection staves off lawsuits from creditors seeking repayment and
provides the business time to reorganize finances, though the
reorganization must be accepted by a majority of creditors for the
business to recover.
</P>
<P>
   APBnews executives' current plea to potential investors,
including large media companies, is that they can provide the most
popular services of the site, like local crime statistics, while
spending far less for staff and news-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cash-burn rate and projected revenues are under $10
million for the next 12 months,'' Davidson said in a telephone
interview. ``Under $10 million keeps us operating. A total of $15
million breaks us even.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's original, more expensive ambitions, he said, matched
the demands of private equity investors in the summer of 1998, when
APBnews.com mustered its first financing, selling a 40 percent
stake of the business for $3 million. A year later, he said, it was
turning away investors willing to buy in at a much higher premium.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Giving his version of his company's brief,
roller-coaster history in the private equity markets, Davidson said
``if the capital markets would support a more rapid'' _ and
expensive _ ``build-out and thus the value of your company is
greater earlier, then that's what you would do.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``If the cap markets want to support a lower-cost
build-out and accept a lower valuation, then you'll do that. The
capital markets really made that change in March and April.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Muoio, the president of S. Muoio &AMP; Co. and an early investor
in APBnews.com _ to the tune of $100,000 _ said that the Chapter 11
strategy ``makes sense, for now. I think it's better than selling
the desks. They've got good people and they've built a terrific
news organization _ they obviously lost sight of what happens in
financial markets.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: MEXICO'S NEW DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When things went wrong for global capitalism in the 20th century
_ and they often did _ they tended to go wrong first in Mexico. The
Victorian version of globalization _ which depended either on
colonialism, or on the support of domestic elites so disconnected
from the local population that they might as well have been
colonists _ began to fall apart in 1911, when Mexicans rebelled
against the rule of the ``scientific'' dictator Porfirio Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   The cocksure optimism of ``emerging market'' investors in the
early '90s got its first serious warning at the end of 1994, when
Mexico plunged into financial crisis _ a crisis that proved to be a
dress rehearsal for the terrifying Asian crisis that began 30
months later.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Mexico's triumphantly free election on Sunday was cause for
rejoicing, not just for Mexico, but for everyone who hopes that
this time around we may be getting globalization right.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means clear that Vicente Fox was the better man. In
terms of policy positions, he was virtually indistinguishable from
Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (what a name!), or PRI. And Fox will face a
sort of reverse version of the Nixon-goes-to-China effect, which
may put him at a disadvantage as he tries to continue Mexico's
opening to the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a former executive of Coca-Cola, he will have to be
especially careful not to lay himself open to charges of
Coca-colonization, of selling his country to foreign investors. As
the candidate of a party originally founded to defend the
privileges of the Catholic Church and oppose land reform, he will
have to bend over backwards to show that his free-market policies
are not just a way to make the rich even richer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet his electoral victory is the best thing that could have
happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario was a narrow victory by the PRI _ a
victory that would have raised understandable suspicions of fraud.
A solid victory by Labastida might have been acceptable; but Fox's
victory proves that Mexico's reformers meant what they said, that
they really have been out to turn their country into a real
democracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Need one point out that this is, among other things, a
vindication for the North American Free Trade Agreement?
Sophisticated supporters of NAFTA have always acknowledged that the
treaty would in itself produce only modest economic gains _ a few
percent added to real income in Mexico, a few tenths of a percent
added in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The real justification of the agreement was political: it gave
Mexico's reformers an achievement to point to, a promise of better
things to come. Some critics of NAFTA jeered at this argument,
claiming that Mexican reform was a sham, that the reformers
themselves were merely well-spoken crooks _ a claim made more
plausible as revelations emerged about the dealings of former
President Carlos Salinas. But now we know that, whatever the sins
of Salinas, the reformers he brought to power were sincere _ and
the reform was real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, those of us who believe that globalization, while
neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for democracy, tends
to promote freedom have another success story to add to the list _
a list that now includes Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Argentina and more.
When a nation opens to the world, its businesses become less
dependent on government favor, its citizens become more aware of
how politics is conducted in advanced countries. The result,
repeatedly, has been a peaceful transition to true democracy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such transitions are not automatic _ we still need
heroes. And the hero of Mexico's transition is the current
president, Ernesto Zedillo. Zedillo was an accidental president, a
mild-mannered economist thrust into power when assassins gunned
down the PRI's chosen candidate. His elevation raised the obvious
questions: Would he become just another machine politician? Or
would he simply be weak, allowing the ``dinosaurs'' to return to
business _ including the business of stealing elections _ as usual?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo was neither corrupted by office, nor a patsy for the
corrupt officials in which the PRI still abounds. He insisted on a
fair election. And he and his party have triumphed in defeat: the
finest hour in the PRI's history was surely the moment in which it
finally lost power.

ONLINE NEWS GROUPS SEE CONVENTIONS AS A CHANCE TO SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the widespread expectation is that the summer's political
conventions will stir up about as much excitement as a city council
debate over landfill fees, there is an upstart element in the news
business that sees endless hours of fun and drama where others
envision ennui: the press corps of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   From boutique start-up ventures like Speakout.com to virtual
empires like America Online, Web sites and Webzines are looking to
the political gatherings in Philadelphia and Los Angeles as
potential defining moments in the evolution of news on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican officials say online enterprises are
requesting space in numbers no one anticipated. Organizers of the
Democratic convention, which begins in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, say,
for instance, that more than 100 Web sites have applied, and the
list is growing daily. So many wanted work stations along the newly
christened ``Internet Avenue'' that the party had to expand the
area, said Lindsey Berman, who has a job title new to political
conventioneering: Internet news media manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is even infiltrating that august symbol of convention
coverage, the skybooth. This year, the old-line networks and
all-news cable channels have new dot-com neighbors in the booths
high above the convention floors. Pseudo.com, America Online and
USAToday.com have all been allotted booths, whose costs at the
Republican convention start at $20,000 but with modifications can
go much higher.
</P>
<P>
   With the broadcast networks scaling back their prime-time
coverage of the conventions _ ABC is not even pre-empting Monday
Night Football preseason games _ the Web, even more voluminously
than the 24-hour cable stations, is rushing to fill the void. In
fact, the ways the Internet brings users closer to the process
could become one of the proceedings' more compelling stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, it's the perfect Web story,'' said Kerry
Lauerman, the Washington bureau chief of Salon, the online
magazine, which will have six editors and reporters covering the
proceedings from work stations in the arenas. ``It's a story that's
live, with its own peaks and depths.''
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor, reporters for Voter.com and Evote will
mingle with the delegates. Around the hall, pool cameras operated
by C-Span will send convention images via streaming video to
computer users around the country who will be able to watch from
the angle of their choice. MSNBC.com, in association with Hotline,
the online political digest, will produce live hourly Webcasts from
the convention throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   And America Online will have an open ``skybox cam'' trained on
the halls 24 hours a day, to provide real-time transmissions from
the crack of the chairman's gavel to the slosh of the janitor's
mop.
</P>
<P>
   The gizmos to be used may make it seem at times that the First
Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los Angeles
are staging hardware conventions. Pseudo.com, for instance, will
have a 360-degree camera taking in events all around the arena.
Voter.com plans to issue ``smart cards'' to delegates that can be
used to gain access to consoles that will tell them where the late
night parties are. Reporters for operations large and small will
circulate with all sorts of minicameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's the Web, there will be a million different kinds
of coverage,'' said Jacob Weisberg, political writer for the
Webzine Slate. ``It is going to be an interesting experiment, and
it can only make the conventions more interesting: the removal of a
single, heavy-duty spotlight and in its place hundreds of tiny
little spotlights.''
</P>
<P>
   A parched landscape for news does not faze the dot-coms, which
liken the arrival of e-journalism to another innovation in
political news, the television camera, introduced 52 years ago at a
political convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the 2000 campaign is doing to the term `new media' is
taking the `new' out,'' said Carin Dessauer, election director for
CNN Interactive. ``We've arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   And arriving in all sizes. Internet operations with vast
resources, like CNN's allpolitics.com, and even start-ups like
Voter.com, a bipartisan political Web site that went online last
November, will have contingents at the conventions larger than most
newspapers. Voter.com, under the editorship of Carl Bernstein, will
have 40 people at each of the gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has come a long way since the 1996 conventions,
when only a handful of Web operations were present. ``I was sitting
in the nosebleed seats typing on my laptop with the college
newspaper press,'' recalled Kathleen deLaski, the director of
political and government programming for America Online. This year
hundreds of Internet reporters, or maybe more, will be among the
15,000 reporters, technicians and support staff accredited for each
convention.
</P>
<P>
   While reporters for some news organizations work in more than
one medium, many others will be reporting exclusively to
cyberspace, in a rainbow of styles, from serious to satirical, from
text-driven to telegenic. ``We're going to keep it very
junkie-specific,'' said Chuck Todd, editor of Hotline, which is on
the National Journal Web site. ``We're not trying to make it
interesting for Mr. and Mrs. Public; we're trying to make it
interesting for Republican operatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com, a ``video experience on the computer,'' on the other
hand, will try a broader tack, carrying Webcasts, chats and a
variety of video and audio transmissions on its Pseudopolitics
page, which began on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to offer viewers a sort of immersive
experience, in that they ought to feel like they're at the
convention themselves,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of
Pseudopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if ``The Truman Show'' has made its way to the
political show. ``The big difference between now and four years ago
is video,'' said Chris Long, director of new media for C-Span,
which not only is providing the pool television coverage of the
convention for the networks, but also will have a camera in its own
booth, over the director's shoulder. Viewers, in effect, will be
able to design their own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The populist implications of a digital invasion are for a
virtual catalog of new ways to experience politics. But will the
appeal reach beyond the most politically obsessed?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, answered with his own question: ``Did the advent of
C-Span lead to that much greater knowledge and greater
connectedness to Capitol Hill? It's going to be a matter of great
enrichment to people who are really interested in this stuff. And
yet they may be painfully small in numbers.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Web site and Webzine operators say a limited audience is not a
concern. One appeal of the conventions on the Internet, they say,
is that a site can fulfill its mission by offering a perspective as
broad or as narrow as its audience wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a communal experience but of significance to a
shrinking number of people,'' said Michael Silberman, executive
editor of MSNBC.com. ``What the Web brings is the ability to reach
out and get information about your specific states that you care
about, to interact directly with a delegate, to ask a question
directly of a floor correspondent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, who is both executive editor of Voter.com and a
partner in the venture, says the vastness of the Internet gives it
a leg up with the people who care most deeply about the
conventions. ``We can put up a whole book if need be, put up
Charlton Heston on video going on for an hour and a half about
guns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dot-coms acknowledge, not every site will survive the
competition in the political arena, and the casualties may be
apparent at the conclusion of the party gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do what TV does, we fail,'' said David Bohrman, the
chief executive of Pseudo.com. ``We have to do something completely
different. We have to almost deconstruct the process, give the
users the feel of the convention, to touch what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Web reporters face some of the same problems as their
print and television counterparts. There may be infinite room in
cyberspace but not in greater Philadelphia, as the convention
reporters for Evote discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, both of them did find hotel space, but it's like a
two-hour drive out there,'' said Peter Markel, Evote's director of
strategic planning. ``That was one of the last things in our
planning.''

COMMENTARY: SOME DOGS ARE PROFESSIONALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRED BROCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I
tried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living.
Canines that can hold their heads high as they approach their
supper dishes. Animals whose vet bills could be a tax-deductible
expense for their owners.
</P>
<P>
   My dogs yawned as their attention drifted to a chattering
squirrel. They gave me their how-long-until-we-are-fed look and
wandered deeper into the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   I sighed and returned to my growing list of what working-class
dogs do for a living. I was helped by a new book, ``Dogs With Jobs:
Working Dogs Around the World,'' by Merrily Weisbord and Kim
Kachanoff (Pocket Books, $24.95). The possibilities are impressive.
There are dogs that work as actors and guards; there are dogs that
aid the blind, the deaf and the ill. There are dogs that work for
the police sniffing out drugs, bombs and missing bodies. Then there
are racing dogs, rescue dogs and show dogs. There are dogs that
herd cattle and sheep, and dogs that serve as companions for
patients in nursing homes and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most dogs do duty as family pets, and that role
should not be made light of. These stalwarts provide love and
security to tens of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But I wanted to check out some working dogs _ dogs with real
jobs, that work each day in a particular place with a particular
goal. I was interested in canines that, if they had two legs
instead of four, would be entitled to the minimum wage. Dogs like
Smokey, who works as a fire department mascot and guard dog in
Paterson, N.J.; Pearl, who herds cattle in New Mexico; Royce, who
sniffs out illegal drugs for the sheriff's department in Essex
County, N.J.; and Moki, who works as a companion to residents of a
nursing home in California.
</P>
<P>
   BEATING THE FLAMES
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters at the Northside Firehouse on Temple Street in
Paterson, N.J., call Smokey, a friendly 9-year-old mixed breed who
looks mostly like a German shepherd, a ``Paterson street dog.'' But
it's a compliment to his street smarts, not a slur on his lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Smokey has lived and worked at the firehouse since he was a
puppy and two firefighters brought him there from an animal shelter
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Coughlan, a Paterson firefighter who usually watches after
Smokey, says the dog doesn't go on as many fire calls as he did
when he was younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch him a little more carefully now,'' he said. ``We
don't want him to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped Smokey from working: When he's not on a
fire call, he stays behind and guards the firehouse until the
firefighters return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had his share of battle wounds _ stitches for cuts from
broken glass and stuff like that,'' Coughlan said.
</P>
<P>
   When Smokey goes to a fire, he often beats the firefighters
inside a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking for people and pets,'' Coughlan said. ``Many
times he's beaten me into a building and then come out choking
while I'm still getting my gear on. Later, he'll check to make sure
we're all safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlan sometimes takes Smokey to his house for a visit. ``But
after a few hours, he wants to get back to the firehouse,''
Coughlan said. ``It's his home.''
</P>
<P>
   ROUNDING UP CATTLE
</P>
<P>
   Wherever John Gard goes, Pearl is usually right by his side. Or,
more precisely, by the side of his cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl, a 10-year-old bluish-black-and-white Scottish border
collie, helps Gard, who is 80, run cattle on 9,000 acres near
Gladstone, in northeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gard is working from the back of a horse or behind the
wheel of a truck, Pearl stays busy helping him round up stray
cattle and move herds into corrals or from pasture to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a big help,'' Gard said. ``She really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Gard got Pearl when she was a puppy and trained her himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearl and border collies like her are only happy when they're
working,'' he said. ``They want to work, and they learn easily.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that like many border collies, Pearl is a master of
getting cattle to do her bidding without hurting them. ``These dogs
are best for working cattle, I think,'' he said. ``They mainly snap
at the heels, just enough to scare the cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Gard has used border collies on his ranch and
can't imagine being without one. ``Pearl takes care of me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DETECTING THE DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Rispoli, a detective with the canine unit of the Essex
County sheriff's department, had carefully hidden two plastic bags
of cocaine and marijuana in an abandoned building next to his
unit's offices in Belleville, N.J. Then, when detective Chris
Di-Rocco gave the command, Royce _ a 3-year-old black mixed
Labrador and retriever _ bounded into action. Within seconds he had
found the first stash in a discarded file cabinet; with equal
dispatch he found the second in the drawer of a old desk. In both
cases he signaled his discovery by frantically pawing at the hiding
places.
</P>
<P>
   Royce is a specialist in sniffing out narcotics. He is one of
three dogs used for that purpose by the canine unit. Ten other dogs
of various breeds, including bloodhounds and German shepherds, are
used to find bombs, detect arson, track suspects or missing people,
or help in search-and-rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
   Royce came to the sheriff's department from Morristown, N.J.,
after the Seeing Eye Inc., which trains guide dogs, rejected him
because of a short attention span. But this characteristic made him
perfect for rapid police searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royce is an amazing dog,'' said DiRocco, who is the dog's
human partner and takes him home when the two aren't on duty. ``He
loves to work and he loves to play. And he knows the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   SPURRING THE SMILES
</P>
<P>
   Moki is on duty 24 hours a day at the Vista Del Sol Care Center,
a nursing home in Culver City, Calif. During rounds each morning,
he visits patients; later, he meets them in an exercise room.
</P>
<P>
   Moki, who is 1 year old, is a black and white peekapoo, a cross
between a Pekingese and a miniature poodle.
</P>
<P>
   Stella Henry, a nurse who is a co-founder and director of the
nursing home, says Moki has had an extremely positive effect on the
patients. She cites examples of usually unresponsive patients who
have reacted to Moki by petting him and talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   She says attendance and laughter at activities programs increase
as Moki ``works the room'' and ``earns his keep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moki sees no age, no wrinkles, no tremors and no tubes,'' she
added. ``His expertise lies in giving unconditional love.''

TALL SHIPS LEAD 11-MILE REGATTA ON JULY 4 IN NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a steamy cloud-bound sky, one of the largest
gatherings of seagoing vessels assembled since man discovered that
iron and pine would float cruised majestically through the salty
flats of New York Harbor on Tuesday in a nautical tribute to
America's 224th year of independence.
</P>
<P>
   A stately march of 26 Class A tall ships, hulls humming and
sails belled, led an 11-mile regatta of 300 military vessels from
nearly 20 nations across the harbor's watery parade ground and up
the Hudson River in a five-hour wind-blown ballet witnessed by
thousands aboard bobbing pleasure craft and more than 1 million on
shore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a splendid maritime collage: teak-decked schooners daubed
with sailors in spanking whites, grey swells heaving brown-masted
barks into yellow skies, bowsprits slicing through ocher haze,
jibtops whipping, and hundreds of canvas mainsails flickering like
birthday candles on the foamy, white-capped cake of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   As he reviewed the display from the flight deck of the USS John
F. Kennedy, President Clinton said: ``On this Fourth of July,
standing in the shadow of Lady Liberty, we must resolve never to
close the golden door behind us and always not only to welcome
people to our borders but to welcome people into our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who accepts the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship is our fellow citizen, equal in the eyes of God,
entitled to be treated equally and with dignity by all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the crowd, which stretched from the Battery to the
George Washington Bridge on the west and from the South Street
Seaport to above Roosevelt Island on the east, turned its attention
from sea to sky as 60,000 pyrotechnic shells, rising from 13 barges
spread across the harbor, sizzled, whined and burst, conjuring a
hothouse of exotic flowers in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   The rich blossoms of red, blue, yellow and green exploded once
in the black of the night, then again in reflective flashes on the
glassy facades of buildings and the dark surface of the surrounding
water.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day began with a sultry, humid morning in the New
York area as temperatures hovered in the low 70s and pewter clouds
massed above the harbor, giving the ships a somber elegance.
Gathering in the early-hour heat, the vessels slipped like brigands
past the shores of Gravesend, gliding slowly through the mist
toward eager crowds.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, the haze had retreated but the overcast sky had
been soldered into an unbroken scrim of clouds that glared above a
wonderful sight _ an armada of full sails stretching into the
distance, fireboats spraying red, white and blue parabolas of water
into the air and military jets booming over the clogged harbor,
which was covered in a bright white Jackson Pollack splatter of
pleasure boats.
</P>
<P>
   From piers and decks, rooftops and shoreside restaurants, from
apartment living rooms and from lampposts and the hoods of
strategically parked cars, the crowds watched the antique vessels
drift by with a speed and courtliness seemingly drawn from a
distant, gentler age. This was how the world traveled ages ago, at
the pace of nature and at the discretion of capricious winds.
</P>
<P>
   With so many gathered to watch the parade _ 10,000 packed onto
the USS Intrepid and its berth at 46th Street alone _ there was
bound to be confusion. A brief spell of disappointment hit the
masses gathered on the Upper West Side, for example, when many of
the tall ships turned around at 54th Street, following what
organizers said was the flotilla's prearranged route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it Slop Sail,'' said Kate Foster, who watched
with a sinking heart from her apartment on Riverside Drive and
113th Street as the full-rigged brigs and barkentines came about
and sailed south before reaching her and a dozen guests. ``We have
friends over and everyone's gathered around, but there's better
coverage on television. It's a real disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The august tall ships massed in the harbor seemed to catch the
uneasy optimism of the country at the turn of the millennium. They
were made of simple and practical stuff _ oak, canvas, steel _ and
proved to the crowd that ingenuity, craftsmanship and rugged
self-reliance were once common values. At the same time, however,
the ships were relics, reminders that these values had flourished
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The procession Tuesday was billed as the largest naval operation
in history, and its organizers said it would contain more floating
vessels than D-Day or the Spanish Armada. While 70,000 sailing
craft of all types were expected, far less _ perhaps as few as half
_ showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the 295-foot, American three-masted bark Eagle, the
Parade of Sail eased under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge shortly
after 9 a.m. in a northwesterly wind of less than 10 mph. A regal
line of 180 tall ships led the fleet, followed by scores of modern
and antiquated military craft and surrounded by as many as 30,000
recreational boats.

 &HT;    Team time trial concept costs Armstrong
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Sedrvic e
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. NAZAIRE, France _ As Lance Armstrong chugged up the Pont de
St. Nazaire, a huge, winding bridge that looms almost 100 yards
above the mouth of the Loire River, his coach screamed for him to
put on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Tour de France champion was riding too fast and
was breaking away from the rest of his U.S. Postal Service Team.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's stage four from Nantes to St. Nazaire was a unique one
for this year's Tour. Rather than have a traditional time trial,
the Tour planners opted for a team version for the first time since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   At least five riders from the same team had to cross the finish
line together. If one broke away, the team risked a penalty. All
the riders who finished together received the same time as the
fifth rider.
</P>
<P>
   So Armstrong, rather than simply putting his head down and
pumping out the miles, had to wait for everyone to catch up. His
squad managed a second-place finish, but because of the team time
trial concept, Armstrong lost ground in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of celebrating American Independence Day seven time
zones from home by wearing the Tour's traditional yellow jersey,
Armstrong was forced to find a quick ride to his team hotel while a
new leader was presented on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert, already one of the most popular athletes in
his country, gave the French something to cheer on this blustery
afternoon along the Atlantic Ocean. Jalabert was the leader of the
winning ONCE team, and his squad's performance allowed him to zoom
from third to first place in the overall standings, or ``general
classification'' as it's called in cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Jalabert's overall time of 10 hours, 9.1 seconds was 12 seconds
better than second-place David Canada, also of ONCE. Armstrong, who
started the afternoon in second place and four seconds behind the
leader, fell to third place, 24 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   ONCE's dominant performance Tuesday allowed them to pack the top
10. Seven members of the Spanish team were in the top 10. U.S.
Postal members made up the other three spots, with Vjatceslav
Ekimov in fifth (43 seconds behind) and Tyler Hamilton in 10th, 55
seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   USPS member Kevin Livingston, an Austin, Texas, resident, was
13th, 1:18 behind Jalabert. USPS rider George Hincapie was 14th
overall and 1:33 out of first. Austin resident Chann McRae, who
rides for Mapei, was 51st overall, 3:57 back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed not to have won it, because we spent a lot
of time preparing for it,'' said Mark Gorski, USPS general manager.
``But ultimately, this was a real key for our team and Lance
because we picked up 40 seconds on Telekom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorski was specifically referring to the advantage Armstrong
picked up on Telekom's team leader Jan Ullrich, who won the 1997
Tour while finishing second in 1996 and 1998. He did not compete in
1999 because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Telekom's third place finish knocked Ullrich from fourth to
12th, 1:07 behind Jalabert and 43 seconds behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Gorski had been riding in one of the team cars tailing the USPS
riders, so he got an upclose look at what happens during a team
time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance got on that bridge, and Johan (Bruyneel, the USPS coach)
was shouting at Lance, 'slow it down, slow it down,''' Gorski said.
``He was riding so strong, the other guys were just hanging on the
best they could.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, three USPS riders lost track of the leading six. But
that wasn't unusual, given that every team but ONCE suffered
casualties on the 43.4 trek from Nante to St. Nazaire. The winds
turned nasty, consistently gusting 35 mph. Brief showers and
temperatures in the low 60s also made for a miserable day.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was too tired to talk to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's happy with the results,'' said Bill Stapleton,
Armstrong's Austin-based agent. ``He gets to keep the pressure of
the yellow jersey off his back. There's not going to be another
lead change until Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong left the course thinking he was in fourth place
overall. About an hour after the finish, the Tour officials
penalized ONCE 20 seconds for breaking driving rules. A judge
spotted a ONCE team car trailing too close to the riders. The judge
ruled that the car served as a shield to keep the wind off the ONCE
team, thus giving them an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jersey is tiring for a team to defend, especially
this early in the three-week long Tour. Jalabert's eight other
riders must chase down breakaways and control the tempo of the
peloton while he is wearing yellow. He hinted that ONCE may have a
different strategy for the rest of the flat stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have the yellow jersey,'' Jalabert said. ``And we
knew it would be possible thanks to the strength of our team. Now
that we have the race lead, we'll discuss how to handle it at a
team meeting (Tuesday night). Our priority is to ensure that we
maintain the strength of our team for the climbing stages of the
Tour.''

A POWER STRUGGLE BEGINS FOR MEXICO'S DEFEATED LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MEXICO-POLITICS-FOX) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A battle has broken out within Mexico's governing
party, following its election defeat, with several rival leaders
maneuvering for control during a painful transition that will test
its powers of survival, party leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Near chaos gripped the party after its leader, installed during
the presidential campaign by the party's candidate, Francisco
Labastida, presented her resignation, with the expectation that her
entire Cabinet would leave with her. The party called a meeting of
its leaders for Tuesday night to choose replacements, but the elder
statesmen were so divided over whom to pick and how to pick them
that the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's resignation by Dulce Maria Sauri, the party president,
was not formally accepted, said Marcos Bucio, a congressman who was
the party's spokesman during the Labastida campaign. But Sauri
appeared to have lost her authority.
</P>
<P>
   Who was in charge of the party, if anyone, was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of catharsis,'' Bucio said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, has always been based on the influence and resources of the
Mexican presidency, and by tradition, the president or
president-elect has hired and fired the party's top leaders,
virtually by whim.
</P>
<P>
   But after the party's first defeat in a presidential race since
its founding seven decades ago, several of its elder statesmen on
Monday refused to back a former governor, Jesus Murillo Karam, to
replace Sauri in the top party post because he was seen as
President Ernesto Zedillo's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many very different positions now,'' said Javier
Trevino, who resigned his post as deputy treasury secretary to work
as a senior campaign aide to Labastida. ``Some groups think they
don't want a leader who seems to reflect the president. They don't
want the president involved. They want this to be more of a PRI
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A few party leaders said they hoped Labastida might take the
party reins personally, but it was not clear if he would accept the
post. On Monday, the defeated presidential candidate went to the
party's hulking concrete headquarters in downtown Mexico City to
collect his personal belongings from his office.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Roberto Campa, who sought the nomination last
fall as the party's Mexico City mayoral candidate and later worked
for Labastida's campaign, also packed up his personal photos and
files and stalked out of party headquarters. He vowed to abandon
politics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters' message was very clear,'' Campa said. ``But it
doesn't look to me like people around here understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Labastida's defeat, the party should also be disturbed
by the fact that most of the party's votes in Sunday's election
came from sectors of the Mexican population that are disappearing,
said Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, a political scientist at the
Center for Teaching and Learning in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the demographics,'' Elizondo said. ``They received
votes from rural people, who are moving to the cities. They
received votes from old people, who are dying. And they received
votes from illiterate people, who are becoming more educated. This
is a terrible problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some leaders were looking on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trial by fire for us,'' said Cristina Alcayaga, a
former party human rights official who worked for Labastida. ``But
don't forget, our party received 12 million votes. We have to build
bridges to new constituencies and that's not easy. But we're not
dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in December, though, when President-elect Vicente Fox
takes office, the party's base of governmental support will shrink
drastically _ to its 20 state governors and the party's
much-reduced congressional delegation. How firmly the party's
several large unions and peasant organizations will remain tied to
it remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to the PRI's future, an optimist would have to be
a badly informed pessimist,'' said Agustin Basave, a former party
official who is now a political science professor.

   The elections have not only devastated the governing party. The
largest leftist group, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, is
also in turmoil after its presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, came in a distant last among the major candidates in his
third presidential race. The party's congressional delegation also
has been reduced, although it retained control of Mexico City's
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox repeatedly invited Cardenas to join
forces with him to defeat the governing party, but his flirtations
went unrequited. Tuesday Fox again invited the left to join with
him in forming the new ``government of unity.'' But Cardenas
spurned that offer, too, and Amalia Garcia, the party president,
said Fox had a ``conservative and backward position.''
</P>
<P>
   One leftist senator urged Garcia to call a party congress, to
``put the party on a new footing.'' Then an ugly public dispute
flared with the Workers' Party, a small party with which Cardenas
had forged an electoral alliance, after one of its leaders
criticized Cardenas' handling of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should just keep their mouth shut,'' said Carlos
Navarrete, the Party of the Democratic Revolution's spokesman.
``Out of prudence we haven't wanted to make public their behavior
in the political and economic areas of our alliance, but if they
want to have a public fight, things are going to turn out badly for
them.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Beginning and average teacher salaries rose more
than 3 percent last year, but they still fall short of earnings by
other college-educated workers and, adjusted for inflation, remain
below teacher salaries from 1972, according to a survey released
Tuesday by the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual paycheck for first-year teachers in 1998-99
was $26,639, while teachers with an average of 16.2 years on the
job earned $40,574, the survey showed. New Jersey, Connecticut and
New York led the nation for average teacher pay, around $50,000,
while Oklahoma, Mississippi and the Dakotas had the lowest average
salaries, below $30,000. Among cities with more than 100,000
residents, Yonkers, N.Y., had the highest starting salary for
teachers, at $37,045.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly, I think, a national emergency,'' said Sandra
Feldman, the president of the teachers federation, at the union's
biennial convention. ``We have to ask ourselves, what are our
priorities here as a nation?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the union has been conducting the salary survey for a
half century, this year's release comes amid an intense national
debate over how teachers should be compensated. Facing a national
shortage of some 2.5 million teachers over the next decade, school
administrators and state legislators have been searching for
creative ways to recruit and retain high-quality people in the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama recently enacted a law that will bring its salaries up
to the national average by 2007 (provided that tax revenues remain
flush). The governors of California and New York are essentially
engaged in a bidding war, offering tuition reimbursements, home
loans and incentives for advanced certification. Vice President Al
Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has
suggested unprecedented involvement by the federal government, with
$5,000 or $10,000 signing bonuses for teachers who agree to work in
hard-to-staff schools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, six states and about a dozen local districts are
experimenting with various types of merit-pay plans for teachers.
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley has suggested making teaching
a year-round profession _ automatically increasing the pay by about
20 percent for the added time at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're seeing state legislators in a growing number of
states, and governors in a growing number of states, being willing
to do something about it,'' said Robert Chase, president of the
National Education Association, the other major teachers union,
which expects a contentious debate over pay-for-performance at its
convention this week in Chicago. ``We're seeing the kind of
movement we want to see. Hopefully it will expand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the past year, Connecticut and the District of Columbia
each raised starting salaries for teachers more than 10 percent,
according to the American Federation of Teachers survey, while
Alabama's first-year pay rose 9.2 percent, Iowa's 8.2 percent, and
Minnesota and North Carolina both more than 7 percent. Overall
average salaries also shot up 11.3 percent in North Carolina, 9.1
percent in Alabama, 7.9 percent in Washington, D.C., and 7.1
percent in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not high enough,'' Feldman said. ``If it were, we
would be able to fill all the teaching vacancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was the only state where the average salary dropped, down
1.8 percent to $48,275. The starting salary dropped $10 in North
Dakota, to $19,136.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the starting salary for teachers has not recovered from
its inflation-adjusted high of $26,880 in 1972, and remains at 72
percent of what average college graduates expect to earn in their
first jobs. Comparing mid-career professionals with similar
experience, teachers earn 59 percent as much as engineers and
attorneys, 61 percent of the salary of computer analysts, and 82
percent of accountants' pay, according to the teachers federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot more money as a pretty bad salesperson than I do
as a pretty good teacher,'' said Julie Blaha, 30, a first-year
teacher in Anoka, Minn., who spent the previous five years selling
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ray, a history teacher at Lincoln High School in Yonkers
who is president of the union's local, said he has seen a change in
the quality of teachers as the school system has increased salaries
some 50 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, if you couldn't get a job elsewhere, you came to
Yonkers,'' Ray said. ``The new teachers we've been hiring over the
last six to eight years are top-quality people who look at Yonkers
as somewhere they want to spend their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yonkers previously lost teachers to the surrounding
Westchester suburbs and even New York City, ``now you almost have a
flip-flop,'' Ray said. New York's starting salary of $30,265 _ 18
percent below that of Yonkers _ ranked 23rd among the 100 large
cities. ``For New York City experienced teachers,'' Ray added,
``coming to Yonkers is a promotion.''

MORE POST-GRADUATES CHOOSING LAW OVER BUSINESS DEGREES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a swiftness that has surprised and puzzled educators, law
schools have gained the advantage in their long tug of war with
business schools for the attention of corporate America's future
participants.
</P>
<P>
   At virtually every top business school, the number of applicants
fell in spring, and some of the numbers are startling. At the
University of Chicago, they dropped 24 percent. At Cornell
University, the dip was 23 percent, and at Stanford University, it
was 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is considerably less difficult to gain admission
to some business schools than it was a few years ago, and school
officials have relaxed their requirements for work experience and
stepped up overseas recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Law schools, meanwhile, are enjoying their first increases in
applications since the 1980s. Around the country, about 77,000
people submitted applications to begin law school this fall, up
about 3 percent from the previous year. It was the second
consecutive increase, reversing a string of declines that accounted
for a 30 percent overall drop from 1991 through 1998, according to
the Law School Admission Council.
</P>
<P>
   Deans say they have no clear explanation for the trend, which
comes after a decade in which interest in MBA programs grew as
rapidly as stock market values. Top schools became so selective
that at some, admission rates plummeted to 10 percent or less. At
the same time, law schools became less selective.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the tight labor market is causing companies to offer
promotions and perquisites to retain young employees who otherwise
might be considering business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities presented to someone like me are pretty
compelling right now,'' said Brian Gale, 27, an equities trader in
Boston who is trying to decide between going to the University of
Chicago full time and working for a bank in Cleveland that has
offered to pay his tuition if he enrolls in Chicago's weekend
program. ``It's difficult to take a timeout for two years. People
are saying, `I'll postpone it until there's a need for me to go
back.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, graduate programs of almost all types, from the
humanities to the physical sciences, have received slightly fewer
applications over the last five years than in the past, according
to the Council of Graduate Schools. The number of people in their
late 20s has decreased, and the strong economy has given them many
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Law schools have managed to defy that trend, though. Unlike many
business schools, they accept students directly from college,
before the students have employers who may be desperate to keep
them. Law schools also seem to be benefiting both from corporate
America's willingness to hire lawyers for a broader range of jobs
than in the past, deans say, and from a heightened interest in
public-interest work after a long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the speed and the size of the turnaround for
business and law schools defy easy explanation, school
administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody I've talked to has come up with a really good reason
for this, and we're all concerned,'' said Mary Miller, the
associate dean for admissions at the Stern School of Business at
New York University, where the number of applicants fell by 15
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The flip-flop in the schools' fortunes is connected,
graduate-school experts say, because both draw from the same pool:
ambitious young adults who have decided against careers in
specialties like medicine and engineering and opted instead for
degrees that may be passports to wealth and success in just about
any business field.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the first warning signs that MBAs were losing some
luster came as applications fell at schools that traditionally
attract people interested in technology, like Stanford University
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the decline in applications is more widely spread. In
fact, the list of schools where applications dropped, and
acceptance rates spiked, reads like a magazine ranking of the
country's best programs: Harvard University, the University of
Pennsylvania, MIT, Columbia University, Michigan, Virginia,
Northwestern, Duke. The declines are steepest among American
applicants. Yale's business school appears to be the only big-name
MBA program with an overall increase each of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the schools themselves tend to be among those who
blame the growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Career prospects generally look so good now that a two-year
investment in an MBA may be hard for many to justify,'' said
Richard Schmalensee, the dean of the Sloan School at MIT. Indeed,
the combination of tuition costs and lost wages can easily exceed
$200,000 over two years.
</P>
<P>
   George Parker, an associate dean at Stanford, added, ``There are
a lot of people who feel things are moving so quickly that they
don't want to stand on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that managers at some large companies are
discouraging younger workers from going to business school, in part
because they cannot spare them in the current job market and in
part because they want to keep them a safe distance from Internet
start-ups.

 UNDATED: Internet start-ups.

<P>
   Sally Lannin, the president of MBA Strategies, a firm in Edina,
Minn., that advises applicants, said companies had become more
reluctant to hire her to speak to their employees about how to get
into a top school.
</P>
<P>
   ``These organizations are really questioning whether they need
to have these people go to business school because they're having
such a hard time getting them back,'' said Lannin, a former
admissions officer at Stanford Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses have responded by helping employees get their
MBAs in part-time programs while they continue working. Starting in
January, for example, Paine Webber will pay for NYU to send
professors to the company's office in Weehawken, N.J., and teach
night classes to about 20 of its most promising young employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally related to the tight labor market,'' said Sue
Emanuel, a corporate vice president for career development at Paine
Webber. ``We want to make this as convenient as possible for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools with higher acceptance rates have not been hit as hard,
probably because they tend to attract younger students who
companies are more willing to let go, deans say.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nationwide statistics for business schools because
applications do not go through a centralized clearinghouse, as they
do for law schools.
</P>
<P>
   To get back enrollment, the most prestigious schools are
relaxing some of their admissions guidelines they imposed at the
height of their popularity in the 1990s. Cornell University, the
University of California at Los Angeles and a number of other top
schools have begun accepting applicants with only two or three
years of work experience, people who would most likely have been
rejected in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Deans say their concern for the decline in applications is
tempered because they are still receiving far more applications
than they need to fill a class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still plenty of hot competition,'' said Daniel Bauer,
the managing director of the MBA Exchange, an admissions consulting
firm based in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators also note that the recent downturn in many
technology stocks could make some companies less appealing places
to work and leave their young employees more interested in MBA
programs. The number of Americans taking the standard
business-school admission test, the Graduate Management Admissions
Test, increased slightly this year _ although turning test-takers
into applicants is not easy in a strong economy, deans say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the resurgence of the popularity of law schools is
an even greater mystery than the decline at business schools.
Maybe, they speculate, the business schools had become so selective
that some people gave up hope of getting in and sent their resumes
to law schools instead. And no doubt the big increases in starting
salaries that many law firms have introduced in the last two years,
in part to hold onto their associates, increased the law schools'
allure, administrators add.
</P>
<P>
   The tight job market and the legal complications arising from
new technologies are also opening up new opportunities for law
school graduates. About half the consultants that Boston Consulting
Group and McKinsey &AMP; Co. now hire do not come from business school,
for instance, and many instead hold a law degree, or juris
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, JDs are becoming a surrogate for MBAs in
business,'' said Trent Anderson, a vice president at Kaplan Inc.,
the test-preparation company, who has both degrees and who holds
seminars for people thinking about applying to professional school.
</P>
<P>
   America's unprecedented prosperity probably also plays a key
part. Many young people were not in the work force in the last
recession and assume they will never have to worry about money. As
a result, some educators suggest, they have set their sights on
higher ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potential students to business and law school think they want
to make a difference,'' said Edward Snyder, the dean of the
University of Virginia's business school, adding that most see the
law as a better way to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in law school applications have not been as stark as the
setbacks at business schools. Some law schools experienced big
increases in applications in the last year, for example, but
roughly half of the elite schools, including Duke, Harvard and
Yale, registered declines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever erosion occurred, though, was generally slight and far
less than the slide that characterized most of the 1990s.
Applications to Duke, for instance, fell less than 3 percent last
year, compared with a 37 percent from 1991 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that have booming numbers of applicants, like Columbia,
Georgetown and NYU, are suddenly much harder to get into. In 1991,
for example, the law school at the University of California at
Berkeley admitted just one out of nine among its 6,527 applicants.
By 1997, when only 4,171 people tried to gain admission, about one
in five succeeded. This year, after three consecutive years of
application growth, the odds were closer to one in seven.
</P>
<P>
   Herma Hill Kay, the outgoing dean of the school, says many
professors think popular culture, as much as any economic factor,
has a hand in the changing interest in law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was going through the roof in the 1980's, people said
it was because of `L.A. Law,''' Kay said. ``When it was going down,
people said it was because of the O.J. trial.'' These days, most
people are not quite sure why it is on the rise again, she said.

   VERMEER-OPERA (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) _ Peter Greenaway,
the British movie director, and Louis Andriessen, the Dutch
composer, are opening the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 with a new
opera, ``Writing to Vermeer.'' Focusing on two weeks in 1672 when
the painter Johannes Vermeer made a trip to The Hague, the creators
imagine that he received 18 fictional letters from women in his
life and sensed the crisis gripping the country as it prepared to
breach the country's dikes to hold off invasion by France. Alan
Riding concludes that the creators are saying that Vermeer painted
idyllic domestic scenes as a response to agitated times. Vermeer
never replies to the letters, but Riding says he is ever-present in
the 100-minute opera.

   SERIAL-MUSIC (New York)_ The development of 12-tone composition
was one of the most invigorating occurrences of the 20th-century
music. Now two theories persist and conflict: Was there a tyranny
of the atonal composers who seized the intellectual high ground and
intimidated tonal composers or was it these modern composers who
were the beleagured minority? Joseph N. Straus, a professor of
music theory at Queen College, has an answer. The dominance is a
myth. More than two-thirds of the active composers were tonal,
whereas serial composers constituted less than 15percent of the
total. By Anthony Tommasini.

   DANCE-ULTIMA-VEZ _ (New York) _ When Wim Vandekeybus, the
Belgian choreographer, presented in New York from 1987 to 1991,
dancers ducked as others threw bricks at them, and the norm
consisted of flying bodies, confrontational games and erotic
aggressiveness. The 37-year-old choreographer warns the Lincoln
Center Festival says he no longer has to throw bricks to show
intense instinct. The title of his newest dance, ``In Spite of
Wishing and Wanting,'' refers to the impossibility of explaining
wishes and fears except in dreams. That is why the dancers often

PROBLEMS OF PREMATURE INFANTS BROADER THAN ONCE THOUGHT, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Babies born weighing less than 5 and a half pounds are almost
four times less likely to graduate from high school by age 19 than
their normal-birthweight siblings, according to a study in the June
issue of the American Sociological Review.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the study, apparently the first to follow
low-birthweight children to age 19, are far more dramatic than the
academic problems documented in previous studies tracking children
for fewer years. And the extent of the educational gap came as a
troubling surprise to some experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge effect, four times less likely to graduate from
high school,'' said Greg J. Duncan of the Institute for Policy
Research at Northwestern University. ``And it's a little puzzling,
since most studies have shown that most effects of low birthweight
fade out in the preschool years. But a sibling comparison is a very
good way to look at it, since it gets around all kinds of variables
that make it hard to compare low-birthweight children with
normal-birthweight children from different families.''
</P>
<P>
   In the families studied, 57.5 percent of the normal-birthweight
siblings graduated from high school by the time they were 19,
compared with 15.2 percent of the low-birthweight siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Timely high school graduation is an important indicator,
sociologists said, because those who do not graduate on time are
more likely to receive an equivalency diploma and less likely to go
on to a four-year college than those who complete high school on
time. The study did not examine the cause of the educational lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be for some future researchers to investigate
whether it's health problems, slowed cognitive development or other
mechanisms,'' said Dalton Conley, a sociologist at New York
University, who, with Neil G. Bennett of the Baruch School of
Public Affairs, wrote the study. ``Our contribution was to follow
these kids years longer than other studies. And as a policy matter,
I think our findings argue that programs to help low-birthweight
kids need to extend well beyond the early years.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley's study is based on data from the University of
Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has followed
thousands of families since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has found that low-birthweight children have
an increased risk of academic difficulties in early childhood, but
the gap was not as dramatic as the gaps found in the new study.
</P>
<P>
   In one study following 2,000 low-birthweight children to age 8,
researchers found that among those weighing less than 2.2 pounds,
more than a third had already failed a grade, and 12 percent were
in special education. And among those between 2.2 pounds and 5.5
pounds, more than a quarter had failed a grade, and 6 percent were
in special education.
</P>
<P>
   An author of that study, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a child development
and education professor at Columbia University, said that while the
new results were startling, there might be reasons school problems
became more pronounced as low-birthweight children grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit adolescence, there are more challenges to deal
with, and that may exacerbate the effects we saw at age 8,''
Brooks-Gunn said. ``These are kids with more illnesses, more going
against them. What this very large difference at high school
graduation may reflect is that when these kids get to middle
school, and face greater demands, they may disengage from school.''
</P>
<P>
   That study followed babies born in the 1970s, and Conley's
looked at babies born in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been significant medical advances in
caring for premature, low-birthweight babies, who make up almost 8
percent of all infants born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been big medical advances, which may mean that some
of these babies do much better,'' Conley said. ``But at the same
time, many more babies weighing less than 3 pounds are surviving,
babies who probably would have died in the period of our data. And
those are the ones with the worst problems.''

JAPAN FINALLY CONSIDERING INTEREST RATE BOOST UP FROM NEAR ZERO 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Faced with growing evidence that the Japanese economy is
gaining momentum, the country's central bank could decide later
this month to raise interest rates from their near-zero level.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would be the first increase in Japanese rates in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of economic strength came Tuesday with the
bank's closely watched quarterly survey of business sentiment,
known as the tankan, which showed that big Japanese manufacturers
were more confident of their future business prospects in the
quarter ending on June 30 than they have been in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of the tankan means the probability is now quite
high for a rate hike,'' said Masaaki Kanno, a senior economist at
J.P. Morgan in Tokyo and a former official at the central bank.
``But it's hard to say whether that's a good or bad thing at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tankan survey was in many ways a tale of two
economies, the global and the domestic, making it hard to draw
overarching conclusions from the data.
</P>
<P>
   While executives at Japan's large corporations were feeling more
confident, their colleagues at smaller businesses remained gloomy.
That difference in sentiment will complicate the central bank's
decision on interest rates, which is likely to be the hottest topic
of discussion among the nine policy board members at their next
meeting on July 17. The central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, has
made it clear that he favors raising rates as quickly as possible,
and at least two other members of the policy board have supported
him.
</P>
<P>
   The bank lowered short-term interest rates virtually to zero a
year and a half ago, when significant parts of Japan's financial
system seemed at risk of collapse and the threat of severe
deflation loomed large. But in the process, the bank deprived
itself of its most valuable tool, the ability to use interest rates
to influence the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While many economists and policy makers agree that bank
officials did the right thing, opinions about when and how the bank
should go about re-creating a more normal interest rate environment
diverge widely.
</P>
<P>
   There is as yet no clear consensus that the budding economic
recovery can flourish on its own, and the tankan survey results did
little to resolve the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies reported that they intended to increase their
capital investment by 4.6 percent on average in the current fiscal
year, ending in March 2001, but smaller companies said they would
be cutting their spending _ and even more sharply than they
projected in the previous quarter, from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say that difference speaks volumes about the strength
of the nascent recovery in Japan's economy, the world's second
largest.
</P>
<P>
   Larger corporations have been able to rely on demand in Europe
and the United States to increase business. Were they solely
reliant on the domestic economy, like smaller companies and service
businesses, they too might be less optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Big multinationals also have less need than small companies do
for the short-term financing that would become more expensive if
the central bank raised interest rates. Indeed, a surge in profits
has enabled many large companies to go on a spending spree using
their own cash, as reflected in the continuing decline of bank
lending here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys that rely on export markets are doing great,''
said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Tokyo,
``but the domestic service sector and small and midsized companies
that do most, if not all, of their business domestically are only a
little better than stagnant. The question for the bank thus becomes
whom do you run the bank for?''
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates and borrowing costs for companies might curtail
their investment activities or even accelerate the pace of
bankruptcies. ``My view is that raising rates would kick off a
recession,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter here.
</P>
<P>
   But others consider such concerns overblown because the bank is
not likely to raise rates above 0.25 percent. ``The increase in
borrowing costs should have only a small impact on economic
activity,'' Kanno of J.P. Morgan said. ``Bank lending is declining
anyway, and capital expenditures are increasingly financed
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has not laid out guidelines, such as inflation
targets, that would help steer its decision making and increase
understanding of its intentions. It has said that the low rates are
meant to help stimulate the economy by keeping the cost of
borrowing down. But low rates may also be contributing to a
deflationary chain of lower prices, wages and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices in Japan are currently falling at the fastest
rate in the last decade. Moreover, the prices that manufacturers
can charge for their goods is falling much faster than the prices
of their raw material and other costs, eroding profit.
</P>
<P>
   Central bank policy board members argue that much of this is
``good deflation,'' but they have yet to produce convincing
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministry is also making things difficult for the
central bank in setting a clear policy. The ministry, another
center of financial power in this country and often a rival, is
using its authority on intervention in the currency markets to send
a clear message that it does not favor raising interest rates. It
has ordered the central bank to intervene to keep the yen from
rising more than 10 times this year. Such intervention tells the
market that rates are unlikely to rise, since a rate increase would
itself put upward pressure on the yen.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the bank seems confused about its role. Like most
central banks, its legal mandate is to maintain price stability.
But lately, some policy board members have expressed concern that a
``moral hazard'' is emerging from the exceptionally loose monetary
policy. They fear that by holding rates effectively at zero, they
have enabled corporate Japan to avoid the painful overhaul it
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand, and in some ways agree with the concern about
moral hazard,'' Feldman said. ``But the bank is not in charge of
structural policy, and anyway, using interest rates to influence
structural reform is sort of like using a hammer to hit a screw.''

DEFENSE EXPERTS SHARPLY SPLIT ON MISSILE THREATS TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mass., Ariz.)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Intelligence officials, military officers and
policy experts in the Clinton administration are deeply divided
over the seriousness of missile threats posed by countries like
North Korea, Iran and Iraq, even as the administration says the
United States needs to build a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department dissented from an intelligence
report last fall that stated that North Korea could soon develop a
ballistic missile that could threaten the United States. They are
also quite likely to dissent again as intelligence agencies prepare
a new assessment for the president, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials in the White House, State Department, Pentagon
and CIA argue that the threat has been defined almost exclusively
by technological abilities and that the assessment discounts
political, economic and social factors that could make a threat
less likely. The officials said the intense focus on missiles that
can hit American soil also obscures the more immediate threat posed
by nuclear weapons carried by terrorists or fired from ships. And
they said it devalues the concept of deterrence, by which the sheer
force of America's military arsenal would inhibit even the most
irresponsible leader from attacking American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Dissension exists even on the technological side. A senior
Pentagon official acknowledged that Iran's ballistic missile
program had problems and was ``certainly not clicking along really
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon schedule to build a missile defense is entirely
driven by the belief that North Korea will have a long-range
missile by 2005. Indeed, the coming intelligence report will
conclude that North Korea could develop a missile that could strike
the United States by 2005, the same finding that was in the report
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Iran, the study last year reported that some
experts believed that the threat was ``likely before 2010.'' Others
have said there is ``less than an even chance by 2015,'' a split
that persists.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iraq, officials agree that Iraq will pose no concrete
threat to the United States as long as international sanctions
remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments are crucial, because they are driving the
decision by President Clinton to decide in the fall on proceeding
with a $60 billion program to build a limited missile defense in
five years. Clinton has repeatedly said _ as recently as this week
_ that he will make his decision on four factors: the cost, the
technological feasibility, the effects on other countries and the
urgency of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said so himself. ``I believe by
the year 2005 a threat will be present that could threaten the
security of the United States,'' Cohen said in an interview on CNN
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That finding is being fiercely contested by some officials,
including experts on Korea, who point to North Korea's suspension
of its missile tests in the fall and the progress between the
leaders of North and South Korea since their successful meeting
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence report being completed for Clinton is known as
a National Intelligence Estimate and is supposed to reflect the
consensus of all the intelligence agencies, including, among
others, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State
Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But as experts from
those agencies have contributed their views and information to
drafts in recent weeks, there is little consensus.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as a missile defense has emerged as an important
difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
in the presidential campaign, many intelligence officials have
complained that what is supposed to be a coldly analytical process
has evolved into a roiling political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the report last year, the rules of classic intelligence
analysis were altered, the officials said, to measure not whether
countries were likely to threaten the United States, but whether
they ``could'' do so. The officials said that change skewed the
results toward the most alarming assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure from the Hill driving this
process,'' said a longtime intelligence official involved in
preparing the new report. ``You end up with realms of possibility,
including what is least likely to what is unthinkable. We are
writing in worst-case language. Frankly, from my perspective, this
is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials defended the process. ``We don't
live here to make anybody happy,'' a senior intelligence official
said. Still, that official acknowledged that people on all sides of
the debate were ``looking for something in what we say to support
their own arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensely partisan politics swirling around the urgency of
the threat were on display Thursday at a hearing of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. At one point, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
pressed Larry D. Welch, a retired Army general who heads an
independent team that is reviewing the Pentagon's plans, to
enunciate the extent of the nation's vulnerability to missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look straight into the cameras and say, `We are as a nation
defenseless,''' Warner demanded after trying several ways to have
the witness say that affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
   Welch replied: ``We as a nation have no missile defense to deal
with these threats. That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   But at another point, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``There's
nothing that I'm aware of that suggests that the threat of an
attack on the United States is `increasingly likely' in the next
few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the threat depended on not only the ability to build
weapons, but also on ``analysis of the nature of the relationships
with a country, the rationale for an attack, the possibilities of
an attack, the levels of deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the central question asked by many critics of the
national missile defense is why its advocates appear to have
discounted deterrence as a counter to the missile threat, even
though deterrence governed American strategic thinking throughout
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior officials have concluded that deterrence no longer
holds when it comes to countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
They regard the leaders of these three countries as capable of
irrational, self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the Soviets but we roughly understood them to
be extremely cautious,'' said Leon S. Fuerth, Gore's national
security adviser. ``We never have had the depth of understanding
about what makes the North Koreans tick to give us that
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last month's summit with South Korea, President Kim Jong
Il of North Korea was so reclusive that ``We hardly knew what his
voice sounded like,'' Fuerth said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Iran, a senior Pentagon official pointed out that
Iranians seized American hostages twenty years ago, still chant
``Death to America'' and are involved in state-sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials say Iran is considering developing a
rocket that could put satellites in orbit, a move that would
represent a significant step toward possessing an intercontinental
ballistic missile. Tehran has begun discussing the project with the
French, Indians and Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also cite Iran's efforts to develop a longer-range
missile, the Shahab-4. But Iran still faces difficulties in its
program to build the Shahab-3, a missile with a range of 780 miles.
Those problems have prompted experts to question the Iranian
missile threat to the United States. ``There is an Iranian threat
to U.S. forces in the region, not to the continental United
States,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials complain that all the attention focused on the
potential missile threat diverts attention from more likely threats
like chemical or biological weapons prepared in the United States
and hidden in a truck, or even a cruise missile carried aboard a
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cohen acknowledges those facts. ``I think the act of
terrorism taking place on the United States is more likely than
intercontinental ballistic missiles,'' he said in his interview on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But at another point he added, ``To say that we can't protect
against everything doesn't mean that we shouldn't protect against
those that can cause us catastrophic harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials vehemently deny that the missile
program is aimed at curbing the military ability of Russia or
China. The analysis last year and the report being prepared find
that the United States defines those two countries as a threat only
in the case of an accidental unauthorized launching.
</P>
<P>
   But especially on Capitol Hill there are those who argue that
the ultimate threat is China's ability to strike the United States.
Five years ago, an unpublished report prepared for the House
National Security Committee by the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization cited the possibility of China's ``using its ballistic
missiles to prevent U.S. action in Korea'' as a pivotal threat that
justifies a defensive shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to talk about North Korea, Iran and Iraq, but people
don't like to talk about Russia or China,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
said. ``But people privately also are a little worried that there
could be another threat from China. I'm candidly telling you that
behind closed doors you hear some people expressing some concerns
about ultimate threats like China.''

RICK LAZIO: AMBITIOUS, ENERGETIC AND POLITICALLY SKILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Special Report: A Growing Ambition) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tall and lanky, with a voice that occasionally cracks
and a forelock that resists conformity. All in all, he presents
himself as the perfect young man to escort your daughter to the
junior prom: he would obey the speed limit, attempt nothing more
than a peck on the cheek, and studiously avoid the rum raisin ice
cream for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Lazio is 42 years old, not 18. Despite the gee-whiz air
about him, he is old enough to have a wife, two daughters and a
weekend beach house; eight years as a Republican congressman; and
the brash self-confidence to square off against Hillary Rodham
Clinton in New York's high-wattage race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers have warned Clinton that in many ways, Lazio presents
more of a challenge than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the putative
candidate he so gleefully replaced two months ago. He has a
palpable ambition that infuses him with energy, a gift for
negotiation, and that rare ability, shared by her husband, to
connect with a savvy lobbyist in Washington and some teen-ager
working a pizza oven in his native Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they say, he is a nice guy, with little in his
personal life to titillate the curious and suspicious. He rarely
socializes and spends most of his free time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood L. Boehlert, a Republican congressman from Utica, and
his wife were recently watching a televised scene from a political
rally that showed an aide gripping Lazio by the arm and leading him
off stage. The candidate broke loose, Boehlert recalled, went back
to take the hand of his wife, Patricia, and walked away with her by
his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very important to my wife,'' he said. ``I'll tell
you, that was a heady position he was in. And yet he stops, grabs
his wife's hand and walks off together. That's not manufactured.
That's real.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who know him say that a certain calculation lurks
behind his smile. He promotes himself in a way that unnerves
colleagues. He is well-known for waiting until the last moment to
cast his vote; while supporters say it reflects a deliberate
approach to lawmaking, detractors say it shows a penchant for
pandering to the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of the Lazio ideology. Although
considered to be a moderate Republican, his positions, from gun
control to abortion, can seem oh-so-carefully nuanced. Rep. Peter
King, an outspoken Republican colleague from Long Island, said he
doubted whether Lazio was guided by any particular philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically a facilitator, a mediator, a fine-tuner,'' King
said. ``He tries to make things work a little better, but it's not
out of any real ideological base.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Braun, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Television
Group, said he had a different take on his former college roommate,
a man he loves and teases ``like a brother.'' For all his boyish
qualities, he said, Clinton's opponent is as hard-driven as they
come _ and ``very, very pragmatic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early Lessons in Responsibility
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio inherited that pragmatism from his father, Anthony
Lazio, who worked long hours in the automotive parts store he
owned, then spent many nights making contacts through the local
Kiwanis club and the Suffolk County Republican clique. The lesson
imparted was that little comes to those who relax.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lazio had met his wife in the mid-1950s when he
serendipitously stepped on the foot of Olive Christensen, the
daughter of Danish immigrants living in Brooklyn. ``It must be a
family thing,'' Rick Lazio joked, referring to his own
lip-splitting stumble at a recent Memorial Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Both were veterans of World War II, single parents _ he was a
widower with one daughter, and she was divorced, with two daughters
_ and rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fans, which prompted a romantic trip
to Ebbets Field that eventually led to marriage. They settled down
in a small Cape Cod house in middle-class West Islip on Long
Island's South Shore. It was just a few miles east of Lindenhurst,
where his Sicilian parents, a seamstress and a man who dabbled with
unsuccessful inventions, ran a dress shop out of their house on
Montauk Highway.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1958, the couple had their first child together: Enrico
Anthony Lazio, named after his paternal grandfather. Lazio later
joked that when his teachers conducted roll call _ ``Mary, Jane,
Paul, Bill, Enrico!'' _ other children would look to see ``who's
the new exchange student.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the baby in the family, doted on by his parents and three
older sisters. To hear Lazio tell it, his childhood was normal and
healthy, but hardly a free ride. Yes, his family owned a beach
house on Fire Island. Yes, he played Little League and collected
stacks of baseball cards. Yes, they installed a floodlight over his
basketball hoop so that he could mimic Walt Frazier late into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   But he never received an allowance, he said. Instead, his father
made him earn spending money by stocking shelves and sweeping the
floor at the family store.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lazio also played down his father's role in
politics. ``He would be one of the guys who would put the signs up
and carry the petitions,'' he said. ``And then when you had some
sort of visiting bigwig come into town, he'd be the guy who would
be asked to go pick him up at the airport and bring him in.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Edwin M. Schwenk, the Suffolk County Republican chairman
from 1967 to 1977, remembered Tony Lazio's playing a significant
role. The party paid Lazio about $26,000 a year, he said, to
coordinate elaborate fund-raising dinners that often included a
formal program and a three-tier dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made everybody think that Suffolk County was important, and
he convinced them to come, including the vice president, Spiro
Agnew,'' Schwenk said, adding: ``And he wasn't bashful about
telling me what a good job he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lazio minimized the role of politics in his
childhood, saying he did little more than attend a few rallies. As
for Republican patronage, he said, his father would help friends
secure summer jobs on the public beach, but that his son's
assignments would be ``the lousiest'': hauling garbage or working
on the mosquito-control unit.
</P>
<P>
   About this time, his future political opponent, Clinton, was a
young lawyer working for the House Judiciary Committee. Her task:
preparing for the impeachment of one of the Lazio family's heroes,
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing His Causes
</P>
<P>
   The West Islip High School yearbook in the bicentennial year
1976 includes a photograph of a grinning graduate named Enrico
Lazio sporting a striking white bow tie. His listed accomplishments
included membership in the Coin and Stamp Club and something called
the Leaders Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Leaders Club was like a group of people that were picked
to _ what did we do? _ we sort of led,'' Lazio said, laughing and
cringing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the kind of teen-ager to sneak a six-pack of
Schmidt's beer down to the Babylon docks; nor was his high school's
coin club likely to rumble with rowdy numismatists from, say, Bay
Shore High School. He followed the Mets, hung out in friends'
basements, spent time clamming off the Fire Island shores.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, he began to attend Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, an
elite women's school that had begun to admit men only seven years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It retains a whiff of its upper-crust past to this day;
afternoon tea is still served under gold chandeliers in the Rose
Parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he chose Vassar because it was relatively close to
home, had a small-school feel and offered him some latitude in
choosing course work. The disproportionate women-to-men ratio, he
added, ``certainly wasn't a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   There he was, a political science major in Lacoste shirts and
Top-Siders, dressed like a preppy but not a true preppy, more
interested in Tom Seaver than in Mary McCarthy, a wide-eyed product
of what he later called a ``lily-white middle-class background.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point he tried marijuana, he said, but those who knew
him then say he was hardly one to join others in beginning their
weekends with Thursday-night pitchers of beer. He and his friends
spent most of their time competing in cutthroat games of Risk,
basketball and all-around teasing, but he was neither the
sharpest-tongued nor the most athletically gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could easily give him a pass and it would hit him in the
head,'' Braun, his former roommate, said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The conservative kid from West Islip gradually revealed himself
on the liberal-leaning campus. He was the campus coordinator for
Youth for Ford _ ``a pretty small group of volunteers, as you can
imagine,'' he said _ fought for more student input in faculty
evaluations and lost in the election for senior class president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think perhaps one day I would run for public office?''
he said. ``Yeah, I thought that.''
</P>
<P>
   Such aspirations were obvious to those around him. ``Lazio was
always understanding of the things you cannot do if you want to
have a career in politics,'' said Michael Naso, another former
roommate. ``He was conservative in his actions because he knew
where he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   When talk turned to national politics, Lazio passionately argued
that Nixon had been railroaded. But he would not immerse himself in
some stickier issues, as when many on campus erupted in protest
over the college's investments with banks that did business with
the apartheid government of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick was not on the map for any of that,'' said Dimitri Cruz,
a graduate who was active in campus politics. ``In that sense, Rick
chooses very carefully when to present himself, when to express his
views, when to assert himself.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the appearance of being focused, Lazio was more than a
little distracted. In late 1978, his father suffered a severe
stroke from which he would never fully recover; doctors told the
family that Tony Lazio would never get out of bed, and would
probably remain in a vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis failed to account for the determination of a man
who eventually willed himself to walk a few steps with a cane,
Lazio said. ``He pushed it as hard as anyone could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   College friends recall visiting the Lazio house to spend time at
the nearby beaches and to help their friend with his father:
assisting him in his physical therapy, using flash cards to help
him regain his speech, so affected by the stroke that only family
members seemed to understand him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a house of remorse,'' recalled Steve Kluger,
another former roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also worked to keep his father in touch with the
Republican clique that once meant so much to him. Sometime during
Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980, he said, he put a
note ``in somebody's hand who put it in somebody's hand,'' asking
that Reagan mention his father during a Long Island rally.
</P>
<P>
   He later said he just wanted the celebrity to point to the man
in the wheelchair and say: ``Tony Lazio, glad you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not happen. But the next morning, Reagan called the Lazio
house to apologize, saying that he had received the letter only
after he had left the rally. Then Olive Lazio held up the phone,
Lazio said, so that her husband could hear the future president
tell him ``how much he meant to the party, meant to the nation, the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering how the call thrilled his father, Rick Lazio said:
``It was a nice thing to do, something that didn't need to be done.
My dad _ it was a nice thing to do.''
</P>

<P>
   Able Prosecutor and Devoted Son
</P>
<P>
   Two young men from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Michael Moriarty,
were studying at American University School of Law in Washington
one day when, according to Lazio, an acquaintance came up to his
friend and said: ``Hey, man, Moriarty, I saw your sister. She's
pretty good-looking, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he felt betrayed; he had been driving Moriarty home
for a couple of years and yet knew nothing of this sister. ``When
am I meeting her?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty, now a lawyer in Manhattan but forever an older
brother, decided such a meeting made sense. ``He had a seriousness
that a lot of other guys didn't have, a sense of where he wanted to
go,'' Moriarty said, which was reflected by his dedication to his
family. ``What he was doing was not what a lot of unmarried guys in
their early 20s wanted to spend their time doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was arranged for some law school students, among them Lazio,
to meet some nurses, including Patricia Moriarty, at a bar near
George Washington University Medical Center. The son of a Suffolk
County politico started talking with the daughter of a New York
City police officer, then walked her to the hospital, where she was
working the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably took him about a good month to call,'' she later
said. And so began a slow-paced relationship.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio's interest in someday running for office had
grown so strong that he wrote a letter to James L. Buckley, a
conservative former New York senator, seeking advice _ a brash move
that yielded a lunch meeting. While becoming a prosecutor was an
honorable choice, he recalled the veteran politician telling him,
someone interested in elective office should work instead on a few
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I did just the opposite,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He landed a summer job with Patrick Henry, the Suffolk County
district attorney and a Republican. ``He had known my dad,'' Lazio
said. ``And I'm sure _ though he never said it _ I'm sure it
probably had something to do with that he felt that it was a nice
thing to do for somebody in need.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas, a prominent
lawyer and the mother of a toddler named Chelsea. And Lazio was on
the verge of becoming an assistant district attorney who each
morning packed the court papers he needed and the lunch prepared by
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a nice sandwich with lettuce and some healthy
fruit,'' recalled Marcy Rudner Flores, who shared a cubicle with
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raisins,'' Lazio said sheepishly. ``The transitional food: not
quite a candy or a fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores recalled Lazio's being the office ``golden boy'' who was
always there to encourage others. Henry, now a state Supreme Court
justice, described him as an able prosecutor who rose to become the
office's executive assistant _ and an attentive son, often seen
pushing his father in a wheelchair at Republican events.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1985, Lazio won a conviction in a felony case against
the ringleader of a major bootleg record album business. The next
month, his father died, at 65. The obituary in Newsday included a
statement from Nixon that said, in part, that ``the Nixon family
has lost a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a generous gesture, Lazio said, considering that Nixon
barely knew his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Road to Congress
</P>
<P>
   In late summer 1988, Lazio left the district attorney's office
to open a general practice law firm in Babylon. It was time, he
later said, to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there was Patricia Moriarty, whose photograph he
kept on his desk. The casual long-distance relationship had
recently become more serious. She said she told him, ``You need to
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought about it long and hard, and we stopped dating for a
couple of months,'' she said. ``Then he came back one day and said:
`I really thought about this. I want to marry, but I'm not ready at
this point.'''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, in January 1989, Lazio proposed at the Rainbow
Room. They would marry in June the following year and move into a
ranch house in Brightwaters, just three miles east of his mother's
house.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Then there were his political aspirations. Henry, his former
boss, was stepping down amid a state investigation into the
office's sloppy practices. And so Lazio, all of 30 years old,
spread the word that he wanted to run for district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party committee instead chose James M. Catterson,
a man almost twice Lazio's age, but strongly hinted that he had a
future.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, he easily won an open seat in the Suffolk
County Legislature, thus joining an 18-member panel known for
preferring an in-your-face style of democracy. Shouting is common.
A member once struck a colleague with a pocketbook; another once
dropped some tissues on an opponent's desk, a sly reference to
tears shed during a previous argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely participating in the grandstanding was the gentleman from
West Islip, who was exceedingly friendly and always immaculately
dressed. Alan Binder, a legislator, remembered being so obsessed
with the perfect dimple in Lazio's tie that he confronted his
colleague in a parking lot and demanded that he share his sartorial
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then,'' he said, ``I have had a dimple in my tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his party had the majority in the County Legislature,
some former colleagues say that Lazio's legacy does not go much
beyond the dimple now found in Binder's tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked to not get out in front of the controversial
issues,'' Paul Sabatino, a Republican and the counsel to the County
Legislature, recalled. ``He was a pleasant person, but he left no
fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondra M. Bachety, a former Democratic leader in the Legislature
who sat next to Lazio, agreed. ``He would speak about things and
sound very sincere, but I never found him to be a stand-up guy in
that respect,'' she said. ``He didn't take the tough votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio cited several accomplishments, from helping to revitalize
downtown Bay Shore to working to recognize the sacrifice of
reservists during Desert Storm. Besides, he said, he served only
one two-year term. In 1992, during his second term, he ran for
Congress against a fellow West Islip High School graduate who had
become a Washington institution: Tom Downey.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years in office, Downey, who was usually elected by
huge margins, was one of the most effective members of Congress and
served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Back on Long
Island, however, more than a few thought he had become distant, too
caught up with the clubbiness of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk Republican leadership basically told Rick Lazio the
eager politician: go ahead, kid, give it a shot. But shortly
afterward, the same leadership delivered a message to Rick Lazio
the legislator: support its budget bailout package, a plan that
included an increase in the sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio refused on principle, he said, and not because he was
concerned about how a vote for a tax increase would hurt him on
Election Day. He simply did not like borrowing money for operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But many said the county had no choice, including Michael D.
O'Donohoe, the conservative Republican who headed the Finance
Committee at the time. ``He kept saying there must be another
way,'' he said, ``which used to drive me up the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The bailout package eventually passed, but not before Republican
leaders vowed to get even. When the Lazio campaign held a large
fund-raising dinner at LaSalle Military Academy in Oakdale,
prominent Republicans boycotted the event, leaving the uneaten
canapes to remind him that he could expect only lukewarm support.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican freeze-out of 1992 has become part of the Lazio
lore, feeding the legend that he was a David to Downey's Goliath.
In fact, he received significant financial help from a national
Republican operation that smelled blood. And he waged an aggressive
campaign that belied his boyish manner, accusing Downey of abusing
his position by overdrawing checks from the House bank, of
overusing his mailing privileges and of taking government-sponsored
junkets. (Such trips are common, but ABC News had recently
broadcast images of Downey on a Jet Ski during one such trip to
Barbados.)
</P>
<P>
   Downey said recently that Lazio was ``an affable, friendly
fellow,'' but that ``when you scratched the surface, there was not
a lot there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, ``I made mistakes _ the trip to Barbados, the
House banking scandal _ and the economy was in such poor shape.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Downey said, the myth that Lazio was woefully
underfinanced galls him the most. The national Republican
leadership had dedicated ``extraordinary resources'' to the race,
he said. ``The amount of money he spent made a material
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Bond, who was then the chairman of the Republican
National Committee, declined to say how much was spent on the Lazio
campaign. But, he added, ``I took it as my cause to do everything
within legal boundaries to fund that race.''
</P>
<P>
   In late January 1993, the country had a new president, Bill
Clinton, and a new first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And the 2nd
Congressional District of New York had a new representative, a
gangly young man with a beguiling smile and a reputation as a
giant-killer. His new Republican colleagues bathed him in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Alliances and Ambitions
</P>
<P>
   Eight years in Congress have matured Rick Lazio, beyond the gray
hair just now appearing at his temples. He is the representative
credited with steering a law to overhaul the federal public-housing
policy; the mediator between the conservative Republican leadership
and the moderate members known as the ``lunch bunch''; a deputy
majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Paul A. Equale, a prominent insurance lobbyist who generally
supports Democrats, said of Lazio: ``Unlike many of them, he really
gets his hands dirty in terms of legislative issues. He gives
direction to his staff, not the other way around. He understands
both the politics and the policy, and is generally working hard on
both.''
</P>
<P>
   And the traits that he first exhibited during his years at
Vassar _ establishing many relationships, avoiding controversy,
choosing his causes _ have served him well.
</P>
<P>
   With the Democrats controlling the House his first two years,
Lazio often supported the policies of President Clinton. In 1994,
when Newt Gingrich and the Republicans won control, he became more
conservative. When several Republican factions were vying for the
House leadership in 1998, he lobbied hard for the majority leader,
Dick Armey, a rock-solid conservative from Texas who is rarely
mistaken as a friend to the interests of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lazio's credentials as a moderate are sometimes
called into question. In late 1998, for example, he surprised many
in his district by voting for two of the four articles of
impeachment against his future opponent's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that his alliance with Armey smacks of opportunism
and forces him to lean conservative on tough votes, but Lazio is
unapologetic. Friendship is at the root of a relationship that also
helps him in his legislative duties, he said: ``You have the
ability to be around the leadership table and provide another
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Lazio's persona as Everybody's Friend, he has had
his share of battles over the years and is known for being a
demanding, driven boss. ``I'm not a yeller,'' he said, ``but I'm
pretty demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also that bubbling ambition, reflected in the way he
persisted in promoting himself as a Senate candidate _ even after
the state Republican leadership cast its lot with Giuliani _ and in
the way he seeks publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his New York colleagues still grumble that he took most
of the credit for getting federal reimbursement for the money
Suffolk County spent in the aftermath of the Trans World Airlines
Flight 800 disaster. They say that Rep. Michael Forbes deserved
credit for seeking the appropriation; besides, the plane crash was
in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't going to happen with Mike Forbes,'' Lazio said of
the appropriation. ``Trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in finally winning what he has lusted for these last
few years _ the Republican nomination for Senate _ Lazio is
learning that every photo opportunity, every vote, every move, is
under scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking
into a profitable investment he made a few years ago, and even his
struggle to restrain that disobedient forelock has become
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lazio seems to be moving even faster than usual.
Dimitri Cruz recalled seeing his old Vassar classmate at their 20th
reunion last month. ``We gave each other a hug, said hello,'' he
said. ``And he kept on running, kept shaking hands.''

TEACHERS' UNIONS ENDORSE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill.)   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After months of supportive speeches, fat donation
checks and thousands of hours of volunteer campaign work, the two
national teachers' unions formally endorsed Vice President Al Gore
for president Tuesday in separate votes.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements came as no surprise, but could prove
significant in a campaign in which both candidates are making
education a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore the union backing is an important symbol of support
from the Democratic Party's traditional base and a significant
organizing tool for the coming months. But while the vice president
will try to use the endorsements to show that his education agenda
reflects the opinions of classroom experts, his opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, will undoubtedly accuse Gore of being in
the unions' pockets and uninterested in true school reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs more than unions,'' said Mindy Tucker, a campaign
spokeswoman for Bush, a Republican. ``He needs the support of
parents and school board members and people in local communities
that make the decisions that affect our schools. It takes more than
an endorsement to improve education in America.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, both candidates have been trying to one-up each
other with education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to provide preschool for every 4-year-old, give
teachers who agree to work in difficult schools signing bonuses and
pump federal money into school construction projects, plus a host
of other ideas whose costs total $115 billion over a decade. Bush
would spend far less, some $13 billion, and focus his attention on
holding low-performing schools accountable by imposing financial
penalties and heightening scrutiny of test data, particularly among
minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chasms between the candidates are their positions on
providing vouchers, financed by taxpayers, for tuition in private
schools, an issue that alone might have been enough to decide the
union endorsements. Bush refrains from using the word ``vouchers,''
but would let students at failing schools take $1,500 of government
money to pay for tuition at a private school, while Gore opposes
vouchers, as do the unions.
</P>
<P>
   At the biennial convention of the American Federation of
Teachers here Tuesday afternoon, Nat LaCour, the union's executive
vice president, ticked off issue after issue, such as increasing
teacher salaries and providing better health care for children. On
each one, La Cour said, Gore was a friend of the union's 1 million
members, ``Not Mr. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker lavished praise on the vice president, who
is scheduled to speak here on Wednesday and at the convention of
the 2.5 million-member National Education Association, in Chicago,
on Thursday. Several Texas teachers told their colleagues that
Bush's accomplishments in schools have been exaggerated. Finally,
one man recommended no endorsement, saying that the Clinton
administration's trade policies have expanded child labor overseas,
but the endorsement was overwhelming on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the NEA convention in Chicago, the vice president received 89
percent of the votes cast by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the search for ideas to improve public education, Al Gore
knows where to look first,'' said Robert Chase, the president of
the NEA. ``He looks to teachers.''

   Consumers May See Higher Heating Bills This Winter
</P>
<P>
   After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for
another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and
natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to
heat American homes. With demand for fuel and electricity soaring,
natural gas prices have nearly doubled in the last year, to their
highest levels in more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen
10 percent just in the last month. This winter, many homeowners
could discover that it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their
homes than it did last year.

   Of Parachutes and Software
</P>
<P>
   Did you hear the one about the optimistic sky diver? No, this is
no joke. Thomas Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems, a maker
of e-business application software, compares sky diving to taking
business risks. He also likens house painting to the software
business. And he says that as a result of his Midwestern
sensibilities and lessons about hard work and debt, he prefers real
business attire for business dealings and hopes his employees never
boast about all the Ferraris parked in their lot.
</P>
<P>
   European Companies Eye U.S.
</P>
<P>
   First The conventional wisdom has been that European companies,
newly emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at home,
would use Wall-Street-style tactics in cross-border deals unifying
the Continent. But not following the script, European companies
have increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the
United States first.

   APB Online, operator of a criminal justice news Web site that
recently foundered, plans to file for protection for creditors
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Last month, ABP
Online laid off the staff and scrambled to find private investors
to inject new capital into the debt-ridden company. The bankruptcy
filing, which the executives of APBnews.com said they would

   Record Delays in June for Airlines
</P>
<P>
   June appears to have been the worst month in domestic airline
history for delayed flights, preliminary statistics from the
Federal Aviation Administration indicate. In general, bad weather
accounts for about 70 percent of flight delays, which are the bane
of business travel. The big question now is whether the trend will
continue as record numbers of passengers crowd onto planes.

AS PUBLIC CELEBRATES FREEDOM, HOSPITALIZED VETERANS PAY THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-JULY4) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sign in the veterans hospital in Brooklyn reads:
``The Price of Freedom Is Visible Here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Americans were supposed to remember. On Tuesday,
hundreds of thousands of people celebrated on the shores of New
York Harbor as they watched one of the largest armadas ever
assembled. Meanwhile, fewer than two dozen people went to see the
men of war and military service who sat silently in the beds and
halls and doorways of the Veterans Administration Hospital, unable
to see the flotilla from their windows as it passed underneath the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge just a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   These men passed the morning inhaling the smell of antiseptic
and the stench of bedpans, listening to the mumblings of the dying,
lying in bed watching the beautiful boats on their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ward 8 is the cancer precinct, and the men there wait for
disease to do what fighting wars could not. To a man, they said
they were disappointed that their sacrifices _ some fought, some
served, none regretted any of it _ were not appreciated more, that
there was no band playing, that there was no child's hand to hold.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were lonely.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Spangled Banner played on a television and its melody
drifted down the hall. The music came from the room of Frank
Pardal, 54, who held his eyes closed. He breathed from a tube while
his lips mouthed the words. When the music was over, he opened his
eyes. He was alone. There were pictures of the boats sailing by on
his screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy mackerel, that's big holiday stuff,'' he said. ``They
look like a bunch of birds out there, those boats do.''
</P>
<P>
   He cleared his tube and wiped his fingers on the sheets. ``It
don't mean nothing to me, though. Independence Day. It don't mean
nothing to anyone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardal served from 1965 to 1968 in West Germany for the Army. He
came home to Staten Island, worked laboring jobs and then was hit
by a car. That's when they found the cancer. He has not left the
hospital in months. And no one has come to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you the truth though, I wish I was out there looking at
those long beauties go by, having a cold one and a dog and holding
my girl's hand,'' he said. ``Even if I could get out of bed, what
could I do? I got a view of an air conditioning unit.''
</P>
<P>
   No one likes to hear about self-deception and disappointment and
grief, said Eddie Murach, 72, a retired sergeant major who served
in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. But, he says, that is precisely
what war is, that is precisely what Ward 8 is. Because whatever war
it was, Murach said, however long it lasted, it changed men from
scrawny hometown clerks into men who know the fragility of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for these guys down the hall,'' he said.
``They've got no one.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant is one of the lucky ones. He has his wife, Mary
Ellen. He met her at a root beer stand in rural Indiana. He sat in
his Buick. She sat in the next car over. That was 47 years, three
children and six grandchildren ago.
</P>
<P>
   She washed him Tuesday morning and brought him a pair of
binoculars to watch the ships. But the day was hazy and the windows
stained with soot. The armada might as well have been in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Murach insisted he was no hero. A 30-year veteran of the Army,
Murach started his career with the Japanese occupation. He was part
of the Chosin Reservoir Campaign in Korea when the conflict broke
out in 1950. He slept in a frozen hole for 60 days. The Army had
given its men summer gear for a winter campaign and he watched as
men died of exposure. Then the Chinese poured down the ridge, the
batallion pulled out, were re-outfitted and pushed back in.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Vietnam. ``I was 40, and I had to volunteer because
they wouldn't send me,'' he said, laying bare-chested in bed. The
boats below sailed by. ``I figured it was a career for me and they
were taking guys who didn't want to go. I felt it was my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He has cancer _ probably caused by exposure to Agent Orange, he
said the doctors told him. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and
two Bronze Stars with valor. He spends part of his time in the
hospital, part of his time as a high school baseball coach. He
loves Buicks and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more blessings than I'm entitled to,'' Murach said as
he squeezed his wife's hand. ``I do wish that all of us could go
outside for just a moment and get a gander of those ships.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 veterans stayed in the hospitals last year,
according to Veterans Administration statistics, and 35 million
outpatients visited its clinics. Statistics on visitors are not
kept. But Sgt. Clifford Newman of the Federal Police Department,
who patrolled the empty lobby Tuesday morning, said the respect for
people in uniform had declined drastically over the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of freedom is not cheap,'' the sergeant said.
``People could invest a little time. Instead of spending the whole
day watching the boats go by and lighting off firecrackers, people
should have thought to visit a vet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Passaro sat in a chair in the doorway of his room. ``I'm
just going to sit here and watch the floors dry,'' he said. ``It's
a cruel, cruel thing to have those boats going by and us locked up
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Passaro is 84. He said he saw more action at the horse track
than in the Second World War as a supply clerk. And now that he is
alone and has no visitors, he wishes he had conducted his life
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a crumb, I admit that,'' he said. ``But even a crumb
needs company.''

VICTOR IN MEXICO PLANS TO OVERHAUL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MEXICO-POLITICS) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The president-elect of Mexico, Vicente Fox,
announced plans Tuesday to rebuild the country's federal law
enforcement system, moving it toward a U.S. model of justice as a
way to wipe out corruption that has crippled his nation for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said that he would travel to the United States soon to
meet with President Clinton, and both major presidential candidates
to press his proposal to open the U.S.-Mexico border to a
less-restricted flow of immigrants. The president-elect also
explained some of the measures his new government would take to
deal with a range of Mexico's most persistent and complex troubles,
including the fight against poverty, efforts to stem the flow of
drugs through Mexico and the unresolved conflict in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour news conference by Fox, whose election on Sunday
ended a 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
turned into a wide-ranging foreign policy address. But his most
detailed proposals centered on his fight against corruption, a
problem he considers a top priority. To accomplish the overhaul, he
is likely to use executive powers that allow him to create a
federal police agency and to shift law enforcement responsibilities
from one agency to another.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he said that he would create a Ministry of
Security and Justice _ similar to the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation _ that would be responsible for all the federal
police.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's plans would also significantly reduce the powers of the
Interior Ministry, which currently manages a recently created
federal police force. And the attorney general's office would be
similarly weakened, not only by the removal of its control over
federal law enforcement, but also by Fox's plans to create a new
agency of federal prosecutors to manage investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Because his ideas have widespread support, Fox's transformation
of the system is also expected to be well-received in the Mexican
Congress, even though the Congress is no longer dominated by any
single political party following Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   During his wide-ranging comments, Fox brought up his goal of
greater cooperation among the United States, Mexico and Canada. He
suggested the creation of a North American common market that would
allow a freer flow of merchandise and workers, with strict
adherence to standards for the protection of the environment, law
enforcement and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that both of us have lost sight of the
goal,'' said Fox, referring to the United States and Mexico. ``The
United States' goal has been to put up walls, police and soldiers
to fight immigration. That can't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's goal has been to open an escape valve, allowing
350,000 young people to cross the border each year and washing its
hands of any responsibility,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are serious,'' Fox concluded, ``The least we can do is
sit down and say, `this is the problem' and the goal is to close
the development gap.''
</P>
<P>
   In his answers to reporters' questions, Fox also offered
specific proposals for improving U.S.-Mexican relations, including
extending the benefits of NAFTA more evenly to small businesses on
both sides of the border and turning the drug certification program
from a unilateral to a multilateral process involving all countries
affected by trafficking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that in the next two months, he will use five
international head-hunting firms to help him select the members of
his Cabinet so that leading up to his Dec. 1 inauguration, they can
work side-by-side with the ministers they will replace. A team of
aides to Fox have also been assigned to work with the current
leaders of the Finance Ministry on setting next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to transform the law enforcement system, Fox's plans
could be upset by a backlash from below, where bureaucrats and
officers enjoy strong civil service protections.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo reorganized and renamed the nation's
drug police at least twice, and each time traffickers quickly
infiltrated the forces and bought off leading officials. And
Zedillo created a new federal police force to fight a mounting wave
of federal crimes, including kidnapping. But so far the new police
have done little to make Mexicans, especially those in larger
cities, feel any safer.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Chabat, an analyst of Mexican law enforcement praised
Fox's plan to take the federal police out of the hands of
politicians, who used the agents for their own agendas. He said he
felt some pessimism over whether the new system would be resistant
to the corrupting forces of drug traffickers. But, he said,
``Someone has to try to fight them. The truth is whatever the
government tries, it will face a problem with the corruption of
traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of assurance to the Mexican military, Fox also said
he would not consider appointing a civilian as chief of the
Ministry of Defense. ``I see no reason to break a tradition that
has brought stability to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   On other domestic issues, Fox said he wanted to visit Chiapas as
soon as possible and reopen peace talks with the Zapatista rebels,
and he said that he was willing to consider one of the rebels'
principal demands to withdraw the military from rural areas of
conflict in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting poverty was another area that Fox called a priority and
he said that as president he would not approve budgets or program
proposals from members of his Cabinet unless they could demonstrate
in concrete terms how their programs would help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be our way to pay attention to the groups that have
been totally excluded from the development of our country,'' he
said. ``It is one of the strong principles that we are going to
introduce in the decision-making process of the new government.''
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing his commitment to fighting corruption, Fox turned
the spotlight not only on the past, but also on his administration
and its future. He announced that he would create a ``Commission of
Transparency,'' made up of Mexican citizens whose job would be to
investigate high-profile scandals of past administrations as well
as to serve as a watchdog over his own government.
</P>
<P>
   But he was careful to make clear that he would not conduct
wholesale investigations of government conduct before taking
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to waste our government looking only at the
past and conducting witch hunts that could be misinterpreted,'' Fox
said in the press conference at the presidential residence, Los
Pinos. The transparency commission, he added, would be his
government's way to ``set its sights forward, to construct a
harmonious government and also to make an accounting of the past.''

PAUL HATFIELD, 72, MONTANA JUDGE AND SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Wash., Nev.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Gerhart Hatfield, a senior U.S. district judge in Montana
who, as a Democratic Party senator in 1978, provided the decisive
67th vote to ratify the Panama Canal treaties, died on Monday at
his home in Great Falls, Mont. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause was a heart attack, the local coroner's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield was the chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court in
Helena when Gov. Thomas L. Judge named him to the U.S. Senate. He
filled a vacancy opened in January 1978 by the death of Montana
Democrat Lee Metcalf, who had personally recommended the judge as
his successor.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpired term had only a year left, but Hatfield made
history when he announced after just 53 days in the Senate that he
would vote to cede the canal to Panamanian sovereignty. The
announcement branded him ``the 67th senator,'' and treaty opponents
did not let him forget it, dubbing him ``Panama Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters, including President Jimmy Carter, had dined
and lobbied the novice lawmaker, but he said the decision was his
alone. Indeed, he said, ``that's what a judge's life is, making
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   By then he had declared his candidacy for a full term, but well
after Rep. Max Baucus had done so. In the primary campaign, the
Democratic contenders found nothing but good to say about each
other, but an anti-treaty groundswell gripped Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's campaign turned into a shambles. Baucus walked away
with the nomination and remains in the Senate today. He remembered
his fellow Montanan as ``one of the most decent and thoughtful
people I've had the privilege of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield had run for office only once before, in a sedate and
affordable campaign for the Montana Supreme Court. He returned
there as a staff attorney in 1979, but later that year Carter named
him to the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana.

 &HT;    Giants' Kent comes from way back; others wait
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fans' All-Star votes have been counted, with Jeff
Kent of San Francisco coming from far behind to win the start at
second base for the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Managers Bobby Cox and Joe Torre must
pick the pitching staffs and reserves for Tuesday's All-Star Game
at Turner Field In Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The complete NL and AL squads will be announced today. As
always, there will be plenty of disappointed players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost an impossible job,'' said Cox, managing the
National League team for the fifth time. ``I'm sure that there will
be 10 or 12 people upset. You can't blame them. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones was the only Braves' player voted in, winning by a
landslide at third base. As many as four teammates might make the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I hope we get five in the game,'' said pitcher Tom
Glavine, who is on the bubble. ``With the game here, it makes it
extra special. You see the ovations players get in their home parks
and you can't help wanting that, too. Especially if you have spent
your whole career with one team, like I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said he ``feels good'' about his chances after beating
the Mets 10-2 Sunday to improve his record to 8-5 and lower his ERA
to 3.62. The left-hander pitches Friday in Boston and will be
well-rested for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Although he pitches again Sunday, Greg Maddux is a cinch to make
the team. Other deserving Braves are first baseman Andres
Galarraga, coming back from treatment for cancer, and outfielder
Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, who leads the NL in RBIs, overcame a 138,000-vote deficit
in the final week to overtake Houston's Craig Biggio and Edgardo
Alfonzo of the Mets at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Ballpark voting closed last Tuesday, but fans could vote through
Saturday on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   At first base in the American League, Jason Giambi of Oakland
held off Cleveland's Jim Thome. Giambi and Kansas City outfielder
Jermaine Dye, a former Brave, are the only starters who will be
playing in their first All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the leading vote getter in each league was a
catcher. Pudge Rodriguez of Texas led the AL with 2,808,456 votes.
Mike Piazza of the Mets led the NL with 2,780,452 votes.
</P>
<P>
   THE FACTS
</P>
<P>
   What: Major League All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 8 p.m. EDT Tuesday; Turner Field, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   TV: NBC.
</P>

BLOCKED BY CONGRESS, CLINTON WIELDS A PEN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Utah, Ariz., Calif., Neb., Pa., Wash., Ore., Alaska)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress appears intent on denying President
Clinton major legislative victories in his final months in office,
but White House officials say they will continue drafting and
carrying out policies, Congress or no Congress, until Clinton's
final day.
</P>
<P>
   Through executive orders, memorandums, proclamations,
regulations and other flexing of presidential power, Clinton has
already put in effect a host of measures concerning the
environment, health care and civil rights. And with the
presidential campaign in high gear, and the Republican-controlled
Congress not inclined to give Democrats any boost, Clinton's aides
intend to continue making policy by decree _ putting federal land
off limits to development, reorganizing government agencies,
tightening pollution control rules and pushing other measures that
would otherwise stand little chance of congressional passage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been especially frustrated that many of his nominees
for judgeships, ambassadorships and other posts have failed to be
confirmed by the Senate. But he is not surrendering in that area
either. If Congress fails to act on some of the nominations later
this month, White House aides say they expect the president to make
recess appointments in August that would require no congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president will be signing executive orders right up until
the morning of Jan. 20, 2001,'' said Bruce N. Reed, the president's
domestic policy adviser. ``In our experience, when the
administration takes executive action, it not only leads to results
while the political process is stuck in neutral, but it often spurs
Congress to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, in a radio address on high prices for gasoline
and other fuels, Clinton said that if Congress did not act, he
would use his own authority to create a home-heating-oil reserve to
help avoid shortages in the Northeast. The House has approved such
a reserve, but the Senate has not acted on the proposal. Clinton
said he had asked Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ``to take the
steps necessary to create a reserve through administrative
authority if Congress does fail to act, so that a heating oil
reserve will be in place next winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal of executive actions these days, of course, is to
aid Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. It was Clinton who
signed the order earlier this year granting increased protection to
250,000 acres of federal land in Oregon and Washington state. But
it was Gore who announced the creation of the Cascade-Siskiyou and
Hanford Reach National Monuments, an act that pleased
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his seven and a half years as president,
Clinton has signed an average of about one executive order or other
policy-making declaration a week, or 450 in all, according to the
Office of Management and Budget. That far exceeds the executive
actions taken by former Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan,
whose orders riled congressional Democrats just as much as
Clinton's have angered Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this president is doing is pretty typical when
Congress is controlled by the other party,'' said Louis Fisher, who
has studied executive authority for the Congressional Research
Service. ``Certainly, Nixon did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that presidents in both parties have engaged in the
practice _ President George Washington, a Federalist, issued the
first one in 1793 dealing with American neutrality in the war
between Britain and France _ does not assuage the frustration on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers argue that the Constitution gives them, not Clinton,
the authority to pass laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I disagree with the president on many of the
issues, the bigger concern is the erosion of the foundation that
our founding fathers put in place,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
``It's very dangerous for a president to implement policy by
essentially debasing the constitutional structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have complained most fervently about Clinton's
liberal use of the Antiquities Act of 1906 to protect ``objects of
historic and scientific interest.'' The protests began in earnest
in 1996 when Clinton set up the 1.7 million-acre Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, which was opposed by
Republican lawmakers in the state. Recent presidential directives
protect land in California, Arizona and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton points to his predecessors to justify his approach.
President Jimmy Carter, for instance, signed an order creating a
national monument in Alaska that exceeded 53 million acres. Clinton
now holds the record for total land set aside in the lower 48
states.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, asked about whether he was overstepping his role,
Clinton delivered an impromptu history of the executive branch that
compared his actions with those of other presidents. Clinton
acknowledged that his office has grown over the years, but he said
many of his predecessors had advanced the power of the presidency
without interrupting the constitutional balance envisioned by the
founders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that Thomas Jefferson had agreed to the Louisiana
Purchase for a sum that was roughly the total annual budget for the
federal government at the time. ``Can you imagine what the Congress
would say if I said I want to buy a little land but it will only
cost $1.8 trillion?'' Clinton said with a smile. (In fact, the
treaty with France to cede its vast territories to the United
States had to be ratified by the Senate, and Congress passed a
number of laws in 1803 to carry out the transaction.)
</P>
<P>
   No consensus has emerged on Capitol Hill on whether future
presidents ought to be reined in. Legislation limiting the acres
that presidents can protect with the stroke of a pen cleared the
House but not the Senate. Bills requiring Clinton to justify his
executive orders to Congress or win subsequent approval from
lawmakers have also stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Just once has a court ruled that Clinton has overstepped his
bounds, after he signed an order in 1995 that banned awarding
federal contracts to employers that permanently replace striking
employees. Several members of Congress filed suit to block another
order to protect rivers, but a federal court ruled that the
lawmakers' injury was ``clearly institutional rather than
personal.'' In another instance, the House voted in 1998 to deny
money to carry out an executive order dealing with when the federal
government could get involved in state and local matters. Clinton
later withdrew the order.
</P>
<P>
   Executive actions can be undone just as quickly as they were put
in effect. But White House officials say a future president would
face political constraints against reducing protections on federal
lands. On other matters, Clinton himself showed how quickly
presidential declarations can disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Clinton took office in 1993, he told Donna Shalala,
secretary for health and human services, to overturn former
President Bush's moratorium on federal financing of research
involving fetal tissues from induced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have little doubt that the next president, whether it
is Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will continue the pattern
of past presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the romance with the executive order is
restricted to the Clinton White House,'' said Rep. George W. Gekas,
R-Pa., who has held hearings on the issue. ``Every president has
used them. Some, though, have used more restraint than others.''

MORE OFF-DUTY OFFICERS RIDING IN MOTORCYCLE GANGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are police officers by trade, but their
appearance, as a group, does not exactly shout law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is the tattoos and beards. Or the bandanas and bare,
barrel chests. Or the black leather vests crowned with the likeness
of a tusked boar in mid-snarl. Or the V-Twin Harley-Davidson
cruisers equipped with shotgun dual exhausts and tuned to scorch
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is their name: The Wild Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been stopped by police officers out of state,'' said
one Wild Pig who asked to remain anonymous. ``We tell them, `Hey,
we're cops,' and they say, `Really? You guys are cops?' And two
hours later they are at our barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1,400 members in 80 chapters, the Wild Pigs are one of two
increasingly popular, national motorcycle clubs that draw their
members from the law enforcement ranks. The second club, known as
the Blue Knights, is even larger, with 11,630 members in 373
chapters, including dozens of chapters in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a world infatuated with stereotypes, police biker clubs
illustrate that the universe of officers includes more than a few
free spirits for whom rebellion has become a weekend pastime.
During riding season, from April to October, Wild Pigs and Blue
Knights, and smaller clubs like the Lawmen and Celtic Law, organize
trips as ambitious as a weeklong pilgrimage to Daytona Beach and as
modest as an evening spin to Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand bikers, primarily police officers, poured into that
New York neighborhood on the night of June 28, roaring through the
Holland Tunnel from New Jersey, as part of Gooch's Garlic Run, a
ride sponsored by the Blue Knights to benefit sick children. The
bike procession stretched 14 miles along Route 80, organizers said.
Then the leather-clad riders filled Mulberry Street trattorias to
overflowing. Manhattan may not be a place that routinely welcomes
bellowing choppers, but this night there were few complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a family on the corner who wanted to know what was going
on,'' said Anthony Fontana, manager of Caffe Napoli. ``I told them,
these are cops and they come here once a year. They smiled. If this
had been some other group they would have turned around and left.''
</P>
<P>
   As motorcyclists, the Wild Pigs and the Blue Knights share a
taste for a face full of wind, the freedom of the open road, the
embrace of the wide, blue sky and the brotherhood of bikes and
babes in black leather. As public safety officers, both active and
retired, they share an interest in supporting the families of
fallen colleagues and raising money for charity. The Blue Knights,
for example, say they have raised nearly $3 million in cash for
charity since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But there are distinctions between the clubs as well. The Blue
Knights, who were founded 26 years ago in Bangor, Maine, are a
G-rated bunch, as motorcycle clubs go. Club members, a range of law
enforcement professionals, including correction officers, wear
leather vests, or ``colors,'' that are an unthreatening shade of
powder blue. Their logo is a knight atop a rearing white horse. One
of their slogans is: ``There are no strangers, only friends you
haven't met.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You ride safe and you are courteous,'' said Joseph Edelmann, a
Blue Knight who retired from the New York City Police Department 13
years ago and rides with Chapter 7, which covers Queens, Staten
Island and Brooklyn. The 70 members (about half of them New York
Police Department officers, both active and retired) meet monthly
at a diner on Emmons Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to change the whole outlook on bikers,''
Edelmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Pigs have adopted a more intimidating look, a la the
Oakland Raiders, and their manner is more full-throttle. Posted on
one Wild Pig Web site, for example, alongside the club bylaws and
photos of noteworthy bikes, are occasional snapshots of women in
abbreviated attire bending over to grab a beer.
</P>
<P>
   The club was born in San Jose, Calif., 13 years after the Blue
Knights, and it accepts a variety of public safety personnel as
members, including firefighters, as long as they ride American-made
bikes, usually Harleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to portray us as a bunch of knuckle draggers
wearing leather jackets,'' said one Wild Pig. ``The reality is that
it's a fraternal organization of people who share a common
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Buck, 37, editor of Thunder Press East, a monthly
motorcycle newspaper, said the Wild Pigs drew members from those
who thought the Blue Knights were too strait-laced. ``They wanted
black vests instead of blue,'' she said. ``They wanted a little bit
of the bad boy image.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck recalled riding to the annual nationwide motorcycle rally
in Sturgis, S.D., in 1996 when a traffic jam in western
Pennsylvania forced her and some Wild Pigs to take a break along
the road, not far from a state trooper. ``I reach in and pull out a
bottle of water,'' she said. ``They are popping beers on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Blazer, a Wild Pig from Chicago who is the club's spokesman
and lawyer, said the incident, if true, was an aberration. ``Our
members are sensitive that they live under a microscope,'' he said,
``so they are incredibly careful and scrupulous about the creation
of any false impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, like the Blue Knights, the Wild Pigs organize benefits
for charity each year, with each chapter involved in staging at
least one. The Westchester chapter, one of eight in New York State,
will be holding a pig roast in August for Nick Springer, a
15-year-old boy from Croton-on-Hudson who lost his hands and the
lower part of his legs last year to a bacterial disease. The boy's
father, Gary Springer, said the club just sent him a letter one
day, out of the blue, offering its help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great group of guys,'' he said, ``and it's obvious
that they care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Membership in either club is not an issue with the New York City
Police Department. ``Officers are allowed to join fraternal clubs
or organizations at their own discretion as long as they do not
engage in any criminality,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Wild Pigs were willing to be interviewed for
this article. Only one, Blazer, would agree to be quoted by name.
He said the club had been victimized in the past by bad press and
overzealousness by a small circle of motorcycle gang investigators
who had chased some unfounded rumors about unsavory activities.
Some of the suspicion, he said, stemmed from a member's brief lapse
in judgment seven years ago when he posed for a picture with a
Hell's Angel, who was his cousin. The Wild Pig was later kicked out
of the club because contact with outlaw bikers is banned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a zero tolerance policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Wild Pigs do not chase trouble, it has found them on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   In May, two Wild Pigs from Washington, D.C., who were in New
York for a charity event were wounded, although not seriously, in a
drive-by shooting at 4 a.m. as they walked outside the Red Rock
West, a biker bar in Chelsea. Investigators said it remained
unclear what led the gunman, in a sports utility vehicle, to open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigators are looking into a report that it might
have stemmed from an altercation several weeks earlier on Long
Island between several Wild Pigs and Hell's Angels after a bike
blessing, an event in which clergy members bless motorcycles to
keep their riders safe. Hours after the blessing, outside a nearby
bar, an argument erupted over whether a Wild Pig had slapped a club
sticker on an Angel's bike, investigators said. There were words,
and by some accounts, punches thrown, but no one ever pressed any
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Blazer said the Wild Pigs who were there that day did not touch
anyone else's bike, which is a mortal sin in the motorcycle world.
A lawyer for the Hell's Angels, Ronald Kuby, said his clients had
no role in the Manhattan shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Pigs and Blue Knights said that in general, they keep their
distance from outlaw bikers and the parties they sponsor, although
they do attend large motorcycle rallies that often draw outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do their thing,'' said one former Wild Pig. ``We do ours.
We don't talk to them or shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   This policy has had breakdowns, however. Three years ago, in
Laconia, N.H., at the town's annual motorcycle rally, a group of
Hell's Angels confronted two Wild Pigs to object that a Wild Pig
had called them ``drug dealers and punks'' in a newspaper article.
The discussion ended peacefully, but police officials have said it
helped set a tone that led to a later brawl in which several Hell's
Angels assaulted uniformed officers patrolling the event.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago at the Laconia rally, there were rumors of
brewing trouble between the Wild Pigs and the Angels, stemming from
the recent incidents in New York, said the town's police chief,
William Baker. A number of Wild Pigs even offered to doff their
colors to avoid an incident, but Baker said he did not think it was
necessary and there were no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our detractors,'' one Wild Pig acknowledged, ``those
that have decided that anyone on a Harley must be some kind of
lowlife.'' In reality, he said, ``we're just a bunch of cops who
like to ride motorcycles.''

ADVERTISING: 20 QUESTIONS ON SLOGANS, COMMERCIALS AND CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is time again to ask 20 questions about
advertising, marketing and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that the Kellogg Co. is sponsoring a promotion with Etrade
Group, centered on a $100 bonus account deposit for consumers who
buy Smart Start cereal, will their next joint venture be a Special
401(K)?
</P>
<P>
   _ How come a newspaper advertisement from FleetBoston Financial
Corp. to promote its status as a sponsor of Major League Baseball,
which reprinted the lyrics of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game,'' was
careful enough to note that the baseball ``trademarks and
copyrights are used with permission'' but misrendered the brand
name Cracker Jack as ``crackerjacks''?
</P>
<P>
   _ How pleased were the staff members of Talk magazine and its
parents, Hearst and Miramax, to see that a recent subscription
offer in a Sunday newspaper insert appeared under a coupon for Tidy
Cats Disposable Cat Box and Litter in One?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Qwest Communications International has merged with U
S West, wouldn't it make for a memorable brand if the combined
company were named West Qwest or Qwest West?
</P>
<P>
   _ How could CBS have promoted the sitcom ``Grapevine'' with
commercials in which the actors said, ``It's like nothing you've
ever seen before'' when it was a remake of a series on the same
network in 1992?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris really believe
parents would rush to buy Capri Sun Fruit Punch Drink Mix because a
line at the bottom of print ads reassured them that the product
``won't stain most fabrics and surfaces''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Chad and Alisha Blondeel of Newaygo, Mich., have
named their son Espen after ESPN, the sports cable television
network, will maternity wards someday soon be filled with babies
named Emteevee, Cy Fi, Pax and Dubbya Bea?
</P>
<P>
   _ And will executives at another cable network try to entice
Espen's parents to nickname him E?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it some kind of inside joke that in a magazine ad for a
promotion sponsored by Miller Lite beer, depicting a living room
furnished with seats from Milwaukee County Stadium, there was a
book on an end table titled ``The Italian Renaissance''?
</P>
<P>
   _ What could have put copywriters in the morbid mood to create
print ads for the Stouffer's Home Style Entrees line of frozen
foods sold by Nestle and the Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup sold by
Campbell Soup Co. that carried the headlines ``Potatoes so good,
you'll think you died and went to heaven'' and ``Quick and easy
quesadillas so delicious, you'll swear you've died and gone to
Acapulco''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that the Army has hired Leo Burnett as its agency, will a
Madison Avenue version of ``Fail-Safe'' include a scene in which
one general frantically shouts to another: ``Call the president!
We've gone to B Com3'' ?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will critics of boy bands cite as proof of their blandness a
decision by Famous Fixins, a company that produces celebrity
licensed products like Britney Spears Bubble Gum, to introduce a
flavored lip balm named after Justin Timberlake of the group 'N
Sync that comes in vanilla?
</P>
<P>
   _ Would The Economist magazine have run an ad poking fun at the
presidential candidacy of Steve Forbes, carrying the headline
``Concise reporting of the naked truth, love handles and all,'' if
Forbes were not president and editor in chief of Forbes magazine,
which competes with The Economist?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. has introduced a brand called
Kenmore Elite, will the next innovation in appliances be a brand
called Sub-Zero Plebeian?
</P>
<P>
   _ When the Nabisco Biscuit unit of Nabisco Holdings introduced a
character named the Honey Maid Bee in ads for Honey Maid Graham
Crackers, did anyone recall the 1950s character Buffalo Bee that
appeared in ads for two Nabisco cereal brands, Wheat Honeys and
Rice Honeys?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the introduction by the Franklin Mint of a model of
Bonnie and Clyde's getaway car _ a 1932 Ford V-8 ``fully authorized
by the Ford Motor Co.'' _ mean that collectors will one day be
offered a Ford Bronco model to commemorate the O.J. Simpson
low-speed chase of 1994?

BUSINESS TRAVEL: WILL NUMBER OF DELAYED FLIGHTS CONTINUE TO GROW? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)

<P>
   June appears to have been the worst month in domestic airline
history for delayed flights, preliminary statistics from the
Federal Aviation Administration indicate. The big question now is,
will the trend continue as record numbers of passengers crowd onto
planes, making this summer even worse than last for the prospect of
getting there on time?
</P>
<P>
   In general, bad weather accounts for about 70 percent of flight
delays, which are the bane of business travel. This June, a
greater-than-normal number of thunderstorms contributed to the
pile-up of delays, which rose sharply against the expectations of
the airline industry and the FAA. Only a month earlier, both had
been pointing hopefully to some signs that things might be
improving after three years of rapidly deteriorating on-time
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In May, for example, delays dropped 7 percent from May 1999.
That was one month after the FAA and the airlines put into place an
ambitious new strategy called the Spring/Summer 2000 Severe Weather
Plan. This allowed the FAA's main traffic center in Virginia to
function as a kind of super control tower to coordinate operations
hour-by-hour with the airlines and help regional radar centers
integrate traffic throughout the nation's air space.
</P>
<P>
   But here are the latest statistics compiled by the FAA just
before the long Fourth of July holiday: From June 1 to June 28,
airlines reported more than 44,000 delays. That compares with about
38,000 delays in the same 28-day period for June of 1999, when a
total of 39,533 flights were delayed for the whole month. The
previous record number of delays _ 45,162 _ came in July of last
year. Given even a routine number of delays during the last two
days of this June, that record will likely be broken when the final
statistics for the month are compiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is try and provide factual information,'' said
Steven J. Brown, the acting associate administrator for air traffic
services at the FAA ``We have a collaborative effort with the
airlines in making the daily plan and adjusting it hourly. If we
failed, we should say it. But if in fact the collaboration is
making a difference, which I believe there is plenty of evidence
for, then we should provide the objective measures to talk about
that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brown said that it was difficult to say whether the plan would
succeed in actually reducing delays this summer over last, since
the June statistics were skewed by an atypical number of
thunderstorms that raked major air corridors in the central and
southwestern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines have cut a small number of flights from their
schedules this summer, partly in anticipation of delays. United
Airlines, which is grappling with a labor dispute in which some
pilots have refused to work overtime, recently canceled more than
4,500 flights throughout the summer. United has about 2,500 flights
a day. Its pilots union has said that the airline unfairly blames
it for flight cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Some other airlines might also reduce their summer schedules,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``United was the first to come out and say for a number of
reasons they felt they needed to rationalize their schedule,'' he
said. ``I know from talking with the airlines over the last week
that others are considering'' dropping some scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, airlines operate on razor-thin profit
margins and are not likely to deliberately cut revenues
significantly, even if it means a summer of mounting flight delays
and unhappy customers.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays are a constant headache for business travelers,
who are the airlines' most lucrative source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Among those delayed in June was Kevin Mitchell, the director of
the Business Travel Coalition, a trade group that lobbies for more
airline competition and lower fares on behalf of businesses. Last
Thursday night, Mitchell cooled his heels in Detroit thanks to a
Northwest Airlines 5:30 p.m. flight that was delayed for hours
before he finally got a 9 p.m. flight on US Airways. The delay
caused him to forego a 7:30 a.m. meeting in Washington the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've had a lot of bad weather in the last 60 days, but
these delays are a real burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, frequent airline delays mean that valuable
employees are ``sitting around for hours unproductive,'' he said,
adding that businesses are also beginning to asses the impact of
delays on employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   A delay is defined by the FAA as a flight that arrives at the
gate more than 15 minutes behind schedule. But average delay times
now exceed an hour, according to industry statistics.
</P>
<P>
   As customers fume, the airline industry has sought to shift much
of the blame to the FAA, which the industry says has been slow in
replacing inadequate technology even as air travel demand has grown
steadily. This year, the FAA estimates, airlines will carry about
640 million passengers in the United States, compared with about
460 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the airlines themselves have been accused of exaggerating
the role of weather in the delay crisis. And frequent fliers know
that on some flights, some airlines have begun adding minutes to
the posted flying times to keep delay statistics in check. As a
result, on days when the airspace is humming efficiently, some
flights arrive well ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messing around with the schedules, padding them a bit to help
improve on-time arrivals, is pretty common in the industry,''
Mitchell said. ``You'll sometimes hear the captain announcing that
we're going to arrive, say 45 minutes early because there's a
strong breeze behind us _ which flies in the face of reason.''
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FAA's Brown said he believed that the new system
was working and that delays could begin to drop this summer ``if by
some miracle the weather turns more favorable during July and
August.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new centralized system, federal air traffic employees
in the 20 regional radar-control centers are for the first time all
using the same technology, thanks to a recently completed
modernization of the agency's computer hardware and software. Other
new air control measures include putting some aircraft into
lower-than-normal altitudes below 30,000 feet _ which marginally
increases capacity but at the cost of fuel efficiency for aircraft
that are routed into those lower altitudes when the system is
crowded, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has a new Web site (www.fly.faa.gov) showing a national
map with links that provide current delay information for more than
30 major U.S. airports. Brown said that the Web site was started in
April ``as part of our new collaborative initiative with the
airlines and, broadly, with the general public to provide more
planning and consumer oriented information.'' He continued, ``It's
updated, hourly or more frequently,'' adding that the information
on the site is reliable enough that ``we use it inside our
facilities for decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation, meanwhile, is working on a
detailed report that will examine the reasons for flight delays and
cancellations, from weather problems to airline staffing,
maintenance, flight-schedule and fare-schedule issues. A
preliminary report submitted to Congress last week documented a 50
percent increase in delays, and a 68 percent increase in
cancellations of flights, over the last five years. At the largest
28 airports, delays exceeding an hour after leaving the gate
increased 130 percent in that period.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Brown said, the FAA and the industry anticipate
``marginal, incremental steps'' aimed at improving on-time
performance. But even in the best of circumstances, assuming
better-than-average flying weather for the rest of the summer, the
new joint government-industry efforts aren't expected to do much
more than barely hold the fort against the ever-increasing number
of airline passengers, either this summer or in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Brown noted, the number of domestic
flights has consistently risen 3 to 4 percent annually. No one
expects that demand to fall in the foreseeable future. And, given
the unlikelihood of new airports being built or additional runways
being added in major air traffic bottlenecks like the eastern
seaboard, no one is predicting a day anytime soon when the system
will be able to easily handle the demands placed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said: ``The questions are: Will demand continue to grow
more than our ability to meet it on an annual basis? Or will demand
slow down a little bit, and we 'll be able to catch up? We have the
ability to increase the capacity of the system, but only at a level
that's a fraction of this annual increase in demand. We've already
done all the easy things.'' &QL;

EUROPEANS SEE ACQUISITIONS IN U.S. AS FASTEST ROUTE TO
TRANSFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The conventional wisdom has been that European
companies, emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at
home, would use Wall Street style tactics in cross-border deals
unifying the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   But not following the script, European companies have
increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the United
States first.
</P>
<P>
   From Vivendi's recent deal to acquire Seagram to Unilever's
agreement to purchase Bestfoods to Terra Network's buyout of Lycos,
Europe is increasingly looking across the pond before it looks
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   And with Deutsche Telekom of Germany considering a bid for
Sprint, trans-Atlantic deal-making seems unlikely to stop anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``European companies are in a pretty mad scramble to be
global,'' said Donald Meltzer, co-head of global mergers and
acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ``You go
where you can do the deals to achieve a critical mass. And
acquiring control is still easier in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, European companies have completed a handful of
cross-border deals, including the largest takeover in corporate
history, Vodafone Airtouch's $183 billion acquisition of
Mannesmann. That was supposed to pave the way for even more such
takeovers, but now investment bankers are less sure about the
potential for big cross-border European deals than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the past year it became apparent that many of the
political and cultural roadblocks that were supposed to have
disappeared were still up. Spain's largest telephone company,
Telefonica, tried to buy the Dutch telephone operator Royal KPN in
May, but was foiled by the Spanish government, which owns a
controlling share in Telefonica and blocked the deal over political
concerns. A privately proposed merger between Telefonica and
British Telecommunications also was thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain sectors _ telecommunications, banking, media _
there is still going to be nationalistic tendencies,'' said Daniel
Dickinson, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions for Merrill
Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   Even intra-country deals have been stymied, exemplified in
Germany by Dresdner Bank's recently failed merger with Deutsche
Bank, and in Norway by the foiled marriage of two phone companies,
Telenor and Telia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some investment bankers are not too concerned about the
problems that have hung up European deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Anglo Saxon tactics can be applied in Europe,'' said
Simon Robey, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in London. Nonetheless, he added, ``It's pretty
natural to expect we'll see trans-Atlantic activity in all the big
sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have pointed out that the market for trans-Atlantic deals
has expanded because investors in the United States are now more
receptive to foreign acquirers. One reason is that the stocks of
many European acquirers are relatively high, enabling them to pay
big premiums for American takeover targets. And European companies
that want to increase their size quickly are inclined to go after
American companies, which are usually much bigger, before looking
at their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game at the moment is to do something strategically
transforming,'' Robey said.
</P>
<P>
   While trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions have increased
recently, overall deal-making activity has actually slowed in the
last three months, according to statistics released Tuesday by
Thomson Financial, which tracks mergers and acquisitions. The
global market for deals in the April-June quarter fell by 32
percent to $760 billion following a record-breaking first quarter
of $1.121 trillion. Most of the decline can be attributed to
activity from deals in the United States, which fell to $324
billion from $568 billion. European activity remained relatively
flat at $298 billion, compared with $303 billion in the earlier
quarter. Nonetheless, global activity for the first half of the
year surpassed previous results with a total of $1.882 trillion in
deals.
</P>
<P>
   As Wall Street banks jockey to rake in the most deals, the race
is tight, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs in a
virtual tie at the top. Based on completed deals so far this year,
Goldman is the leader, followed by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch,
Credit Suisse First Boston, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg. But if the
measure is based on deals announced so far this year, Morgan
Stanley leads, followed by Goldman, Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill,
and Credit Suisse.

OPTIMISM AND SKYDIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: THOMAS M. SIEBEL is chairman and chief executive officer of
Siebel Systems Inc., a maker of e-business applications software;
this was written with GEOFFREY BREWER.) 
 By THOMAS M. SIEBEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up in a modest home in Wilmette, Ill., a suburb of
Chicago. My first job was painting houses in the Chicago area
during summers in high school and college. I used to paint about
three houses a summer with a team of two or three other guys. Some
summers, I also cut logs for people. In doing those jobs, I learned
that you had to set expectations, in terms of quality and
timeliness, at a high level, then exceed that level.
</P>
<P>
   This works in the software business, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've had other outdoor jobs. After I graduated from the
University of Illinois in 1975, I did ranch work outside of
Bellevue, Idaho. I moved cows, baled hay, irrigated. This was a
great experience, but it was really hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest role model I had growing up was my father, who was
an attorney. He was a smart guy and worked really hard. I'd see him
working at the dining room table at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. in the
morning, even on a Saturday and Sunday. One thing he taught me was
to stay out of debt. He wouldn't even borrow money for a car.
</P>
<P>
   When I started this company in July 1993, I didn't get any money
from venture capitalists. Our office space was 11 cents a square
foot in East Palo Alto, Calif. Even though our company is in
Silicon Valley, my sensibilities are essentially Midwestern.
</P>
<P>
   When customers come to visit us from Munich, Germany, or Paris,
I think people should wear coats and ties when they meet with them,
not polo shirts and jeans. It's never a casual day when you meet
with someone who is spending millions of dollars with you.
</P>
<P>
   I also never want this company to be one where employees boast
of all the Ferraris we have parked in our lot, or one that values
raising venture-capital money over profits. Serving customers
should be a humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not, however, risk-averse. During and after college, I used
to go sky diving, and probably did it about 20 times. It's tough to
put yourself out there by the door of a plane, looking down from
10,000 feet. Every fiber of your being is telling you not to do it.
You climb out on a little metal step, hold on to the wing and let
go. At that point, you start dropping pretty fast. The thing is,
once you let go, it's not as exhilarating as you think. You fall
down a little while and pull the chute. It's not that big of a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's the way I feel about taking business risks: Don't
dwell on decisions. Just make them and go.
</P>
<P>
   It was risky joining Oracle Corp., which I did in 1984. The safe
thing would have been to go to IBM. Oracle was a small company then
with untested management, and it wasn't well-financed. Its software
product was speculative. But they have proven to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this company was a risk. All of the experts said we
wouldn't succeed with our sales-automation software, that it was a
crummy market and it would be impossible to build a good product.
But we took the plunge. I just generally have an optimistic
attitude, and I think optimism is self-fulfilling. My parents had a
very positive view of the world, and I guess that rubbed off on me.
</P>
<P>
   One of my philosophies is, in any meeting, however fragmentary
the information we have, we will make a decision before the meeting
is over. We won't wring our hands. I've made a lot of bad decisions
and some good ones. Sixty percent of the time I turn out to be
right.

WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, DAVID CONE?
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a year ago on the Yankee Stadium mound,
David Cone, with his pitching hand and his glove hugging his Yankee
cap in disbelief, watched a pop-up come down, down, down into third
baseman Scott Brosius' glove for the final out of his perfect game.
Then he collapsed in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   His body language is different now. His disbelief is the same.
</P>
<P>
   After snatching Oriole left fielder B.J. Surhoff's one-hopper to
lead off the sixth on Tuesday, Cone floated the ball high and wide
to first baseman Jorge Posada, whose lunge at the bag was too late.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, the 37-year-old right-hander looked away, shaking
his head in disbelief at his error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever doing that,'' he said later. ``It was
just an easy toss to first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, after he watched second baseman Mark Lewis'
two-out, three-run homer disappear beyond the right-center-field
fence for a sudden 7-2 lead in an eventual 7-6 loss, Cone stood
like a statue, his back to home plate, his head down, his hands on
his hips in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-pitch slider,'' he said, ``for a three-run homer.''
</P>
<P>
   By, of all people, the Orioles' ninth-place batter, who had not
had a home run all season. And now, after Joe Torre arrived at the
mound to change pitchers, Cone jogged to the dugout, trying to
ignore the mixture of realistic boos for his 1-7 record and
sympathetic cheers for old-times' sake when he was the Yankees'
ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserved it and I don't blame them,'' he said of the most
boos he has ever heard as a Yankee. ``I kept putting us in a hole.
We had a nice comeback, but I put us in too big a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the second half of the season, it's understandable to
wonder if Cone will be able to help the Yankees dig themselves out
of the hole that jeopardizes another first-place finish in the
American League East, if not a wild-card berth in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He has pitched so poorly that it's understandable to wonder if,
despite a career 181-109 record in his 15th major league season, he
will ever again be the dependable big-game pitcher that the Yankees
relied on so often in the playoffs and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He insists his arm is sound, which makes it even more
understandable to wonder if he is through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't keep the ball in the ballpark,'' he said. ``I only
gave up six hits, but four were home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has allowed 17 homers this season, including four Tuesday
that were a one-game high for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried some things,'' he said, alluding to remedies for
his poor record. ``I've moved from the right side of the rubber to
the left; I've tried different mechanics. I feel good while I'm
doing it, but I've just got to keep the ball in the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   His earned run average is a shabby 6.40. He has not won in his
last 11 starts, the longest streak without a victory of his career.
His only victory this season occurred April 28, when he pitched
seven innings in a 6-0 victory over the now first-place Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to work on your confidence when you haven't won
since April,'' Torre said. ``He's got to find a way to win a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees have to find a way to win more games. Over the
last several weeks, their record is 18-28 _ not exactly
cost-efficient for baseball's first $100 million payroll. With a
$12 million one-year contract, Cone has also been anything but
cost-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm holding the club back,'' Cone said. ``I still
believe I can turn it around, but my numbers are ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers indeed are ugly. Cone is 5-13 over the last 12
months (including his 6-0 perfect game last July 18 against the
Montreal Expos). He has a shaky hits-to-innings ratio: 108 in 90.1.
He has a weak walks-to-strikeouts ratio: 43 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff and his velocity numbers have been consistent with
last year, but his total command isn't there,'' Torre said. ``He's
having trouble locating the slider. I don't know what the answer
is, but I'm not about to give up on him helping this team.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees are to start winning, David Cone needs to start
winning, beginning Sunday night when the Yankees play the Mets at
Shea Stadium. To know how he is doing, you don't need to watch the
scoreboard. Just watch his body language.

Venus aligns with Serena at Wimbledon
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ Before Tuesday's matches, Richard Williams
predicted both his daughters would advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he wasn't going out on too big a limb, seeing as how
both sisters had swept through their portions of the draw, neither
dropping a set or really being tested.
</P>
<P>
   But with No. 1 and top seed Martina Hingis, a former Wimbledon
champion, standing in Venus Williams' way, nothing was assured.
</P>
<P>
   It's assured now. There will be one Williams sister in the
Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, seeded fifth, needed 2 hours and 5 minutes to
knock off Hingis 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Her sister Serena, the eighth seed,
was able to watch much of her match after polishing off her
quarterfinal opponent, Lisa Raymond, in a mere 40 minutes, 6-3,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters will face one another in a Thursday semifinal.
Defending champion and second seed Lindsay Davenport escaped a
challenge from sixth seed Monica Seles, needing three sets for a
6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-0 victory. Davenport, who drilled 14 aces and had
20 backhand winners in that quarterfinal match, will face unseeded
Jelena Dokic, a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Magui Serna in the other
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know at least one of us will be there in the next round,''
said Serena, insisting there is no sibling rivalry. ``It would have
been more exciting as a final; unfortunately, I was not able to be
in the other half of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Hingis put on one of the best shows women's tennis has
seen in a long time, using power and finesse to fight for every
point. Few games were settled quickly, most going to several deuces
before a slugger emerged.
</P>
<P>
   After losing her serve more than she won it in the third set,
Venus served out the final game at love, drilling an ace out wide
on match point. She leaped in celebration even before the ball
touched Hingis' side of the court, then searched out her father and
sister in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going in, I felt confident. I felt I was playing well,'' Venus
said. ``Naturally, if I had won the match 6-2, 6-2 it would have
been different. I had been running. I had some tough service games,
some tough return games. So when I hit that ace, it was a great way
to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the third game of the second set through the fifth of the
third, every server faced at least one break point. Ten of those 14
games did result in service breaks, including six consecutive from
the final game of the second set through the fifth game of the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis faced 20 break points in all, seven of those being
successfully converted by Venus. Hingis broke Venus six times on 16
break point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had great matches playing each other,'' Hingis said.
``Sometimes I won, sometimes she did. Especially when it was
important _ at the Grand Slams _ I was able to pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Venus played the riskier game, making more errors but drilling
50 winners, those being almost equally divided between her
forehand, backhand and volleys. Hingis played a cleaner game but
hit only 19 winners, most of those coming from advances to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good win for me because I've never advanced past the
quarterfinals,'' Venus said. ``The two times I was in the quarters,
I had some tough, heartbreaking matches. Today, I was ready to pull
this one out because I had a bad history.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women had to stretch their legs to counter cramping and
looked winded in the final set after running each other all over
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was probably a little bit more hungry,'' Hingis said. ``We
both wanted to win very much. She was just a tiny bit better
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, meanwhile, has been much better every day. Serena
has been so dominating, she has dropped only 13 games in five
matches. But Venus will be the first seeded player she has faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very excited,'' Serena said. ``Very happy. I feel
like I can make anything happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena had 15 unreturned serves and nine aces. She never faced a
break point. She smashed 37 winners. Raymond had only one winner.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning U.S. Open winner said she's playing better than
when she won that Grand Slam last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm playing much better here than I was in the U.S.
Open, or any other tournament I've played in my life,'' said
Serena, calling Tuesday's match one of the best of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Serena beat her sister in their last meeting, that one coming at
last year's Grand Slam Cup. But Venus holds a 3-1 edge and is still
missing that initial Grand Slam trophy to start building a
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both had dreams. She had a dream of winning the U.S.
Open,'' Venus said. ``I had a dream of winning Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena's dream has come true. Thursday, Venus will discover if
she still has a chance of seeing hers realized as well.

AS YANKEES WAIT, THE LOSSES PILE UP 
</HEADLINE>
 (With ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees keep waiting for the streak, the burst of
victories that will remind them how good they were and might be
again. Orlando Hernandez won Saturday, Roger Clemens won Sunday and
many of the Yankees probably started thinking about riding a string
of victories into next week's All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   The streak was relayed to David Cone on Tuesday and he dropped
it, right in the middle of Yankee Stadium, surrendering four homers
in five and two-thirds innings to the aging Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees rallied in the ninth, but never overcame Cone's
deficit, losing by 7-6. And now the Yankees are stationary again,
bogged in mediocrity, their record 40-37, their position a game and
a half out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a game to the Mets last month was annoying to the
Yankees. Dropping a couple to Cleveland might be frustrating.
Tuesday's loss was devastating, ``a killer,'' Cone called it, and
he was right.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had won back-to-back games to finish a long 6-7 road
trip; they were home to play a second-division team _ a club the
Yankees need to dominate _ and Cone never gave them a chance. He is
1-7, more than two months removed from his last victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything to help the team,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees keep waiting for that winning streak, and the
starting pitching keeps undermining them. Sometimes the saboteur
has been Cone, sometimes Clemens or Andy Pettitte, sometimes it has
been injuries. But it's always the starting pitching. The Yankees
have not had three consecutive quality starts (six or more innings,
three runs or less) since the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee starters have reached the seventh inning in only 15
of the team's last 40 games, which goes a long way toward
explaining why they have not won more than two consecutive games
since the last time Baltimore was in town; on May 6, they collected
the fourth and final victory in a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   They needed this game, and they had an early lead, scoring twice
in the bottom of the first after the Orioles had scored a run in
the top of the first. But Cone was essentially without ammunition.
He has had days this season when he wielded a decent fastball or an
effective slider, but Cone had neither Tuesday; his fastball was
benign and his slider was flat and lifeless. He was relying on
guile and guts.
</P>
<P>
   If this had been a bad Western, he would have thrown his pistol
at the Orioles. ``His stuff has been consistent,'' Yankees Manager
Joe Torre said. ``He just has trouble with his total command.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone's approach in pitching to the second batter of the game,
Mike Bordick, revealed much about his stuff. He threw fastballs to
get ahead in the count no balls and two strikes, Bordick fouling
off two pitches. Cone has dominated Bordick over the years, holding
him to nine hits in 42 at-bats, with nine strikeouts. When he got
ahead in the count in past seasons, he would sweep sliders near the
outside corner, or lower his arm angle and tease Bordick into
chasing a high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone did not choose to throw sliders to Bordick in the first
inning Tuesday, perhaps because his slider hasn't been that good.
He rarely lowers his arm angle this season. Cone tried finishing
off Bordick with fastballs, instead, thrown over the top. He tried
jamming Bordick, and Bordick pulled a home run down the left-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Turner, Cone's catcher, said later that he thought Cone
had pitched better than the results indicated, that it was only a
matter of time before Cone rebounded. The slider, he acknowledged,
``was just kind of rolling; it didn't have that much bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner added: ``He's going to have to spot his fastball because
it doesn't have the velocity it used to have. If he doesn't, he's
going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Baines opened the second inning by slamming a low
split-fingered fastball into the seats. Charles Johnson, the next
batter, almost never draws walks, but Cone walked him on four
pitches. Two batters later, Cone tried to get ahead on the count
with Brady Anderson, tried sneaking a first-pitch fastball past
him, and Anderson bashed the pitch into the seats. The Orioles had
three more runs and led, 4-2. An absolute killer.
</P>
<P>
   Cone changed speeds better in the third, fourth and fifth
innings, pitching mostly outside, some of his sliders a little
sharper. But there was always the sense that he was just hanging
on, one mistake away from a major crisis.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff smashed a one-hopper to the mound leading off the
sixth and Cone reacted well, gloving the ball, before stepping
toward first base and throwing _ high. Jorge Posada, normally the
Yankees' catcher, was playing first, and he had to leave the bag
and leap. By the time he stretched a foot to touch first, Surhoff
was across the bag. Cone dropped his chin, disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff took second on a grounder, and the Yankees intentionally
walked Baines, who has always hit well against Cone. Bernie
Williams made a diving catch on a looper to center by Johnson, and
it looked as if Cone would get through the inning, still holding
Baltimore to four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lewis, a part-time player who had not hit a home run this
season, strolled to the plate. Lewis decided that if Cone threw a
slider, he was going to swing at it. Cone did throw a slider, a
lifeless slider. Lewis hammered it to right-center field, over the
wall. The home run muted the crowd of 44,447 for a few seconds. But
the fans were revived by Cone's departure, booing him purposefully.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 7-2, the Yankees scored one run in the eighth, three in
the ninth. But with Derek Jeter at second base and two out, Paul
O'Neill grounded out and the Yankees fell short by one run, a
discouraging defeat, a killer loss. &QL;

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN NATIONS LEAST DEVELOPED, U.N. REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Africans south of the Sahara, an area convulsed in wars and
weakened by natural disasters, suffer the broadest range of social
and economic disadvantages, a United Nations survey says.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, the Human Development Report, examines the
availability of schools, clean water and medical care, and whether
people can play a role in politics. It began 10 years ago as an
experiment to measure a nation's growth not by economic figures,
but by statistical profiles of its people and what they can expect
from life.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 30 of the 35 countries at the bottom of the index
were in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In that region, where the spread of AIDS and other diseases has
begun to shorten life spans after decades of slow improvement,
people can no longer expect to live beyond their 40s or 50s. Fewer
than half go to school and fewer than half _ sometimes 25 percent
or less _ can read, the survey shows. It also shows that a large
proportion of people _ as high as 66 percent in the case of Sierra
Leone _ lack access to clean water, and that even larger majorities
lack basic sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Sierra Leone, which is ranked last, the other least
developed nations, from the bottom up, are Niger, Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Chad, the Central
African Republic and Mali.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, the countries with the highest human
development indicators are, from the top, Canada, Norway, the
United States, Australia, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Japan and Britain. In the Western Hemisphere, only
Haiti ranks in the bottom 35.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the report, produced by the United Nations
Development Program, focuses on new themes that experts say should
be factored into studying why some countries remain poor and others
grow in economic and human terms. This year the report tried to
connect human rights and political freedom with economic and social
conditions, saying the two can no longer be separated. It
challenges the view that people are not ``ready'' for democracy
until there has been economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights are not, as has sometimes been argued, a reward
of development,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, the development
program's administrator, in an introduction to the report.
``Rather, they are critical to achieving it. Only with political
freedoms _ the right for all men and women to participate equally
in society _ can people genuinely take advantage of economic
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   In another departure, this year's report, which was issued June
29, calls for the increased collection and more effective use of
statistics to aid in promoting human rights by quantifying more
effectively the conditions under which many people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistical indicators are a powerful tool in the struggle for
human rights,'' the report says. Among other benefits even the
simple collection of information can provide, it adds, is help in
monitoring the actions of government and in curbing corruption.

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT PARRIES CRITICISM WITH A RAPIER TONGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The biographer of Abdurrahman Wahid,
Indonesia's unpredictable president, thinks he has him figured out:
He is the drunken swordsman in the martial arts movie who disarms
his enemies with his seeming foolishness, then cuts them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great master who looks like a complete walkover,'' said
the biographer, Greg Barton, an Australian political scientist.
``Suddenly there's a whirl of limbs and then everyone is lying on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The swords are out again this week as the president and his many
opponents start slicing the air in advance of a special
parliamentary session next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are talking about impeachment, although the national
assembly does not technically have that power. At the least, it
will be a grandstand for the criticism that has dogged Wahid since
his improbable election last October.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody saw it coming when Wahid (who in fact is not a drinker)
announced that the police would investigate up to 10 members of
Parliament on suspicion of fomenting violence and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his now-familiar pattern of verbal feints and jabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one big fish,'' he said on Saturday, ``but we haven't
found the supporting evidence yet. Once we catch him it will all be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, according to a local newspaper, he said: ``I have
ordered the police to arrest and interrogate those suspected of
creating or being involved in riots. With or without evidence they
have to be captured.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday his Cabinet secretary, Marsilam Simanjuntak, said the
president had signed an order for the investigation of the
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with newspaper headlines blurting ``Confusion Reigns,''
the president said: ``I've never accused the legislators of being
guilty. My other statement was twisted for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jakarta is abuzz with rumors and political scurrying as
people name names, point fingers and nudge the points of their
knives into one another's backs.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent legislators, Ginandjar Kartasasmita and Fuad
Bawazier _ once ministers in the Cabinet of former President
Suharto _ found themselves angrily denying that they were on
Wahid's list.
</P>
<P>
   Bawazier did not seem to help his case much when he denied a
suggestion that he was financing armed groups by saying: ``The
accusations are baseless. It is normal that I give donations to the
needy.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a diverting spectacle, but the stakes are high.
Indonesia is _ as the pilots of jetliners say _ passing through a
period of turbulence after the ouster of Suharto two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it does so, it sometimes seems that Wahid is alone at the
controls. And there are disconcerting moments when he seems,
willfully, to be steering into the thunderheads.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say Wahid is his own worst enemy,
undermining Indonesia's stability and economic recovery by his
impulsiveness and his tendency to cry wolf. Although economic
analysts insist that in real terms the economy is on an upturn, the
confidence of investors has continued to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the political noise, the currency, the rupiah, fell to
below 9,000 to the dollar Tuesday, its lowest point in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The catch-phrase in Jakarta now is: ``The best thing the
president could do for the economy is to keep his mouth shut for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's defenders say that shutting his mouth would in effect be
laying down his weapons. With few political cards to play, they
say, the president is lucky that he is an expert bluffer.
</P>
<P>
   The back-room coalition he yanked together last October to win
the presidency has mostly turned against him, ready to devour him
when he presents his state of the nation address to the assembly
next month.
</P>
<P>
   And he is operating without much of a functioning bureaucracy,
which was eviscerated by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Where Suharto kept his opponents at bay by force of arms, Wahid
must operate by the force of his personality. That is how he
undercut his recalcitrant military chief, Gen. Wiranto, in
February, pummeling him with a barrage of intemperate remarks and
finally dismissing him.
</P>
<P>
   The newly empowered legislature has roared to life as what one
analyst called a ``crocodile pit'' of political agendas. The
legislators fired the first shot last Friday when they voted to
call in the president later this month _ ahead of the assembly _ to
explain his firing of two Cabinet ministers in April. Barton,
Wahid's biographer, said the president had already ``done his
deals'' in advance of the assembly, well aware that few of his
critics are prepared to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur has done his political homework,'' said Barton, using
the president's nickname. ``In this, he is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president is faced with a surge of violent
unrest around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a religious war in the far eastern Maluku islands,
where more than 2,500 Christians and Muslims have been killed in
the last 18 months. There has been communal fighting on the islands
of Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok. There have been bomb blasts at
mosques and churches. And there are insurgencies in the provinces
of Aceh and Irian Jaya that appear to be receiving outside aid.
</P>
<P>
   The unseen hands behind them may include military plotters,
local power blocs, ambitious politicians and people from the former
government.
</P>
<P>
   Their message, said Barton, is: ```Back off or we'll make
problems.' It's a sort of hostage situation; it doesn't take a lot
of money to set things off. From others, it's, `Let's see what a
weak leader he is.' There are all sorts of crazies, all sorts of
people trying their thing, trying to get him to take them
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot for one man to handle. And, according to Barton, it
is a battle the president relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feint to the left, hit to the right: Your opponent never knows
where you're coming from,'' Barton said. ``It's strongly his style,
like a kung fu expert. He doesn't always land on his feet, but
don't underestimate him.''

THE LEFT-HANDED JONES FAILS HIS FIRST TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On Sunday night, facing the Yankees at Shea Stadium on
national television in their final game before the All-Star Game
break, the Mets are scheduled to start the left-hander Bobby M.
Jones. Another option would be to bring back Mike Hampton on three
days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   After Jones failed to hold a five-run lead Tuesday and lost to
the Florida Marlins, 9-8, Mets manager Bobby Valentine was asked if
Jones would still pitch that showcase game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, probably,'' Valentine said. ``He's in line to, let's put
it that way. We'll just see how the whole thing shakes out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lukewarm endorsement, and it was understandable. Making
his first Mets start in place of the injured Rick Reed, Jones'
command escaped him in the fourth inning. In the fifth, he faced
four batters and retired none, then watched as the Marlins took the
lead on a double steal that really was not.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored three runs after falling behind by 9-5, and with
one on and one out in the ninth, Mike Piazza came off the bench to
pinch hit. Piazza was hit on the left elbow by the backswing of
Preston Wilson on Monday, and he did not start because of soreness.
X-rays on the elbow showed that nothing was broken, and when Piazza
began feeling better Tuesday as the game went on, he volunteered to
pinch hit.
</P>
<P>
   With Jay Payton on first, Piazza hit a grounder to third and
Payton beat the throw to second. Though Piazza reached first base
safely, the fielder's choice ended his hitting streak at 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for the Mets, Antonio Alfonseca then struck out Todd Pratt
and Melvin Mora to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked four-plus innings, and gave up seven runs on six
hits and three walks. He was starting for the first time since June
10, after pitching only one inning during an eight-game stint with
the Mets in mid-June and an inning and a third in a subsequent
relief appearance for Triple-A Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked two bullpen sessions in that time, but there is no
substitute for game experience. His fastball was not down as often
as he wanted it to be, he said, and his slider was inconsistent.
Jones knows the Mets demand better from him, no matter how little
he has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, personally, it's a direct reflection of only pitching
two innings in 20 days,'' Jones said. ``But I don't have room to
make mistake after mistake. This is a team that's very good with a
chance to go a long way. That's not what they're looking for;
they're looking for a pitcher to get people out. I think I'm that
person, but, hey, I have to show it. I can't just tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Bill Pulsipher arrived at spring training as the
favorites to land the fifth starter's spot, but Glendon Rusch
passed them both and won the job. Pulsipher, who was traded to
Arizona in June, had two starts in May for the Mets and was roughed
up, faltering in the fourth inning both times.
</P>
<P>
   Jones followed the same pattern. He retired eight of the first
nine Marlins hitters Tuesday, but the more of Jones the Marlins
saw, the better they did. Protecting a 5-0 lead in the fourth,
Jones issued a pair of two-out walks and was visited on the mound
by the pitching coach, Dave Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The next hitter was Alex Gonzalez, batting .174, and Jones fell
behind, 2-0. His next pitch was a high fastball _ ``He laid one in
there,'' Valentine said _ and Gonzalez belted it deep into the
left-field seats for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pitches that I thought were strikes got called balls
today,'' said Pratt, the catcher in place of Piazza, ``and any time
the count turns into 1-0 instead of 0-1, or 2-1 instead of 1-2, it
doesn't matter who's pitching, the hitter's more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse for Jones in the fifth. The pinch-hitter Mark
Smith drew a leadoff walk and Luis Castillo singled. Mark Kotsay
ripped an opposite-field double to the warning track in left,
scoring two runs to tie the score, 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd then dribbled a grounder about 50 feet toward third
base, and it went for an infield single, ending Jones' day.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes entered, and with runners at first and third, Floyd
broke for second on the first pitch. Pratt's throw bounced off the
infield grass and deflected off Floyd's helmet. Mora, the
shortstop, raced over to grab the ball, but he could not get it
from his glove as Kotsay scampered home with the go-ahead steal of
home.
</P>
<P>
   The play was ruled a double steal, even though Kotsay did not go
until the throw bounced and struck Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triple-clutch _ we had him easy,'' Pratt said. ``The guy
didn't break until Melvin had the ball. But that isn't to blame.
I'm supposed to be the leader on defense, and I didn't execute
well. Our offense gave us enough to win, and the defense didn't
play up to our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mahomes walked Wilson, a one-out intentional walk to
Derrek Lee loaded the bases. Gonzalez struck out, and Mike Redmond
grounded a ball up the middle, giving the Mets a chance to escape
the inning with minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mora ranged to his left, he bobbled the ball, and his
error sent Floyd home to give Florida a 7-5 lead. Smith singled in
two more to increase the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got closer on a two-run homer in the sixth by Todd
Zeile, who did not start because of a stiff neck, and a bases-empty
shot by Edgardo Alfonzo in the ninth, but the Marlins prevailed,
winning their fifth game in a row. The Mets have lost six of 11
games to Florida this year, and they will be glad to be done with
the upstart Marlins after Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to play havoc with people who have to play them
the rest of the year,'' Valentine said. He did not note that the
first-place Atlanta Braves have five games left with the Marlins.

PHILIPPOUSSIS READY TO TAKE ON AGASSI 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-WIMBLEDON)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ There is still a Ferrari in the garage, but
it is a lonely set of wheels since Mark Philippoussis began
discarding the artificial fillers in a life once scant on career
substance.
</P>
<P>
   He would spent his days wave running on Miami Beach, his nights
surfing for fun and only his spare moments applying his
considerable talents to tennis. The serve, the strokes, the range.
He had all the skills, but fell short in work ethic. He has put a
``For Sale'' sign on his bachelor pad in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Philippoussis is following the lead of his opponent
Wednesday in a quarterfinal at Wimbledon. While Pete Sampras tries
to fend off the hot Jan-Michael Gambill in one highlighted
quarterfinal match, Philippoussis will look across the court and
find Andre Agassi in another one.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Agassi has searched for deep meaning;
Philippoussis is starting the same journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had everything that you could possibly have,''
Philippoussis said. ``Now I'm a little sick of it, which is good.
It's a phase I went through. I got it out of my system. Obviously I
still like the fast cars, but I've sold almost all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami was exciting for me as a 22-year-old when I first moved
there. Of course, I mean, the night life and the atmosphere is
incredible. But I'm actually moving. I'm going to go back to
Australia. I want to be with my family and friends. Start
concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been focused throughout a laborious but uplifting run
through Wimbledon, which included a five-hour victory in the third
round and another five-set victory in the fourth. Agassi is much
fresher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Todd Martin pushed Agassi to a fifth set in the second
round, he has not dropped a set since. But he is wary of
Philippoussis, who has served 77 aces in his last two matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know what it feels like to be Mark
Philippoussis and hit a 128-mile-per-hour serve down a set point,''
Agassi said. ``I'd like to know what that feels like. But I like
the fact that my dynamics of play matches up pretty well against
baseliners and big power hitters. I think it brings a lot of
elements that the game of tennis has to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why his quarterfinal is so intriguing. If Philippoussis
is the biggest server in the game right now, Agassi is the best at
returning the blasts. Although Agassi has won three of the four
previous matches against Philippoussis, there is a notable change
in the Australian's desire.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this metamorphosis can be credited to Boris Becker, who
recently told Philippoussis that he hadn't reached 40 percent of
his potential. Mostly, Philippoussis has been influenced by his
coach, Mike DePalmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking, and obviously we talk every day,''
Philippoussis, who will be 24 in November, said of his coach. ``He
sits me down just to tell me what he thinks I need to do. We've
definitely talked about that. Pretty much what he said is: `If you
want to be a champion, you have to be a champion 24 hours a day.
You've got to live like a champion, think like a champion, talk
like a champion in order to become one.'''

MAJOR LEAGUES ANNOUNCE STARTERS FOR ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It has become a rite of summer for Mike Piazza. The
results of the All-Star balloting are announced, and Piazza has
more votes than any other National League catcher. The fans have
voted him to the All-Star team seven years in a row, and this year
made him the league's leading vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's teammate Edgardo Alfonzo was leading in the balloting
at second base on Friday, poised to be an All-Star for the first
time. Alfonzo might still make it, but he will have to do so as a
reserve. The San Francisco Giants' Jeff Kent, a former Met, surged
ahead of Alfonzo and Houston's Craig Biggio and will be the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want Fonzie to be recognized,'' Piazza said of his
teammate, ``but he's such a well-kept secret for us in so many
ways. He's just got a really cool vibe going there. But he deserves
every bit of recognition that he has coming _ and he's got a lot
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, who is leading the league in runs batted in with 80,
received 1,018,430 votes, about 55,000 more than Biggio and 145,000
more than Alfonzo. He is one of four players who were voted to the
team for the first time this year, joining American League
outfielders Bernie Williams of the Yankees and Jermaine Dye of
Kansas City, and first baseman Jason Giambi of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is batting .331 with 18 homers and 77 RBIs, was
selected as an All-Star reserve in each of the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good choice,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``It was great to have Griffey go to the other league and
Bernie lead all outfielders in votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the leading vote-getter among AL outfielders, a
distinction that had usually been Ken Griffey Jr.'s before his
trade from Seattle to Cincinnati before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had been the leading vote-getter in the American League
each of the last four seasons, and five times overall. Griffey
started off slowly this season, but he batted over .300 in June and
is among the National League leaders with 26 home runs. He finished
first in the balloting among NL outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez led all major leaguers with
2,808,456 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza led National Leaguer players with 2,780,452 votes, over 2
million more than Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall, the runner-up.
It was the third time in his career _ and first time as a Met _
that Piazza has been the leading NL vote-getter. ``It never gets
old,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who is batting .333 with 13 homers and 57 RBIs, was
second to Biggio when in-stadium balloting ended early last week,
but received a boost from online voters. That proved to Alfonzo
that more fans were noticing him, and that is a great feeling, he
said. But he knew Kent could pull ahead; he said he sees Kent's
highlights on television all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was real close and I'm kind of a little
disappointed, but I think I did everything,'' Alfonzo said. ``I
just put everything all together. There's a lot of competition at
second base. We'll see what's going to happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox, who must choose from a cluster
of talented second basemen including Florida's Luis Castillo and
Montreal's Jose Vidro, has said that he would consider selecting
Alfonzo as a backup at another position, like third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could play anywhere,'' Alfonzo said. ``If he wants me to
play third base, second base, shortstop, catcher, whatever. I'll be
prepared for it, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Derek Jeter finished second to Seattle's Alex
Rodriguez, his good friend, after being the runner-up to Boston's
Nomar Garciaparra last year. Torre selects the American League
reserves, and Jeter is one of several Yankees likely to be named to
the team. The closer Mariano Rivera and catcher Jorge Posada are
also strong candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Torre also could select Toronto's David Wells as the starting
pitcher for the game, which will be played at Turner Field in
Atlanta next Tuesday. Wells, who sometimes clashed with Torre when
he pitched for the Yankees from 1997-98, is 14-2 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Pedro Martinez is having the best season among AL
starters, but is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Al Leiter is 10-1 with a 3.04 earned run average
and will almost certainly be selected.
</P>
<P>
   The closer Armando Benitez, who is third in the National League
with 18 saves and who has a 1.19 ERA since May 6, also has a chance
to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   The voting for National League second baseman was not the
closest at any position.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Manny Ramirez won the third and final outfield spot
by fewer than 30,000 votes over Boston's Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Ivan and Alex Rodriguez, Giambi, Williams, Dye and
Ramirez as American League starters are second baseman Roberto
Alomar of Cleveland and third baseman Cal Ripken of Baltimore.
Ripken is an 18-time All-Star who has been elected to the team
every year since 1984, except in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Piazza, Kent and Griffey, National League
starters include first baseman Mark McGwire of St. Louis, third
baseman Chipper Jones of Atlanta, shortstop Barry Larkin of
Cincinnati and outfielders Barry Bonds of San Francisco and Sammy
Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.  &QL;

MASON ARRESTED IN NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Mason, the former Knick who now plays for the Charlotte
Hornets, was arrested on Monday night in New Orleans and charged
with inciting a riot, assaulting a police officer and resisting
arrest, the police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred shortly after 9 p.m. Monday when New
Orleans police officers responded to an argument between two groups
of men in the French Quarter. The police said that when officers
tried to separate the men, Mason struck one of the officers without
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the 6-foot-7, 270-pound Mason was sprayed with
pepper spray after he resisted officers' attempts to arrest him.
They said Mason managed to flee but was caught a short distance
from the scene. After he was handcuffed, the police said, Mason
began to incite a crowd that had gathered, yelling to them to help
him escape.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a string of run-ins the 33-year-old Mason,
a native of Queens, has had with the police, dating back to 1989.

MEXICO'S PRESIDENT-ELECT FOX OUTLINES AMBITIOUS PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vowing to reduce poverty and to eliminate Mexico's
chronic government corruption within six years, President-elect
Vicente Fox Quesada outlined an ambitious program for his incoming
administration Tuesday, including positions on drug policy and
immigration that showed the first signs of possible friction with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the conservative candidate elected Sunday in a landmark
vote that halted 71 years of uninterrupted presidential rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, offered a sweeping
blueprint of what Mexico's government might look like after he
takes office Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's most important goal, he said, would be to
cut growing poverty levels, particularly among indigenous and rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before every program we create and decision we make, I want
every one of my ministers to ask, `How will this affect the
indigenous and the marginalized in our country?' '' Fox said during
a 2 1/2-hour interview Tuesday morning with foreign news media.
</P>
<P>
   As a short-term measure, he said, he would work to ensure that
incomes rise higher during his government's first year than the
rate of inflation, something Mexico hasn't seen in more than a
decade. The former Coca-Cola executive also said he would seek to
attract more private investment, especially to the southeast
region, the country's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who defeated PRI candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa 43
percent to 36 percent, also pledged that by the end of his six-year
term he would end rampant government corruption. To do that, he
said, he would create a Ministry of Justice and Security that would
remove federal police departments and investigative
responsibilities from the Interior Ministry, which oversees most of
the government's domestic programs, incuding immigration and
customs. He also would transfer the attorney general's special
powers to determine guilt in some criminal cases to the judiciary,
thereby limiting the role of the office to prosecuting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also proposed transferring the government's main accounting
office to Mexico's Congress to allow for more independent analyses
of government spending and operations.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his views on drug policy that may present the new
administration's first test with Washington, which has so far
welcomed Fox's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's president-elect proposes to do away with the annual
process of certification of drug-fighting allies by the US
government and replace it with a multilateral agreement between the
United States and drug-producing countries that would set goals for
each nation _ including the United States _ to reduce the supply
and demand for illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This multilateral effort should have specific obligations for
each country,'' Fox said. ``I don't think that any country
individually can solve this cancer. It has to be a coordinated
international effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The current US certification program, which Mexico and other
countries have criticized as being punitive, evaluates the efforts
by drug-producing countries every year. Nations that fail to be
certified as cooperating partners risk sanctions or the loss of
some US trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also proposed a deepening of the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada, saying
that the economic benefits of the pact haven't ``flowed down to the
level of the medium and small businesses or the regions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 58-year-old former Guanajuato state governor,
who once spent a year studying at Harvard University, said he
favored a freer flow of immigrants among the NAFTA countries, a
different view from that of Washington, which has tried to limit
the number of immigrants crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Fox added, he would support the creation of a
borderless North American area, with a common currency, similar to
the European community.
</P>
<P>
   US officials were not available for immediate comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On other domestic issues, Fox pledged to restart negotiations
with the indigenous Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, whose six-year-old
armed struggle against the government is unresolved, and he
promised not to fire all federal workers who were hired by the
current ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect continued his work Tuesday on assembling a
Cabinet and transition team that will inherit control from the
ruling party administration of Ernesto Zedillo in five months. It
will be the first transfer of federal power to a different party
since the birth of the PRI in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Tuesday night at Los Pinos, the presidential
residence in Mexico City, Zedillo and Fox pledged a smooth
transition, despite the absence of a formal protocol for the
handover. Fox said he would name a Cabinet within sixty days to
work with current government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to create a citizen-dominated transparency
commission to monitor the transfer. Mexico's fiscal 2001 federal
budget would be put together by both administrations, Fox added.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexico analysts Tuesday praised many of Fox's proposals as
bold and innovative, saying they addressed the most pressing issues
facing the country's 96 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   But one worried that some of Fox's plans, including his promise
to slash poverty or erase corruption in just one presidential term,
might be too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he can't make major strides,'' said Roderic Ai
Camp, a Mexico specialist and professor of government at Claremont
McKenna College in California. ``But to altogether eliminate
something as widespread as corruption, I'm not optimistic. But he
is facing very high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucia Arroyo, a 37-year-old bakery assistant in southern Mexico
City, said she'd love to see a Mexico where she didn't always have
to pay off government clerks or traffic cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get pulled over in this city, I have to beg and
bribe a patrolman not to ticket me just because my car has
out-of-state license plates,'' she said. ``But it happens all the
time, and it's not fair.''

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GYM CLASSES STRESS COOPERATION AND ACTIVITY OVER
COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAYVILLE, N.Y. _ With its squeaky wooden floor, cement-block
walls and stalwart basketball hoops, the gymnasium at Sunrise Drive
Elementary School has barely changed since the school was built
four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But physical education has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Signs posted around the gym remind students that they have
entered a ``no-fault zone'' where they are allowed to make
mistakes, and that ``if you had fun, you won.''
</P>
<P>
   Students here no longer pick their own teams for ball games
because egos may be too easily wounded. Dodge ball, a gym class
favorite for decades, was banned a few years ago because it was too
confrontational and, for many children, too demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, students at Sunrise not only exercise but write
about the experiences in fitness journals. There are two
objectives: expressing their feelings about various sports and
explaining how each makes them more physically fit.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in many elementary schools around the country, the
emphasis is increasingly on cooperation, not competition. Joanne
Hamilton, the gym teacher at Sunrise since 1982, said the idea was
to nurture children's self-esteem and teach them more about how to
keep healthy than how to play team sports. The fewer discouraging
experiences students have in gym class, she said, the more likely
they are to continue exercising for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever gets their feelings hurt in my class,'' said
Hamilton, thin and no-nonsense in khaki shorts and a tucked-in
T-shirt, as a class of second-graders skittered around the gym.
``Because once you turn a kid off to movement, they are never going
to move again.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Young, executive director of the National Association for
Sport and Physical Education, said physical education classes were
focusing more on cooperative activities because they allow even the
least athletic students to play important roles.
</P>
<P>
   One way that Hamilton keeps her students enthusiastic is to
avoid elimination games, much less let them strike out. In
baseball, instead of switching roles after three outs, each team
gets 10 minutes at bat, then 10 minutes in the field. Players may
choose between having the ball pitched to them or hitting it off a
tee.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hamilton's version of tag, boys and girls alike pretend
they are fairies and skip around the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Players who are ``it'' can tag their classmates, but the
children who are caught are not necessarily out of the game. They
can escape from captivity by shouting to other players, ``Free
me!''
</P>
<P>
   But if gym class is kinder and gentler these days, it is also
more goal-oriented. The standards movement that has swept the
nation in recent years, while focused mostly on academic subjects,
has led many states to adopt physical education standards for each
grade level, too.
</P>
<P>
   New York's standards, for example, require students to
``demonstrate mastery of fundamental motor, nonlocomotor and
manipulative skills'' and ``demonstrate and assess their fitness by
performing exercises and activities related to each health-related
fitness component.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the new standards, students at Sunrise learn the
difference between muscular strength (``being able to lift our
books up'') and muscular endurance (``being able to carry them
home''). They get homework questions about upper body strength, for
example, and volleyball terminology. And in their fitness journals,
they explain how different physical activities keep them in shape
and, in some cases, foster cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The journals also give students an opportunity to vent about
their gym class frustrations. Lauren Gajewski, a fifth-grader,
confided that she was relieved when she failed to hit the ball in a
recent softball game because ``I didn't have to worry about what to
do if I got to first base.'' And Jacklyn Spaeth, also in fifth
grade, complained in her journal that students who are caught
during tag pretend to be still free. ``That's when you know a fight
is going to begin,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In grading the journals, Hamilton has been known to offer
therapeutic advice. ``During tag you can always resolve the
conflict with rock-paper-scissors,'' she wrote to Jacklyn.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of scolding raucous students with a shrill whistle,
Hamilton uses carefully chosen language to make students reflect on
what is now known as inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg, that wasn't a good choice to make, to throw that ball in
Lissa's face,'' she said calmly to a first-grader. ``You owe her an
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such denigrations at Sunrise's annual field day in
June _ an event that, not surprisingly, has been renamed Fun Day.
None of the games were competitive, and each student was given a
ribbon. Instead of ``First Place'' or ``Second Place,'' the ribbons
were printed with ``Everybody's a Winner'' and ``It's Great to
Participate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a partner tire roll, in which students paired up to
push a tire down the field. The point was not to beat other teams,
but to cooperate with your partner and see how many times you could
race back and forth in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to accept everyone and their abilities,''
Hamilton said.

LEMON DROP KID BEATS BEHRENS IN A FAST SUBURBAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lemon Drop Kid took some fast and serious strides
toward racing's year-end honors Tuesday when he outran Behrens by
two and a half lengths and won the $500,000 Suburban Handicap at
Belmont Park in the second-fastest time in the history of the
114-year-old race.
</P>
<P>
   He not only defeated Behrens, who ran second to the world-class
Dubai Millennium in the $5 million Dubai World Cup in March, but
also flew the mile and a quarter in 1:58 4/5. That time was just
three-fifths of a second off the track record, set in the Suburban
in 1991 by In Excess. And Lemon Drop Kid also became only the
fourth horse to race 1 1/4 miles in the Suburban in less than two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Prado, who also rode Lemon Drop Kid to a seven-length
score in the Brooklyn Handicap last month, made no secret of the
fact that he had kept Behrens blocked on the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had Behrens pinned on the inside, and at the top of
the stretch, I wanted to get the jump on him,'' Prado said. ``My
horse just took off, and I knew Behrens was chasing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid, conceded that
``the position we were in didn't hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just keeps on running,'' Schulhofer said. ``He's finally
got focused, and Prado is the big thing as far as the improvements
go.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jeanne Vance, who owns Lemon Drop Kid, said: ``This one is
extra special because Behrens was in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Schulhofer and James Bond, the trainer of Behrens,
predicted a return match in the Whitney at Saratoga on Aug. 6. And
Bond felt that the four-month layoff and inside post position had
compromised Behrens while Wild Imagination set the lead for most of
a mile before Lemon Drop Kid made his move and Behrens finally
escaped from the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid ran three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 4/5 and one
mile in 1:34 1/5. It was, as predicted, a two-horse race with Lager
third and Almutawakel finishing last in the field of six. The
winner paid $3.60 for a $2 bet.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's other stake, the $113,800 Poker Handicap, Affirmed
Success made a ringing success of his debut on the grass as he
drove home with a length and three-quarters over the Irish horse
Rabi, who had half a length on Weatherbird. With Jorge Chavez
riding, Affirmed Success ran the mile on the turf in 1:34 flat and
paid $4.90 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Schosberg, who trains Affirmed Success for Albert Fried
Jr., explained the transition: ``After he lost two Breeders' Cup
Sprints in a row, we decided that the only alternative was to put
him on the turf and see if he could make the Breeders' Cup Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Poker Handicap, Divide and Conquer broke down on the far
turn with a fractured right foreleg and was destroyed by injection.
The jockey, John Velazquez, was not injured.

ALBERT THE GREAT IS ZITO'S TICKET TO THE 3-YEAR-OLD RACES
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can a 3-year-old colt named Albert the Great, who
skipped the Triple Crown wars in the first half of the racing
season, become a star in the second half and help restore Nicholas
the Great to his rank among trainers?
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito considered the question at Barn 12 at Belmont Park the
other day, and said: ``He made the first start of his career only
in January, but he has the potential to be one of the best we ever
had. He'll run all day, and as he goes longer, he'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito is plotting an ambitious summer and fall for his prodigy,
who has won his last three races, but who will take a giant step
upward next Sunday in the Dwyer Stakes when he tangles with several
top graduates of the Triple Crown. They are More Than Ready, who
ran fourth in the Kentucky Derby; Red Bullet, who won the
Preakness, and Commendable, who won the Belmont Stakes. They will
run 1 1/16 miles for a purse of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great will test these formidable stars with two
strikes on him: He did not run anywhere last year as a 2-year-old,
and he will be appearing in his first stakes race. He will be a
figure of unusual intrigue, the late bloomer, the ace in the hole
for one of the most accomplished trainers of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Zito won the 1991 Kentucky Derby with Strike the Gold, the 1994
Derby with Go for Gin and the 1996 Preakness with Louis Quatorze,
snapping the winning streak in the classics by D.Wayne Lukas at
six.
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great was still running in allowance races earlier
this year while Zito was approaching the Kentucky Derby with
Greenwood Lake, winner of the Champagne and the Remsen last year
and one of the early favorites for the Derby this year. But just
like that, in the first week in March, the chance was gone.
Greenwood Lake came back from a workout limping, and his quest for
the Triple Crown was ended with a fractured left foreleg. And for
the first time in 10 years, one of the star trainers of the Triple
Crown did not even see a Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was emotional for me,'' Zito said. ``This is a game of
dreams, a game of people and so much romance. The Triple Crown has
been part of my life for the last 10 years. It means so much to our
stable. It seemed strange for me to miss the Derby, Preakness and
Belmont this spring after years of being deeply involved. There
were rumors that I might run Albert in the Belmont, but it was too
big a step. And Bare Outline just didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I have the chance to catch the first-half horses with
a second-half winner. People get caught up with the horses that win
the classics. But for the rest of the year, the fresh-horse theory
can be just as important in deciding championships. Everybody's
looking for the good horse these days. I think I've found mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great is a bay gelding who was bought by Tracy Farmer
of Lexington at the Keeneland auction sale last year for $85,000.
But he did not race at 2 because, Zito said, ``he had the usual
series of baby things, like splints and shins.'' But he finally
went to the races in January at Gulfstream Park, ran third twice,
then second and then seventh at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, he began to dazzle people. On April 22 at
Keeneland, he won by 10 lengths. Then he came to New York and won
in May and again in June. He went to the front in all three races
and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   His next test will be the Dwyer Stakes. ``It's a major test, but
the way he trains makes me think he will handle it,'' Zito said.
``Then we'll aim him for the Jim Dandy at Saratoga in August and
the Travers later in August. Ambitious, yes. But he strikes me as
the horse who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 52, with or without Triple Crown honors, Zito continues to
rank among the leading trainers in his hometown, New York City. He
trains full barns at Belmont Park and at Saratoga. He has been
forced to cope in the last few years while other trainers, notably
Lukas and Bob Baffert, have monopolized the winner's circle at the
classics. But he has the feeling now that he has found an
alternative path to the top.
</P>
<P>
   He also disclosed that his private life had been stabilized
recently with his marriage on June 4 to Kim Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been planning it,'' he said, ``but we made the decision
one Sunday when we were in Cooperstown upstate. We got a justice of
the peace, and got married. I said to Kim, `I know you like me, but
you're not so crazy about the job.' But she accepts it with good
grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``job'' takes a new turn Sunday when Albert the Great
springs from the starting gate to pursue his campaign to overtake
the veterans of the Triple Crown.

REFORMERS SCALE BACK AMBITIONS AFTER CRACKDOWN BY HARD-LINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change May 30 to May 27 in 8th graf.)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ _ With most of their newspapers silenced and many
of their activists jailed by hardline courts, Iran's reformers have
scaled back their once-defiant agenda for change and are
concentrating on regaining a public voice through their control of
the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the vast high-ceilinged chamber where the lawmakers meet,
there is a sense of reduced expectations. It is a mood far
different from the euphoria that followed their sweeping victory in
the first round of parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the reformers pledged that they would soon make good on
all the vague promises of democracy and freedom that were made by
their hero, President Mohammad Khatami, when he was elected in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But their ambitions were visibly trimmed by a hardline backlash
_ the press crackdown, the detention of pro-democracy activists,
the voiding of more than a dozen races won by pro-Khatami
candidates and a three-month delay in certifying the election
results for many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have huge demands and expectations from this parliament
and government,'' acknowledged Mohammad Reza Tabesh, a newly
elected lawmaker from the reform movement and a nephew of Khatami,
in a recent conversation. ``It's almost too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paraphrased a Persian proverb to describe the Khatami
camp's operative strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who moves forward,'' Tabesh said, ``is not the one who
moves fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The new parliament _ Iran's sixth since the 1979 revolution,
which replaced the monarchy with a theocratic leadership _ began
work on May 27. It has spent much of the time since organizing its
leadership and committee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Only 268 members have taken up their posts. The results of
elections for the remaining 22 seats in the 290-member body are
still being disputed by the hardline Council of Guardians, the
group that vets candidates, certifies elections and can block any
legislation that it deems offensive or contradictory to its
interpretation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hardline opposition controls only about 30 percent
of the parliament seats already decided, the cautious reform
majority has so far tried to postpone their inevitable head-on
collision.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, they elected a compromise figure, Mehdi Karroubi, a
turbaned cleric who ran on a pro-Khatami ticket but is also a
former hard-liner and past parliament leader. Karroubi has been
busy in the past few weeks shuttling from meetings with pro-reform
groups to get-togethers with hard-line religious leaders in Qom and
in the Council of Guardians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factions have to learn how to cooperate with each other _
and they will learn,'' said Abbas Salimi Namin, managing director
of the hardline Tehran Times daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran's politicians, he added, are still new at competing as
pragmatic political adversaries and not as arch-enemies bent on
destroying one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much experience in this,'' said Namin. ``The
role of parties _ how they should be controlled, how they should
work with each other _ it's not very clear to us.''
</P>
<P>
   As the reformers try to build bridges, they also have toned down
their language on the more divisive social changes they once
championed, like lifting the ban on satellite television dishes and
limiting the intrusive power of the country's quasi-official morals
squads and hard-line courts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have said they will concentrate on reviving the
once lively national press, streamlining government ministries,
passing a national budget and devising legislation to encourage the
formation of political parties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Their first and main priority, they said, is to strip the
country's press law of restrictive amendments, added by hard-liners
in the last parliament, so reformers can defend themselves from
political attack.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tough press law, hardline judges have closed 20
reformist newspapers and magazines since the elections, leaving
mostly right-wing publications and the state television channels,
which regularly condemn the reform movement as un-Islamic and an
agent of U.S. imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The muting effect was demonstrated just last week, when a reform
member of parliament rose from his red leather seat and began to
denounce the state television operation as the ``mouthpiece'' of
only one political faction.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds into his speech, the television screens in the
chamber went dark as cameramen from the government broadcasting
company shut off their equipment. The lawmaker's comments slipped
into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed press law, which would effectively return Iran to
the regulations in force earlier this year, is energetically backed
by Khatami's government. But it is one of only a few pieces of
legislation that the administration has put forward for
consideration by the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's aides have spoken of the need to
depoliticize the court system and ensure that judges act according
to the law, they say he is not likely to offer any sweeping reforms
that might provoke a dangerous showdown with hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But their prudence is unlikely to avert clashes with the
hardliners. The Council of Guardians, for example, can cancel any
new reform legislation it does not like. The parliament can appeal
such decisions, but only to another potentially unfriendly body
called the Expediency Council. It is led by former President Ali
Akbar Rafsanjani, who has denounced the reformers as threats to the
Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the guardian council to approve of all the
laws we send them,'' said Ali Reza Nouri, a leading reform lawmaker
and the younger brother of a well-known cleric jailed by the
hardliners for his writings. ``We're not going to commit suicide,
but we won't stop passing new laws just because the guardian
council won't accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some reformers are reluctant to engage in full-scale
battle with the hardliners who control the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation of students at our religious seminaries
is quite advanced and progressive, but most of the older
generation, like those on the guardian council, have traditional
views,'' said Mohammad Taghi Fazel Meibodi, a reformist cleric who
is a close friend of Khatami's. ``This is a problem the government
is faced with. But the council should be respected because it's a
legal institution.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of hard-liners, including some in parliament and some
on the Council of Guardians, have already signaled that they will
fight the new press law. They have also said the parliament should
deal with the ailing economy rather than issues of political and
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Reform activists, who are badly split among themselves on
whether to pursue a state-controlled or free-market economy, said
they will try to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, economic issues are important and, separately, we
have to find solutions to the problems of inflation and
unemployment among our youth,'' said Jamileh Kadivar, a reformer
elected from Tehran. ``But to solve the economic problems, we must
create a stable and secure state in order to attract foreign
investment that would in turn create jobs.''

MOLINA IMPRESSES BEHIND THE PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Young pitchers, inexperienced catcher. That is
not a combination that often gets, or keeps, a team in contention.
But so far this season, rookie catcher Bengie Molina and the
Angels' cast of young pitchers have perhaps surprised everybody but
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who started the season with just 77 days of major-league
service, has caught 11 different starters. Manager Mike Scioscia
has been forced to juggle his rotation because of injuries to Tim
Belcher, Ken Hill, Kent Bottenfield and Jason Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis, Brian Cooper, Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz
and Seth Etherton had a combined 35 big-league starts entering the
season, but Molina has handled the veterans and youngsters with
equal poise.
</P>
<P>
   He's a big reason why the Angels were 42-40 entering Tuesday's
game and were six games behind first-place Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Molina is hitting .311 with nine home runs and 37
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is taking the job and running with it,'' said Scioscia, who
admitted he knew little about Molina except the young catcher was
``a great talent, but durability was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then (at spring training) I saw how hard he worked and his
dedication. He has tremendous ability . . . the only thing Bengie
can't do is run fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither durability nor speed has been an issue this year.
Scioscia has been careful not to overwork Molina and the strategy
has paid dividends both offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who has played in 57 of 85 games (including Tuesday), is
among the league leaders in throwing out runners attempting to
steal (23). He also put together a 14-game hitting streak and set
an Angels record for the highest batting average in a month (.461
in May).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great success story,'' Cooper said. ``He's had to work
his way through the system. Sometimes he wasn't even the No. 1
catcher. Now he gets his shot and and is making the most of it. . .
. catching well, throwing guys out and hitting (above .300).''
</P>
<P>
   While Molina has been impressive at catcher, it didn't start out
that way in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to catch and I didn't know how I was going
to move up if I didn't know how to catch,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   Molina spent most seven of years in the minors, where his
progress was slowed by a variety of injuries (shoulder, hamstring
and wrist).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after hitting .257 in 31 games with the Angels late
last season, Molina won the starting job in the spring and hasn't
looked back. But the 25-year-old remains firmly grounded, even
though some are touting him as Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing the same things that got me here and I'm not
planning on changing,'' he said. ``I never imagine good or bad, I
try to stay level-headed and not put pressure on myself, just do
what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   And Molina is getting rave reviews from his pitchers, many of
whom he caught in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came up together and he knows our strengths and
weaknesses,'' said Washburn. ``I have great confidence in him;
there are very few times that I shake him off. I can't say enough
about the job he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn describes Molina as shy but said a transformation of
sorts takes place when he's behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come out and take charge; he doesn't hold back,''
Washburn said. ``And that's his job . . . to take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper found that out first-hand when he shook off Molina
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out and said, `That's not the pitch we should go
with,' '' Cooper said. ``We went with his pitch and we got the
batter out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the youngsters who appreciate Molina's style.
Veteran closer Troy Percival gives Molina high marks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good idea what to call and you can feel a
confidence back there,'' Percival said.

TASTING: LONG ISLAND MERLOTS THAT LIVE UP TO THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wine rode a bigger crest of popularity in the 1990s than
merlot.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that merlot is now grown all over the
world, as producers everywhere hope to get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   For all its popularity, though, merlot is a curious case. It
makes serious, wonderful wines, which reach luscious heights in
St.-Emilion and especially Pomerol, areas of Bordeaux where merlot
is a dominant grape. Yet, it also makes insipid wines, especially
in California. And while these wines have nonetheless proved
popular, they have received regular whippings from critics,
prompting some wine drinkers to turn up their noses at the mere
mention of merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear. Many merlots, even French ones, are plain bad:
weedy, and hollow. Some are good, even in California, where the
best examples either follow the Bordeaux model, with an elegant
balance of fruit, tannin and acidity, or are made in the more
typical California style, full of sweet fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, which has been promoted as a future merlot hotbed,
likewise makes some good merlots, but more uninteresting ones.
Unlike the French, who have had centuries to ponder how best to
plant the grapes, Long Island vintners are fairly new to merlot, so
a certain amount of experimentation is to be expected for a few
years at least.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen or so Long Island merlots I tasted, the Pellegrini
stood out for its balance and structure. Unlike many merlots, which
can be so soft they are practically squishy, the Pellegrini had the
tannins to stand up to the fruit. It is not the most approachable
wine, but in the long run it was easily the most pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   PELLEGRINI VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1996 $18
</P>
<P>
   Well structured, excellent balance between fruit and tannins.
</P>
<P>
   SCHNEIDER, NORTH FORK, 1997 $24
</P>
<P>
   Aromas of smoky herbs and plums, with a long sweet finish.
</P>
<P>
   BEDELL CELLARS, NORTH FORK, 1995 $17
</P>
<P>
   Smooth textured and medium bodied, soft but nicely flavored.
</P>
<P>
   LAUREL LAKE VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1996 $16
</P>
<P>
   Fruity and ripe, with a little chocolate mixed in, but very
soft.
</P>
<P>
   DUCK WALK VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1997 $20
</P>
<P>
   Aromas of chocolate and bell pepper, earthy flavors and a nice
finish.
</P>
<P>
   HARGRAVE, NORTH FORK, 1998 $18
</P>
<P>
   Light bodied, anise and bell pepper flavors balancing out the
fruit.

KEMAL SUNAL, 56, POPULAR TURKISH COMIC STAR
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Kemal Sunal, one of Turkey's most popular
comic actors, died on Monday in Istanbul. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Sunal had a lifelong fear of flying but had been persuaded to
take a commercial flight from Istanbul to the Black Sea port of
Trabzon, where he was to begin making a film. Soon after boarding
the plane at Ataturk Airport, he suffered a heart attack. He did
not respond to emergency first aid and was rushed to a hospital but
could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had plane phobia and could not get onto planes,'' said
Hulya Kocyigit, an actress and friend of Sunal's. ``I wish he had
traveled by car on the highway instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Erol Al, a member of Parliament who was on the plane with Sunal,
said he believed that negligence may have contributed to his death.
He said that personnel at the Istanbul airport ``were not at all
well-trained for emergency procedures and first aid'' and that when
an ambulance arrived 21 minutes after the heart attack there was no
doctor in it.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said Sunal was ``adored by the
Turkish people.'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said his films
``gave significant messages to society through humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunal starred in some long-running situation comedies and had
appeared in 82 movies since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He often played characters who epitomized the poor Anatolian
peasants who have migrated by the millions to big cities like
Istanbul. They find themselves overwhelmed by their new
environment, but although they are simple they manage to use their
native common sense to survive.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sunal's most famous characters was a slow-witted student
called Saban the Cow, and that expression has entered the Turkish
language to signify a well-meaning dolt who is a bit stupid but
good-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``His films were always the story of a maligned or oppressed
person,'' wrote the columnist Mehmet Ali Birand. ``The city people
look down on small-towners. They sneer at them. To earn money they
would, if they felt the need, commit any evil deed. Kemal Sunal won
a special place in the hearts of people because he showed in his
films that the ugly, the clumsy, the good, the naive and the honest
can also end up as winners. People saw themselves in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunal's screen persona was bumbling and utterly unsophisticated.
His ability to reach the hearts of ordinary people with simple
humor led to comparisons with Jerry Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we consider that the Turkish people's education is at the
primary school level, we can see why everybody can understand
Sunal's jokes,'' said Ozcan Koknel, a psychiatrist and social
commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Sunal was born in Istanbul on Nov. 11, 1944. He began his career
by playing theatrical roles during the 1960s and soon moved on to
films. By the mid-70s he had become one of Turkey's most popular
stars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 he played a leading role in ``Propaganda,'' a film by
Sinan Cetin about a town that rival groups divide with barbed wire.
It was read by some as an allegory for the divisions between Turks
and Kurds and was more subtle than the films for which Sunal became
famous.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of grief for Sunal reflected the pedestal on
which many Turks place their entertainers. Similar and perhaps even
more profound waves of mourning followed the deaths of the gifted
singer Zeki Muren in 1996 and the singer and television star Baris
Manco last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sunal is survived by his wife, Gul; his daughter, Ezo; and his
son, Ali, who was with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a talented actor, both in theater and movies, but
saying he was Turkey's best actor is an exaggeration,'' said Eris
Akman, a film producer. ``His director, Ertem Egilmez, knew his
target audience very well. These people associated themselves and
their village personalities with Kemal's roles. Through him they
could laugh at themselves.''

INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT PARRIES CRITICISM WITH A RAPIER TONGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to recast graf about Kartasasmita and Bawazier, deleting
reference to their being legislators.)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The biographer of Abdurrahman Wahid,
Indonesia's unpredictable president, thinks he has him figured out:
He is the drunken swordsman in the martial arts movie who disarms
his enemies with his seeming foolishness, then cuts them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great master who looks like a complete walkover,'' said
the biographer, Greg Barton, an Australian political scientist.
``Suddenly there's a whirl of limbs and then everyone is lying on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The swords are out again this week as the president and his many
opponents start slicing the air in advance of a special
parliamentary session next month.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are talking about impeachment, although the national
assembly does not technically have that power. At the least, it
will be a grandstand for the national harrangue that has dogged
Wahid since his improbable election last October.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody saw it coming when Wahid (who in fact is not a drinker)
announced that the police would investigate up to 10 members of
Parliament on suspicion of fomenting violence and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his now-familiar pattern of verbal feints and jabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one big fish,'' he said on Saturday, ``but we haven't
found the supporting evidence yet. Once we catch him it will all be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, according to a local newspaper, he said: ``I have
ordered the police to arrest and interrogate those suspected of
creating or being involved in riots. With or without evidence they
have to be captured.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday his Cabinet secretary, Marsilam Simanjuntak, said the
president had signed an order for the investigation of the
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with newspaper headlines blurting ``Confusion Reigns,''
the president said: ``I've never accused the legislators of being
guilty. My other statement was twisted for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jakarta is abuzz with rumors and political scurrying as
people name names, point fingers and nudge the points of their
knives into one another's backs.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Cabinet of former President Suharto _
Ginandjar Kartasasmita and Fuad Bawazier _ found themselves angrily
denying that they were on Wahid's list.
</P>
<P>
   Bawazier did not seem to help his case much when he denied a
suggestion that he was financing armed groups by saying: ``The
accusations are baseless. It is normal that I give donations to the
needy.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a diverting spectacle, but the stakes are high.
Indonesia is _ as the pilots of jetliners say _ passing through a
period of turbulence after the ouster of Suharto two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it does so, it sometimes seems that Wahid is alone at the
controls. And there are disconcerting moments when he seems,
willfully, to be steering into the thunderheads.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say Wahid is his own worst enemy,
undermining Indonesia's stability and economic recovery by his
impulsiveness and his tendency to cry wolf. Although economic
analysts insist that in real terms the economy is on an upturn, the
confidence of investors has continued to sink.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the political noise, the currency, the rupiah, fell to
below 9,000 to the dollar Tuesday, its lowest point in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The catch-phrase in Jakarta now is: ``The best thing the
president could do for the economy is to keep his mouth shut for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's defenders say that shutting his mouth would in effect be
laying down his weapons. With few political cards to play, they
say, the president is lucky that he is an expert bluffer.
</P>
<P>
   The back-room coalition he yanked together last October to win
the presidency has mostly turned against him, ready to devour him
when he presents his state of the nation address to the assembly
next month.
</P>
<P>
   And he is operating without much of a functioning bureaucracy,
which was eviscerated by Suharto during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Where Suharto kept his opponents at bay by force of arms, Wahid
must operate by the force of his personality. That is how he
undercut his recalcitrant military chief, Gen. Wiranto, in
February, pummeling him with a barrage of intemperate remarks and
finally dismissing him.
</P>
<P>
   The newly empowered legislature has roared to life as what one
analyst called a ``crocodile pit'' of political agendas. The
legislators fired the first shot last Friday when they voted to
call in the president later this month _ ahead of the assembly _ to
explain his firing of two Cabinet ministers in April. Barton,
Wahid's biographer, said the president had already ``done his
deals'' in advance of the assembly, well aware that few of his
critics are prepared to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur has done his political homework,'' said Barton, using
the president's nickname. ``In this, he is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president is faced with a surge of violent
unrest around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a religious war in the far eastern Maluku islands,
where more than 2,500 Christians and Muslims have been killed in
the last 18 months. There has been communal fighting on the islands
of Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok. There have been bomb blasts at
mosques and churches. And there are insurgencies in the provinces
of Aceh and Irian Jaya that appear to be receiving outside aid.
</P>
<P>
   The unseen hands behind them may include military plotters,
local power blocs, ambitious politicians and people from the former
government.
</P>
<P>
   Their message, said Barton, is: ```Back off or we'll make
problems.' It's a sort of hostage situation; it doesn't take a lot
of money to set things off. From others, it's, `Let's see what a
weak leader he is.' There are all sorts of crazies, all sorts of
people trying their thing, trying to get him to take them
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot for one man to handle. And, according to Barton, it
is a battle the president relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feint to the left, hit to the right: Your opponent never knows
where you're coming from,'' Barton said. ``It's strongly his style,
like a kung fu expert. He doesn't always land on his feet, but
don't underestimate him.''

MATHIS WINS MLS HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Former Los Angeles Galaxy striker Clint
Mathis, who proudly displays his ``I Love NY'' T-shirt after each
goal he scores for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, was named
MLS player of the month for June.
</P>
<P>
   New York picked up Mathis from L.A. in the dispersal draft that
followed the allocation of Luis Hernandez to the Galaxy. Hernandez
scored his first goal in eight games on Saturday; Mathis has
recorded four goals and eight assists for the East-leading
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hartman, Elliott return: Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman
returned to his starting role after missing Saturday's 4-2 loss to
the Dallas Burn so he could attend his sister's wedding in Palos
Verdes.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Matt Reis, likely doesn't want to remember that
match. It was the most goals allowed by a Galaxy team since four
were allowed against Dallas last October.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Simon Elliott is back to his starting role after
returning from Tahiti where he played for New Zealand in the
Oceania Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott missed two games before returning as a late substitute
Saturday in Dallas. He is having his best MLS season and it's
paying off with his national team. He scored two goals off free
kicks for New Zealand during the tournament as New Zealand reached
the championship before falling to Australia 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Midfielder Danny Pena underwent surgery last
week to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
Galaxy fitness trainer Jim Liston believes Pena can recover before
the season ends. Pena, 32, is expected to be out four to eight
weeks.

ZIMBABWE'S ECONOMIC WOES EXPECTED TO GET WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `number' to `proportion' in 6th graf.)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Just days after Zimbabwe's fledgling
opposition party splashed into Parliament, its jobless supporters
were still digging for dreams.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of gold hidden beneath the red soil on a deserted
farm here. And one recent morning, desperate men and women were
clawing into the earth, hunting for the glimmers that might buy a
bag of rice or a pair of secondhand shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is hopeless, backbreaking work, and the diggers pray that
their new representatives in Parliament will help ease
unemployment, which stands at nearly 50 percent, so they can find
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking our lives will change now,'' said Francisca
Makumbe, 32, as she hauled a sack of the red earth to the river for
panning. ``There is no future in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the strong showing of the opposition in the
parliamentary election last week has heightened expectations among
the urban poor, economists predict that the coming months will only
bring more hardship to a country already staggering through its
worst economic crisis since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study, the U.N. Development Program reported that the
proportion of people living in poverty in Zimbabwe surged from 40
percent to 75 percent in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on health and education has dipped so
sharply that schools routinely run short of textbooks, hospitals go
without medicines and the sick are increasingly turning to
traditional medicine and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that the worst is yet to come. While neighboring
countries in southern Africa this year are expected to enjoy their
highest growth rates since 1996, Zimbabwe's economy is expected to
shrink, perhaps as much as 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which won 57 seats in the 150-member Parliament,
lacks a majority and control over the government's fiscal policy,
which has been characterized by chronic budget overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and business executives say economic recovery will
depend largely on foreign investment and financing from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But in a ranking of the
economic prospects of African countries issued last month by the
World Economic Forum, Zimbabwe placed next to last, dimming most
hopes for private investment.
</P>
<P>
   With President Robert Mugabe vowing to reinstate price controls
and to seize white-owned farms without compensation, there is
little chance that Western donors will rush to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   And so in an abandoned field of tall grass and white
butterflies, the prospectors here will likely cling to their dreams
and dig for gold while their children go to sleep hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of parliamentary debate, the coming of the opposition
is positive, but the power they have is limited,'' said James Jowa,
the research economist at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce. ``Things are getting worse and worse. We need urgent
rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors have already suspended most expansion plans. And
officials say the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
which cut off financing last year after the government
underreported the cost of its role in the war in Congo, want to see
signs of fiscal discipline before offering aid.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks donors will be watching to see how Mugabe
realigns his Cabinet, manages his budget and handles land
redistribution. They will be looking for significant changes,
particularly in fiscal management, in which the government's track
record has been dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which budgeted a one-third salary increase for
civil servants this year, has actually increased salaries by nearly
65 percent, according to an economic analysis conducted by Standard
Chartered Bank here. And the budget deficit, expected to total 3.8
percent of the gross domestic product, is now expected to soar to
12 percent by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the regime is dead,'' said one Western
official familiar with the negotiations between Western aid donors
and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any money flowing unless Mugabe
changes his ways,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The donors cannot go to their boards with a program
based on promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling economy has also been hurt by external factors
like the falling prices of tobacco and gold in recent years, two
droughts and a so-called structural adjustment program that was
applauded by the West but plunged many more people into poverty
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Under such programs, international lending organizations demand
that countries living beyond their means reduce spending on public
projects and cut subsidies that often keep the cost of living down.
``We all underestimated the social impact of the program,'' said a
Western economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``And when
we recognized it, we didn't get our act together quickly enough to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Mugabe's party, who still control the Cabinet and
Parliament, say they are keenly aware that they must address the
economic crisis. But the Cabinet is split between those who want to
move toward a socialist, managed economy and those who embrace the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt of the sense of urgency. Inflation stands
at about 50 percent and is expected to soar. For many of the
diggers here, meat and shoes without holes have become unimaginable
luxuries.

COLUMN: OF ALL PLACES, LADY LIBERTY OFF LIMITS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oh, it was grand all right, grand as could be, the
crisp procession of tall ships along the waters of New York. You'd
have had to be drained of every drop of romance to be unimpressed
by the spectacle and the grace that it shed on us all.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard not to feel that several important, if
undistinguished, vessels were missing in the hullabaloo of OpSail
2000. They were ordered off the water so they would not get in the
way of their fairer, more favored cousins that set sail on this
Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about the ferryboats that carry thousands of
people a day from Battery Park to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island. Since they were unable to leave their moorings, it meant
that the inspiring statue and the historic immigration center were
closed to the public for the day.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, you say? What's one day?
</P>
<P>
   Not much perhaps. But it did seem strange that on the day
Americans celebrated their emergence as a people, the people could
not reach enduring symbols of the country's claim to be a beacon
for _ how did Emma Lazarus put it? _ those ``huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.''
</P>
<P>
   Close Liberty and Ellis Islands on Independence Day? Fine. While
you are at it, why not shut the doors of St. Patrick's Cathedral on
Easter Sunday because all those worshipers interfere with the
thousands flocking to Fifth Avenue for the fashion show known as
the Easter Parade?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Drees, of Boulder, Colo., was one of many visitors to
Battery Park on the eve of the holiday who could not believe that
the Statue of Liberty, of all places, would be off limits on the
Fourth of July, of all days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely ridiculous,'' he said as he stood Monday
afternoon outside Castle Clinton, the old fort that now serves as a
ticket booth for the ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there might be legitimate security concerns, Drees said.
But he added, ``What's the point of this country if you're going to
let your fears over security shut it down?''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the twin islands of liberty and immigration were
hostage Tuesday to the classically American _ and very New York _
need for chest-thumping over superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of graceful ships that pleased the eye and exercised
the imagination was of itself insufficient. It had to be beaten
into everyone, mercilessly, that this was the biggest, the best,
the boldest, the most whatever of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The advance billing, repeatedly echoed by television announcers,
was that it would be ``the greatest event in maritime history.''
Didn't anyone off camera ever whisper ``D-Day'' in these people's
ears? Or at least show them a video of ``Saving Private Ryan''?
</P>
<P>
   But then television merely fell in step with the times. New
York, in general, seems to be hooked on always having to top
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough for people to enjoy themselves last New Year's
Eve. For New Yorkers to have a good time, the celebrations had to
be the largest, the liveliest, the most bubbly and eye-popping
ever. The same principle governed OpSail Tuesday morning and the
holiday fireworks displayed later that night, an appreciated annual
gift from Macy's that is also an obvious promotional device _ call
it OpSale.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks were not merely splendiferous. What counted for
many New Yorkers was that they were the most outsized: 60,000
shells weighing 150 tons and bursting at a rate of 2,000 per
minute, or if you preferred, 34 per second.
</P>
<P>
   On and on, for weeks, the numbers poured out of an ever-churning
hype machine. Four million people would view the ships. There would
be 70,000 craft in the water. About 28,000 police officers would be
on duty. That some of those numbers were gross exaggerations made
no nevermind. What mattered for many people were the superlatives
themselves. They were the ultimate affirmation of our civic worth,
not the waterborne displays of grace and majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Some people did not buy it.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that numbers were fleeting and that the Statue of
Liberty was a lot more than a backdrop for a fireworks display,
especially on this holiday.
</P>
<P>
   They were people like Jo Ann and Sam Mannino, visitors from
Detroit, who went to the statue with their three small children on
the Third of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get our kids to understand things like the Statue
of Liberty, and the pain that people went through ... '' Mannino
said. He did not finish the thought, picking up a different one
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first symbol of America,'' he said, as his wife
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called a reality check,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband agreed, and pointed to the children. ``They've got
to learn about it,'' he said.

COLUMN: JULY FOURTH IN MORRISTOWN, N.J., MARKED BY DEMONSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISTOWN, N.J. _ This town, which served as a headquarters of
the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with
a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete
with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a
live-action drama showcasing those inalienable rights of life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won
the right in court to hold a rally here Tuesday. Richard Barrett,
whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ``the white race is the
superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its
history. Just as George Washington ``said no to the privileges of
the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,''
Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett got what he wanted Tuesday _ helmeted police protecting
his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry
counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect
forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Barrett brought to town
an anemic anti-affirmative action protest and a racist version of
the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night, as Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive
message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people
filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a
celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and
embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a
community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then
brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't
have done it without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is
superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter,
said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The service and candlelight march to the Morristown Green was
arranged at the urging of the mayor, John DeLaney Jr., who was
looking for a way to counter Barrett without giving him the
satisfaction of a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The town has about 17,000 residents _ about 15 percent black and
20 percent Hispanic _ and just around the corner from Calvary
Baptist Church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a
house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was
killed last year by police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors
cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example
of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi
David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the
crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I.,
that one of the country's guiding ideals was ``to give to bigotry
no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst who is black, said
she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even
though she grew up in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and
rarely felt racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a KKK march,'' she said. ``I brought my
daughter. She knows about the KKK. I want her to see it. This is
our history, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night
remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama.
Barrett's message ``really astounded me,'' he said. ``I really
thought these days were passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Moore
said, but there were more white faces in the pews, and the ranks of
racists were thinner. ``I think you have to accept the differences
and move on,'' he said. ``I think that's what we're doing more of _
accepting the differences and moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   But moving on is not a straight course.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's harmony gave way to Tuesday's ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an
angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on
horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups,
including the Progressive Labor Party, were hurling vile taunts at
the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw
golf balls and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to
oppose Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous
winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July
freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown.
``It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving
the rally. ``It always is.'' &QL;

AS PUBLIC CELEBRATES FREEDOM, HOSPITALIZED VETERANS PAY THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `Administration' to `Affairs' in 2nd and 19th
grafs.)  
(With NY-JULY4) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sign in the veterans hospital in Brooklyn reads:
``The Price of Freedom Is Visible Here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Americans were supposed to remember. On Tuesday,
hundreds of thousands of people celebrated on the shores of New
York Harbor as they watched one of the largest armadas ever
assembled. Meanwhile, fewer than two dozen people went to see the
men of war and military service who sat silently in the beds and
halls and doorways of the Veterans Affairs hospital, unable to see
the flotilla from their windows as it passed underneath the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge just a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   These men passed the morning inhaling the smell of antiseptic
and the stench of bedpans, listening to the mumblings of the dying,
lying in bed watching the beautiful boats on their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ward 8 is the cancer precinct, and the men there wait for
disease to do what fighting wars could not. To a man, they said
they were disappointed that their sacrifices _ some fought, some
served, none regretted any of it _ were not appreciated more, that
there was no band playing, that there was no child's hand to hold.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were lonely.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Spangled Banner played on a television and its melody
drifted down the hall. The music came from the room of Frank
Pardal, 54, who held his eyes closed. He breathed from a tube while
his lips mouthed the words. When the music was over, he opened his
eyes. He was alone. There were pictures of the boats sailing by on
his screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy mackerel, that's big holiday stuff,'' he said. ``They
look like a bunch of birds out there, those boats do.''
</P>
<P>
   He cleared his tube and wiped his fingers on the sheets. ``It
don't mean nothing to me, though. Independence Day. It don't mean
nothing to anyone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardal served from 1965 to 1968 in West Germany for the Army. He
came home to Staten Island, worked laboring jobs and then was hit
by a car. That's when they found the cancer. He has not left the
hospital in months. And no one has come to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you the truth though, I wish I was out there looking at
those long beauties go by, having a cold one and a dog and holding
my girl's hand,'' he said. ``Even if I could get out of bed, what
could I do? I got a view of an air conditioning unit.''
</P>
<P>
   No one likes to hear about self-deception and disappointment and
grief, said Eddie Murach, 72, a retired sergeant major who served
in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. But, he says, that is precisely
what war is, that is precisely what Ward 8 is. Because whatever war
it was, Murach said, however long it lasted, it changed men from
scrawny hometown clerks into men who know the fragility of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for these guys down the hall,'' he said.
``They've got no one.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant is one of the lucky ones. He has his wife, Mary
Ellen. He met her at a root beer stand in rural Indiana. He sat in
his Buick. She sat in the next car over. That was 47 years, three
children and six grandchildren ago.
</P>
<P>
   She washed him Tuesday morning and brought him a pair of
binoculars to watch the ships. But the day was hazy and the windows
stained with soot. The armada might as well have been in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Murach insisted he was no hero. A 30-year veteran of the Army,
Murach started his career with the Japanese occupation. He was part
of the Chosin Reservoir Campaign in Korea when the conflict broke
out in 1950. He slept in a frozen hole for 60 days. The Army had
given its men summer gear for a winter campaign and he watched as
men died of exposure. Then the Chinese poured down the ridge, the
batallion pulled out, were re-outfitted and pushed back in.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Vietnam. ``I was 40, and I had to volunteer because
they wouldn't send me,'' he said, laying bare-chested in bed. The
boats below sailed by. ``I figured it was a career for me and they
were taking guys who didn't want to go. I felt it was my duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He has cancer _ probably caused by exposure to Agent Orange, he
said the doctors told him. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and
two Bronze Stars with valor. He spends part of his time in the
hospital, part of his time as a high school baseball coach. He
loves Buicks and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more blessings than I'm entitled to,'' Murach said as
he squeezed his wife's hand. ``I do wish that all of us could go
outside for just a moment and get a gander of those ships.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 veterans stayed in the hospitals last year,
according to Veterans Affairs statistics, and 35 million
outpatients visited its clinics. Statistics on visitors are not
kept. But Sgt. Clifford Newman of the Federal Police Department,
who patrolled the empty lobby Tuesday morning, said the respect for
people in uniform had declined drastically over the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of freedom is not cheap,'' the sergeant said.
``People could invest a little time. Instead of spending the whole
day watching the boats go by and lighting off firecrackers, people
should have thought to visit a vet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Passaro sat in a chair in the doorway of his room. ``I'm
just going to sit here and watch the floors dry,'' he said. ``It's
a cruel, cruel thing to have those boats going by and us locked up
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Passaro is 84. He said he saw more action at the horse track
than in the Second World War as a supply clerk. And now that he is
alone and has no visitors, he wishes he had conducted his life
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a crumb, I admit that,'' he said. ``But even a crumb
needs company.''

ASHCROFT, CARNAHAN TRY TO OUTDO EACH OTHER ON CRIME ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Never mind that crime and mayhem are down
nationwide. John Ashcroft is pursuing that tried-and-true
Republican tactic of thumping his rival, Democrat Mel Carnahan, as
soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, seeking a second term in the U.S. Senate, slams the
two-term governor for taking a murderer off death row at the
request of Pope John Paul II. Carnahan, Ashcroft says, never even
told the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan now asserts that Ashcroft did the same thing when
he was governor. And he says that Ashcroft's crime-fighting
credentials are suspect because of his opposition to gun-control
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashcroft's been against every reasonable gun-safety measure
that's come before Congress during his almost six years in
office,'' said Carnahan campaign manager Marc Farinella.
</P>
<P>
   That crime has moved to the forefront of the state's Senate race
should be no surprise, experts say. Although the issue may have
been surpassed by education, health care and sometimes Social
Security as higher priorities in national opinion polls, crime
remains a perennial voter concern.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates, no matter where they are from, don't want to appear
weak-kneed on law-breakers the way Democrat Michael Dukakis did
when he lost the 1988 presidential race to George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis opposed capital punishment, and Bush made him pay for
that stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates cannot afford to be out `anti-crimed,' so to
speak,'' said Ken Warren, a St. Louis University political
scientist. ``They want to make sure they look the toughest on
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Carnahan both favor capital punishment. When
Ashcroft was governor, the state began carrying out executions
again in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 decision. Seven
inmates were put to death under Ashcroft; Carnahan has so far
overseen 36 executions.
</P>
<P>
   Although several recent studies have raised questions about the
fairness of capital punishment, neither candidate favors a
moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, said spokesman Steve Hilton, ``believes in capital
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan is convinced that ``the system works well here,'' said
spokesman Jerry Nachtigal.
</P>
<P>
   Crime surfaced as a point of contention only weeks after
Carnahan announced his plans to challenge Ashcroft in late 1998.
The door opened the next year after Carnahan agreed to Pope John
Paul II's request to commute the sentence of convicted killer
Darrell Mease.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan called the decision a one-time act in response to a
personal plea from the pope. Mease will now spend his life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have done it,'' said Ashcroft, who complained that
an act of a jury was nullified by a governor's personal whim. It
also showed that Carnahan would use the death penalty to score
political points _ in this case with Roman Catholic voters, Hilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Farinella is convinced that Ashcroft's focus on crime is a
result of the Mease commutation.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft wants to make himself into the anti-crime candidate,
Farinella said, ``and the one and only thing he has to point to is
Mease.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Senate hearing in March 1999, the senator complained that
the relatives of the couple and their paraplegic grandson whom
Mease shot to death ``did not get a phone call, even a letter''
about Carnahan's commutation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Carnahan accuses Ashcroft of doing the same thing. In 1992,
Ashcroft commuted the sentences of Helen Martin and Becca Hughes,
who were convicted in Jefferson County of murdering or arranging
the murder of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Both faced life imprisonment without parole. Ashcroft's decision
meant that the women were eligible to seek parole.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft had never commuted a prisoner's sentence. He said he
did so in these two cases because the women were convicted before a
1987 law went into effect allowing women to use the battered-spouse
syndrome as a defense. Juries never heard about the severe abuse
each woman endured, the governor said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, though, pointed out that Ashcroft did not notify the
victims' families when he took his action.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft contends MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...when he took his action.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft contends his action only allowed the women to
eventually seek parole. Notifying relatives, he said, was a parole
board task.
</P>
<P>
   Martin eventually was released from prison, although Hughes was
not, Carnahan aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Farinella said blaming someone else for the lack of notification
isn't valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is...a flat-out contradiction,'' Farinella said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan opposed last year's failed Proposition B, which would
have allowed Missourians to carry concealed weapons. He often
points out that Ashcroft was a prime proponent who made radio ads
last year in support of concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gun stands sell well in rural areas, but not in the state's
two major cities, where crime is more prevalent and where
Proposition B was defeated with more than 70 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the balance are the state's suburban voters, who also
were strong in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburban areas are very important in terms of electoral
outcomes,'' says Farinella. ``Crime is likely to be one of the key
issues that suburbanites vote on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has gone out of his way to label Ashcroft's gun record
a carbon copy of the National Rifle Association's agenda. The NRA
has given Ashcroft more than $50,000 in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft opposed the federal assault-weapons ban in 1994 when he
was running for the Senate. In 1998, he voted against a bill that
would have required dealers to sell child-safety locks with each
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has highlighted Ashcroft's firearms votes in news
releases to reporters titled ``Ashcroft's Gun Safety Charade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ashcroft maintains he has ``zero tolerance'' for gun
violence. He favors a program known as Project Exile that
guarantees prison sentences for anyone caught using a gun in
connection with illegal drugs, children or domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates claim that the program has resulted in dramatically
fewer murders in Atlanta and Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Missouri,'' said Hilton, the Ashcroft aide,
``are interested in programs that work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft also points to his work last year on a juvenile-crime
bill that remains bottled up in a House-Senate conference
committee. In particular, the Senate passed an Ashcroft amendment
that bars juveniles from possessing semiautomatic assault weapons,
such as an Uzi or ``street sweeper'' shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of violence that has polluted our society and
desensitized our children to violence over the past decade must be
confronted,'' the senator said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan criticized Ashcroft's amendment, which passed with
96 votes, saying the so-called ban provides too many exceptions.
``The point is, the law is so broad that any juvenile can carry a
semiautomatic weapon,'' Farinella said of the Ashcroft amendment.
An NRA spokeswoman said the group ``didn't oppose'' the senator's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's provision would make possession of a semiautomatic
weapon subject to the same rules as possession of a handgun. In
most cases, those rules require a parent to authorize use of the
weapon for hunting or farming, or at the juvenile's job.
</P>
<P>
   The two remain somewhat divided on the issue of mandatory
background checks at gun shows. Ashcroft voted for a 1999 bill that
Republicans say would have taken care of the issue. Many Democrats
disagreed. They preferred what they called a tougher version
sponsored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey; it ultimately
passed when Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft opposed the Lautenberg proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In a race filled with contrasts, the two campaigns differ on why
crime has become a focal point. Democrats point out that
violent-crime rates have dropped dramatically during Carnahan's
eight years as governor and under President Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are concerned that they are now vulnerable on the
crime issue, which the Republicans have always viewed as a core
issue for them,'' Farinella said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft points to recent federal crime statistics showing that
Kansas City and St. Louis now rank fourth and first respectively
nationwide in per-capita serious-crime rankings. The ranking came
despite figures showing that the number of reported serious crimes
in both cities had declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City has very problematic numbers,'' Hilton said.

STEELY DAN: JADED, METICULOUS, QUIRKY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WANTAGH, N.Y. _ ``It's a strange night,'' Donald Fagen said in
the middle of Steely Dan's concert Monday night at the Jones Beach
Theater here. ``I'm not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed about to explain further when his partner, Walter
Becker, drily cut him off. ``Another strange night,'' Becker
deadpanned, returning the show to routine and not revealing a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a night out of a Steely Dan song: gray, rainy,
mildly uncomfortable, thoroughly unglamorous and redeemed by music.
Meticulous as always, Becker on guitar and Fagen on keyboards led a
band that lavished attention on the peculiar and ingenious details
that define Steely Dan songs: the telegraphic lyrics, the aberrant
structures, the harmonies that won't stay in one key, the
gradations of swinging and rocking rhythm, the voicings of lines
for the horn section, the shifts between basic blues vamps and
Steely Dan's gnarled variations. Steely Dan songs thrive on a
convoluted perversity that few other songwriters have tried to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, when Steely Dan released its debut album, Becker and
Fagen have been writing about marginal, disreputable characters:
some smug, some running out of luck. Monday night, Fagen sang about
drug dealers, drug addicts, a Wall Street opportunist, small-time
hoods, a self-destructive jazz musician, a cornered psychotic
bomber and three aging lechers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steely Dan can be cynical about everything except music. Its
vignettes of sleaze and human shortcomings are eased into songs
that pose and solve musical conundrums under a smooth pop veneer.
</P>
<P>
   At times Steely Dan can be the middle-aged version of Eminem,
the rapper who has been widely denounced for the sick-minded
characters he creates. Becker and Fagen are not mellowing with
maturity. On the ``Gaucho'' album in 1980, and Monday night, Steely
Dan sang ``Hey Nineteen,'' about a baby boomer (then pushing 40)
longing to seduce a 19-year-old he'll never understand. ``She
thinks I'm crazy/But I'm just growing old,'' Fagen sang, with some
poignancy, in his thick, straining voice.
</P>
<P>
   In two songs from ``Two Against Nature'' (Giant), Steely Dan's
first album of new songs since 1980, similar premises became more
grotesque. ``Cousin Dupree'' tries to make a pass at his cousin,
while ``Janie Runaway'' is an underage waif who's turned into a
rich man's plaything: ``Who gets to spend her birthday in
Spain?/Possibly you.''
</P>
<P>
   The pop is 1970s pop, with no updates. Although early Steely Dan
tried to sound unobtrusive, its music ended up becoming one of the
defining styles of the decade, as Becker and Fagen collaborated on
seven Steely Dan albums before they separated in 1980. They began
touring again as Steely Dan in 1993 but took their time before
releasing ``Two Against Nature'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   The group pays no attention to hip-hop, hard rock, electronica
or anything else that's affected popular music in the last 20
years. Nor do Becker and Fagen seem to care that many of their
musical quirks have been learned, and shaped into a new version of
blandness, by a generation of ``lite jazz'' musicians. Steely Dan
insists on refining what it already had.
</P>
<P>
   And what it had is a thoroughly selective backward glance into
American pop. At Jones Beach, Steely Dan revealed some of its roots
when, after an intermission, its band played ``Hank's Pad'' by
Henry Mancini. Like many Steely Dan songs, the tune shifts between
a bluesy riff and elaborate bebop harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   Steely Dan looks back to a '50s hipness that prized bebop and
big-band jazz as well as the example of Jerry Lieber and Mike
Stoller, the songwriting team that slipped storytelling and social
commentary into wry rock 'n' roll songs. But they add the jaded
perspective of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Becker and Fagen prize the craftsmanship that rock and free jazz
challenged; they savor forms and limitations in order to stretch
them. Their songs here were extended to show off clever new
introductions and solos by Becker on guitar _ with taunting lines
against the beat or phrases that breezed above it _and first-rate
band members, including Jon Herington on guitar, the saxophonists
Bob Sheppard and Cornelius Bumpus, Michael Leonhart on trumpet and
Ted Baker on keyboard. The songs were slick and luxurious, and
still disquieting.

CONNECTICUT CITY SUES ITS PLANNING COMMISSION FOR APPROVING
DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDEN, Conn. _ In this struggling blue-collar city, tucked
into the leafy Quinnipiac River Valley halfway between Hartford and
New Haven, the fight over a 100-foot-high mound of jagged shale
boulders and scrub brush has turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the city filed a lawsuit in Superior Court against
its planning commission for approving a plan by the property owner
to blast the hill to build 36 town houses. The city contended in
the lawsuit that the commission approved the project illegally,
contravening its own rules protecting local ridge lines.
</P>
<P>
   City council members voted unanimously last week to spend
$15,000 on lawyers to for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the July 25 court date: on one side, environmentalists
and North End residents who live near the hill; and, on the other
side, the politically connected businessman permitted to raze the
hill.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists and residents say the hill is a natural
extension of Cathole Mountain, a towering face of rock cliffs
looming over Meriden from the northwest, and should only be
developed with care. But to the businessman, William Corvo, and his
partners, the hill is privately owned and worth millions of dollars
after development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel this is _ not to exaggerate _ the Rocky Mountains
or something of that nature, then you should acquire it,'' said
Corvo, 49.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Corvo bought the the hill and its 660,000 cubic
yards of shale from two of his friends, Joseph and Salvatore
Carabetta, brothers who have made a fortune in area real estate
deals over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the commission's vote, on June 1, everyone says things
have gone drastically wrong. The hill, and Meriden's planning
commission, were not supposed to end up in court _ again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the planning commission denied a company controlled by
the Carabetta brothers a permit to level the same hill and build
houses. The brothers sued the commission, arguing it had no right
to deny them a permit, but a Superior Court judge in New Haven
sided with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is in a fervor over this thing,'' said Dominick
Caruso, Meridan's director of planning, who had warned the
commission minutes before its vote last month to reject the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war over the hill, which is too small to hike and too
gentle to climb, may been seen as a case study of Meriden city
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Joseph Marinan Jr., is a Democrat who appointed the
planning commission, including its chairman, Roger DeZinno. At a
meeting last month, DeZinno, also a Democrat, voted with the
commission's two Republicans to approve Corvo's housing project,
which passed, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the city council directed the city manager and
Caruso to file a lawsuit. Corvo hired Meriden's former Democratic
mayor, William Shea, as his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including some city officials, say they believe
that the Carabetta brothers are behind Corvo's bid and that they
improperly influenced the planning commission vote to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The planning commission's chairman, DeZinno, and the Carabetta
brothers ``enjoy boating together'' on a powerboat owned by the
brothers, said Stephen Anderson, a lawyer representing two
homeowners suing the city and the commission to stop the project.
Anderson also points out that Lois DeMayo, a Republican planning
commissioner who voted to approve razing the hill, owns a
telephone-answering service that contracts its services to
companies owned by the Carabettas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Corvo accuses Caruso, the city planner, of being
unprofessional and having a ``personal problem'' with developing
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   DeMayo blames the local media and a pack of ``tree huggers'' for
keeping the issue in local newspaper headlines for the past month.
She also accused the city council of playing favorites with local
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the proper excavation company applied, the one that the
city wants to get the contract, that hill would be down tomorrow,''
she said. ``This is all politics. This thing is a hill. It's not
cliffs, it's not climbing, it's not hiking, and besides, it's
private property.''
</P>
<P>
   If the city council wants to protect the property, she asked,
why doesn't it vote to buy it?
</P>
<P>
   The city may get its chance on Wednesday, when Corvo is
scheduled to meet with Marinan to try resolving their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel that it's absolutely critical,'' Corvo said of
the hill, ``then they are going to be given the option of buying
it.'' The price: somewhere in the single-digit millions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not work out, he said, he is also considering
filing individual lawsuits against all 12 Council members for
voting to sue the planning commission and his development company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody,'' he said, ``has got to be personally responsible
for their actions.''

EDITORIAL: A MISGUIDED WORLD BANK PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the World Bank's board of executive directors will
consider how to proceed with a $40 million loan to China. The loan
would underwrite a dam and irrigation projects in a remote part of
western China and resettle 58,000 impoverished Chinese and Hui
Muslim farmers in lands that have traditionally been home to
Tibetans and Mongol herders. The plan would thus threaten a
distinct Tibetan culture, and should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The project generated intense public criticism last year because
of its environmental impacts and because the Tibetan population
would be diluted by non-Tibetan settlers. The social impact is of
great concern because China has in the past used similar strategies
to weaken Tibetan claims of a separate culture. Dozens of
environmental and human rights groups and the Clinton
administration opposed financing the project.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the controversy, the directors delayed the loan
until the bank's independent inspection panel could review various
issues, including whether the bank had met its own standards for
protecting the environment and indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The board refused to make the report public after the panel
finished it. But it has since been leaked to the press and, not
surprisingly, it is devastating. The panel found that the bank's
management failed to consider alternatives to resettlement or other
resettlement sites, and did not comply with other policy
requirements, including the need to make a proper environmental
analysis and create plans to preserve local cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's president, James Wolfensohn, believes that these
failures can be addressed by conducting more thorough studies on
the project's impacts. But studies are not the answer. They may
satisfy the bank's regulations, but they will do nothing to solve
the social problems created by incursions into traditionally
Tibetan lands. The bank directors would be wiser simply to reject
this poorly designed project, and to invite China and the bank's
management to present an alternative plan that would not require a
large resettlement program in a culturally sensitive area.

EDITORIAL: IMMIGRATION INJUSTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment rates at a 30-year low and strong growth in
the high-tech sector, many technology companies are hard pressed to
find enough programmers and other skilled workers to meet their
needs. One way industry has dealt with the labor shortage has been
to hire skilled foreign workers who are allowed to come to this
country under special, temporary H-1B visas. But now demand for
skilled workers is outstripping the number of such workers allowed
in each year by statute. Congress needs to raise the visa cap
temporarily to ease the shortages. It should also correct some
severe injustices in the immigration laws that have hurt immigrants
who have been in this country for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, H-1B visas, which permit foreign workers to
stay in the United States for up to six years, are capped at
115,000 for fiscal year 2000 and will decline to 65,000 in 2002.
There is bipartisan support in Congress to increase that cap for a
limited time. One reasonable proposal, sponsored by Reps. David
Dreier, R-Calif., and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., would increase the cap
to 200,000 visas per year through 2003. Their bill would set aside
a number of the visas for nonprofit research institutions and
require that 60,000 visas be reserved for people with advanced
degrees. The proposal would also increase the visa application fee
to $1,000 from $500 and direct the money toward job training and
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports a temporary increase in the
visa cap, but with higher fees than the Dreier-Lofgren plan. It
also wants Congress to correct some other immigration problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress granted permanent residency to Nicaraguan and
Cuban refugees who fled oppression by their leftist regimes in the
1980s. But it granted only lesser forms of relief to Guatemalans
and Salvadorans who fled right-wing regimes, and it neglected
Haitians and Hondurans. Congress should dismantle these
distinctions and allow Central American refugees to apply for
permanent residency on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should also cure a legal mess left over from the 1986
immigration overhaul. At that time Congress granted amnesty to
illegal aliens who had been in the country before 1982. But some
300,000 people were improperly denied the opportunity to apply for
amnesty by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Years of litigation followed, with the courts ruling in favor of
the immigrants. Then in 1996, Congress stripped the courts of
jurisdiction over these cases, leaving these immigrants, a great
number of whom had been granted work authorization, in legal limbo.
A sensible bill now pending in Congress would allow these
individuals and other similarly situated people who have been here
since the mid-1980s to stay permanently.
