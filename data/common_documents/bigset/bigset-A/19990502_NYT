DIRTY JOB WORTH BIG MONEY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Dirt is a hot commodity in Phoenixs booming construction
market.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't have it want it so they can build homes,
offices, shopping centers and highways, and those who have too much
of it need to get rid of it to clear sites and finish developments.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty stuff people wipe off their shoes is big business
here. Companies are selling it, trucking it and grading it. More
than 10 million cubic yards of earth was moved around the Valley
last year.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 10 truckloads of dirt to carve out a hole for the
typical swimming pool, about 75 cubic yards of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 21,000 truckloads have come out of the ground in the
middle of downtown Phoenix where the office, hotel and shopping
complex Collier Center is going up.
</P>
<P>
   But where does it all go? Wherever a dirt broker can find a home
for it.
</P>
<P>
   These middlemen work with contractors to find dirt for projects
that need it and haul it away from land that has too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real commodity,'' said Mike Markham, president of
Markham Contracting of Phoenix. ``If you need it, dirt's expensive.
If you need to get rid of it, it's expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs from $30 to $50 to move an average truckload several
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors use dirt to raise foundations, fill in ravines,
solidify hillsides and support parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes builders even have to outbid each other for good soil
close by so they can finish projects on time and on budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirt really has no value. It all comes down to the cost of
moving it,'' said Jim Padavano of Canyon Country Contracting. He
was one of the first dirt brokers in the Valley, starting in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Padavano, who is constantly tracking developments across the
Phoenix area to find dirt and builders who want it, estimated soil
is worth about $3 to $5 a cubic yard.
</P>
<P>
   That's why dirt is rarely moved more than five miles to another
site, because longer treks turn into money losers. Dirt brokers say
that's why Valley dirt never goes as far as Tucson or out of state.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, most trucking companies move it at night,
something traffic engineers appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lund, a senior project manager with Opus West
Construction, is in charge of the Collier Center project, and said
hauling the 281,000 cubic yards of dirt out of that project's
basement was no easy feat.
</P>
<P>
   He explained the trucks had to maneuver around crowds of people
in downtown Phoenix at night for baseball, basketball and hockey
games and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   If a contractor can find someone to buy the dirt, then the cost
is usually split between the two projects. However, if no one wants
the earth, then a builder has to assume the cost of hauling it to
the dump to get it out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt in your front yard could be from the nearest freeway,
shopping center or office building.
</P>
<P>
   Earth and cobble rock that came out of the Collier Center went
to Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, the nearby Salt
River bed and to a crusher where some is being turned into
Ready-mix concrete.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the 10,000 truckloads of dirt that came out of the hole
for the Nordstrom department store built last year at Scottsdale
Fashion Square ended up as part of the new Pima Freeway a few miles
away to the east, Padavano said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeways are huge dirt users and movers. The ``bridges to
nowhere'' on the Pima Indian Reservation on the fringe of east
Scottsdale were built when the Arizona Department of Transportation
had extra dirt, say dirt brokers.
</P>
<P>
   But not all dirt is the same. Some is bad and can be used for
little else than infill at the dump. Good dirt usually has a slew
of takers.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt brokers and contractors shy away from soil in Gilbert,
southwest Phoenix and along parts of the Superstition Freeway in
the East Valley because it's packed with clay, which makes it
porous causing it to expand under projects, eventually cracking
foundations and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Soil from the base of mountains fresh with silt is the best,
they say. That's what makes north Scottsdale dirt, Mesa soil from
the Superstition Mountains and land along the Camelback Corridor
fronting Camelback Mountain hot commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Location is important, but dirt is key to most projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a developer picks a site, the next thing they do is test
the soil,'' Lund said. ``To know what you can build and how much it
costs, you have to know what kind of dirt is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, if the dirt beneath a building site had too
much clay, was contaminated or too rocky, the contractor would just
find another site. They can't be as picky today since the Valley
doesn't have many big empty parcels.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, more than 36,000 new homes were built, at least
15 neighbhorhood shopping centers went up, more than a dozen office
buildings were developed and miles of roadways completed.
</P>
<P>
   All the construction translates to millions of cubic yards of
dirt to dig, load and move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting good dirt cheap has become so important for projects
that construction will be speeded up or slowed down depending on
when it's available,'' Markham said. &QL;

FEWER PLAYING THE GAME  
 BLACK PARTICIPATION FALLING, FROM COL LEGE TO LITTLE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When draft pick Curtis Johnson chose to play college
baseball, no one warned him about the isolation he would feel as an
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deal with when you look around and don't see any
others,'' said the University of California outfielder, who was
drafted by the Diamondbacks out of high school in 1996. ``You can't
help but look. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline of African-American participation in baseball
extends far beyond the major leagues. One need only look in Arizona
to see the problem has permeated every level:
</P>
<P>
   The baseball rosters at Arizona and Arizona State have a
combined two Black athletes out of 80 players.
</P>
<P>
   Only one athlete on South Mountain High School's baseball team
is Black despite an African-American enrollment at the school of
more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Little League programs that serve African-American communities
in metropolitan Phoenix report a steady decline in Black
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, when I took over the baseball program at South
Mountain, I thought I'd attract a lot of African-American kids,''
said Coach Derrick Gray, who is Black. ``Now, I stop kids all the
time and ask them `Why?' I hear, `It's not my sport,' or `I don't
know how to play.' How did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what many are asking 52 years after Jackson Robinson
broke Major League Baseball's color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Each level of play seems to have its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only 6.5 percent of baseball student-athletes in Division I are
Black, according to Northeastern University's Center for the Study
of Sport in Society, and less than 4 percent &QL; 
of Pac-10 players are Black.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Johnson's African-American peers in Oakland chose to
sign professional contracts right out of high school for economic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that instant gratification,'' he said. ``They see money
right now, so they go after that. And maybe their family needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I think education hasn't been emphasized enough in many
Black communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rafell Jones, the only African-American on the
University of Arizona's baseball team, said that basketball and
football are marketed to the Black communities as more glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a lot of negative thinking about baseball,''
he said. `` `The game's too slow.' `It takes too many hours of
preparation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The issue troubles ASU Coach Pat Murphy, who this season went as
far as scheduling a three-game series with Howard University, a
predominantly Black college in Washington, D.C., to help increase
awareness of African-Americans in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to reach out to an all-Black school and say,
`Look, come in, we'll pay you a great package, have a great trip
and experience and maybe we can encourage more Blacks to go to
college,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general feeling, certainly not mine, that all the
really good Black players are going to sign (out of high school)
and so maybe some schools lay off. It's a gross generalization and
an unfair one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are concerned that there soon won't be enough Black talent
available at the high school level. Gray's challenges at South
Mountain magnify the problem. If a school with one of the largest
populations of Black students in the Valley can't find
African-American players, what does that say about the state of the
sport?
</P>
<P>
   Duane Nelson, field manager for the Boys and Girls Clubs of
Metropolitan Phoenix, said many of the youth that come to his
clubs, which attract predominantly Blacks and Hispanics, have
limited, if any, experience with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of our kids, it's all new,'' he said. ``Most of them
don't own gloves, high quality baseball bats, or good equipment.
Many are more familiar with basketball and other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that baseball's relationship with children has
changed. Gone are the days when kids found the nearest sandlot and
played for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, we played every day, with one baseball until
the cover fell off, or it disintegrated or we lost it,'' said
Murphy, who is from New York. ``Everybody used the same bat, and if
it was too big, you choked up, and if it was cracked, you nailed
it. That's all we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The decreasing number of young African-Americans playing the
game reflects a recent indifference toward youth baseball overall.
Since 1995, national Little League enrollment has tapered off and
participation in 1998 was down 33,300 players from '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole syndrome of yelling parents has hurt youth
leagues,'' Murphy said. ``But I think the biggest reason (for the
decline) is that there is a lot of failure in Little League, and I
don't think parents are ready to let their kids deal with failure.
Striking out is perceived as failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other sports, like soccer, the failure (is more disguised).
But I think a lot of us have learned that failure makes us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys and Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Phoenix is
participating with the Diamondbacks in a national program called
RBI, Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, whose objective ``is to
reintroduce baseball to some good athletes that may not have the
opportunity to play baseball,'' said Craig Pletenik, the
Diamondbacks' director of community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   RBI is one of several programs the Diamondbacks are involved in
to help bring back the game to minority and underprivileged youth.
</P>
<P>
   They have run clinics throughout the Valley and are helping to
refurbish fields. They provided $8,000 worth of equipment to the
Boys and Girls Clubs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is excited about the RBI program but hopes he can find
players to commit to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a problem with getting kids to come back week after
week with our clubs because we have such a transient population,''
he said. ``They have no commitment. And the parents of a lot of our
kids don't care what their kids are doing. We can't say to them,
`Can you get Johnny to the game tonight?'
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, we're going to houses, picking up kids and
getting them out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is hopeful African-American interest in the game will
improve. He wants to field an all-Black Connie Mack team this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he has always had a dream of coaching an all-Black
baseball team and taking it to the College World Series in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's kind of a ``White Shadow'' thing, I don't know,''
he said,smiling. ``I just think it would be a way for Black players
to see there are advantages to coming to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something needs to be done.'' &QL;

FOR ANTLEY, THE WEIGHT WAS WORTH IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Chris Antley made the joke in September, and
it's a good thing he was hidden away in South Carolina when he said
it.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been at a racetrack, he would have been laughed off the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be neat,'' the jockey said to his father, with
whom he was living, ``if I rode in the Derby _ and won it.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the prospect seemed humorous indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Antley hadn't ridden in any race, let alone a Kentucky Derby, in
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been spotted at Del Mar last summer, but he wasn't in
racing silks, just searching for a solution to his weight problems,
the demons that threatened to end his career at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   Since the previous October, he'd spent most of his time in
Columbia, S.C., considering the possibility that ``racing is gone
and I might have to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   He delved into the stock market, and created an
investment-advice web site titled ``The Ant-Man Report.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was Chris Antley doing in the Churchill Downs winner's
circle late Saturday afternoon, offering thanks to trainer D. Wayne
Lukas, owners Bob and Beverly Lewis and higher powers after riding
31-1 shot Charismatic to a Derby victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``My sarcasm came true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after he returned to the races at Santa
Anita, Antley was back on top of the sport, where many thought he
belonged all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's maybe the best rider of our generation, for pure
talent,'' said Drew Mollica, one of his former agents. ``He's very
complex. When he's good, he's very, very good. When he's bad, he's
very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The good included an earlier Kentucky Derby victory, aboard
Strike the Gold in 1991, a record 64-day winning streak in New York
in '89, and a record nine-winner day at tracks in New York and New
Jersey in '87.
</P>
<P>
   The bad included the suspensions that followed positive drug
tests in '88.
</P>
<P>
   Antley insists the problems that kept him out for all of '98 had
nothing to do with substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   An even decade after drug-plagued Pat Valenzuela rode Sunday
Silence to a Derby victory and declared ``Just Say No'' in a
post-race press conference, there would be no similar testimonial
from Antley.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, was all about weight, devil enough in a sport
where athletic young men are asked to weigh less than 115 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem overwhelmed him when he left Del Mar in '97 to ride
at Saratoga. He found the scale reading 119. One day, when he went
to Canada for a major race, he was forced to sweat away nine pounds
in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Diet pills left him too weak to ride. Fad diets didn't work.
Blood tests in Europe provided no answer.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to California shortly before the '97 Breeders'
Cup at Hollywood Park, Antley stopped riding and went home.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, he roomed with his father, Les, who pumps
propane for a living.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage, Antley was up to 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my dad I was going to come back or die trying,'' he
said. ``I'm going to run and run and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Thanksgiving, ``I broke down,'' he said. A knee grew so
sore he couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   But after Christmas he was back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He set his sights on beating a rival, Mike Smith, back to the
races. If Smith could do it, recuperating from a broken back, why
couldn't Antley, recovering from a broken diet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the name `Forrest Gump' in South Carolina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my career _ in my
life,'' he said of returning to Derby caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first (Derby win) was right time, right place. This has a
lot more sentimental value probably than anything I've done in my
career. I didn't think I was going to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he became ``a big boy'' in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had things handed to me and always been able to come back
quick or get through hard times,'' he said. ``This was (different).
I couldn't just come back nonchalant. I had to work to get back
here. I had to reach into the depths of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley returned to competition Feb. 4 at Santa Anita and has
done well since _ even during the weeks when he'd weigh out at a
plump 121 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a break to wind up in the Derby. Hall of Famer Laffit
Pincay Jr. reportedly turned down the mount on Charismatic, whom
he'd ridden at Santa Anita, and Lukas and the Lewises turned to
Antley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had won the Derby,'' Bob Lewis said. ``He'd had experience
in big fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Antley got lucky Saturday, avoiding the traffic that
claimed several contenders, even though he started from the outside
in post 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of this sport,'' said Shane Sellers, who
rode Vicar to a troubled 18th-place finish. ``Here's a guy who was
out a year and a half, and he's back (eight) weeks and riding the
Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sorry to see him on the sidelines. He's just a great
rider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show you're never down and out in this
business,'' Mollica said on the phone from New York Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As he rode Charismatic through the homestretch, an eighth of a
mile from winning the Derby, Antley says he uttered a silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking if this was real or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It !ital!was!off! real.
</P>

IT'S NEARLY CRASH `N' DASH

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It was Roller Derby. It was Demolition Derby.
Or make up your own comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys said Saturday's Kentucky Derby was the roughest they can
recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my worst trip ever in horse racing,'' said Gary
Stevens, who rode Santa Anita Derby winner General Challenge to an
11th-place finish Saturday after they were squeezed back and nearly
fell in the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' said Shane Sellers, who rode Vicar to 18th
in the field of 19 after they were forced six-wide in the first
turn.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Sellers said, was that in the absence of confirmed
front-runners and dead closers, most horses had the same mid-pack
running style. There wasn't room for all of them side-by-side in
the clubhouse turn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the pace was slow, so horses ran up on rivals' heels.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Racing Form chart noted significant trouble for a
dozen horses. They didn't include winner Charismatic or third-place
Cat Thief. They did include runner-up Menifee, forced to wait for a
path in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said General Challenge's opponents ``picked me up and
carried me about four strides. I don't know how I didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the worst trip went to the Florida filly Three Ring, who
was bumped for most of the first quarter-mile and had her saddle
slip. She finished last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, riding on her head,'' jockey John Velasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Kentucky Derby purse was a record
$1,186,200. Charismatic's connections pocketed a record
$886,200.... The Churchill Downs attendance, 151,051, has been
exceeded only by the 163,628 who watched the centennial Derby in
1974.... Charismatic is the second straight Derby winner _
following Real Quiet _ who failed to meet the Dosage standard.
Dosage is a statistical measure of the stamina in a thoroughbred's
pedigree.... D. Wayne Lukas' fourth victory (from 35 starters) tied
Dick Thompson for second among Derby trainers. Ben Jones holds the
record with six. Lukas also won with Winning Colors ('88), Thunder
Gulch ('95) and Grindstone ('96).... Elliott Walden trained the
runner-up for the second straight Derby _ Menifee, a year after
Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Next: Trainer Bob Baffert, denied a record third straight Derby
victory, said Prime Timber (fourth) will go on to the May 15
Preakness Stakes in Baltimore and Kentucky Oaks-winning filly
Silverbulletday might join him.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and Excellent Meeting (fifth) will go back to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Consolation: Godolphin Racing's Island Sands won the 2000
Guineas, one of the English classics, at Newmarket earlier
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, it wasn't the day of Godolphin, the
Dubai sheikhs' stable. Worldly Manner finished seventh in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back next year,'' Worldly Manner trainer Saeed bin
Suroor said.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: In the Early Times Turf Classic, the other major
race on the Derby program, California's Hawksley Hill came up just
short again, charging late under Kent Desormeaux to finish third in
a photo finish with winner Wild Event and Garbu.

   METAIRIE, La. _ Former Gov. David Treen and state Rep. David
Vitter finished atop the nine-person field vying to succeed Bob
Livingston as the congressman from Louisiana's 1st District
Saturday night, and advanced to a runoff scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Republicans, ensuring that the party will maintain its
11-seat majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and a self-described
advocate for the civil rights of white people, finished in third
place and close enough to the two leaders to make the night an
anxious one for Republican leaders in both Louisiana and
Washington. Establishment Republicans feared that if Duke won the
race, or even made the runoff, Democrats would attempt to make him
a national Republican symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Duke had moved into second place with just under half of the
precincts reporting, and he lingered close to Treen and Vitter well
into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we were sweating bullets,'' said Ken Johnson, an
aide to Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the Republican dean of
Louisiana's congressional delegation and an outspoken critic of
Duke. ``Having David Duke in the runoff would have been a nightmare
come true for Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Treen had 25 percent
of the vote in Saturday's special election, followed by Vitter with
22 percent and Duke with 19 percent. Monica L. Monica, an
opthamologist with a timely name, finished a disappointing fourth
with 16 percent of the vote despite vastly outspending her
opponents. Dr. Monica spent at least $1 million of her own money on
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana has an unusual open primary system that allows
Republicans and Democrats to run against each other in a first
primary. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two finishers
move on to a runoff, regardless of their party.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a Republican who had represented the district for 21
years, announced his resignation late last year when Hustler
magazine threatened to expose his extramarital affairs. He had been
slated to become speaker of the House, succeeding Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st District, which begins in the northern New Orleans
suburbs and stretches across the 24-mile bridge over Lake
Ponchartrain to the Mississippi border, is considered the most
conservative and the most reliably Republican district in the
state. Eighty-five percent of the registered voters in the district
are white, and many of them have fled what they consider to be high
crime rates and unacceptable schools in the majority black city of
New Orleans. President Clinton lost badly here in both 1992 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff will pit one of this state's Republican warhorses
against one of its youngest Turks. Treen, 70, was the first
Republican since Reconstruction to represent this state in Congress
and then also became the first to serve as governor. Vitter, a
37-year-old lawyer, Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar, has served
for eight years in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Treen enjoys the support of Livingston, Tauzin, and Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. He maintains that he
still has relationships with leading congressional Republicans that
will help the district compensate for the loss of Livingston's
seniority and influence. But Vitter counters that Treen's age may
limit his ability to accumulate power in the House and suggests
that the district would be better served by a younger
representative.

NATIONWIDE CRACKDOWN PUTS PRESSURE ON SEX OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Brad Farabough sends a birthday card to a niece or nephew,
he's a step closer to going back to jail.
</P>
<P>
   If he opens the door to neighborhood kids, he could be back
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   As a registered sex offender, he isn't allowed the remotest
contact with children.
</P>
<P>
   Farabough, who pleaded no contest to felony charges, must follow
a long list of rules. He keeps the sheriff informed of his latest
address. When he moved into an apartment in Mesa, the police passed
around fliers to alert the neighborhood. He's on intense probation
for life, and next year, his name and photo will be on a new state
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Farabough is feeling the full weight of a national push to keep
closer tabs on at least 200,000 registered sex offenders who are
out in the community. The aim isn't punishment _ they've already
served their sentences _ but to prevent them from striking again.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the pressure is a shocking crime: In New Jersey,
7-year-old Megan Kanka was raped and strangled in 1994 by a
convicted sex offender living across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress has lighted a fire under states to adopt minimum
standards for monitoring sex offenders, with the threat of losing
some federal funding if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, sex offenders are in the spotlight. Alarmed
neighbors worry about letting their children play outside. In
Maricopa County, surveillance officers are shadowing 700 men and
women offenders for life.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether all this time, effort and money will pay
off. There's little consistency among states monitoring sex
offenders and scant data yet to show whether the public will be
safer. A few programs, such as Maricopa County's intense lifetime
probation, show promising results.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that it will take more and more dollars and
people to keep these systems running. Consider Maricopa County,
where the number of sex offenders on probation is rising 11 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another certainty is the depth of pain that victims suffer,
especially children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a sex offender abuses a child, he murders that child, he
takes away her childhood,'' said Karie Farrally, who volunteers at
the Center Against Sexual Abuse in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Farrally speaks from her own harrowing experience. She was
abused for years as a teenager by a man who was never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the most elaborate system of monitoring
registered sex offenders falls short.
</P>
<P>
   While society is keeping an eye on the known predators, a huge
number of criminals haven't yet come into the sights of
prosecutors. More than three-quarters of state prison inmates
serving time for rape or sexual assault in 1994 had no previous
convictions for sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The files at the Phoenix Police Department give a vivid picture
of the challenge ahead for local governments. The city has 4,000
registered sex offenders. Their records fill nine tall file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the papers were in something of a jumble, a low
priority in a busy urban police department. But a series of federal
laws is forcing sex offenders to the top of the to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   States risk losing 10 percent of their federal anti-crime
funding if they don't set up systems for registering sex offenders,
regularly verify the addresses of registered offenders, and warn
the community of sexual predators in its midst. The deadline for
complying is September.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Farabough knows the system from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he pleaded no contest to charges of attempted
molestation involving minors. Farabough, 37, maintains he's
innocent but couldn't afford an adequate defense.
</P>
<P>
   People don't know what they're facing when they make a plea
agreement on a sex charge, he says, and ``I had no idea what it
entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst possibility: getting out of prison and suddenly being
assessed as a sexually violent predator, to be confined in the
state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It's a controversial strategy used by some states to keep the
most dangerous offenders off the street.
</P>
<P>
   And it's just what happened to Farabough, who was detained in
the hospital for eight months before the state found ``no
reasonable cause'' for commitment and released him in July. He then
faced Arizona's multipronged strategy for keeping watch on sex
offenders after they finish their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The state took a DNA sample to compare with blood or semen found
at future crimes. Next Farabough had to register under one of the
broadest laws in the country. Arizona requires lifetime
registration for virtually every sex-related crime except
first-time indecent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, on the other hand, limit registration to 10 years
for all but the most violent sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Does Arizona cast the net too wide?
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein supports
lifetime registration, but worries about cases like the two teenage
boys who were goofing around in a store, exposing themselves to
each other. A young boy saw them, a guard was called and the teens
were arrested for indecent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   With that one incident, ``they were looking at lifetime
registration,'' Reinstein said. They got off only after the court
ordered an assessment of whether they were really risks to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has one of the nation's oldest registration laws, dating
to 1951. Sex offenders must tell the sheriff where they're living,
but until recently, there was little effort to verify addresses.
After a Mesa girl vanished in January, police in neighboring
Chandler hurried to check on their registered sex offenders _ and
discovered 40 percent of the addresses were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Arizona Department of Public Safety finally
began sifting through the state's nearly 10,000 registered
offenders. It's expected to take a year to check just those
registered since June 1, 1996, who are subject to tougher laws.
</P>
<P>
   And it's easy to lose track of sex offenders if they move or
travel to another state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Tyson's a perfect example,'' said Barbara Broderick,
director of adult services at the state Administrative Office of
the Court. The boxer, a registered sex offender for a hotel-room
rape in Indianapolis in 1991, came to Phoenix on a travel permit
but failed to register when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona authorities picked up on it only because it's a
high-profile case and Tyson was training just down the block.
</P>
<P>
   At his apartment complex in Mesa, Farabough has kept a low
profile. ``I've lived here since December and never spoke a word to
anybody,'' he said. ``I fear the way they're going to perceive
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew the police would soon do a sex-offender notification _
warning schools, putting a bulletin on the community-TV channel and
plastering the area with fliers giving his name, photo, address.
</P>
<P>
   It all stems from ``Megan's Law,'' adopted in various versions
by Congress and many states, which requires authorities to alert
the public to registered sex offenders. The law is named for Megan
Kanka, whose gruesome murder was committed by a twice-convicted
molester. Neighbors knew nothing of his criminal background _ nor
of two sex offenders who were his roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to know who's threatening their kids in
their neighborhoods,'' said Marc Klaas, who began speaking out
after his 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was abducted at knifepoint
from their California home.
</P>
<P>
   As with registration, states take widely differing approaches.
In Washington, which had the country's first community-notification
law, police typically hold forums and distribute fliers.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are states like West Virginia,
which notifies only a few government agencies and youth groups that
sign a non-disclosure agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is among a dozen states that try to avoid a
one-size-fits-all approach by rating offenders _ from 1 to 3 _ on
how likely they are to repeat their crimes. Notification is
required for Level 3, the most risky, and optional for Level 2.
</P>
<P>
   But each city and county typically does its own evaluation, with
inconsistent results.
</P>
<P>
   One man who had molested his daughter was rated a low-risk Level
1 by the state when released from prison. But when he moved to
Gilbert, police considered him a Level 2 and prepared to hand out
warning fliers. The panicked landlord canceled the offender's lease
and offered him $1,000 to move out. The man ended up in Phoenix,
which ranked him Level 1.
</P>
<P>
   There's no appeal in Arizona, although at least 11 other states
allow offenders to contest being subject to community notification.
</P>
<P>
   Reinstein fears that the inconsistency and lack of an appeals
process could be grounds for challenging Arizona's notification
system as unconstitutional. ``You have the danger of losing the law
altogether,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Chandler Detective Velma Anderjeski, that would mean losing
a powerful crime-fighting tool. When neighbors are alerted to sex
offenders, she said, ``they become an extra set of eyes for us, and
it's been very beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizens tipped her off that a convicted sex offender had
slipped back into Chandler after being deported and was hanging
around an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   But as someone who has been through notification, Farabough says
it ``puts more of a panic and hyperawareness in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, harassment isn't common. It's occurred in fewer
than 4 percent of notifications in Washington state. Most were
minor, although in one case, the house where an offender planned to
live was burned down.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics also show that sex offenders aren't any less
likely to repeat their crimes just because their neighbors are on
the alert. A Washington study found that recidivism was the same
for offenders who were subject to notification and those who
weren't _ although the former were caught sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Notification leads to ``a false sense of security,'' said
Eleanor Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   And she argues that it adds one more barrier to turning
offenders into productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of notification can actually make sex offenders try
to hide their whereabouts, a reaction known as ``Megan's flight.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Phoenix police geared up to distribute fliers on one
sex offender, and he moved the night before. It's happened more
than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them: Every time you move, we have to re-flier you,''
said Sgt. Gail Kavanagh, head of sex-crimes notification for
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The community may hope offenders will move out; the police hope
they stay put.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is high-tech: The Internet. In January, Arizona
will join 15 other states with Web sites listing sex offenders.
Chandler, Tempe, Tucson and Yuma already have their own electronic
lists, and Phoenix is considering one.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County is trying a lifetime leash for sex offenders _
putting them on permanent probation with strict rules, surprise
visits by a surveillance officer, therapy and periodic lie-detector
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Scott, supervisor of adult probation, points to the
numbers: Since 1993, fewer than 2 percent of those under Maricopa
County's intense supervision have committed another sex offense.
</P>
<P>
   The program, chosen as a national model for the U.S. Justice
Department project, gives the probation department veto power over
almost every part of an offender's life: from roommates to
recreation. An offender may be forbidden to drink alcohol, own a
computer or be around children.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be able to cure sex offenders, Scott said, but you
can help them manage their lives so they're less likely to molest
or rape again.
</P>
<P>
   The rules go too far, argued Farabough, a trim man with blue
eyes and a handlebar mustache. As he settled onto the sofa in his
apartment, furnished with dream catchers and other Southwestern
touches, there was a soft knock at the front door. Farabough peeked
out the curtain and shook his head. ``I'm not allowed to answer the
door because it's a kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The knocking got louder and louder, an insistent drill that went
on and on, but Farabough ignored it. He can't have any contact with
minors, even sending cards to nephews and nieces across the
country, a restriction he calls ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Probation supervisor Scott says it's too risky to allow any
communication until a sex offender has gone through treatment. ``We
need to know that he's not being manipulative or `grooming' these
children in any way,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Lie-detector tests are used to check whether sex offenders are
following all the rules. Professionals say they're the only way to
cut through evasions and falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   But Farabough says therapists are trying to force him to admit
guilt in a case in which he pleaded otherwise _ and if the
polygraphs support him, they say he's in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, in an odd twist, Arizona's most dangerous
offenders have been the least likely to be under such intense
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Violent sex offenders who served their full sentences would come
out of prison with no strings attached to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors now try to convict them on at least two counts, with
sentences that combine prison and lifetime probation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their effectiveness, all these strategies for
monitoring sex offenders carry a cost that's likely to keep rising.
Arizona has six people working full time to verify the addresses of
registered sex offenders. Once they get through the list, it will
be time to start checking again.
</P>
<P>
   And the list keeps growing. Arizona has 800 more registered sex
offenders every year, and with lifetime registration, few names
drop off.
</P>
<P>
   Val Biebrich, who coordinates registration, predicts the job
will get easier, because ``as time goes on, people are going to
keep current.'' And sex offenders are required to get special
one-year driver's licenses, so the state can cross-check addresses
with the Motor Vehicle Division.
</P>
<P>
   There's a stick, too: Failure to register is a felony in
Arizona, with mandatory prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Biebrich realizes that ``staffing needs will grow
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story in Phoenix. The city now has six detectives
whose sole job is to keep track of offenders and do notifications.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kavanagh, who supervises them, predicts, ``We're going to
have to grow dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller jurisdictions are feeling the pinch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale is proposing a position devoted to registration and
notification instead of a system spreading the work among officers
busy with other duties.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County's intense monitoring program, on the other hand,
gets much of its budget from the sex offenders themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, they pay the standard monthly probation fee of $40,
plus $25 a week for group therapy and $180 apiece for lie-detector
tests, required once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to taxpayers is $3.81 a day per offender. That's a
bargain, supporters say, if it heads off the cost of sending
someone to prison for $50.25 a day. But the overall caseload is
rising _ up 11 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County just added two officers to sex-offender
probation, bringing the total to 29, with another hire planned.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a lot of dollars, but Biebrich argues, ``If it
prevents one additional child from being molested or one additional
person from being sexually assaulted, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a taxpayer and a registered sex offender, Farabough says
there are better ways to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want these people to have treatment so bad, why don't
they offer it in prison?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona prisons, only 50 to 75 sex offenders a year have been
getting treatment _ although officials say there hasn't been a
waiting list, either.
</P>
<P>
   The state is trying a new four-phase program, beginning with
mandatory orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But Pamela McCauley, mental-health manager for the Department of
Corrections, said, ``There is not a lot of motivation for most sex
offenders to participate in treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is one place that has moved more aggressively, with
special units for treating sex offenders in prison and intensive
treatment programs once they're released.
</P>
<P>
   The track record of treating sex offenders is mixed, but
research on offenders in the Vermont program showed lower
recidivism rates than those with other programs or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   While the community is devoting so much money and energy to
watching known criminals, many sex offenders had no criminal
history at the time of their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Karie Farrally was molested by someone close to the family for
five years, beginning in seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Her abuser was never arrested or prosecuted, and she didn't have
the strength to confront him until she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   She persuaded him to come to a therapy session, where she said
he admitted his actions. Far from the tearful confessions of
television tell-all shows, she said, ``it was a very chilling
experience to have him sit there and be so calm, cool and collected
with all these rationalizations, no remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix consultant with her own business, Farrally decided to
speak publicly about her experiences for the first time to help
push for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Registration, community notification, intensive therapy and
stringent restrictions all make sense to her for convicted
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their life should not be easy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wouldn't have spared her.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent more victims, she said, is education.
</P>
<P>
   More than the ``stranger danger'' that parents and schools are
used to teaching, children should be told what type of behavior is
inappropriate, assured that it's not their fault and urged not to
keep secrets but to tell a trusted adult.
</P>
<P>
   Farrally was paralyzed by shame, guilt, the threats of her
abuser and the fear that she would be blamed rather than believed.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teachers and youth-group leaders can be trained to
recognize the techniques of sex offenders: an adult befriending a
child, making him or her ``special,'' separating the child from
other children, developing an exclusive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   An alert adult might have picked up on her own behavior as a
girl. ``I stuttered when this person was around,'' Farrally said.
``I had hellacious nightmares and chronic stomachaches.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best way to protect children from sex offenders is one
she can just dream of: ``Send them to Jupiter and leave them
there.'' &QL;

YANKS COAST AS CONE IS NEARLY PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hitting against David Cone these days is like
trying to guess the winner in a 19-horse field. Opposing batters
don't know if he is going to take them inside, if he is going
outside, if he will stalk them with his slider late in the count or
go to the whip with a high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing his different pitches for strikes, Saturday night Cone
allowed just two hits over seven scoreless innings against the
Kansas City Royals, and the New York Yankees went on to win, 8-4,
with Chuck Knoblauch getting three hits and improving his batting
average to .381.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (4-0) struck out seven and walked three, and in 33 innings
this season he has allowed just 11 hits; opponents are batting just
.101 against him, easily the best in the big leagues. His earned
run average is a league-leading 0.82. ``I don't think he can pitch
any better than he has in this stretch,'' said Don Zimmer, the
Yankees' interim manager. ``He's just in a tremendous streak right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, the Yankees' catcher, said: ``It would be hard to
improve on what he's doing, other than to throw no-hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone's performance Saturday night was unique in that his style
was ill-suited to the strike zone being called by the home plate
umpire, Rick Reed. Cone often picks at the fringes of the strike
zone, like a kid who only likes frosting, and if the home plate
umpire is calling strikes on pitches just off the edges, then Cone
is so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed called the rule book strike zone: If Cone threw the
ball an eighth of an inch off the edge, Reed called a ball. If Cone
grazed the strike zone just a bit inside, or low, or high, Reed
called a ball. Cone received no special consideration for his
control, for his veteran status and sometimes he did a double-take
or snapped at the return throw from the catcher Joe Girardi after
Reed didn't give him a certain pitch.
</P>
<P>
   So Cone earned everything he got, with perhaps his best outing
since sometime last summer; he cannot remember throwing this well
since 1988, the year he went 20-3 for the Mets. ``I really like my
style,'' Cone said. ``I like the way I pitch now, even more than
when I was more of a power pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1998, when Cone closed on 20 victories, he would have
days when he would have to win with only his breaking stuff, or
only his fastball, and a bit of good fortune. Right now, Cone is
throwing four pitches effectively _ a fastball that he is zipping
past hitters high in the strike zone, his slider, his
split-fingered fastball and a slow curveball Cone has refined this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   He is throwing them all for strikes, with different speeds and
from different angles, making it difficult for hitters to look for
a specific pitch to hit in a specific situation. On four of Kansas
City's seven strikeouts, the Royals' hitters were caught looking, a
strong indication they were fooled completely. Carlos Febles stared
at a strike-three slider in the second inning and another in the
seventh, Joe Randa watched a fastball dissect the outside corner in
the third and a curveball mesmerized Larry Sutton in the fourth.
Cone loves to use his curveball against left-handed hitters,
starting it outside the zone and then bending it back in. It is so
different than anything else he throws that hitters almost always
take it, rather than swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Royals did hit the ball, their swings were so
ill-timed _ again, Cone changed speeds exceptionally _ that the
contact was imperfect. The Royals didn't have a hit until the
fourth inning, when Mike Sweeney lined a double to left-center.
``Sweeney was the only guy to hit a ball hard off him the whole
night,'' said Johnny Damon, the Kansas City left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only runs the Royals scored came in the eighth, when
Larry Sutton hit a grand slam off Tony Fossas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cone was in trouble only one time the whole night, with the
Yankees leading by 5-0 in the fifth. He walked Febles leading off,
twice staring at Reed about pitches Cone thought were strikes,
before Rey Sanchez dumped a single into center. Two on, nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Chewing his gum ferociously until pausing to look in for the
sign, Cone attacked the next hitter, Carlos Beltran, with
split-fingered fastballs, getting ahead in the count and then
striking him out with a fastball. Cone then made one of his few
mistakes, hanging a splitter, and Joe Randa lifted a drive deep to
left field. It looked as if the ball might drift into the stands
for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricky Ledee, the Yankees' left fielder, caught the ball so
close to the wall that the stadium lights projected his shadow
against the fence, and after Johnny Damon rolled out weakly to
first to end the inning, the Yankees' first baseman Tino Martinez
ran past Cone on his way to the dugout and tapped the pitcher on
the side. Nice going. The Royals were 0-for-9 with runners in
scoring position; opposing batters are 2-for-29 (.069) with runners
in scoring position against Cone this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cone assumes nothing about the weeks and months to come. He has
broken down before, ``and there is a long way to go,'' he said. But
Girardi shook his head slightly in amazement at what Cone is
accomplishing. ``I think he's getting wiser with age,'' said
Girardi. ``And he'll get better as long as he keeps getting older,
I guess.''

SEX OFFENDERS FACE AROUND-THE-CLOCK INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Sitnek thunders his fist on the door of the local sex
offender. The well-practiced knock is calibrated to overpower the
loudest TV or stereo. The surveillance officer will do it a dozen
times tonight as he makes the rounds checking up on registered sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   He pops into people's lives unpredictably with a simple goal:
``The feeling that someone's watching might make them hesitate if
they were thinking of re-offending.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek opens closets, looks at mail, scours videotape
collections for pornography, conducts searches without needing a
warrant. He may tail an offender for a few hours or drop by a house
at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Close surveillance is a key part of Maricopa County's intensive
probation program for sex offenders. It includes strict rules,
group therapy and periodic lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   As the country struggles to find the best way to protect the
public from rape, molestation and other sex offenses, this is
viewed by many as a model.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Sex Offender Management, a national project
supported by the U.S. Justice Department, chose Maricopa County as
one of 11 sites with the most promising and innovative programs for
dealing with sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifetime supervision is one of the best things we can do,''
said Lori Scott, supervisor of adult probation.
</P>
<P>
   The county has supervised 1,845 sex offenders since 1983. Many
have violated their probation or committed other kinds of crimes _
263 had their probation revoked and were put behind bars _ but only
1.6 percent have committed new sex offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek's knocking finally gets an answer from a squat
middle-aged man who flings the door open, flicks his cigarette to
the ground and motions Sitnek into a tiny unit in a
down-at-the-heels apartment complex in central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek chats and scans the room, glancing at magazines, videos,
books for any sign of kiddie porn _ the type of material that got
this man into trouble. He downloaded child pornography from the
Internet and sold it to an undercover officer at a swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   Casually dressed, with an engaging smile and blond hair pulled
back in a short ponytail, Sitnek looks a lot like a refugee surfer.
When he showed up at one sex offender's door for the first time,
the startled man insisted on seeing his badge.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek is one of 10 surveillance officers and 19 probation
officers who oversee the 1,007 sex offenders on intensive probation
in Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent are on lifetime probation.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Sitnek is making the rounds in central Phoenix and
Tempe. His next visit is to a thin, grizzled man in his 60s, socks
pulled up to protect the sores on his legs. Last year, the man
finished 10 years in prison for molesting his daughter and
stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to see his grandson, he complains. But he's not
allowed any contact with his family. It's a common restriction.
Nearly two-thirds of the county's sex offenders have committed
crimes, often incest, against children.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new resident in the crowded trailer: a brown and white
puppy. Scratching behind its floppy ears, Sitnek wonders what breed
it is. A pit bullterrier mix. Sitnek nods doubtfully. He could
forbid a sex offender to keep a dog if he thought it might lure
children.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona affiliate
of the American Civil Liberties Union, questions making all sex
offenders follow such strict rules, especially when they accept
lifetime probation as part of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people always understand and are psychologically
prepared to have their lives so controlled and to give up so many
of the basic human decision-making powers that we value so much,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek makes a quick stop at a tiny trailer parked behind a
hamburger joint, where he touches base with a round, balding man
who has progressed to ``maintenance'' probation, with less
intensive therapy and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Checking up on sex offenders means dropping by million-dollar
homes, the homeless shelter and everywhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek moves on to an upscale adult mobile home community, with
a tidy, well-landscaped patch in front of each residence.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, 70-year-old man with curly steel-gray hair, wearing only
Bermuda shorts, answers the door.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Sitnek, he ducks back inside, anticipating the order,
``Put a shirt on.'' Being completely dressed is part of the drill.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested for molesting three children. How many kids did
he actually abuse over the years? The man answers 13. Later, when
he's out of earshot, Sitnek scoffs, ``It has to be at least three
times that number.''
</P>
<P>
   The man gestures to a tape recorder on the coffee table next to
the couch. He bought it as a shortcut for all the writing the
therapist makes him do. He doesn't like the way the therapist is
insisting that he write about molesting incidents again and again,
so he doesn't leave out any detail about how he groomed victims,
preyed on their friendliness and abused them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like wallowing in a cesspool,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Therapy is a crucial prong of Maricopa's sex-offender probation
program.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix psychologist Tom Selby, a contractor to treat
probationers, says the focus is less on cure and more on
management: recognizing the triggers for deviant behavior and
learning to handle them in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As a reality check, there are lie-detector tests every six to 12
months. Offenders may have to undergo testing with a
plethysmograph, a device attached to the penis, to gauge whether
they're aroused by inappropriate images or suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether the probation department goes overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Leone Hamm, director of an inmate advocacy group called
Middle Ground Prison Reform, argues for closer scrutiny of how well
treatment is working and whether it should be continued.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the probation requirements can become a gravy train
for therapists and polygraphers. ``You're guaranteeing them
success,'' she says, ``because if the guy drops out of the program,
he'll go to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial point is that probationers must waive the
usual patient-doctor confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   To the probation department's Scott, it's critical to have ``a
very structured program with no secrets'' to keep tabs on what
stresses offenders are experiencing and how well they're moving
through the steps of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the therapy is typically coming clean about past sex
offenses. If the information is shared with authorities, it could
lead to future prosecution or to commitment in the Arizona State
Hospital as a sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   Law Professor Michael Gordon, currently at Arizona State
University, contends that the government should offer some sort of
immunity if the therapy sessions aren't confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek heads into a neighborhood of modest ranch houses, where a
shy, unassuming man in his mid-30s ushers Sitnek into the living
room. ``You like the picture?'' he asks, gesturing to a large
framed photo from his wedding a year ago. Hearing voices, his wife
comes out and plops onto the couch beside him.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could get married, she had to go through the partner
program, a series of counseling sessions. Her husband molested his
10-year-old stepdaughter and spent a year behind bars before going
on probation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will have to think carefully about having children.
Depending on a sex offender's restrictions, the probation
department can make the father move out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Female offenders, who make up barely 1 percent of Maricopa
County's caseload, may lose custody if they give birth. One woman,
arrested for molesting the boys she was baby-sitting, has had two
babies since going on probation. Both were placed with relatives.
She's not allowed to see them.
</P>
<P>
   The public's picture of a child molester is a dirty old man
lurking in the shadows ready to grab a child.
</P>
<P>
   But in Maricopa County's program, only 12 percent of the sex
offenders preyed on strangers, while 51 percent molested family
members and 37 percent victimized acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   The next apartment is a shrine to Elvis. There are pictures of
The King, magnets, a calendar, framed records, even an Elvis clock.
``I'm an Elvis impersonator,'' the 25-year-old sex offender
confides. Short and rotund, he doesn't look at all like his idol,
but he breaks into a passable imitation of Elvis' tremulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   He's ``low functioning.'' The probation department has had to
set up special slow-learner therapy classes for people like him.
</P>
<P>
   Secondhand smoke is a hazard of the job for Sitnek, and it hangs
heavy at his next stop. The 22-year-old sex offender shows off his
new haircut: shaved around the lower edges, long and dyed red on
top.
</P>
<P>
   He served six months in jail for molesting a girl _ in an odd
twist, the victim was the daughter of another sex offender in
Sitnek's crew. He's taking Lithium to deal with a bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a job is a problem, he complains. (``That haircut
couldn't help,'' Sitnek comments later.) But he needs the money to
pay for therapy and testing.
</P>
<P>
   Offenders must foot part of the probation bill whenever
possible, which helps hold the cost of the county's program to
$3.81 per person per day. A similar program in Pima County runs
$9.85 because it has fewer offenders per officer.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County officials would like to lower the ratios of
offenders to officers, especially for surveillance. Many other
Arizona counties lack the resources for any special probation
program for sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Supreme Court has been lobbying the state
Legislature for several years to put more money into managing sex
offenders. Lawmakers haven't anted up, but this year they did give
the court some flexibility to move existing funding into such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek makes his last visit at a tumbledown trailer court. He
opens a rickety wood gate, fends off a pair of large dogs and
ambles over to a decrepit Volkswagen, almost vibrating from the
radio turned full-blast inside.
</P>
<P>
   A boyish girl with short hair climbs out of the car as her
boyfriend, a registered sex offender, steps out of a ramshackle
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene rap talk booms from the VW. Sitnek asks her to turn the
music down; it will disturb the neighbors. Their lights are on, she
points out. Yes, he answers, but they have two little kids who are
probably in bed and could hear the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dilemma for probation: The kind of cheap housing that
will accept sex offenders is likely to attract financially strapped
families and single mothers whose children may not get much
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   This offender got a 13-year-old drunk and had sex with her. His
girlfriend may be wild _ Sitnek recently confiscated a knife with
brass knuckles from her _ but the offender has been following all
the terms of his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitnek pokes around outside for a while and calls it a night.
</P>
<P>
   He's done his part to keep some sex offenders on the straight
and narrow. ``If there are a few kids who don't get molested,'' he
says, ``we've done something right.'' &QL;

KHABIBULIN NEARS PAY DIRT  
 1 MORE WIN WOULD ELEVATE CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - It's a win-win situation that Nikolai Khabibulin
faces.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old bromide in hockey that the greatness of a goalie
is not decided by regular-season performance, but by how far he can
carry his team in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Khabibulin can win today's Game 6 of the Coyotes' Western
Conference quarterfinal series against St. Louis, he will have
carried his mates into the second round for the first time in his
career after a season in which he statistically finished among the
NHL's top five goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niki is our man,'' Coyotes left wing Keith Tkachuk said. ``He
wins games for us. He might be underrated by some around the
league, but that's fine. All he does is stop goals and win. That's
good enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gaining the recognition is fine, but there's an even bigger
 &UR; plus: financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   If Khabibulin, a restricted Group II free agent at season's end,
closes out the Blues today or, failing that, on Tuesday at home if
a seventh game is necessary, he figures to become a much wealthier
man next season.
</P>
<P>
   His Group II status means other NHL teams can tender an offer
and the Coyotes can either match it, or, if not, receive
compensation in the form of first-round draft picks according to
his salary status. In his case, probably three choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Khabibulin, who's earning $1.7 million this season, is only
26 and a proven, battle-tested product playing a position that
takes years to develop. A top-five NHL goalie earns in the $3
million-$5 million range in today's market. He will receive offers.
He's also a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it yet,'' Coyotes General Manager
Bobby Smith said. ``I don't think (during the playoffs) is the
proper time to even discuss it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Smith, a stubborn negotiator, anticipate having problems
re-signing Khabibulin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll have our differences, but it will get done,''
he said, confidently.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Khabibulin agrees with the boss and prefers to
focus his thoughts on beating the Blues and advancing far into the
playoffs to worrying about contract issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it at all,'' he said. ``I haven't even
talked about it with my agent. It's not the time to talk about it.
I haven't forgotten it, but I don't really care. There's only so
much time left in the season and I've waited seven months. I can
wait another couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting salary issues aside, he entered this playoff series with
a career postseason record of 7-9 and a 2.91 goals-against average.
He's 3-2 with a 2.30 GAA in this series and, if one conducted a
poll of his teammates they would likely name him the team's most
valuable player in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he will tell you differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have probably played better in this series,'' he said
before Friday's 2-1 overtime loss. ``There's no particular area,
just better overall. If I would have played better, we probably
would have finished playing this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, to make a name for oneself in the NHL, one must close the
deal and advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to think of those things,'' Khabibulin said.
``I don't want to put any more pressure on myself . . . I don't
need that. So I don't think about what people are going to think
about me if we lose. I just go out there and try to do what I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   What strange logic there is in hockey. This man basically owns
every franchise goaltending record. He had a 32-win season, eight
shutouts, shattered his own franchise goals-against record (2.74)
at 2.13 this season, and it means little if he doesn't win in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the NHL is measured on playoff performance,''
Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``Teams are, franchises are,
individual players and goaltenders are; it's the same for everyone.
You become a household name by being on one of the two teams left
playing for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who likes hockey is focused on that series, whether
they're from the cities involved or not. There are a lot of
variables to consider. Nik's performance has been tremendous in
this series and we're still in the mix. But you don't evaluate
anyone until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   In leading Phoenix to back-to-back wins in St. Louis last week,
he was forced to stop 17 third-period shots in Game 3 for a 5-4 win
(all four Blues' goals came with a man advantage), then backed it
up with a 27-save effort in 2-1 win in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the chance to seal the deal with a win Friday, he
played brilliantly and stopped 40 of 42 shots, allowing only an Al
MacInnis' power-play goal until Scott Young's shot in overtime left
him frustrated and the Coyotes with a 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nik played it well,'' Schoenfeld said of Young's game-winner.
``He was well out of the net. He has his angle, but it was a
perfect shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly frustrating, eh Nikolai?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose,'' he said in his normal
stoic manner. ``I tried hard but we didn't win. There's nothing we
can do about it right now. We just have to win today. I played
pretty good and I'm confident. I'll try to do the same thing
today.''
</P>
<P>
   With a better result. &QL;

ANTLEY'S EXILE ENDS IN GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, KY. - He searched for the words. When he felt them,
lodged in his throat, he smiled. His pale blue eyes welled with
tears.
</P>
<P>
   How could he say this?
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to oblige those who stood around him, looking down at
him, asking how he felt. He wanted to shout it to the world. But
how could he put into words how special this day was for him, from
the moment a pari-mutuel choir of 140,000 voices sang that sweet
old song to the thrilling finish when the colt he was riding, a
30-to-1 longshot named Charismatic, charged from behind and won the
Kentucky Derby, the greatest horse race of them all?
</P>
<P>
   The Derby is called a ``mile and a quarter without any water.''
It's about courage and stamina and sacrifice, not only for the
winner but also the little man aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Antley, a longshot himself, can tell you about sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Antley had to give up racing horses last year. Discouraged, he
moved back home to Columbia, S.C. His weight was the problem. One
day he stepped on the scales. His heart sank. ``147'' pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Antley had faced a career crisis before. In 1988 he tested
positive for cocaine and lost his jockey's license. He beat his
addiction and three years later won the Derby aboard Strike the
Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faced a battle he feared he couldn't win no matter how
hard he tried. Antley had to lose weight _ lots of weight _ if he
hoped to race again.
</P>
<P>
   He began running. He dieted. ``Every diet you could think of.''
He took water pills. Over time, he dropped 22 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Antley grew weak. Light-headed. He shed a few more pounds but
couldn't keep the weight off. He was stuck at 125.
</P>
<P>
   Les Antley's heart went out to his son. He urged him to give up
this torturous regimen. ``Chris, you're killing yourself. Forget
being a'' ``jockey. It's dangerous. You're 33. Why don't you try
something else''?``''
</P>
<P>
   At times Antley wanted to quit. It was hard. ``So'' hard. Too
hard. Hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   But Antley persevered. He began to run longer distances. People
in town became accustomed to seeing the 5-foot-3 figure jogging for
hours at a time. ``I got up to 25 miles,'' Antley said. Marathon
distance. Folks nicknamed him Forest Gump.
</P>
<P>
   Antley remembers the wishful conversation he had in December.
``Dad, the Derby is coming up soon. Wouldn't it be great if I made
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would say to his father now, Antley paused. Eyes
shining, the miniature figure wearing green and gold silks drew
himself up to his full height and said triumphantly, all 114
pounds, ``I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   He was everywhere Saturday. Sitting atop a determined horse that
caught Cat Thief and Worldly Manner down the stretch and held off
Menifee near the wire. Standing alongside Hall of Fame trainer D.
Wayne Lukas, who became a four-time Derby winner. Shaking hands and
accepting congratulations from many of the 18 other jockeys who
wished they could trade places with him.
</P>
<P>
   What was it Lukas called winning the Derby? ``A chance of a
lifetime in a lifetime of chances .''
</P>
<P>
   Antley felt as if that poetic sentiment had been penned just for
him. The winning jockey didn't know until a few weeks ago if he
ever would get another chance to be back in the saddle, doing what
he loves.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the day, the ride itself was easy compared with
what was required of him afterward. All the questions about what it
felt like coming down the stretch. Crossing the finish line and
pointing to the sky. Looking into the sweeping grandstands at the
sea of faces, men dressed in their silk neckties and matching
pocket squares; women in their fashionable finest, smiling out from
beneath the wide brims of their Derby Day hats.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes words seem inadequate. This was one of those days for
the small goggled figure who appeared bobbing down the sandy loam
headed for home _ ``in the midst of a miracle''_ feeling reborn,
weightless with joy, light as air. &QL;

THERE WAS MORE THAN OL SON TO D BACKS' VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Closer Gregg Olson was officially credited with the
save Saturday, but there were plenty of others who saved the
Diamondbacks in their 5-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was starter Todd Stottlemyre, working 6 strong innings and
drawing a pivotal walk with two out in the sixth to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   There was center fielder Steve Finley, who, after begging
Manager Buck Showalter to play two hours before the game, delivered
with a two-run single after Stottlemyre walked.
</P>
<P>
   There was set-up man Greg Swindell, getting out of impending
doom in the seventh with runners on base and working a perfect
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   There was left fielder Luis Gonzalez, who has been on such a
roll of late that he even won the clubhouse Kentucky Derby pool,
collecting two more hits to extend his franchise-record streak to
15 games and raising his team-best batting average to .392.
</P>
<P>
   There was second baseman Jay Bell, making a mad dash into right
field in the ninth to rob Brian Banks of a leadoff hit with an
over-the-shoulder catch.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Olson, exorcising early April demons by picking up
his fourth save, third on this trip and second in less than 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owed Oly one,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   With Olson on the mound and the Diamondbacks in the lead April
11 in Atlanta, Bell dropped a leadoff soft liner in the ninth
inning that led to a Braves' victory and Olson's third blown save
in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big catch,'' Olson said. ``If that drops in, it
could end up being demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the wind slowed the ball just enough for him to get to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had an angle on it,'' said Bell, who had three hits,
including his eighth home run in the fifth. ``I basically turned
around, hoping I wouldn't get hammered by one of the outfielders.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Diamondbacks (14-11) a 5-4 record on this
13-game trip and a second straight win over the Brewers, who lost
their fifth straight and ninth of 11 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (3-1) was sharp. He got ahead on most batters and
was in control until the seventh when he walked left fielder Geoff
Jenkins to start the inning, leading, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Banks then singled. Leadoff batter Fernando Vina and Mark
Loretta both went after first pitches and fouled out to catcher
Kelly Stinnett. Jeff Cirillo singled up the middle to score Jenkins
and, with Showalter making his way to the mound, Stottlemyre kicked
the dirt in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there in the seventh inning and walk the leadoff
guy with a 5-1 lead, that's not real good pitching,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``I felt I had better command of my fastball today. I just
missed there on Jenkins.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the bullpen has performed lately, Stottlemyre wasn't too
worried about handing Showalter the ball to give to Swindell.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a double to Jeromy Burnitz that cut the score to
5-3, Swindell, with runners on second and third, got Sean Berry to
hit a soft liner into left, where Gonzalez charged in to make the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the middle reliever is tough,'' Swindell said. ``He
can make or break a game. We made it out and I didn't break it.
That means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who has struggled at the plate, was grateful he didn't
break a bat for a change.
</P>
<P>
   He had two broken-bat outs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've broken enough bats to build a house,'' said Finley, who
is hitting .228. ``I'd say I was due for a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he didn't break any bats but perhaps the Brewers'
spirit with his two-run single in the sixth that gave Arizona a 5-1
lead and sent starter Jim Abbott to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter came to the stadium, seriously contemplating giving
the left-handed Finley a day off against left-handed Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of begged to play,'' Finley said. ``I don't care if I'm
swinging the bat bad or swinging it good. Sometimes, it's good to
have a day off. But I just felt I really needed to be out there. I
had my mind set to face this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter is glad he heeded his center fielder's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big knock,'' Showalter said. ``And what can I say
about Jay? He's played as good as anyone has played. That was a
great play (in the ninth). That stopped their momentum.'' &QL;

FERGUSON GETS JOB AS CARDINALS' GM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Bill Bidwill's friends around the NFL advised him,
urged him, to hire a real football man and give him control of the
Bidwill family business, the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And for years, Bidwill, the Cardinals owner, resisted. The
result was a consistently downward spiral in every aspect of the
team. Along the way, the title of general manager was given to
various men, but none had the power that it suggested.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bidwill finally did relent and give control to one man,
he gave it to the wrong one, Buddy Ryan, who held the dual role of
coach and general manager for two years until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The team since has been in the hands of a committee with no
clearly defined leader until Bidwill on Saturday confirmed a Friday
report in ``The Arizona Republic'' and handed the reins to Bob
Ferguson, who was promoted to general manager.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Ferguson, 48, has been vice president
for player personnel. He was assistant to the president for one
year before that. Ferguson now has authority over football
philosophy, player personnel, the coaching staff, pro and college
scouting, the draft and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Ryan has Bidwill entrusted someone outside his family
with such power. It is a move that, to the credit of Bidwill,
continues a wave of recent momentum for the team that it hopes
helps carry an election in two weeks on the Rio Salado Crossing, a
proposed Mesa convention and exposition center that would include a
retractable-roof stadium where the Cardinals would play.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing Ferguson has been the antithesis of the
tight-vested, bumbling image of the team during its first decade in
the Valley. He has become a favorite of fans because he is
accessible and straight-shooting. His deft player transactions and
drafts lifted the Cardinals to their first winning record since
1983, their first playoff berth since 1974 and their first playoff
win since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outspoken,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   With Ferguson running football and a Bidwill son, Michael, in
charge of non-football matters that include liaison to the Rio
Salado Crossing, the Cardinals have what Bidwill Sr. called a
leadership team ``to take us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said having Bidwill entrust him with his team ``is
pretty special when the family believes in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago Ferguson was uncertain he would be with the
Cardinals beyond the expiration of his contract later this month,
not knowing whether Bidwill wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying here and that's important to me,'' Ferguson said.
``I want to help us build a championship team and build a new home
in the East Valley. I'm grateful I've been part of what we've begun
here the last couple of years. Now we hope to finish it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an affirmation of what we all have been doing here
together. Now we need to learn how to play against a championship
schedule every year . . . to prove to everybody that we are
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who received a multiyear contract, will direct a front
office staff that includes Rod Graves, who continues as assistant
to the president and serves as the team's primary contract
negotiator; Bill Bidwill Jr., who had done considerable contract
negotiation but who now will provide strategic financial planning
on salary-cap issues in his role as vice president; and Jay
Nienkark, player personnel administrator who serves as daily
salary-cap administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill Jr. had served as one of the top committeemen in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fergie has earned the right to be the Cardinals' senior
football executive,'' Bidwill Sr. said. ``He has proven to be one
of the game's most astute evaluators of college and professional
talent. He is an excellent communicator and his expertise on draft
day is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope his guidance will help take us where we want to go.
Our team has made great strides in the years he has been with our
organization and he deserves his fair share of the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson has held executive postions in the NFL for 22 years
with Seattle, Buffalo, Dallas, San Francisco and Denver. All but
Seattle went to the Super Bowl with players he landed.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Ferguson might have a profound impact on the
team's negotiations with free agent linebacker Jamir Miller.
Ferguson has said that he is a fan of Miller, an outside linebacker
who led the team with 150 tackles last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that I like Jamir, I want him here, but
now we have made other moves that make it tough under the salary
cap to get anything done,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals are strapped under the cap, Ferguson now has
authority to tinker and open enough room to entice Miller into a
one-year offering, enough to get him back in the fold with the
opportunity to reach for more as a free agent again next year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Miller nor his new agent, Leigh Steinberg, could be
reached Saturday for comment. &QL;

BURTON ON THE POLE FOR CAL 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ If history is to repeat itself today at the California
Speedway, the winner of the California 500 will start from the
third position in the 43-car field. That scenario would return Mark
Martin to the winner's circle at the end of the 250-lap contest.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who dominated the second running of the NASCAR Winston
Cup Series event over the two-mile track last year, is in the third
starting spot not because he qualified there, but because that's
where he stands in the points race.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rain, which seemed like such a distant memory during
Saturday's two practice sessions, washed out qualifying. Thus the
field for today's race, the 10th of 34 in the series, was set by
points and entry postmarks. The last Winston Cup race started by
points was the inaugural Texas event in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That means Jeff Burton will be on the pole alongside fellow Ford
driver Dale Jarrett. Joining Martin in the second row will be Bobby
Labonte, with Jeff Gordon and Rusty Wallace in the third row.
Gordon won the inaugural race in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of the front six, only Jarrett and Labonte have yet to win a
race this year. Burton and Gordon have each won twice, and Martin
and Wallace have also triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a race track like this, it really doesn't matter where you
start,'' said Burton, who has finished 30th and 10th in his two
starts on the Fontana track. ``You could start 10th, 20th or
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was the fastest during Saturday's final practice, dubbed
``Happy Hour'' by tour regulars. Gordon, the two-time defending
Winston Cup champion, toured the oval in 40.198 seconds, a speed of
179.113, in his famed No.24 DuPont Chevrolet. Jeremy Mayfield,
sporting a paint scheme that commemorated Saturday's 125th running
of the Kentucky Derby on his Mobil 1 Ford Taurus, was second
fastest at 40.257, followed by Burton's 40.383. Jarrett was
fifth-fastest in the hour-long session, followed by Labonte and
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was also fastest in the morning session, turning in a
39.699. He won the pole in 1998 with a run of 39.610. What does
that say for the lack of time on the track Friday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I think qualifying really mixes up the field,'' said
Burton. ``I'm glad we're starting by points. All the cars that run
good are high in the points. ``I think it may make it safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach said the 2{ hours of practice were enough to
get ready for today's race. Dallenbach, a Rick Hendrick teammate to
Gordon and Terry Labonte in his No.25 Budweiser Chevrolet, will
start 22nd but had the 16th best time in the final practice
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we might have had a top 10 car here,'' Dallenbach
said. ``But we had plenty of time to work on the race setup.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Schrader is in total agreement. ``We got more practice
time than we usually get,'' said Schrader, who has won two of four
Winston West races held at the speedway but only finished as high
as 15th in Cup competition. ``We don't learn anything on Friday. I
think it's a complete waste of time. ``Everybody is about as good
as they're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton doesn't believe the field will allow him to go around the
first time without a challenge. ``Everybody wants to lead a lap,
especially those in the top five,'' said Burton, who has scored 40
bonus points thus far, tops in the circuit. Drivers gain five bonus
points for leading a lap and the one with the most laps led for
each race collects an additional five.
</P>
<P>
   At Fontana, only Gordon, Terry Labonte and Ricky Rudd have
completed every lap in Cup competition. However, Martin has led the
most laps in that same time span, 176, thanks to his dominating
effort last year when he paced the field 160 times. Martin, who has
seven top-10 finishes in his last eight races, will be making his
400th career start.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's Valvoline-sponsored Ford is one of five owner Jack
Roush will field today. That includes Burton, who has driven the
Exide Batteries car to 11th or better in eight of the nine races.
He saw enough during practice to say that the expected crowd of
115,000 will see some spirited racing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a lot of two-wide racing,'' said Burton,
who got extra seat time Saturday by finishing second in the Busch
Grand National Auto Club 300. ``I think you saw some of that in
practice. The bottom (groove) is still best, but the top is good
enough to slow the bottom down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race track is a little bit different in that you know
you're gonna have a lot of close racing,'' said Jarrett, whose
No.88 Quality Care is one of two cars in the field owned by Robert
Yates. ``It's extremely fast, but there are a couple of grooves
here. You go in knowing it's a wide track that's gonna let you have
fun racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Martin used different strategies for their wins at
Fontana. Gordon won on fuel mileage, cutting it so close that he
coasted into the winner's circle, a development that many won't
forget. Martin was a runaway winner on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start thinking fuel mileage-pit strategy as soon
as the race starts,'' said Larry McReynolds, crew chief for the
No.31 Lowe's Chevrolet driven by Mike Skinner. ``(The track) has
that characteristic, that possibility that it could be a full
green-flag race. There's lots of racing room.''

POW'S MOTHER ANTICIPATES TEARFUL REUNION WITH SON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hailing the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a hero, Vivian
Ramirez glowed with hope as she thanked Jackson for securing the
release of her son, Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, from his Serbian
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson announced Saturday that he had successfully brokered the
release of Ramirez, 24, of East Los Angeles, Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., who were captured a month ago
while patrolling the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jackson's announcement, the Pentagon confirmed that
the three POWs are expected to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lifesaver,'' Vivian Ramirez said Saturday during a news
conference held outside the police headquarters of the eastern
suburb of Baldwin Park. ``He will be my hero when he brings my
!italics!mijo!end italics! home and I thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez received a call at about noon Saturday from the U.S.
Army confirming Jackson's successful mission. Her ``little Andy''
was finally coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy now,'' said Ramirez, sporting a T-shirt
emblazoned with her son's image and pinned with a yellow ribbon.
``It seems like this time we're really going to go (to Germany).''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of Baldwin Park, spent the evening awaiting the green
light from the U.S. Army to fly to Germany where she planned to
reunite with her son at a military base. She was to be accompanied
by her son Steven Ramirez, a Los Angeles police detective, her
former husband, Andrew M. Ramirez, her daughter Nadine Ramirez, and
Nadine Ramirez's 5-month-old daughter, Vanessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we see him that's when it will really hit us,'' Nadine
Ramirez said as she cradled her daughter. ``Right now we're just
hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Los Angeles neighborhood where Andrew Ramirez was
raised, a fresh wave of well-wishers sporting yellow ribbons showed
up throughout the morning with candles and letters to place outside
his home. Friends and relatives remained cautiously hopeful, but
thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. We really can't express our happy
emotions,'' said Maria Rios, 39, a childhood friend of Andrew
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very uplifting, it was positive,'' said Robert Carcano,
who is Andrew Ramirez's second cousin. ``Until the official word
comes out, obviously there will be cause for celebration. I'm sure
there will be one heck of a block party.''
</P>
<P>
   The serviceman's father declined to comment but spent part of
Saturday on his front porch with his sisters and cousins arranging
yellow ribbons and POW buttons in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Andrew M. Ramirez) feels that until he receives official word
from the government that his son has been released into the arms of
the United States, then he'll be satisfied,'' said Carcano, 42, a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Vivian Ramirez said she would do when she saw
her son is cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hug him and I will not let go and tell him how much I
love him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she first heard of Jackson's breakthrough, Ramirez couldn't
believe it and said it didn't seem real until she received
confirmation from Maj. Don Dunne, an Army reservist based in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know that maybe it's definite,'' she said. ``I pray that
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said she hadn't planned to pack her bags until she
received word Saturday because she didn't want to get her hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have been depressed looking at my bag,'' she
said. ``Today I will pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the media frenzy that has surrounded the capture of the
three American soldiers, Ramirez said she didn't think her son
would view himself as a celebrity, describing him as shy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a home-cooked meal, the first thing she would
probably do for her son when he arrives home is take him to his
favorite fast-food hamburger joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite is In-N-Out. He'll say, Forget your dinner,'' she
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Though the past month has been filled with anguish, Ramirez said
she took each day one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw her son in a CNN-televised interview shown Friday
from Yugoslavia, Ramirez said she was encouraged. Her son looked
thinner but healthy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son wrote to each other in the past month. In a
letter she told him how his neighborhood was pulling for him, how
Los Angeles residents had strung yellow ribbons across the city,
how letters poured in from all over the world encouraging Vivian
Ramirez to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ramirez in turn told his mother that he was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's doing a lot of praying, (that) he misses us, he
loves us and he can hardly wait to come home and see us,'' Vivian
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Once her son returns, Ramirez said she was unsure what his plans
would be. Next May, Andrew Ramirez will have completed his
commitment to the army. He originally was supposed to serve two
years, but will have served a total of seven years in the army,
Vivian Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to him, he only has a few more months,'' she said,
adding that his goal is to join the Los Angeles Police Department.
``He wants to be an officer like his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Ramirez arrives home to Los Angeles he'll find the
messages of people like Sandra Dominguez nearby Downey who wrote a
special note for him and hand-delivered it to his father's home
Saturday by placing it under a candle outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home, Andy. So glad you're coming home. Our prayers
have been with you,'' read the letter, which Dominguez said she
wrote on behalf of her sister, a Navy reservist who lives in
suburban Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit close to home when it happened,'' said Dominguez, 24,
accompanied by her parents, Armando and Rose Menchaca, also of
Downey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they will all be coming home safe,'' Armando
Menchaca said. ``That's what we're all hoping will be the bottom
line.''

PHANTOM MENACE SOUNDTRACK ANOTHER WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To fans of John Williams' music for the ``Star Wars'' movies,
each score has the significance of a numbered symphony by a major
composer.
</P>
<P>
   There was the first, original ``Star Wars,'' with its screaming
fanfare of an opening and moments of mysterious quiet for young
Luke. There was the second, ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' with that
maniacally mechanical ``Empire March'' so compelling in its evil it
made you want to join the dark side. And there was the third,
``Return of the Jedi,'' in which the themes of good and evil _
musical as well as cinematic _ came into collision and resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at last, we can say:
</P>
<P>
   May the fourth be with you.
</P>
<P>
   The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack of ``Star Wars: Episode
I, The Phantom Menace,'' due in stores Tuesday, shows once again
that composer John Williams has a great deal in common with Franz
Liszt, the famously devilish 19th century pianist-composer. Liszt
and Williams, whose ubiquitous music makes him the writer of the
soundtracks to our fantasies, are masters of the same genre:
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and fifty years ago, ``melodrama'' referred to a
dramatic reading accompanied by music. The reading told the
audience what was happening, and the music _ usually played at the
piano _ told them what to feel. Liszt wrote many scores for such
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Williams in his best movie scores tells the audience what
to feel while the visuals tell it what's going on. Different
technologies, same idea.
</P>
<P>
   On Sony Classical, reuniting Williams with the London Symphony
Orchestra, ``Phantom Menace'' contains much that is expected, and a
great deal that's new. After the main title, which is exactly the
same as that for the 1977 ``Star Wars,'' the old themes show up
only in fragments, woven into or popping out of the texture of new
music. The movie is a prequel, after all, and these themes haven't
``happened'' yet.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective use of an old theme in the new context is in
a track titled ``He Is the Chosen One.'' It starts out with the
yearning ``Force'' theme (think of Luke beneath the double moons in
``Star Wars)'' but quickly morphs into a distortion of the theme,
auguring some dangerous misuse of the sacred Force. The most
immediately striking of the new music is the second track on the
compact disc, ``Duel of the Fates,'' a choral incantation
reminiscent of Carl Orff, underpinned by a scurrying, insistent
rhythmic figure that will show up again. Less gripping viscerally
but perhaps even better as feeling-painting is the third track,
``Anakin's Theme,'' a serenely haunting melody and possibly the
finest single thing Williams has penned for the series. At the end,
it eerily but aptly changes into a slow version of the ``Empire
March.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of melodrama is signaling, a semaphore of pitch and
pace. Williams is without peer at this. In all four ``Star Wars''
soundtracks, the semaphore vocabulary is clear and exactly right.
Pyramiding brass signal danger. Trumpet fanfares on repeated notes
indicate battle. Percussion _ of which there is a great deal more
in ``Phantom Menace'' than in the earlier three _ points to
something strange, new and possibly illusory.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of hymnlike writing. The sole and soulful
sort, and the kind reserved for moments of public, civil order,
such as the curtain-call medal-hanging scene at the end of ``Star
Wars.'' Both kinds are put to use in ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Star Wars'' and ``Return of the Jedi,'' there is a track
of quasi-pop music. In ``Star Wars'' this was the silly Cantina
Band number, and in ``Jedi'' it was the rather flimsy chanting song
of the Ewoks. ``Phantom Menace'' has ``Augie's Great Municipal
Band,'' a short, Caribbean-flavored dance tune.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' ``Star Wars'' scores are entertainment music at its
best and most honest. They do not pretend to be more than they are,
but they are not shy to exploit everything they truly are. &QL;

CRAVEN WINS WINSTON WEST RACE
</HEADLINE>
 WEST-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Ricky Craven is starting 41st in today's NASCAR
Winston Cup California 500 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's Winston West California 200, the NASCAR veteran
would rather be starting his Winston West Ford Taurus than his
Winston Cup Ford. Craven ran away from his competition to win the
100-lap, 200-mile Winston West race before approximately 40,000
fans Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a better car than the one we're going to race
tomorrow, said Craven, who raced in a Winston West event at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway, but did not finish because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The car was purchased to race in last year's Winston West
exhibition in Motegi, Japan from Winston Cup owner Jack Roush, who
employed Craven until he sat aside because of injuries and was not
re-offered a job back last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be one of the best cars I've ever had, Craven said.
``Either we had 10 more horsepower than they did or they had 10
horsepower less.
</P>
<P>
   The race, a postlude to the Busch Grand National Auto Club 300,
was dominated by drivers who compete in other series. Kenny
Schrader, who is 13th in Winston Cup points, finished second.
Schrader had won this race the previous two years. Craftsman Truck
driver Rick Carelli finished in third place.
</P>
<P>
   The race was marred by a spectacular crash, although no driver
was seriously injured. Brendan Gaughan was tapped from behind in
Turn 4, spun into the wall and slid to the bottom of the track.
Gary Smith, already spinning backward, hit Gaughan in the rear,
causing a large explosion. The fire did not spread and was quickly
extinguished. Gaughan complained of only being singed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get it turned (back) around, Gaughan said. I lost
the brake lines when I hit the wall. I started to go down and I saw
the No. 7 car coming, but I couldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Craven took the lead for good on Lap 73. When the sixth, and
final, yellow flag went out two laps later, Schrader, who had been
swapping the lead with Craven for nearly the entire race, went into
the pits to change all four tires. The pit stop put him at the back
of the lead lap, in 15th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed our sequence, Schrader said. ``We knew we were not
going to get around (Craven) without a change.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Schrader passed Carelli to take second with two laps
to go, Craven was four seconds in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our only chance was to get fresh tires, make a run
for second and then hope we catch a yellow, Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   Polesitter Austin Cameron went out of the race on Lap 58 when
battling Schrader for the lead. He bumped John Metcalf and went
into the wall in Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a very good driver, but he's got to learn how
to finish a race, Schrader said. ``He has to figure out what he has
to do, but it's hard to tell someone that. We've all had to learn
that.
</P>
<P>
   Winston West will race at Irwindale Speedway on June 19 and Aug.
21.

LUCKLESS GORDON HAVING HEADACHE OF A SEASON  
 BUT 3 DNFS IN 9 STARTS ARE `NO REASON TO PANIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ So this is what it's like.
</P>
<P>
   Rotten luck. Lousy finishes. Headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, boy, the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon always knew it could happen. He knew because it's
happened so many times before.
</P>
<P>
   But it's always happened to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Except now.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gordon is the snake-bit driver, the one racer seemingly
unable to buy a stinking break.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of luck, kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Crew chief, confidant, soulmate) Ray Evernham reminded me we
won 10 races after last year's Coca Cola 600 in May,'' Gordon said.
``There's no reason to panic. It's still early.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's early.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're a two-time defending NASCAR Winston Cup driving
champion, winner of a whopping 40 races the past four seasons, and
someone used to going home late because you're too busy supplying
sound bites and quotes for an inquiring media, it's never too early
to talk about being late at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   And in nine starts this season entering Sunday's California 500
at pristine California Speedway, Gordon has been so late in three
races, he hasn't shown up at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having one of those years that everybody has been
waiting for,'' said Gordon, whose statistical ledger this season
includes three DNFs (39th, 43rd and 38th). ``But it's not because
we're not running good. We're running real good. We're just not
having the good fortune that we've had in the past, and that's what
it takes to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a year like we had last year (13 wins, 26
top-five and 28 top-10 finishes in 33 starts), a third driving
title in the past four seasons, and enough race winnings and
endorsement bucks to purchase an island somewhere near, oh,
Jamaica, it's real easy to look at this season and say we're having
a real bad year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had three wrecks and three bad finishes, but we're
still fifth in points. Actually, I feel fortunate that I can sit
here and say, `How in the heck are we fifth in points?' ''
</P>
<P>
   How indeed. Maybe things aren't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Gordon is fifth in the drivers standings, which is
exactly where he was at this juncture a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Gordon has the same amount of wins (two), one more
top-five (five) and an additional top-10 (six) finish than last
season after nine races.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, Gordon trailed the series leader by 73 points.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the deficit separating leader Jeff Burton and
Gordon is 210 points.
</P>
<P>
   And, then, there's those DNFs. That doesn't happen to Gordon. At
least, not to the point where it creates a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone say that they weren't sure they could make up
that point differential,'' Dale Jarrett said. ``You have to laugh a
little bit at that. He's (Gordon) still very much within striking
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon isn't laughing. But he also hasn't locked himself in a
closet, either.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is Gordon, Evernham and the Rainbow Warriors
we're talking about. If anyone is capable of putting together
another remarkable stretch (10 wins, 17 top-five and 20 top-10
finishes in final 20 races of last season), it's you know who.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team is too good and Gordon is too good a driver to stay
down for long,'' Rusty Wallace said. ``They'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Burton senses a Gordon surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it appears as if (Gordon) is having some
troubles,'' Burton said. ``I don't think that's happened to them
that early in the season before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think championships are won on luck. They're won
on preparation. That team knows how to prepare and how to keep
themselves out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   True.
</P>
<P>
   But all good things eventually come to an end, don't they?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, isn't it healthy for NASCAR to have so many different
front-runners (seven different winners this season) instead of a
constant Gordon-Mark Martin and vice-versa one-two finish every
week, which is what happened so many times in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   ``All sports have teams or someone that stands out,'' Burton
said. ``Baseball has the Yankees, the Bulls with Michael Jordan,
the 49ers (a few years ago) in football. It benefits the sort. It
gives others something to shoot at, the way everyone is shooting at
the 24 team (Gordon).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had 30 races and 30 different winners, it might be
parity, but what fun would it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Not much for Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gordon is going to mirror last season and the season
before, he will need a jump start soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need things to happen like what happened last week to
(Burton),'' Gordon said. ``It looked like (his car) was going to
blow up on the starting line, but he comes back and everything is
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of luck we've had. It's been unbelievable at
times, the last three or four years. I'm more surprised at that
than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we can still have a great season, even greater
than it's already been after winning (the Daytona 500). We have a
competitive team, as competitive as we've had in a long time. We
can't put pressure on ourselves and feel like we have to win every
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's what we all want to do _ win. I guess that's me just
wanting to be perfect.''

FOR ANTLEY, THE WEIGHT WAS WORTH IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Chris Antley made the joke in September, and
it's a good thing he was hidden away in South Carolina when he said
it.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been at a racetrack, he would have been laughed off the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be neat,'' the jockey said to his father, with
whom he was living, ``if I rode in the Derby _ and won it.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the prospect seemed humorous indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Antley hadn't ridden in any race, let alone a Kentucky Derby, in
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been spotted at Del Mar last summer, but he wasn't in
racing silks, just searching for a solution to his weight problems,
the demons that threatened to end his career at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   Since the previous October, he'd spent most of his time in
Columbia, S.C., considering the possibility that ``racing is gone
and I might have to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   He delved into the stock market, and created an
investment-advice web site titled ``The Ant-Man Report.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was Chris Antley doing in the Churchill Downs winner's
circle late Saturday afternoon, offering thanks to trainer D. Wayne
Lukas, owners Bob and Beverly Lewis and higher powers after riding
31-1 shot Charismatic to a Derby victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``My sarcasm came true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after he returned to the races at Santa
Anita, Antley was back on top of the sport, where many thought he
belonged all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's maybe the best rider of our generation, for pure
talent,'' said Drew Mollica, one of his former agents. ``He's very
complex. When he's good, he's very, very good. When he's bad, he's
very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The good included an earlier Kentucky Derby victory, aboard
Strike the Gold in 1991, a record 64-day winning streak in New York
in '89, and a record nine-winner day at tracks in New York and New
Jersey in '87.
</P>
<P>
   The bad included the suspensions that followed positive drug
tests in '88.
</P>
<P>
   Antley insists the problems that kept him out for all of '98 had
nothing to do with substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   An even decade after drug-plagued Pat Valenzuela rode Sunday
Silence to a Derby victory and declared ``Just Say No'' in a
post-race press conference, there would be no similar testimonial
from Antley.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, was all about weight, devil enough in a sport
where athletic young men are asked to weigh less than 115 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem overwhelmed him when he left Del Mar in '97 to ride
at Saratoga. He found the scale reading 119. One day, when he went
to Canada for a major race, he was forced to sweat away nine pounds
in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Diet pills left him too weak to ride. Fad diets didn't work.
Blood tests in Europe provided no answer.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to California shortly before the '97 Breeders'
Cup at Hollywood Park, Antley stopped riding and went home.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, he roomed with his father, Les, who pumps
propane for a living.
</P>
<P>
   At one stage, Antley was up to 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my dad I was going to come back or die trying,'' he
said. ``I'm going to run and run and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Thanksgiving, ``I broke down,'' he said. A knee grew so
sore he couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   But after Christmas he was back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He set his sights on beating a rival, Mike Smith, back to the
races. If Smith could do it, recuperating from a broken back, why
couldn't Antley, recovering from a broken diet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the name `Forrest Gump' in South Carolina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my career _ in my
life,'' he said of returning to Derby caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first (Derby win) was right time, right place. This has a
lot more sentimental value probably than anything I've done in my
career. I didn't think I was going to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he became ``a big boy'' in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had things handed to me and always been able to come back
quick or get through hard times,'' he said. ``This was (different).
I couldn't just come back nonchalant. I had to work to get back
here. I had to reach into the depths of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley returned to competition Feb. 4 at Santa Anita and has
done well since _ even during the weeks when he'd weigh out at a
plump 121 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a break to wind up in the Derby. Hall of Famer Laffit
Pincay Jr. reportedly turned down the mount on Charismatic, whom
he'd ridden at Santa Anita, and Lukas and the Lewises turned to
Antley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had won the Derby,'' Bob Lewis said. ``He'd had experience
in big fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Antley got lucky Saturday, avoiding the traffic that
claimed several contenders, even though he started from the outside
in post 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of this sport,'' said Shane Sellers, who
rode Vicar to a troubled 18th-place finish. ``Here's a guy who was
out a year and a half, and he's back (eight) weeks and riding the
Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sorry to see him on the sidelines. He's just a great
rider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show you're never down and out in this
business,'' Mollica said on the phone from New York Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As he rode Charismatic through the homestretch, an eighth of a
mile from winning the Derby, Antley says he uttered a silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking if this was real or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It !ital!was!off! real.
</P>
<P>

EARNHARDT NOW 0 FOR 10 BUT KEEPS POINTS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Still no checkered flag for  &UR; Dale Earnhardt
 &UR; Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, whose sensational debut last season resulted in seven
wins and the NASCAR Busch Series championship, can't seem to find
the entrance into victory lane this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished third Saturday behind winner  &UR; Matt Kenseth
and runner-up  &UR; Jeff Burton in the Auto Club 300 at California
Speedway, leaving him 0 for 10 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have the points lead than win races,'' Earnhardt
said Friday on the eve of the race. ``But I look forward to
hopefully changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt almost did 24 hours later. He led 81 laps, nearly
three times as many as Kenseth. But Earnhardt made a daring move
underneath a slower car on Lap 121 while running sixth and wound up
spinning and losing a lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty spectacular to see someone spin like that at 185
miles per hour and not hit anything,'' Kenseth said. ``(Earnhardt)
is a great driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt unlapped himself on Lap 128, and when a three-car
crash produced the sixth of eight caution flags on Lap 129, he was
able to move to the tail end of the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   By Lap 138, Earnhardt was up to third from 14th. There was
another caution on Lap 140, and Earnhardt momentarily dropped to
fifth following the restart on Lap 145 because his Chevy Monte
Carlo was without third gear.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt mounted another charge and was significantly closing
the gap on the two front-runners when Todd Bodine crashed on Lap
149, forcing the race to end under caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to see that (Lap 140 caution),'' Kenseth said.
``Seeing all those cars on your bumper makes me nervous. But as
long as I kept my position, I felt like I could hold them off.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Kenseth's second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, despite no wins, remained atop the drivers standings,
95 points ahead of Kenseth. &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
McDonald's and car owner  &UR; Cal  &UR; Wells III have agreed to a
sponsorship agreement to field a NASCAR Busch Series car next
season. The arrangement eventually will lead to a Winston Cup team.
Although McDonald's will continue to be car owner/driver  &UR; Bill
Elliott's major sponsor through 2000, the relationship will end
following next season. Elliott last won in 1994, when he drove for
 &UR; Junior Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bobby Labonte will not drive in any more Busch races this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Thompson of Scottsdale finished 10th in the NASCAR Winston
West California 200 on Saturday. &QL;

DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Raul Mondesi was dropped from fourth to fifth in
the Dodgers' batting order, had a bit of a tizzy and now thinks
life is grand.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson did it to spark the offense, and
also catch Mondesi's attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's working.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster offense the Dodgers took to Milwaukee is
disappearing as they deliver clutch hits and piece together big
innings. The latest piling on came Saturday as the Dodgers beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 12-6 at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' highest run output of the season pushed their
winning streak to five _ the longest string since August 1997. In
the last three games the Dodgers have scored 26 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's doing well the last five games,'' said Mondesi,
the Dodgers' right fielder. ``Last week I said we weren't going to
be struggling on offense. We're starting to hit better and our
pitching is doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi led a 12-hit attack with a three-run homer in the first
inning off long-forgotten left-hander Paul Spoljaric (0-3). His
ninth homer in 24 games gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead and served as a
precursor to a five-run second inning that made life on the mound
easier for starter Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Since being moved in the lineup five games ago Mondesi has a
pair of homers, six RBI and is hitting .353.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad the first day, but after that I don't think about
it,'' said Mondesi, who leads the Dodgers with 20 RBI. ``I was mad,
but after that what are you going to do? After that, I have to do
the best I can. I go out there every day and I play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Eric Karros, who swapped places with Mondesi, showed
signs of breaking out of a 1 for 16 skid with a pair of hits,
including the back-breaking one in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield's RBI single knocked Spoljaric (0-3) out with one
out in the second and kept the bases loaded. Karros then hit
reliever Mike Grace's first pitch into left field to score two runs
and give the Dodgers an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to do a few things offensively, (but) some guys
are trying to do too much,'' Johnson said. ``Mondesi is hitting the
ball well. I guess he's still made at me for dropping him to
fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all Dreifort (4-1) needed. He gave up 10 hits and three
runs in six innings, but that hardly mattered. Once the huge lead
was provided, he altered his pitching plan. Many of his 106 pitches
were fastballs, though he did have a wicked slider working.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other starts in which Dreifort was wild, he was able
to throw strikes. He walked a season-low one and had five
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was an `I come straight after them' approach,''
Dreifort said of pitching with the big lead. ``It's the game (Paul)
LoDuca called and I pitched it. I still gave up 10 hits, but only
three scored. I was just throwing it so they could hit it. I'm not
a guy who's going to nibble around. Even when I gave up 10 hits
tonight, most of the time I was behind in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was still able to give the Dodgers a solid outing,
something the Dodgers starters did during the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the once-stagnant offense is alive and producing runs, which
lessen the burden on the pitchers. The Dodgers were averaging 4.7
runs while limping to a 9-10 mark before the road trip. They were
hitting .255.
</P>
<P>
   However, since arriving in Milwaukee for a three-game set
Tuesday, the Dodgers are averaging 6.4 runs and they're hitting
.284.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we're doing anything better. We're just getting
hits now,'' Karros said. ``It's a much more balanced lineup. When
(Todd) Hundley's catching, (Adrian) Beltre's hitting eighth, and
he's batting .350, so we're in good shape.''

DODGERS STARTERS ARE SOLID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pitching was supposed to carry the Dodgers, and
during this five-game winning streak the starters have done their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort's six innings in Saturday's 12-6
win against the Philadelphia Phillies was the fifth consecutive
solid start by a Dodgers pitcher _ each by a different member of
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five games of the nine-game road trip, the
starters are 5-0 with a 3.24 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   It began a few days after a team meeting in which Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson told the pitchers to be more aggressive,
especially with their fastballs, instead of trying to throw
off-speed pitches on the corners of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown set the tone with 62/3 innings against Milwaukee and
allowed two runs. Chan Ho Park had the same numbers the next day.
Ismael Valdes pitched seven innings and allowed four runs in the
series finale.
</P>
<P>
   That trio is expected to lead the Dodgers, and is one of the
best in baseball. But it's what the other two starters did that's
allowed the momentum to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez broke out of his slump with seven innings of
one-run ball in the series opener against the Phillies before
Dreifort's outing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's eased the burden on the Dodgers' overworked bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's a good trip for the confidence,'' Dodgers pitching
coach Charlie Hough said. ``Carlos got confidence. Dreifort is
making progress in things he can do. His slider was unhittable and
he was throwing it for strikes. Carlos pitched to set up his
changeup with his fastball instead of the other way around. It's
been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending their honor: In the spring, everyone outside of the
Dodgers organization wondered how L.A. would survive defensively
with Eric Young and Mark Grudzielanek in the middle of the infield
and Gary Sheffield in left.
</P>
<P>
   A month's sampling is in and the defense is fine. Young has two
errors at second, Grudzielanek has made one at shortstop and
Sheffield has played an error-free and splendid left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all very athletic,'' Johnson said. ``Sheffield has
been the Gold Glove left fielder. Threw a guy out at home, played
the wall unbelievable at home. (Young and Grudzielanek) are taking
extra ground balls. It wasn't something I was really worried
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Osuna diary: Today's Antonio Osuna update has the
right-hander experiencing tenderness in his elbow after throwing
22/3 innings at Single-A San Bernardino on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Osuna will travel to Montreal on Monday and the
Dodgers will examine him when they arrive for their three-game
series. If Osuna is OK, Johnson said he'll be activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little bit of swelling after the game,'' Johnson
said. ``He came in a little bit tender, the swelling went down, got
a little treatment and went out and played catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna is trying to pitch through the pain of a bone spur in his
elbow rather than having surgery to remove it. He's eligible to
come off the disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Osuna is activated, Johnson said the Dodgers will stay with
11 pitchers. It could mean left-hander Jeff Kubenka being returned
to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Catcher Paul LoDuca's seventh-inning
single broke an 0-for-8 slump and raised his average from .036 to
.069. Infielder Tripp Cromer followed with his first hit of the
season after eight hitless at-bats.... Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson has 999 career wins.... Dreifort stole his first base of
the season in the second inning.
</P>
<P>

DODGERS vs. PHILADELPHIA &QL; 
Time: 10:35 a.m., at Veterans Stadium. &QL; 
TV/Radio: Channel 5; KXTA-AM (1150), KAVL-AM (610), KWKW-AM (1330,
Spanish). &QL; 
Matchup: It's marquee matchup No.2 for Dodgers ace Kevin Brown.
After facing Randy Johnson opening day, Brown meets Phillies
right-hander Curt Schilling in the finale of a three-game series.
Brown (2-1) hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in a start
since yielding five in the opener. The right-hander is fourth in
the league in ERA (2.34). He was 2-0 with a 1.96 ERA against
Philadelphia last season. Schilling (3-1, 2.77) hasn't allowed a
run in 10 innings and opponents are batting .206 against him. The
Phillies scored 29 runs in Schilling's first three starts but
scored three in his last two. &QL;

CARDINALS ROOKIE RISES FROM THE ASHES  
 LIFE'S STRUGGLES BRING SAFETY JOHNSON TO NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals rookie safety Paris Johnson was 14 the day his mother
was taken away because of a crack cocaine problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody called the authorities and said she was unfit,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a ward of the state of Illinois. His two younger
sisters and brother were placed in different foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them,'' he said. ``I call them. I talk to them. But it
hurts so bad to see my brothers and sisters struggle like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the lucky one. He was placed in the custody of his
aunt, who tried to shield him from the life of drugs and gangs on
the streets of Chicago's mean West Side.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't always work. At times, he was so wild, his aunt,
Paulette Thompson, locked him out of her house.
</P>
<P>
   He still roamed the streets. One night, he was out celebrating
his acceptance to a junior college to play football when a gang
pulled its guns on him and his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life flashed in front of me,'' said Johnson, a fifth-round
pick earlier this month from Miami of Ohio. ``I made up of my mind
I didn't want to live that way, constantly watching my back,
constantly worried I was going to jail.'' &QL; 
Chapter and verse &QL; 
Miami Coach Terry Hoeppner likes to tell people that Johnson is an
``incredible story who just keeps writing new chapters to the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter happened April 18, when Johnson was playing
Monopoly with friends and his girlfriend, Monica Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my turn to roll the dice,'' he said. ``I let the dice
go, and all of sudden, I see, `Paris Johnson, Arizona Cardinals' on
TV. My mouth just dropped. I said, `Yes!' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was a long way from the day he watched his mother, Darlene
Johnson, leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I stayed in that situation, I would have ended up in
jail,'' Johnson said. ``Or dead. Or on the wrong side of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad, who fathered 16 children with seven different women,
was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got addicted to drugs,'' Johnson said. ``It took a toll on
her life and our whole quality of life. But it motivated me that I
didn't want to go down that path, the way she led her life. I never
wanted to end up like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His aunt took him in, even though she already was raising three
kids and a grandchild. Then she lost her job at the post office,
and money was tight.
</P>
<P>
   That's why she served chicken nearly every night _ fried
chicken, baked chicken, broiled chicken, chicken and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though she lost her job, we stuck together,'' Johnson
said. ``It made me learn what true hard work was. She worked late
hours, would come back in the middle of the night exhausted. But
she still made sure I got my homework done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wasn't an angel, which is why he sometimes got locked
out of the house. He didn't get arrested, just hung around the
wrong people and got involved with gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was ready to spread my wings and see the world the
way it was, and basically, I wasn't ready,'' he said. ``I was being
stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson was a senior in high school, he was out on his own
again. He switched from a high school in a rough neighborhood,
Proviso West, to one in more of a middle class neighborhood, Oak
Park River Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But to play at Oak Park, he had to live alone in a state-funded
apartment as part of the government's New Direction program. He'd
awake at 5:30 a.m., iron his clothes, pack himself a lunch and then
go off to school.
</P>
<P>
   Every couple of weeks, government workers interviewed Oak Park's
coaches to make sure Johnson was behaving himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let anyone down,'' he said. ``I had a
responsibility to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on my own was another blessing. Another door opened. It
allowed me to see what life was all about. It gave me an
opportunity to be a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Football gave Johnson another opportunity. His grades kept him
from going to a Division I school. So he went to North Iowa Area
Community College instead.
</P>
<P>
   It was there he met Lindsay, who later transferred to Miami. She
was the one who told a Miami assistant about him.
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks invited Johnson for a visit. During that visit, he
told then-head coach Randy Walker, ``I want to play for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's response was, ``OK. Who are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he found out Johnson's amazing life story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he knew about me was what he saw on the (junior
college) highlight tape,'' Johnson said. ``It was a homemade tape.
It wasn't clear. Still, he took a chance on me. All my life, I've
been associated with people who took a chance on me.'' &QL; 
Another risk taker &QL; 
The Cardinals took a chance on Johnson, 6 foot 2, 213 pounds, even
though he missed six of his final seven games last season because
of a bruised knee.
</P>
<P>
   They liked his hitting ability, even though he lacked coverage
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the thing that jumped off the film,'' Cardinals
secondary coach Larry Marmie said. ``He played the game with an
attitude. We knew he was going to be very physical in his style of
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with his college coach (Walker) at North Carolina,
and he told me the guy had some real strong resolve. He said, `You
talk about liking somebody, you're going to like this guy.' Some
people can overcome a lot of things if they want to. He must have a
great amount of personal pride and will to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's mother remains in jail. He hasn't talked to her in
months.
</P>
<P>
   When he signs his first contract, Johnson wants to spend the
money to help his brother and sister, teenagers who remain in
foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to raise them like I always wanted to be raised,'' he
said.
</P>

SALAAM FIGURES HE IS DUE FOR BREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   The cheekbone under his left eye is swollen and scarred _ not
the result of a fight but a car accident _ which has left Chicago
Bears running back  &UR; Rashaan Salaam trying to put his NFL career
back together at a fitness center in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   His broken leg has healed, his knee and hamstring problems
appear over. So why is the former Heisman Trophy winner out of a
job?
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before I was supposed to go the (Oakland) Raiders, I
got into a wreck,'' he said of the March 28 accident in San Diego
in which he also injured his back. ``The timing was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years, I've had a lot of downs. I guess it was my
turn to go through tribulations, just the course my life has taken,
because before that, my life had gone real smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam was a first-round draft pick of the Bears in 1995 after
rushing for 2,055 yards and 24 touchdowns his junior season at
Colorado, earning him the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He had an impressive rookie season, gaining 1,074 yards and 10
touchdowns despite missing four weeks of training camp because of a
contract holdout. But he also had fumbling problems that season.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he missed the first three games because of an
injured right knee and hamstring. ``I got hurt in the last
preseason game, but the Bears didn't give me a chance (to recover)
from that,'' he said. ``They wanted me out there. I came back too
quickly and was playing on one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the season, he reinjured his knee, and he finished with
only 496 yards and three scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the third game of the 1997 season, he suffered a broken leg.
A rod was put in the leg, and he was in a walking cast for 13
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded to the Miami Dolphins last off-season, thinking he
had a chance to rebuild his career. ``I was ecstatic,'' he said.
``I was joining a new team with (Coach)  &UR; Jimmy Johnson, who loves
to run the ball. I thought it was the perfect place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he failed his physical examination with the Dolphins, who
thought the broken leg made him too much of a health risk. He was
released by the Bears and was out of football last season.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, only 24, was ready to make his comeback until the car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a month ago, he was reading a magazine about NFL prospects
who visit training centers before the league's scouting combine to
enhance their draft status. One of those centers is run by  &UR; Warren
Anderson in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Salaam, 6 feet 1, 224 pounds. ``I work
out five days a week, four to five hours a day. I want to be
looking great by July 1 so I can go to (training) camp. I want to
go to Oakland. That's always been a dream of mine. I used to wear
nothing but Raiders gear. But I have to be honest: I'd go
anywhere.'' &QL; 
New favorites &QL; 
With Denver Broncos quarterback  &UR; John Elway retiring, the Minnesota
Vikings are the favorites among oddsmakers to win Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have been established as 4-1 favorites.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, many are picking the New York Jets, losers to Denver
in last year's AFC title game. The Jets led the Broncos, 10-0,
early in the third quarter of that game, but Elway ralled his team
to a 23-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jets quarterback  &UR; Vinny Testaverde says, ``I like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells hasn't jumped on the title bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be an easy task for us,'' Parcells said.
``I don't care about perceptions. I learned a long time ago that
last year's performance isn't an indication of this year's
performance. (The balance of power) changes every year. Things do
change. The landscape changes regardless of whether John (Elway)
plays. I think this does give other teams a chance, but it will be
very competitive.'' &QL; 
Next in line? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback  &UR; Dan Marino, the last member of the 1983
quarterback class, isn't planning to join Elway in retirement soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that (retirement) enters your mind sometimes,
but I feel pretty good about what I'm doing,'' Marino said. ``If I
was on a team that I didn't think had a chance to win, then maybe I
would think about it a lot more seriously. But right now I feel
good. I'm throwing the ball great. I don't see any reason to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, one of six quarterbacks taken in the first round in '83,
said it's hard to believe Elway won't be playing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kind of had a feeling after winning two championships in
a row, it probably would be time for him to spend more time with
his family,'' Marino said. ``He's a close friend. He's been a
friend for a long time, and I admire him as a person and also as
the great quarterback that he is. I think we'll all miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino still thinks the Broncos, back-to-back Super Bowl
champions, can win the crown with Elway gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver's got a real good team, and until someone beats them,
they're the world champions,'' Marino said. ``I think we're getting
better, though. We're going to have a chance, a real chance. I'm
looking forward to it. I really am.'' &QL; 
Off color &QL; 
Baltimore Ravens executive  &UR; David Modell, son of owner  &UR; Art Modell,
didn't appreciate former Ravens offensive tackle  &UR; Orlando Brown
saying recently that he hated wearing the team's purple uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brown signed with Cleveland, Baltimore's big rival and former
home of the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my butt was that big, I wouldn't like wearing purple
either,'' Modell said. &QL; 
Dollar signs &QL; 
The Green Bay Packers, the NFL's only publicly owned team, are
thinking of charging the 47,000 people on their season ticket
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Each would be charged $20, earning the club about $940,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are the only other team to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about doing it because other clubs have done
it,'' Packers President  &UR; Bob Harlan said. ``The reason they do it
is to find out if the waiting list is really legitimate or if it's
watered down. You always wonder: Are there truly 47,000 people, or
is that misleading?'' &QL;

VERSATILITY PUTS DUNCAN AT MVP LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the regular season winding down and the playoffs set to
begin Saturday, here's one man's ballot for the NBA's annual
awards: &QL; 
Most Valuable Player &QL; 
Leading candidates: Utah's  &UR; Karl Malone, Miami's  &UR; Alonzo Mourning,
the Suns'  &UR; Jason Kidd, Seattle's  &UR; Gary Payton, San Antonio's  &UR; Tim
Duncan and &UR; Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Malone probably is the favorite. His team looks to be headed for
the league's best record, and Malone ranks high among the league
leaders in scoring and rebounding. But Malone's scoring average
(23.7) is his lowest since 1986-87, and his rebounding average
(9.3) is his lowest since 1985-86, his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, however, will get a lot of votes in the East. He's not
far from Malone in scoring and rebounding and has far greater
impact on the defensive end. His team could emerge with the best
record in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is having his best season as a pro and, with seven
triple-doubles, is going to get a lot of votes. He would get this
one, too, if the Suns had won 30 games or more. Winning has to be
part of the equation. Some, including ESPN.com expert Kevin
Loughery, have endorsed Kidd despite his club's record.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has a similar problem. His team's record is even worse,
and his tirade in the locker room after another loss this week will
cost him votes. O'Neal carried the Lakers early and showed signs of
exerting himself as a leader. But the Lakers have slipped, and so
have his chances.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs overcame a very slow start to make a run at the
league's best record. Duncan, like Malone, is among the scoring and
rebounding leaders. He's also a candidate for the All-Defensive
team who is high on the list of shot blockers, and he shoots a high
percentage. Mourning is a close second, followed by Kidd, Malone
and Payton. &QL; 
Coach of the Year &QL; 
Leading candidates: Utah's  &UR; Jerry Sloan, Miami's  &UR; Pat Riley,
Toronto's &UR; Butch Carter, Portland's  &UR; Mike Dunleavy, Philadelphia's
 &UR; Larry Brown, Charlotte's  &UR; Paul Silas and Orlando's  &UR; Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations always hurt Sloan and Riley in these contests. The
award almost always goes to a team that overachieves, in which case
Brown and Carter will get a lot of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Daly also will benefit from taking a team that was considered a
playoff club but not a championship contender and making a run for
the Eastern Conference's best record.
</P>
<P>
   Silas did a terrific job as an interim, turning his club around
after a 4-11 start and the resignation of  &UR; Dave Cowens. But Silas
also benefited from the trade that sent  &UR; Eddie Jones and  &UR; Elden
Campbell from the Lakers to the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   How he managed to keep all of those egos _ especially  &UR; Isaiah
Rider's _ going in the same direction is a mystery. Virtually
everybody expected the Blazers to come back to reality after a
torrid start, but they never did.
</P>
<P>
   And Dunleavy won a lot of games by playing veteran  &UR; Greg Anthony
at the point during fourth quarters instead of the club's highly
paid star,  &UR; Damon Stoudamire, who had suffered through a bad
shooting season. &QL; 
Rookie of the Year &QL; 
Leading candidates:  &UR; Vince Carter of Toronto,  &UR; Jason Williams of
Sacramento,  &UR; Paul Pierce of Boston and  &UR; Mike Bibby of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   This looked like a wide open contest at the start of the season.
Pierce had a terrific first month in Boston. Williams was a regular
on the highlights in Sacramento and Carter was wowing fans in
Toronto. Denver's  &UR; Raef LaFrentz was right in it, too, until a
season-ending knee injury. Bibby got better as the season
progressed, but his team didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Carter, who ran away with this contest in the
season's second half. &QL; 
Defensive Player of Year &QL; 
Leading candidates: Seattle's Payton, Atlanta's  &UR; Dikembe Mutombo,
Miami's Mourning and the Suns'  &UR; Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson probably won't get as many votes as he deserves,
although he should end up on one of the league's All-Defensive
teams. He guarded point guards to centers and did it well. He
finished among the league leaders in steals and led the club in
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Payton will get a lot of votes but didn't have anywhere near his
usual season. Mutombo is another who will get as many votes from
reputation as achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   He anchored the league's best defensive team and was averaging
more than four shot blocks a game. For perspective, 7-foot-6
Mavericks center  &UR; Shawn Bradley was a distant second with 3.2
blocks a game. &QL; 
Sixth Man award &QL; 
Leading candidates:  &UR; Darrell Armstrong of Orlando,  &UR; Jalen Rose of
Indiana and  &UR; Rasheed Wallace of Portland. &QL; 
Wallace gets some credit for volunteering to come off the bench on
a talent-laden roster. Rose had a solid year that went largely
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Armstrong, even though he started most of the
season's second half. Any player who came off the bench more than
he started is eligible. &QL; 
Most Improved Player &QL; 
Leading candidates: Utah's  &UR; Bryon Russell, Orlando's Armstrong,
Philadelphia's  &UR; Allen Iverson, Milwaukee's  &UR; Haywoode Workman and
Minnesota's  &UR; Joe Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this award finds its way into the hands of a player
who has simply gotten more of an opportunity than in the past.
Armstrong fits that category and is the favorite to win it. Iverson
and Smith are the opposite. They came into the league as starters
but have had to grow into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The vote goes to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   All-NBA teams &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First team: Kidd and Payton at guard; Mourning at center; Malone
and Duncan at forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Second team: Iverson and  &UR; Penny Hardaway of Orlando at guards;
O'Neal at center;  &UR; Antonio McDyess and  &UR; Kevin Garnett at forward.
</P>
<P>
   Third team:  &UR; Tim Hardaway of Miami and  &UR; John Stockton of Utah at
guards;  &UR; Hakeem Olajuwon at center;  &UR; Shareef Abdur-Rahim and
 &UR; Grant Hill at forwards. &QL;

SULLIVAN LIKELY TO PLAY; BRIERE, WAITE RECALLED FROM MINORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Defensive specialist  &UR; Mike Sullivan likely will be
in the lineup today when the Coyotes meet the St. Louis Blues in
Game 6 of their Western Conference first-round series. But
second-line left wing  &UR; Greg Adams' availability won't be decided
until game time.
</P>
<P>
   As insurance, the team recalled forwards  &UR; Daniel Briere and
 &UR; Tavis Hansen from Springfield of the American Hockey League, along
with goalie  &UR; Jimmy Waite, after the Falcons were knocked out of the
playoffs by Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan got hit in the leg with a slap shot from Blues
defenseman  &UR; Al MacInnis in the third period of Friday's 2-1
overtime loss to the Blues in Game 5. He left the game but returned
and didn't miss a shift. Earlier this season, a MacInnis shot broke
one of Sullivan's big toes.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has missed three games in the series, which Phoenix leads,
3-2, because of a pulled groin muscle he suffered late in Game 1.
He came back and scored one of the Coyotes' two goals during their
2-1 victory in Game 4, but the injury flared up and he missed Game
5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how it is because it doesn't hurt me just
sitting around,'' Adams said. ``It's more when I'm exerting myself.
I don't know if I'll test it in the morning or not. I've got to
talk to our trainer and the doctors first.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Adams play if this was Game 7? He'd probably try, but the
team wants to be careful about a possible long-term problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of factors you take into consideration,'' Adams
said. ``I've got to sit down with them and find out exactly what's
at risk and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said there's a small chance
either Briere or Hansen could see action today. He added that the
call-up of Waite, whom the Coyotes gave up on when he struggled to
an 0-5-2 mark after a torrid 6-0-2 start, is simply an insurance
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to have a third goalie, eh?'' Smith said. ``If  &UR; (Nikolai)
 &UR; Khabibulin gets hurt (today), you've got  &UR; (Mikhail) Shtalenkov in
net and no backup.'' &QL; 
Melting ice time &QL; 
After averaging more than 20 minutes per game in the first four
games, defenseman  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky played only 7:01 Friday night.
The biggest reason for that was that Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld moved
him to a wing position with the return of blue liner  &UR; Gerald Diduck
from a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Playing mostly on the fourth line, Tverdovsky recorded no shots
and seldom left the bench after the second period. He is a plus 3
in the series, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if (playing wing) is what I have to do, if the coaches
see me there, that's all there is to it,'' said Tverdovsky, who has
shyed away from changing positions in the past. ``I'll do whatever
it takes.'' &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
As bad as the Phoenix power play has looked at times in the series,
the unit has produced one man-advantage goal in each of the past
four games. The Coyotes were on the power play early in overtime
Friday but couldn't connect for the 29th time in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rick Tocchet, who scored 26 goals during the regular season,
has taken seven shots but has no goals in the series. &QL;

YOUNG PICKED GOOD TIME FOR 1ST GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _  &UR; Scott Young's first job involved working with
explosives, so it was fitting that the St. Louis right wing was the
one creating the fireworks in Game 5 of the playoff series against
the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Young took  &UR; Chris Pronger's lead pass on the right wing and
fired a wrist shot over  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin's glove hand 5:43 into
overtime Friday night. It kept the Blues alive in the postseason
and moved the series to St. Louis for Game 6 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw it and went after it,'' Young said. ``It was just
reaction. I went as hard as I could toward the puck and took a hard
shot, and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Young's first goal in the playoffs and one that his
teammates said afterward that they sensed was coming. In four
regular season games against the Coyotes, Young posted two goals
and two assists. He finished the regular season third on the team
in goals with 24. He was due.
</P>
<P>
   The way he did it, with a rocket of a wrist shot, was vintage
Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect shot,'' Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said.
``He is one of the few guys who could take a wrist shot like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said, ``I'm just glad it went in. I guess it was a good
time to get the first (playoff goal).'' &QL; 
History matters &QL; 
Five Blues players have a combined 10 Stanley Cup rings, and if you
look at who owns them, it says something about the benefit of
championship experience.
</P>
<P>
   Five belong to goalie  &UR; Grant Fuhr, who secured all of them
during his career with the Edmonton Oilers. With the exception of
Game 3, when the Coyotes scored five goals on him, the 35-year-old
Fuhr has been a key factor in keeping these games close.
</P>
<P>
   Young won titles with Pittsburgh in 1991 and Colorado in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Al MacInnis, the most dominating player in this
series with three goals and six assists, was a member of the
1988-89 Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames and was the leading
scorer during those playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Wing  &UR; Geoff Courtnall, who has three points in this series,
played for the champion Oilers in 1988, and defenseman  &UR; Chris
McAlpine's first NHL season was with the 1995 Stanley Cup champion
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience is always going to help,'' said Blues Coach
 &UR; Joel
 &UR; Quenneville, who won a ring as an assistant with Colorado. ``And
those things will reveal themselves in positive ways.'' &QL; 
Turning point &QL; 
There were several key moments in Friday's game, but Quenneville
said the biggest came in the third period, when Fuhr made a key
stop on a &UR; Keith Tkachuk breakaway. It was't much later that
MacInnis scored his score-tying goal on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me was the turning point,'' Quenneville said. ``It was
a big play by Grant. I thought the first two periods weren't great,
but I thought the third period we played like we wanted to win. We
seemed to play our best when the game was on the line.'' &QL;

WHITEOUT: SOMETHING JUST ISN'T WORKING HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - The Whiteout in Phoenix is pretty cool. Pretty to
look at.
</P>
<P>
   And pretty much a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Whiteout is no longer intimidating. Not when the
home team wins four times in nine playoff starts at America West
Arena. Not when the Coyotes have gone 2-5 since uncorking the
tradition with a pair of victories against the Mighty Ducks. Not
when the building is 0-2 in potentially series-clinching games.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Grant Fuhr says it actually helps him see the puck.
</P>
<P>
   For a visual blizzard, the Whiteout is a big-time dud, yielding
results better suited for its cousin, the correctional fluid.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the reason for the lack of home ice advantage,
especially with all the attention given to the pomp and
circumstance?
</P>
<P>
   And just who are you, Arizona sports fan?
</P>
<P>
   You might not want to hear this, but you are becoming a national
curiosity. Across the country, people noticed that Randy Johnson
pitched before a sparse house in his first start at BOB. People
heard about Thom Brennaman's public scolding of Diamondbacks fans
during a recent telecast, a night when Brennaman was distraught
over fans leaving in the seventh inning of a nip-and-tuck affair.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be a big-time city, he said, you stay until the
end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be a big-time city, he said, you'd better start
acting like one.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is any great news flash. The Suns following is a
running joke in this city, a muted gaggle of gray-haired geese. The
Cardinals can't sell out Sun Devil Stadium unless they're in the
closing weeks of a playoff chase. Wells Fargo Arena is a morgue.
</P>
<P>
   And now it appears _ I can't believe I'm typing this _ that
every following needs a crash course in fanaticism from the
Rattlers backers and Mercury militia.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Whiteout isn't loud. Rather, it underachieves.
It isn't rabid. It doesn't blow the roof off the building. It's not
what it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this might be a case of what comes first. Too often,
the Coyotes fall behind at home in a playoff game. Too often, they
fail to jump on an opponent. Too often, they take their own crowd
out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying this: On Friday night, there were
instances where the crowd could've been the lift the hockey team
needed. It could've been the sixth skater. And it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Nikolai Khabibulin was pitching a shutout
and strung together an array of outstanding saves. A genuine hockey
town would've given a standing ovation after any one of those. In
overtime, the crowd was silent with dread. The crowd does fine with
scoreboard prompts, but not so well on instinct and initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dilemma you might want to ponder if the Coyotes get
pummeled by the Blues this afternoon and come home with their tails
between their legs, forced to win Game 7 at home or watch the
entire organization blow up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's understood that on occasion, they fill you with
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Take the power play, please. It's so awful that people are
wondering why the coach can't fix it, and on Friday, it hit a new
low. The guys playing catch on the point were as far apart as they
could be, and the passes literally took seconds to arrive at the
other stick. The spacing was ridiculous, and let's hope it didn't
look that way on the Schoenfeld drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is, the owner is wondering about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a few Coyotes need to step up. Rick Tocchet is playing
like a warrior, but he is not looking like a premier player. For
the most part, this is not his fault. His line has been
unpredictable. Greg Adams has been injured. Robert Reichel has been
invisible, living up to his playoff reputation. And down below, Bob
Corkum has been winning faceoffs, but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Whiteout isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Next time it is called the most intimidating spectacle in
hockey, feel free to laugh. Or better yet, look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Have they let you down once too often?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the other way around? &QL;

DOVE SEASON PERFECTLY FINE AS IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Just when things are running smoothly, someone always
thinks they could be better.
</P>
<P>
   This year's dove season is one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Game and Fish Commission instructed department
biologists to analyze possibilities for changing the season,
including full-day hunts in the second half of the first season.
Currently, the entire two weeks of the early season is composed of
half-day hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Tice Supplee, chief of the Game Branch, warned commissioners
that full-day hunts in the early season could result in an
additional dove harvest that could have an adverse effect in a
number of areas, including seasons in later years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the dove population in Arizona was declining,
causing fewer hunters. Half-day hunts were instituted in 1989 to
spread the kill. After 10 years of half-day seasons, the dove and
hunter numbers have increased.
</P>
<P>
   States with full-day hunts in the early season are experiencing
dove population declines and may face restructuring their seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since doves are migratory birds, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service sets the framework for dove seasons. The states develop
their seasons under that framework.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Shroufe, department director, told commissioners that a
decline of dove populations in this state for whatever reason could
cause Fish and Wildlife to restrict Arizona's options.
</P>
<P>
   Supplee said the numbers of dove hunters in the late '80s was
declining about 10,000 a year. The low was 48,000 in '88. After the
half-day regulation became effective in '89 and more doves were
available, she said, hunter numbers grew, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the number of hunters afield rose to 56,000. The dove
harvest in 1989 was about 570,000 mourning doves during the early
season but rose to more than 870,000 in 1996. The figure went from
170,000 in the second season of '89 to 610,000 in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Supplee said, ``is that what Arizona
implements as a dove season structure will impact Arizona's dove
population and dove hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the direction of the commission, biologists cameup
with alternatives for the commission to review in June:
</P>
<P>
   Creating a juniors-only afternoon dove hunt statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Instituting afternoon-only hunts in specific units and areas
under a permit-like system.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing all-day hunts in Pinal County.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring the early dove hunt statewide and allowing
half-day hunts during the first week of the season and full-day
during the second week.
</P>
<P>
   Junior hunters would be allowed to hunt doves in the mornings
under regular regulations. Then they could hunt the rest of the day
on the juniors-only provision.
</P>
<P>
   That way, they could hunt after school with parental
supervision. Supplee said that wouldn't likely decrease the
populations of doves by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission obviously is attempting to raise recreational
opportunities for hunters while raising more revenue for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   The juniors-only rule may be OK. Who can resist a kid? But this
juniors-only hunting stuff is beginning to reach levels of
diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of hunters who made use of afternoon hunts in the
first season was low (about 20 percent). But that would mean a
substantial loss of doves that wouldn't have been taken with
morning-only hunts. Besides, there was no way to regulate hunter
activities in the afternoon. Then, too, research on these
alternatives would cost about $200,000 a year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The old bromide, ``if it works, don't fix it,'' is completely
applicable.
</P>
<P>
   Why tweak something that's working well? Dove numbers have
increased, and so have dove hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Just leave a good thing alone. &QL;

PINCH-HITTING IRKS JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Diamondbacks ace  &UR; Randy Johnson will spend extra
time in the batting cage, so he can finish the job on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The big left-hander said he was disappointed Friday after being
lifted in the eighth inning for a pinch-hitter with the bases
loaded and two outs and the score tied at 2 against the Milwaukee
Brewers at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson left the clubhouse without talking to reporters. It was
his second straight strong effort, but a second straight
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like ages since I got a win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When told it's only been a couple starts, Johnson repeated, ``It
feels like ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Saturday he wanted to talk to Manager  &UR; Buck
Showalter about the disappointment he felt of coming out for a
pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've got to get used to in this league,'' said
Johnson, who spent most of his career in the American League, where
a pitcher doesn't have to worry about coming out because he's not
producing at the plate. ``If I can help myself by hitting or
bunting, I'm out there still.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 0 for 17.  &UR; Hanley Frias came in to hit for Johnson
and flied out. The Diamondbacks still won, 3-2, with a run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he didn't like getting pinch-hit for, ``but that's
just me and my competitive nature, not wanting to come out of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want him any other way,'' Showalter said. ``Any
time you take Randy out of the game, it's tough. You have a better
chance winning a game with him pitching.'' &QL; 
Against odds &QL; 
With the Diamondbacks' facing left-handers the past few days,
left-handed hitting outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez put his franchise
record 14-game hit streak on hold the past two games. He was back
in the lineup Saturday against a left-hander,  &UR; Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is I don't want Gonzo to sit around for four
days,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who came in with a team-high .391 batting average, has
been platooning with  &UR; Bernard Gilkey, a right-handed hitter.
Showalter doesn't feel locked into that mind-set, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are very capable of hitting left- and right-handed
pitchers,'' Showalter said. &QL; 
Rooter buses &QL; 
Catcher  &UR; Damian Miller said he anticipated about 200 family members
and friends to arrive in ``bus loads'' for Saturday's game. Miller
grew up on the west side of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bona fide cheesehead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tried to leave 12 tickets just for family Friday, but it
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came early and already bought them,'' he said. &QL; 
Snake bits &QL; 
Right fielder  &UR; Tony Womack was a last-minute scratch from the
lineup Saturday. With an afternoon game and no clouds, Showalter
hinted that the sun could pose a problem for Womack, who, as he
says, is still learning on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks either set or tied 42 team records through the
first 24 games. &QL;

Rockets try to focus on here and now to get on track
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Hakeem Olajuwon has a suggestion, perhaps even a solution. But it
does not involve improving defense, or changing the offense. It's
not really about problems or such details, or what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   OlajuwonIt is, in fact, about nothing. Forget the playoffs, he
said. Forget the Lakers and home-court advantage. At this point,
after losses in five of the Rockets' past six games, he said their
only means to make the long climb back is moment by moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we can think about now,'' Olajuwon said. ``The next
game, the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to argue. If the Rockets sent themselves
into this slide at the most inopportune time, just three
regular-season games before the start of the playoffs, with their
inability to prepare for the games considered beneath them, it
would seem no game is beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   This must include tonight's game against the Clippers, one of
the teams to have taken a win against the Rockets since the
collapse began. The way things are, there is little reason to
consider the playoffs such a happy thought to spend time thinking
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is keep playing,'' Charles Barkley said.
``Hopefully things will turn around. I'm always confident. I don't
think you want to go into the playoffs struggling. I want to finish
up strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will tell you the truth, but I will. We have played
terrible. That's it. We played hard. We don't play smart. There's a
difference between playing hard and playing smart. We're not
playing very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Games like tonight's derailed the Rockets. But if the loss in
Los Angeles and two home losses to the Mavericks were embarrassing,
Friday's defeat to the Jazz, without the explanation of a lack of
motivation, seemed to show how far the Rockets are from
playoff-ready.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems suddenly seem too numerous to consider a quick
refresher course on everything a solution at hand. The slide might
have begun with lackadaisical defense, but it has included poor
shooting and sloppy execution on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich laments the lack of execution in special
situations such as jump balls or last-second shots as a sign of
sporadic concentration. Barkley points toward inconsistent
production.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to fix everything, Tomjanovich considered
Olajuwon's proposal perhaps the best first step. He will address
the problems. But to get the concentration to where they can expect
to consistently improve in so many areas, Tomjanovich agreed a
renewed sense of urgency and immediacy might be needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is. Here's the now,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I'm out
here. I have to play against this guy on this play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about this deal is you have to get it done
now. While you're playing, this is it. This is why you get
trophies. Here's the play. Here it comes. I get it stopped. Or
here's the shot. Make it. That's why you get the trophies. It comes
down to basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the Rockets have been putting out one fire, only to
have to move on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make general statements (about what is wrong),''
Tomjanovich said. ``Early in the game (Friday's loss to the Jazz),
we came out frantic. We came down and flung up the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called timeout and let them know we didn't really come to
play. `We're not into the meat of the game. Let's trust each other.
Be a team.' And then we did. We played defense and tied the score.
Then we didn't play smart basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things have to be corrected to be good in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But before then the Rockets might have to play well tonight. If
each loss has sent them further from playoff form with the playoffs
fast approaching, a home loss to the Clippers would seem even more
devastating than even the losses that have brought the Rockets to
this point.
</P>
<P>
   But with a team meeting Friday and Saturday's practice, the
Rockets have at least decided they can turn their season back
around, unless they turn on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have to forget about everything and worry about
my own game,'' Barkley said. ``I know what I have to do and I have
to do it. I can't worry about everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody spends so much time worrying about everybody else,
nobody says, `You know what, I stink.' I'm willing to say it.
Nobody else around here is willing to say it. Coach addressed that.
Everybody always blames somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And since the Rockets still believe they can solve their
problems and become a playoff force despite the losses of the past
two weeks, they certainly would be ready to believe it should they
finish the season with wins over the Clippers, Timberwolves and
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy always says we have to stick together and believe as a
team,'' guard Brent Price said. ``The only way to get it back is to
start doing it on the court. We can talk about it, point to the
problems and try to change things, but until we start playing and
doing it on the court, it wouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't take long, either. A game or two to start doing it
on the court and everybody starts feeling it again. Definitely we
can turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   If that faith has not been lost by now, it might be unshakable _
if things change fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe,'' forward Scottie Pippen said. ``I think we
have what it takes with a whole-hearted effort. We have to have
everyone dedicated to this team to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be willing to do what it takes, whether it's diving
on the floor for a loose ball or taking a hard foul. We've got to
show we want this team to succeed. And if it all fails, then hey,
we gave it the best we had.''

TROUBLE IN THE NEST  
 ORIOLES TRADE ANGRY WORDS WITH MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mess keeps getting worse with each passing day in Baltimore
and no end seems in sight. Manager Ray Miller's team meeting to
clear the air on Tuesday lasted 35 minutes and turned into a
free-for-all in which manager, coaches and players all made
critical statements about each other.
</P>
<P>
   It came one day after Miller went into a post-game tirade
against the players while reporters were in his office. That night,
Miller severely bruised his hand by slamming his fist into a brick
wall. He then went on to rip the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was to unload my feelings and see what feelings I
got back,'' Miller said of the meeting. ``I certainly did not
apologize for what I said. It was about being accountable. I've got
to sit here every day and be accountable, and I'll do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also as a player, I think you have to do the same thing. We
had a very good meeting, a very responsible meeting. Everybody had
their say, and hopefully it will do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players agreed with Miller's assessment. Owner Peter
Angelos, who picked Miller as his manager after letting Davey
Johnson walk away, has remained silent on the matter. Rookie
General Manager Frank Wren wants to make a managerial change,
several sources said, but there is a question as to how well
Angelos and Wren are getting along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the mistakes that have been made so far are by the
players,'' Orioles designated hitter Harold Baines said in a rare
moment of expression from one of the quietest human beings on the
planet. ``But you don't single out any one player, and we haven't.
You lose as a team and you win as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray can only do so much. It's up to us. It starts with every
individual going out to do his best job, and being prepared for
each game. I'm not saying we weren't prepared, but when you're
losing, every little thing gets magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Angelos is simply waiting until after Monday's
exhibition game against Cuba to drop the hatchet on Miller, who has
gained respect by becoming so defiant in the wake of an obvious
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ownership that we have here knows he can do anything any
time he wants,'' Miller said. ``I expect him to. But as long as I'm
here, I expect to manage the club and do my job right. I'm not
happy about (our record), but if I'd had it, I wouldn't be here.
I'm certainly financially set. If I didn't want to be here, I
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   One other side note. Cal Ripken Jr.'s back condition has not
improved and he may be thinking about surgery. The 19-year veteran
needs 117 hits to reach 3,000, which is 162 more than Lou Gehrig
wound up with. Ripken has not ruled out retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still gathering information, so I can't even say what I'm
trying to decide,'' said Ripken, who must know by the All-Star
break whether the Orioles are picking up the $6.3 million option on
his 2000 season or buying it out for $2.5 million. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Name the pitcher with the lowest winning percentage in major league
history? Note: A minimum of 275 career decisions is needed to make
this list. &QL; 
Plenty of seats available &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in baseball are franchises suffering more at the gate
than in Oakland, Montreal and Chicago's south side, where the White
Sox have the worst average attendance of the 30 big league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are projected to draw fewer than 1.3 million fans
this season. This is a club that watched 2.6 million file into the
new Comiskey Park as recently as 1993. The plight of the White Sox
was evidenced last week, when a total of 36,471 watched three ames
against Detroit while the Cubs drew 39,265 for their Sunday game
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit bottom,'' White Sox vice president of marketing Rob
Gallas said. ``But I've been here 10 years and this is as positive
an atmosphere as I've seen (because of the young players). We look
at this as a process that's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Montreal, there is a strong belief that the Expos
are playing their final season in Canada, probably headed to
Washington, D.C., next year and eventually to a new stadium in
northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other coast in Oakland, a franchise that drew more than 2
million fans from 1988 to '93, is at a point where midweek crowds
are consistently under 10,000 and the players are getting angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sucks,'' Athletics first baseman Jason Giambi said. ``It's
kind of depressing. We're out here playing hard. And it's not like
we're a bad team. It's sad we can't get more people out here. This
team and this organization have done everything from commercials to
community service, every angle that you could possibly have to get
people in the seats. And it still doesn't work.'' &QL; 
Childish behavior &QL; 
Pittsburgh pitcher Jason Schmidt and outfielder Turner Ward could
find themselves in serious trouble if major league baseball
security director Kevin Hallinan is true to his word.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Hallinan said baseball ``will prosecute users of
laser pointers (because) those things are dangerous for fans and
players.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also dangerous for a photographer with a camera, which
is exactly where Schmidt and Ward had their pointers fixed during a
game, San Diego Padres team photographer Joel Zwink said.
</P>
<P>
   Zwink said the two Pirates had their lasers pointed directly
into his camera lens. The 44-year-old photographer experienced
blurry vision and immediately left the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still blurry,'' Zwink said days later. ``I saw Schmidt do
it. Others saw Ward. I just want to get my eyes straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who last year sent an e-mail bomb to a reporter that
dropped 500 pieces of junk mail in an electronic mailbox, and Ward
have refused to comment on the allegation. The National League has
not taken any action. One only wonders what the league would have
done if a fan were guilty of the same actions. &QL; 
Making it count &QL; 
Texas shortstop Royce Clayton not only talks the talk, but he also
walks the walk. Rather than simply prattle about what an important
person Jackie Robinson was, Clayton is backing it up with a
concrete move.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley resident donated $100,000 for an endowed scholarship
to the Jackie Robinson Foundation. A Chicago resident attending
Washington University in St. Louis is the first recipient of
Clayton's goodwill.

   ``This is what Jackie Robinson stood for,'' said Clayton, who is
no publicity-seeker and genuinely wants to help. ``He created an
opportunity for me. I feel it's an obligation for me to keep it
going. Hopefully, other (players) will follow. I'm sure my peers
will follow suit.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of today, it's a virtual dead heat between the former
Washington Senator Pedro Ramos and current Texas Ranger Mike
Morgan. Ramos was 117-160 during his career, giving him a winning
percentage of .42238. Morgan is 125-171 in his career, which
translates into a .42229 percentage and gives him the current
ranking of biggest loser in the game. Of course, a victory in
Morgan's next start will push Ramos back to the top _ or bottom,
depending on how it's viewed _ of this list. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
The new city of brotherly love: The Cleveland Indians were 8-0
entering the weekend when the Alomar brothers, Roberto and Sandy,
each had a hit in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Cub factor at work?: The last time the Chicago Cubs had
six pitchers on the disabled list at one time, they finished 23{
games out of first place in 1985, one season after they advanced to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback: Don Money.
</P>
<P>
   What did you expect, sugary marshmallows?: Baltimore right
fielder Albert Belle will begin marketing his own cereal flakes.
Coming with no surprise whatsoever, the flakes are plain. Just like
Belle himself, there will be no frills.
</P>
<P>
   He can't be slipping this much this quickly, can he?: Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel, a six-time Gold Glove winner, already has
committed five errors, the same number he had in 151 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of staying put for a while?: For the first time in the 14
seasons Toronto's Jim Fregosi has been a major league manager, he
is not renting and has purchased a home in the city in which he
works. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Brian Bohanon, acquired as a free agent over the winter, is the
first Colorado Rockies pitcher to start a season with a 4-0 record.
Bohanon and Darryl Kile were the only Rockies starters to have a
victory entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Harold Baines was a designated hitter for the
1,428th game in his career Friday night, surpassing Hal McRae for
the major league record. Even at 40, Baines is batting near .300.
</P>
<P>
   Florida reliever Archie Corbin managed to etch his way into the
record book when he became the 30th pitcher to have four strikeouts
in one inning. Corbin had the chance for a fourth strikeout after
Cubs catcher Tyler Houston reached base after swinging at a wild
pitch on a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's trade between Cleveland and San Francisco that
netted the Giants reliever Jerry Spradlin, it can be noted that San
Francisco has traded with Cleveland for six relievers in the past
four years. The others: Julian Tavarez, Joe Roa, Jose Mesa, Jim
Poole, and Al Morman. Also, the Giants have Alan Embree, another
former Indians reliever, whom they acquired from the Diamondbacks
over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon's consecutive games streak,
which was in jeopardy because of his wife's impending birth of
twins, remains intact after she delivered the boy and girl during a
day off last week. Entering Saturday's game, Damon had played in
180 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins trailed in 54 consecutive innings before
Torii Hunter belted a grand slam in the fourth inning of Monday's
victory over Boston. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Diamondbacks are not that interested in trading Brian Anderson.
Several general managers who have inquired about Anderson have been
told the price is high because Arizona is holding on to Anderson as
insurance against Armando Reynoso, who struggled badly in his last
outing and twice has been moved in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Brian Hunter has been traded to Seattle, Detroit
Manager Larry Parrish is strongly considering moving right fielder
Bobby Higginson into the leadoff spot. The only time Higginson held
down the leadoff spot, in 1996, he hit .421 (53 for 126) with 13
home runs, 34 RBI and a .500 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's arrival in Seattle has created a problem in the
outfield that can only be solved by getting rid of one of the other
three on the roster _ Butch Huskey, John Mabry or Matt Mieske. Look
for one of those to be traded, released, waived or sold soon.
Hunter is the 63rd left fielder to play alongside Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is quietly shopping Tavarez. The Giants called
Anaheim last week and have made similar calls to a handful of other
clubs. Tavarez has lost his role as San Francisco's primary setup
man to closer Robb Nen.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Reggie Jefferson has returned from the disabled list
and Boston's $26 million investment, Jose Offerman, has moved to
second base, Jeff Frye is wondering what will become of him? Frye
is not above asking to be traded, a point he may make very soon.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets are looking to add a starting pitcher. The
addition of Rick Reed once his foot heals will force Mets Manager
Bobby Valentine to choose between Masato Yoshii and Allen Watson as
the fifth starter. Neither one excites the Mets very much. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandPlayed in front of its 300th consecutive home sellout.
 &QL; 
2. NY YankeesJoe Torre is on his way back and the Yanks couldn't be
playing better.  &QL; 
3. San FranciscoEntered the weekend with an 8-4 record since Barry
Bonds' injury.  &QL; 
4. AtlantaHas won three when trailing in the ninth; had two such
wins last year.  &QL; 
5. HoustonShowed D-Backs they still have a ways to go before

6. NY MetsWithout question, the best bullpen in baseball.  &QL; 
7. TexasStill trying to catch up to its nemesis, the Yankees.  &QL; 
8. St. LouisDid not lose consecutive games until Wednesday and
Thursday.  &QL; 
9. Los AngelesRaul Mondesi is in a fit about being dropped in the
lineup. BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. BaltimoreWhatever happened to the Oriole Way of pitching and
defense?  &QL; 
29. FloridaEntered the weekend without posting back-to-back wins
this season.  &QL; 
28. MontrealThe 2-11 start at home is the worst in the franchise's
31-year history.  &QL; 
27. OaklandIf a game is lost but no one shows up to watch, did the
A's really lose?  &QL; 
26. MinnesotaRookie pitchers are finding life is not so easy in the
majors.  &QL; 
25. Kansas CityPitcher Kevin Appier is grumbling louder about
wanting out.  &QL; 
24. MilwaukeeSlumping Marquis Grissom was dropped from No. 2 to No.
6 in lineup.  &QL; 
23. DetroitIs center fielder Gabe Kapler the next budding
superstar?  &QL; 
22. San DiegoLost a ninth-inning lead for the first time since July
1996. ON THE RISE &QL; 
Chicago White Sox: These White Sox seem intent on showing they are
not the dregs they are supposed to be, at least not at this stage
of the season. Rookie pitcher John Snyder has a 1.88 ERA and young
outfielder Magglio Ordonez seems to be living up to the advance
billing he received two years ago. Leading the early resurgence is
Frank Thomas, who not only was batting .381 before this weekend's
series at Anaheim but also seemed reinvigorated with what's going
on. ``This a young club now, but I'm having fun with these guys.
I've been on a lot better teams talentwise. Twenty games do not
make a season, but I think we've got something going.'' &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
Boston Red Sox: After starting the season 6-1, the Red Sox have
been in an offensive funk that has led to a slide in the standings.
Boston entered the weekend series 5-9 since the hot start. The Red
Sox went through a skid of scoring two or fewer runs in seven of
eight games. Boston had only 15 home runs before the weekend
series, six of those came from Troy O'Leary. Without offense, all
that great pitching is going to waste. Winning two of three from
Cleveland was erased after losing two of three to Minnesota before
this weekend's series at Oakland. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
WSB-AM (Atlanta) radio engineer Dave Baker describing the
slow-footed Greg Maddux's first career triple in a game last
weekend: ``It replaced the Kentucky Derby as the most exciting two
minutes in sports.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
San Francisco rookie Joe Nathan has made quite an impression since
making his big league debut on April 21, a game in which he threw
seven scoreless innings in a 4-0 victory over Florida. ``Best debut
I've seen since Fernando (Valenzuela),'' Giants pitching coach Ron
Perranoski said. Nathan's name came up throughout spring training
when opposing managers were left scratching their heads wondering
where this kid with a 97-mph fastball came from. He is 2-0 with a
1.20 ERA in his first two starts. Nathan, who started only 33 minor
league games before his promotion, did not start pitching until
1997. ``I caught Kerry Wood's first outing,'' said former Cubs
catcher Scott Servais, now with the Giants, ``and obviously, Joe's
results were better than Kerry's.'' &QL;

   ANAHEIM _ Troy Percival pitching the ninth inning with a lead.
The Angels chances of extending their winning streak to four games
looked pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of preserving the victory for Chuck Finley on
Saturday night, Percival was rocked for two homers and five runs in
an 8-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox in front of 35,296 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, one of the game's premier closers, had not blown a
save opportunity this season, but his upper 90s velocity has been
down.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norton opened with ninth by pulling a 2-1 fastball into the
right field stands. Five batters later, Ray Durham drove a
three-run homer to right.
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak and Percival were done. The five runs were
the most he has allowed in one outing in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Percival spoiled Finley's performance, which at the time was the
game's highlight. But he went seven innings and gave the Angels the
kind of performance they'll need if they want to win the American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the team will hit, even without injured Jim
Edmonds for the next three months. But an erratic starting rotation
has been a trouble spot and Finley's 6.85 ERA coming in was part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago, he allowed eight hits and three runs as the
Angels were chasing White Sox starter James Baldwin (2-3).
Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched a scoreless eighth and began an
inning-ending double play after Durham bounced sharply back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Percival.
</P>
<P>
   During the feel-good portion of the game, Garret Anderson had
three hits and Randy Velarde had a home run and RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Troy Glaus had two hits and ignited a critical
two-run rally in the fifth against Baldwin. Glaus, who entered the
game with a .341 average, still has not gone more than one game
without a hit this season.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of production that led to back-to-back victories
over Toronto and a 3-1 win Friday night in the series opener
against the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, they jumped on White Sox starter James Baldwin
for 11 hits and chased him in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   They scored in the first on a Velarde's RBI, got another in the
third on his second home run of the year. Anderson, who had a
double and two singles, got the first of his two RBI in the fourth
and the Angels got rid Baldwin with two runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the White Sox effectiveness early this season has been
their success against left-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, they were 17-25 against left-handers, but entered
Saturday's game against Finley with six victories in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Baldwin spotted the Angels a 3-0 lead after four
innings, the White Sox got back in the game against Finley in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   He survived a 30-pitch first inning, but by the fifth Finley
wasn't very sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Jackson opened the fifth with a double into the
left-field corner on the first. A fly ball moved Jackson to third
and after Jeff Abbott walked, Brook Fordyce gave the White Sox
their first run with an infield out.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott took second on the play and scored on a single to left by
leadoff hitter Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got both runs back in the bottom of the fifth, but
Finley allowed a single to Mike Caruso to open the sixth. Two more
hits scored Caruso to cut the Angels lead to 5-3 and brought Angels
pitching coach Dick Pole to the mound.

LOPSIDED WIN CLINCHES PLAYOFF BERTH FOR SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns came to America West Arena Saturday night
looking to clinch their 11th consecutive playoff berth with a
victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   For most of three quarters, however, it appeared the only thing
clinched might be the Suns' throats by the team with the league's
worst record. In the end, though, it was the Grizzlies who were
throttled, 107-77.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns used a torrid 35-5 fourth-quarter blitz to bury the
Grizzlies and wrap up a playoff berth. With two games remaining,
including one tonight in Sacramento, the Suns could still finish
anywhere from sixth to eighth in the Western Conference race. And
whichever of those positions they finish in, they could play either
Utah, Portland or San Antonio in a five-game, first-round playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Suns Coach Danny Ainge said he would try to
win the last two games and finish sixth but also hoped to find some
rest for some of his key players _ particularly point guard Jason
Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have the No. 6 seed,'' Ainge said. ``We want to
play as well as we can in the last two, but at the same time, my
No. 1 priority is to make sure we're going to be healthy and fresh
_ but not rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said his regulars still would play substantial minutes,
but he would cut them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody to shoot me if Jason Kidd plays 45 minutes,''
Ainge said, then added, ``unless we're in a double-overtime or
something. I've got to cut myself a little slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge hopes to get Tom Gugliotta completely healthy from a sore
knee and calf, Luc Longley healed from a hyperextended knee, Rex
Chapman rested and healed from a fractured eye socket and _ most
important _ Kidd rested from sore knees and a sprained wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're going to try to win the last two games,''
said Gugliotta, who led the Suns with 24 points and 12 rebounds.
``Jason has been playing 48 minutes a game all season. Cliff
(Robinson) has been playing a lot of minutes. But we just need to
play better so nobody has to play 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. The Suns could have gotten a lot of rest Saturday
night had they played a lot more efficiently in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped out to a 19-10 lead, and maybe it just came too
easily. Because as quickly as the Suns built it, they let it slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim hit an 18-foot jump shot to
start a 12-2 Grizzlies run, and the game was on.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns sputtered in the second quarter and trailed at the
half, 42-40, despite shooting 54 percent while yielding just 41
percent shooting to the Grizzlies. The equalizer was 12 Phoenix
turnovers that led to 14 points for the Grizzlies and the halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies hung close through the third quarter and trailed
by only four points going to the fourth. But a team that loses 40
games in a 50-game season is never far from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And the Grizzlies went quietly into that good night, escorted by
Suns' sharpshooter George McCloud, who hit back-to-back three-point
shots to start the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm supposed to do, right?'' McCloud said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed the Phoenix lead to 10 points, and the Grizzlies
were convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened it up, went up by 10 and the more we opened it up,
you could just see with every shot we hit that they lost a little
more,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a nice way of saying the Grizzlies called it a night.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns outscored 35-5 before the reserves came off the bench
to finish off a 38-12 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And although it wasn't their best performance, there were things
to like about it.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman played with goggles to protect his injured eye, hated
them but scored 20 points on six of 11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awkward,'' Chapman said of the goggles. ``It seemed
like, peripherally, I couldn't see very well. And I threw a couple
of passes into the bleachers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloud scored 14 points off the bench, hitting three of seven
three-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   And Kidd had 14 points and 13 rebounds despite the sore wrist,
which was apparently injured in a fall at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough season for us,'' Kidd said. ``We're in the
playoffs now, but we can't come out and play these last two games
like it's spring break.''

NBA: MALONE MEANT NO HARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The blows have been delivered and the surgeons have
completed the stitching, but the words still flow like bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   Charge, countercharge and questions about the NBA's role remain
in the wake of a collision Monday night in which Utah forward Karl
Malone left Suns center Joe Kleine badly bloodied.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, NBA vice president of operations, said Saturday that
his office decided to take no action against Malone because there
was no evidence of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said he reviewed the tape several times and also spoke to
Malone and Kleine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malone had both hands on the ball and when he turned to shoot,
Joe was there,'' Thorn said at halftime of the Suns-Vancouver game
Saturday at America West Arena. ``Obviously, from Joe's standpoint,
he thought (Malone) led with his elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge said the NBA should have punished Malone,
who was shoved by Kleine as the Suns backup center left the floor
and headed for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty stitches were needed to sew together gaping wounds in the
face and mouth of Kleine, who has declined comment for the print
media. However, Kleine has ripped Malone on Phoenix radio shows.
Apparently, he doesn't want the printed word to reach Malone and
provide him with bulletin board motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge also said the NBA is practicing a double standard. Last
year, Malone was fined $5,000 for throwing an elbow that knocked
out Spurs center David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In the Robinson knockout, videotape clearly shows Malone
swinging his elbows from side to side. The same thing is not
evident in tapes of the Malone-Kleine incident.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was the league's Most Valuable Player in 1995. He's a
star; Kleine is a journeyman. If Malone had bloodied an established
star instead of Kleine on Monday, would the NBA have penalized him?
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said no.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NBA treats each incident independently. He pointed
out that New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing, also an acknowledged
star, was suspended for Game 7 of an Eastern Conference playoff
series against the Miami Heat two years ago. Ewing was involved in
a brawl in Game 5 of the series, which the Knicks lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might imagine, that was extremely controversial in New
York,'' said Thorn, who was at America West Arena to present the
Gold Whistle, an officiating award, to longtime NBA referee and
Phoenix native Tommy Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said he shares Ainge's concern about Malone's evident lack
of remorse for several collisions that have resulted in injuries to
opposing players. Suns center Luc Longley suffered a hyperextended
knee earlier this season. Several years ago, Eliott Perry, then a
Suns guard, was knocked unconscious by a Malone elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me, yes,'' Thorn said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the NBA has no rules prohibiting bad manners.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Malone ripped Ainge Friday night before a Utah
victory in Houston. He referred to an infamous moment in Ainge's
playing days in Boston when he was bitten by Atlanta's Wayne
``Tree'' Rollins. But Malone misplaced the bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I didn't bite anybody _ like him,'' Malone told the
``Salt Lake Tribune.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone went on to compare Ainge to beavers that populate creeks
near his home in Summerfield, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both use their teeth the same way _ to chew things up,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge countered with a reference to Sybil. A couple of days ago,
he said Malone was as undependable as the character with many
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was weak,'' Ainge said. ``Come on, Sybil.'' &QL;

POW'S MOTHER ANTICIPATES TEARFUL REUNION WITH SON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Updating with confirmation of release.) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hailing the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a hero, Vivian
Ramirez glowed with hope as she thanked Jackson for securing the
release of her son, Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, from his Serbian
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson announced Saturday that he had successfully brokered the
release of Ramirez, 24, of East Los Angeles, Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., who were captured a month ago
while patrolling the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jackson's announcement, the Pentagon confirmed that
the three POWs are expected to be released. At about 10:50 p.m.
Pacific Daylight Time the three men were released to Jackson by the
Serb government of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lifesaver,'' Vivian Ramirez said during a press
conference held outside the police headquarters in the eastern
suburb of Baldwin Park on Saturday afternoon. ``He will be my hero
when he brings my !italics!mijo!end italics! home and I thank
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez received a call at about noon Saturday from the U.S.
Army confirming Jackson's successful mission. Her ``little Andy''
was finally coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy now,'' said Ramirez, sporting a T-shirt
emblazoned with her son's image and pinned with a yellow ribbon.
``It seems like this time we're really going to go (to Germany).''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of Baldwin Park, spent the evening awaiting the green
light from the U.S. Army to fly to Germany where she planned to
reunite with her son at a military base. She was to be accompanied
by her son Steven Ramirez, a Los Angeles police detective, her
former husband, Andrew M. Ramirez, her daughter Nadine Ramirez, and
Nadine Ramirez's 5-month-old daughter, Vanessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we see him that's when it will really hit us,'' Nadine
Ramirez said as she cradled her daughter. ``Right now we're just
hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East Los Angeles neighborhood where Andrew Ramirez was
raised, a fresh wave of well-wishers sporting yellow ribbons showed
up throughout the morning with candles and letters to place outside
his home. Friends and relatives remained cautiously hopeful, but
thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable. We really can't express our happy
emotions,'' said Maria Rios, 39, a childhood friend of Andrew
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very uplifting, it was positive,'' said Robert Carcano,
who is Andrew Ramirez's second cousin. ``Until the official word
comes out, obviously there will be cause for celebration. I'm sure
there will be one heck of a block party.''
</P>
<P>
   The serviceman's father declined to comment but spent part of
Saturday on his front porch with his sisters and cousins arranging
yellow ribbons and POW buttons in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Andrew M. Ramirez) feels that until he receives official word
from the government that his son has been released into the arms of
the United States, then he'll be satisfied,'' said Carcano, 42, a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Vivian Ramirez said she would do when she saw
her son is cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hug him and I will not let go and tell him how much I
love him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she first heard of Jackson's breakthrough, Ramirez couldn't
believe it and said it didn't seem real until she received
confirmation from Maj. Don Dunne, an Army reservist based in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know that maybe it's definite,'' she said. ``I pray that
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said she hadn't planned to pack her bags until she
received word Saturday because she didn't want to get her hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have been depressed looking at my bag,'' she
said. ``Today I will pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the media frenzy that has surrounded the capture of the
three American soldiers, Ramirez said she didn't think her son
would view himself as a celebrity, describing him as shy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a home-cooked meal, the first thing she would
probably do for her son when he arrives home is take him to his
favorite fast-food hamburger joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite is In-N-Out. He'll say, Forget your dinner,'' she
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Though the past month has been filled with anguish, Ramirez said
she took each day one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw her son in a CNN-televised interview shown Friday
from Yugoslavia, Ramirez said she was encouraged. Her son looked
thinner but healthy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son wrote to each other in the past month. In a
letter she told him how his neighborhood was pulling for him, how
Los Angeles residents had strung yellow ribbons across the city,
how letters poured in from all over the world encouraging Vivian
Ramirez to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ramirez in turn told his mother that he was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's doing a lot of praying, (that) he misses us, he
loves us and he can hardly wait to come home and see us,'' Vivian
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Once her son returns, Ramirez said she was unsure what his plans
would be. Next May, Andrew Ramirez will have completed his
commitment to the army. He originally was supposed to serve two
years, but will have served a total of seven years in the army,
Vivian Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to him, he only has a few more months,'' she said,
adding that his goal is to join the Los Angeles Police Department.
``He wants to be an officer like his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Ramirez arrives home to Los Angeles he'll find the
messages of people like Sandra Dominguez nearby Downey who wrote a
special note for him and hand-delivered it to his father's home
Saturday by placing it under a candle outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home, Andy. So glad you're coming home. Our prayers
have been with you,'' read the letter, which Dominguez said she
wrote on behalf of her sister, a Navy reservist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit close to home when it happened,'' said Dominguez, 24,
accompanied by her parents, Armando and Rose Menchaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully they will all be coming home safe,'' Armando
Menchaca said. ``That's what we're all hoping will be the bottom
line.''

POW'S MOTHER ANTICIPATES TEARFUL REUNION WITH SON

(EDITORS: Updating with confirmation of release.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hailing the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a hero, Vivian
Ramirez glowed with hope as she thanked Jackson for securing the
release of her son, Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, from his Serbian
captors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson announced Saturday that he had successfully brokered the
release of Ramirez, 24, of East Los Angeles, Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., who were captured a month ago
while patrolling the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jackson's announcement, the Pentagon confirmed that
the three POWs are expected to be released. At about 10:50 p.m.
Pacific Daylight Time the three men were released to Jackson by the
Serb government of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lifesaver,'' Vivian Ramirez said during a press
conference held outside the police headquarters in the eastern
suburb of Baldwin Park on Saturday afternoon. ``He will be my hero
when he brings my !italics!mijo!end italics! home and I thank
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez received a call at about noon Saturday from the U.S.
Army confirming Jackson's successful mission. Her ``little Andy''
was finally coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy now,'' said Ramirez, sporting a T-shirt
emblazoned with her son's image and pinned with a yellow ribbon.
``It seems like this time we're really going to go (to Germany).''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of Baldwin Park, spent the evening awaiting the green
light from the U.S. Army to fly to Germany where she planned to
reunite with her son at a military base. She was to be accompanied
by her son Steven Ramirez, a Los Angeles police detective, her
former husband, Andrew M. Ramirez, her daughter Nadine Ramirez, and
Nadine Ramirez's 5-month-old daughter, Vanessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we see him that's when it will really hit us,'' Nadine
Ramirez said as she cradled her daughter. ``Right now we're just

PERCIVAL LETS ONE GET AWAY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Troy Percival pitching the ninth inning with a lead.
The Angels' chances of extending their winning streak to four games
looked pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of preserving the victory for Chuck Finley on
Saturday night, Percival was rocked for two homers and five runs in
an 8-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox in front of 35,296 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, one of the game's premier closers, had not blown a
save opportunity this season, but his 95-mph fastball has been
missing since opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no excuses,'' he said. ``I didn't put the ball where
I want it. I always want the ball in that spot. I want to be back
out there tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Percival's third game in four nights, Greg Norton opened the
ninth by pulling a 2-1 fastball into the right-field stands. Five
batters later, Ray Durham drove a three-run homer to right. The
winning streak and Percival were done. The five runs were the most
he has allowed in one outing in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this happens to every closer,'' manager Terry
Collins said. ``From the side where I sit, you can't tell what he
has. But he has been throwing great. He is our guy in that spot.
Once in a while it doesn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival, who earned a save in Friday's 3-1 victory over
Chicago, spoiled Finley's performance, which at the time was the
game's highlight. The left-hander went seven innings and gave the
Angels the kind of performance they'll need if they want to win the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted that game for Chuck,'' Collins said. ``He
missed most of spring training (tendinitis), but now he is rounding
into form. We wanted to go seven and he did that. We wanted about
110 pitches from him and we got that (106).''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the team will hit, even without injured Jim
Edmonds for the next three months. Even when Mo Vaughn goes 0 for 4
with two strikeouts as he did Saturday. But an erratic starting
rotation has been a trouble spot and Finley's 6.85 ERA coming in
was part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago, he allowed eight hits and three runs as the
Angels were chasing White Sox starter James Baldwin. Shigetoshi
Hasegawa pitched a scoreless eighth and began an inning-ending
double play after Durham bounced sharply back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was quick to point out the fly-ball single by Darrin
Jackson that Tim Salmon did not pick up in right. Pinch-hitter Jeff
Liefer also drove in a run with a broken-bat bloop-single to left.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no denying the ball Durham drove into the
right-field stands on an 0-1 count.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad pitch,'' Percival said. ``I have to make
that pitch, not put it right over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last six games, Durham has four home runs and 11 RBI. His
five RBI was a career high and made a winner out of David Lundquist
(1-0). Bob Howry pitched the ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the same pitch on the first one and I should have hit it
out then,'' Durham said. ``I was just trying to stay out of the
double play that would have ended the game.''
</P>
<P>
   During the feel-good portion of the game, Garret Anderson had
three hits and Randy Velarde had a home run and RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Troy Glaus had two hits and ignited a critical
two-run rally in the fifth against Baldwin. Glaus, who is batting
.345, had two doubles and still has not gone more than a game
without a hit this season.

 &HT;    Word 'Dayton' is reinvented yet again
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It seems like ever since war broke out between
NATO and Yugoslavia, the reputation of the Dayton Peace Accords has
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas once the word ``Dayton'' was most typically a positive
one in the context of international relations, it now often has a
negative vibe. Whereas once it was a symbol of peace and successful
diplomacy, now it is a symbol of failed hopes, of how not to do
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Repeat Dayton's Mistakes in Kosovo'' was the headline on
an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal. That complaint is from
the Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations, who _ in the last
paragraph of the piece _ embraces ``the spirit and letter'' of
``Dayton,'' but laments lack of enforcement of its provision for
resettlement of war refugees, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Other people worry that the United States is heading toward
another expensive, endless commitment in Kosovo just like the one
in Bosnia resulting from ``Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   And some (including the Bosnian ambassador), complain that
``Dayton'' legitimized the rule of Yugoslavian president/war
criminal Slobodan Milosevic by allowing him to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Still others complain that ``Dayton'' is a failure because the
people of Bosnia have not really reconciled; bitter divisions
prevail, along with political instability. Critics say this
situation should not be called peace.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's another group _ apolitical people who can't cite
any of the specifics of ``Dayton'' _ for whom the word represents
failure because it was supposed to have resolved the problems of
the former Yugoslavia, and yet here we are.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is pretty strange. After all, the Dayton peace talks
were (ITAL) not (END ITAL) supposed to solve the problems of the
former Yugoslavia. The talks were limited to Bosnia; the accords
never mention Kosovo. Everybody at the talks knew the Kosovo issue
was looming.
</P>
<P>
   But just bringing peace to Bosnia seemed a mightily ambitious
undertaking at the time. It was a three-sided war that had gone on
for years without a winner. Each side was claiming territory deep
within territories generally held by another side. Myriad peace
initiatives had flopped miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Yet peace, defined as an end to the fighting (a pretty good
definition), was achieved. And it has been sustained. To point out
that the animosities still prevail is to make all the more clear
what a remarkable achievement ``Dayton'' was. What would be the big
deal about making peace where brotherly love prevails?
</P>
<P>
   As for President Milosevic, what was the alternative to dealing
with him? The leaders of the Bosnian Serbs _ that is, the leaders
of the Serb side within Bosnia _ were formally indicted war
criminals. And, anyway, he was essentially their boss. How peace
would have been achieved without him is hard to see.
</P>
<P>
   As for the expense to the West of keeping the peace, it is not
oppressive. The United States has about 8,000 troops there. It used
to have 300,000 in Germany; 50,000 in Korea. For decades.
</P>
<P>
   The community of Dayton has a certain interest in ``Dayton's''
standing in the world. Obviously, being part of the international
vocabulary for good is better than being part of it for bad
(Munich).
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of any of the 2 million people of Kosovo is more
important than the aura surrounding the word ``Dayton.'' What's
important about the currently fashionable bashing of ``Dayton'' is
this: If, somehow, achieving an unlikely peace through tough
negotiations and the commitment of an affordable number of
peacekeeping troops has become a bad thing because the negotiations
left problems unsolved, the future of peace is not good.

 &HT;    Voucher support in Texas has spooky quality to it
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry is beyond the pale. A pet
project for which he yanked every chain appears to be dead and
beyond his incantation.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in mediums and channeling, maybe you can still
conjure a chance for school vouchers in this session. Anything's
possible. But it's very unlikely, and for a good reason: Genuine
support for vouchers, touted to be miles wide, proves to be less
than a thousandth of a milimeter thick. Indeed, it's so filmy as to
exist largely in a spirit world, in the specter of James Leininger.
</P>
<P>
   Leininger is the San Antonio physician who made millions
developing hospital beds and whose interests last year pumped
millions of dollars to candidates supporting vouchers, including a
$1 million loan to Perry for crucial ads in the closing days of his
neck-and-neck race with Democrat John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Leininger founded an organization that went right after a public
school district, Edgewood ISD in San Antonio, offering $4,000
vouchers to 13,000 students. Of those, 835 accepted and left.
(Forty-one later would return.) The rest said ``keep your money.''
</P>
<P>
   One Waco voucher supporter who's worked with Leininger asserts
that commentators have demonized a mild-mannered and decent man.
Voucher foes beg dispensation for angry words, pointing out that no
one has done more than Leininger and his mass mailings to demonize
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though vouchers appear dead this session, Leininger's money
walks the Capitol with the sound of clinking bones.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of an ethereal being, I do believe that's what Rick
Perry became when the issue of vouchers was raised on the campaign
trail. He wanted to downplay the subject, sort of like George Bush
and abortion. He said, ``I won't do anything to hurt public
schools,'' and then would shift the conversation to reading
teachers or some such.
</P>
<P>
   Perry didn't conceal his support for vouchers. He just slipped
on the soft shoes. Last week reports had Perry changing from soft
to steel-toed. A Senate coalition had the votes to prevent the
two-thirds support needed to bring Sen. Teel Bivins' voucher bill
to the floor. Bivins retreated from a pilot project involving the
state's six largest metropolitan school districts. He scaled it
down to involve two school districts chosen by the state education
commissioner. Opponents wouldn't budge. It wasn't the project's
size they opposed. It was vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy next shifted to an effort, reportedly led by Perry, to
attach a voucher amendment to the school funding bill, which
included pay raises for teachers. Would Senate voucher foes cave if
teacher pay was at stake? Absolutely not. Not only that, but the
state's two largest teachers associations said they'd prefer
spiking the pay-raise bill if it were contaminated by a voucher
pilot. The legisation was approved without a voucher amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Should we be amazed that an issue Perry soft-pedaled on the
campaign trail assumed hard-ball significance to him in office? No.
It was that way all along. That's why Leininger put his money on
the man. Perry knew the volatility of the school voucher issue and
didn't want to belabor it. He would settle the matter in the
confines of the Capitol, away from the glare of the people who
believe that vouchers would hurt public schools. Opposition also
formed among conservatives who didn't like the idea of religious
schools getting sucked into something with strings-attached
government money. The voucher movement also is undermined by better
test scores by low-achieving students, repudiating assertions that
public schools are beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   So we had groups such as the Texas PTA and League of Women
Voters dead-set against vouchers despite the tweak-and-tinker
crowd's battle cry, ``We just want to see if vouchers work.''
</P>
<P>
   This session shows support for vouchers to be ghostly
transparent, and now lawmakers know how deeply support runs for
public schools.

   DAYTON-ACCORDS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It seems like ever since war

Peace Accords has deteriorated. Whereas once the word ``Dayton''
was most typically a positive one in the context of international
relations, it now often has a negative vibe. Whereas once it was a
symbol of peace and successful diplomacy, now it is a symbol of
failed hopes, of how not to do things. (Dayton Daily News) MOVED

FRAUD CASE PUTS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER'S METHODS UNDER SCRUTINY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seymour M. Hersh, a relentless digger and
interrogator, has long been considered a premier investigative
reporter. His work on the My Lai massacre won him the Pulitzer
Prize in 1970 and was followed by newspaper, magazine and book
exposes on such subjects as Henry A. Kissinger, Richard M. Nixon
and the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hersh was called to testify as a government witness in
a recent criminal trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the
renowned journalist found himself facing stiff cross-examination by
a defense attorney determined to expose any contradiction in his
story. In three hours on the witness stand, Hersh fielded more than
500 questions about his dealings with the defendant, a man who had
claimed to have explosive documents about President John F.
Kennedy. Hersh's account became an intriguing subtext in the trial,
offering a glimpse into how one of the nation's most accomplished,
and at times controversial, reporters practices his craft.
</P>
<P>
   The man on trial was Lawrence X. Cusack III, 48, a former
paralegal who was convicted on Friday of defrauding more than 100
investors of about $7 million in a scheme to sell the documents. He
had said he found the material in the files of his late father, a
prominent lawyer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Cusack's documents were said to link Kennedy to Marilyn
Monroe and Sam Giancana, the legendary Chicago mobster, and that is
what had drawn Hersh to him.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, who first learned of the papers in 1994, saw them as
possibly laying the basis for his next big scoop, as big as My Lai,
he suggested in court. He said he immediately set out to obtain
their exclusive use for a book he was writing on Kennedy that was
ultimately published as ``The Dark Side of Camelot'' (Little,
Brown, 1997). His wooing of Cusack included a barrage of letters.
Hersh testified that he wanted ``first crack'' at making the
documents public.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters hungry for scoops romance sources all the time,
although they do not always leave paper trials as detailed as
Hersh's.
</P>
<P>
   In his letters, he flattered Cusack, cajoled him and implored
him _ all tried and true methods in journalism of getting people to
act for the journalist, whether it is in their interest or not.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Hersh, who worked for The
New York Times in the 1970s after winning the Pulitzer, defended
his approach in seeking access to the papers before he learned they
were fraudulent. ``Was I romancing them?'' he said. ``Yes. Should I
say otherwise? Of course I wanted those papers.'' But he added:
``Did I cross the boundary? I certainly don't think so. I don't
think I came close.''
</P>
<P>
   His first move was to fly to Atlanta, where he was shown copies
of the materials by an associate of Cusack's. According to a court
transcript of his testimony, one document that caught Hersh's eye
purported to be a contract between Kennedy and Monroe in which the
president agreed to pay the actress money for her silence about
their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said his reaction to the papers was ``gaga.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a tip, they were incredible,'' he said. ``It's like
somebody calling me up and saying, `I know about a mass murder in
Vietnam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh first met Cusack in April 1995, at Smith &AMP; Wollensky, the
steak house on Manhattan's East Side. There, he listened as Cusack
regaled him with childhood stories of seeing his father, Lawrence
X. Cusack Jr., leave for the Kennedy compound at Hyannisport,
Mass., with golf clubs or of his mother's chats with Rose Kennedy
about making sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack also indicated to Hersh that he had once served in
Vietnam, carrying out special operations.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate dance between reporter and source had begun,
although Hersh did not realize for more than a year that he was
being tricked, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   He began his letter-writing campaign immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marilyn contracts are obvious dynamite,'' he wrote on
April 14, 1995. So was another document, which supposedly linked
Kennedy to Giancana.
</P>
<P>
   Showing some fraternity, he added: ``We got along so well at
that dinner Tuesday night because, I like to think, we are all what
we seem to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Six letters followed over the next two months. Hersh promised to
write the truth and to use the papers ``accurately, fairly and
appropriately.'' He said he would not dishonor the memory of
Cusack's father, who, his research showed, was every bit as eminent
and distinguished as Cusack had told him.
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded Cusack that he would not buy access. ``We must
be holier than the pope _ and that means we cannot, simply cannot,
pay for any information,'' Hersh wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But he also pointed out that if Cusack allowed him to use the
materials as the basis for further reporting, he would be able to
put the papers into the proper historical context, which in turn
could lead to greater financial rewards for Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   Putting ``history before personal profit,'' Hersh wrote, would
``maximize the value of the papers and the value of your story in
finding them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called having your cake and eating it, too,'' Hersh
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   By early May, Cusack was still demurring, leaving Hersh
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sitting here, frankly, scratching at the door like a
Chihuahua trying to get in,'' he told the jury about his feelings
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack finally relented, Hersh said, giving him the access he
wanted. Then in a letter dated June 22, Hersh elaborated on his
plans for the papers.
</P>
<P>
   It was an assertion in that letter that became a source of
contention at the trial. The defense accused Hersh of crossing the
line of journalistic ethics by declaring to Cusack, who is known as
Lex, that he had been able to confirm that Cusack's father had
known Kennedy, based on an interview Hersh had had with Kennedy's
secretary, Evelyn Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I have independently confirmed not only the fact
of your father's relationship with the president'' through Ms.
Lincoln, he wrote, adding that he had also ``independently
confirmed some of the most interesting materials'' in Cusack's
father's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh later acknowledged in court that this was not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is where I absolutely misstated things,'' Hersh
testified. He explained that Ms. Lincoln had initially confirmed
knowing Cusack's father but later recanted that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrote this letter,'' Hersh testified, ``I selectively
recollected the good and didn't remember the bad.'' He added: ``I
simply misspoke to Cusack.''

Undated: misspoke to Cusack.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cusack's lawyer, Robert F. Katzberg, accused Hersh of misleading
Cusack, perhaps even lying to him. Even the prosecutor, Paul A.
Engelmayer, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury on Wednesday:
``Sure, Seymour Hersh played a little fast and loose with the
facts,'' but he added, ``None of this has anything to do with Lex
Cusack's guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said by phone after the verdict on Friday, ``There is
nothing in my testimony that would suggest I was playing fast and
loose with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked at the trial about the Lincoln statement, Hersh
denied that he had lied to Cusack but did admit to ``romancing
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a newspaper man,'' he told the jury. ``You go after
stories. That's a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   He also testified that he never intended to mislead Cusack: ``I
believe it's very important to be as straight as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of investigation, testimony showed, Hersh
and several associates working on an ABC documentary came to
question the papers' authenticity and Cusack's credibility. Their
doubts eventually helped lead to the unraveling of the fraud
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh testified, for example, that he had asked an informant in
the intelligence community to check ``the very secret covert files
of American government'' and that no evidence was found that Cusack
had ever served in the military or any classified job.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh never used the documents in his book. But in court, his
reporting techniques were thrown back at him. Cusack's lawyer,
Katzberg, practically scoffed to the jury as he cited Hersh's
explanation for why he had not lied to Cusack, only erred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a Pulitzer Prize for backtracking and eating
one's words,'' Katzberg said, ``I think he could add it to his
trophy chest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could those words be any clearer?'' Katzberg said, adding,
``Hersh is telling us in effect that he wrote these words with
disappearing ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said in the interview last week that Katzberg's tactics
did not surprise him. ``He's doing what lawyers do,'' Hersh said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he should have been more careful in his letter to
Cusack: ``There's absolutely no question that had I been careful I
would have said in that letter Evelyn Lincoln `at one time
initially said' instead of `said.'''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Engelmayer, who criticized Hersh in his
summation for his handling of the facts, nevertheless attached yet
a different meaning to the journalism debate that had occurred in
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Engelmayer, who himself spent about a year as a reporter for The
Wall Street Journal, told the jury: ``What the Seymour Hersh
episode does confirm for you is just how good a fraudster Lex
Cusack was in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a pretty good liar to fake out an investigative
reporter like Seymour Hersh,'' he said.

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Pat Kingsley tends to minimize her role in
Hollywood. But no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   Not Tom Cruise, nor a host of other stars: Courtney Love, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, Al Pacino, to name a
few. As a founder of PMK, the most powerful public relations
company in entertainment, she ranks as the doyenne of Hollywood
publicity and an extraordinarily potent force in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley, 66, counts Cruise and company among her clients.
The stars, often difficult, spoiled, volcanic and surprisingly
insecure, find a strong-willed rudder in Ms. Kingsley: smart,
tight-lipped and fiercely loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they can trust her,'' said Sherry Lansing, chairman
of Paramount Pictures, who has worked with Ms. Kingsley for years.
``She brings a sense of perspective to their careers. She has an
extraordinary instinct about what's right and not right for her
clients and for the movies she works on.''
</P>
<P>
   Her control of access to her roster at a time when the nation's
obsession with celebrity keeps growing has helped her reshape not
only stars' images but also entertainment journalism. Tall,
attentive and publicly anonymous in the company of her clients, she
has used her position as no one else has.
</P>
<P>
   She shrewdly manipulates and cajoles magazine editors and
television executives, and often demands outright that for profiles
of her clients they use preferred interviewers (usually ones who
are in awe of stars and will ask soft questions) as well as glossy
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Because an exclusive cover picture of Cruise, for one, can
increase newsstand sales by the thousands, magazine editors, as
well as their television equivalents, are often willing to agree to
Ms. Kingsley's requirements, even though by doing so they are
giving up significant traditional controls over their articles and
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day Ms. Kingsley canceled a ``Today'' appearance
by her client Calista Flockhart because the producers would not
agree to Ms. Kingsley's insistence that the show's interviewer not
ask any questions about the actress' bone-thin appearance.
</P>
<P>
   About Ms. Kingsley, Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism, said: ``She's changed the
rules. And although it may be to her credit as a publicist, it is
not to the general well-being of journalism as a field and those
who are consumers of journalism. There's a feeling that favorable
coverage is traded in some fashion, but what the audience isn't let
in on is the secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley, seated in a conference room at her office in a low
Italianate building on a quiet Los Angeles street, is direct about
her mission. ``Yes, we try to control,'' she said. ``We try to
control whether or not it's a cover. We cop to that. We ask who the
writer is. If it's somebody that either we or the client has had a
bad experience with, we say, well, that's not going to work. They
either will come back with another writer or won't do the story.
The same can be said with photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an actor reaches a certain station, there's a prestige
that they have: They should either get the cover or they shouldn't
do the interview. A magazine editor told me he didn't understand my
reasoning. His magazine had a circulation of six million, and we
were offered an inside story on one of our clients. We turned it
down for a cover story in Details, which had a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's right.' Basically, a lot of people don't read
these articles, but they do see the covers. They see them on the
newsstands. And when a person gets to a certain stage, they should
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Kingsley's most discussed triumphs was placing her
client Matthew McConaughey on the cover of Vanity Fair at a time
when he was almost unknown. The August 1996 article hailed him as a
major new star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we look for a puff piece,'' Ms. Kingsley said,
maintaining that she just wanted the journalist and the star to
``mesh.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Ms. Kingsley and others in public relations filled
the void left by the collapse of the old studio system. From the
1940s and through the mid-'60s studios not only controlled the
public appearances of actors but also created fictions about their
personal lives, including in some cases their sexual orientations
to make them palatable to the public. At the same time Hollywood
journalists, like those in Washington, often avoided publishing
what they knew about the personal lives of the people they covered.
By contrast, some of today's stars proclaim their sexual
identities, like Ellen DeGeneres, a PMK client.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley moved to Los Angeles in 1959, got her first movie
job as secretary to the press agent Warren Cowan, was steadily
promoted and wound up handling stars like Natalie Wood, Doris Day
and Samantha Eggar. One potential public relations challenge was
Ms. Wood, who had had several affairs. ``They would speculate who
she was going out with, but it was all very tastefully done,'' she
said. ``Today there'd be somebody in the bushes trying to get a
photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   PMK was formed in 1980 when Ms. Kingsley's former company merged
with two rivals. After deaths and departures, she emerged on top
and was later joined by her New York-based partners, Leslee Dart
and Lois Smith. Clients pay an estimated fee of $3,500 a month.
Studios pay about $10,000 a month for help with a film's release.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago PMK, a nearly $10-million-a-year business with 40
employees, was acquired for an undisclosed sum by the
McCann-Erickson World Group, the advertising agency, which itself
is a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Kingsley in her workday tends to say no more than yes,
often to people who don't hear no very often, she has stirred a
certain enmity, especially among studio executives who want her
clients to help promote their movies.

HOLLYWOOD: their movies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley herself takes strong exception to a view expressed
by one top producer that when it comes to encouraging clients to do
interviews, ``as far as studios go, it's mostly no, no, no with
Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``We prefer to be buffers,'' alluding to her role as
the gatekeeper limiting access to the stars. ``You know, the bigger
the stars, the studios really don't have much to complain about.
I've never had much complaint about Tom Cruise or Jodie Foster or a
lot of people who really feel the responsibility of their work.
They don't feel that their job ends once they wrap.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Kingsley, selection of writers and photographers is very
much a bargaining chip. Especially photographers. She was the first
publicity agent who demanded magazine covers for many of her
clients, a demand that is now commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Cable Neuhaus, Los Angeles bureau chief of Entertainment Weekly,
said the magazine's relationship with Ms. Kingsley had been
erratic. ``When we first began, she blew us off with impunity,'' he
said. ``Then we had our exclusive story about Julia Roberts calling
off her wedding to Kiefer Sutherland. Pat called. She said we had
turned the corner. She said, `Congratulations, you're one of the
big boys now.' '' The exclusive had turned the magazine into a must
read for entertainment industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus said that Ms. Kingsley could be stern and intimidating.
Several years ago, he recalled, the magazine's plans for a cover
article on Ms. Foster fell through because of a late-breaking
report. Ms. Kingsley was furious that the article ran in a later
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat called and said: `As far as you're concerned, I'm dead.
Don't bother calling me back,' '' Neuhaus recalled. ``The truth is,
she continued to deal with us in a very professional and collegial
way. Subsequently our relationship has been totally civil.''
</P>
<P>
   From the client's point of view, Ms. Kingsley's approach, and
that of her PMK colleagues, is worth whatever they pay. ``If you
have a hint of a Newsweek cover or a little interest from Time,
they know exactly how to navigate the clients in a way that doesn't
seem desperate or lame,'' said Scott Rudin, one of the most
prolific producers, who employs the company on his films. ``They
have the ability to promise: `We'll give you a big Jim Carrey
piece, if you do Diane Keaton. We'll give you `Ransom' if you do
`Marvin's Room.'''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Ms. Kingsley's partners have equally formidable
client lists. Ms. Dart's includes Tom Hanks, Woody Allen, Matt
Damon, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, Conan O'Brien and Mike
Nichols. Ms. Smith represents Robert Redford, Meryl Streep,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Rosie O'Donnell, Dustin Hoffman and others.
</P>
<P>
   Graydon Carter, managing editor of Vanity Fair, which is a prime
focus of PMK, said that Hollywood demographics had worked to
strengthen his hand and those of other editors in their dealings
with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six years ago every magazine was fighting over a small
number of movie stars,'' Carter said. ``PMK was very powerful. They
did a great job. But now there's an explosion of younger talent,
and it's put power back in the editors' hands. Half our staff
doesn't know why we choose some of the people we put on our
covers.''
</P>
<P>
   (Although PMK counts young stars among its clients, including
Ms. Flockhart, Johnny Depp, Neve Campbell and Lisa Kudrow, the
agency's rivals include two companies that are especially popular
with younger stars. One of the companies is Baker-Winokaur-Ryder,
whose clients include Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Sarah Michelle
Gellar, Rosie Perez and Ben Affleck. The other is
Huvane-Baum-Halls, with clients like Gwyneth Paltrow, Helen Hunt
and Jennifer Aniston.)
</P>
<P>
   For someone who spends so much time with so many high-profile
clients, Ms. Kingsley, who has held onto her North Carolina accent,
lives a surprisingly low-key life. She has in a relatively small
home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She said she divided her time
among her office, a gym and the premieres she must attend with her
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she finds herself in a situation where no amount of
spin can save a client. In the early 80s she received a call from
the tennis player Billie Jean King, who said that because of a
lawsuit, the news was about to break that she had had an affair
with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so difficult; it was at the end of her career on the
courts, and it was going to ruin her ability to make money,'' Ms.
Kingsley said. ``She didn't feel she could lie about what happened.
She wanted to deal with it in an aggressive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let's do it here in Los Angeles.' So she gave her
statement at this hotel down near the airport. And it was terribly
difficult. Her mother and father were there, her family. And it was
painful not knowing what the consequences would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the things that she had signed up to represent went away.
And they never came back to this day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The reviews are in for last year's books and the
reading is not pleasant. A new industry study indicates that the
popular market for literature declined, with the number of
purchases dropping for the first time in seven years despite the
growing presence of electronic bookstores and the easy availability
of titles.
</P>
<P>
   The widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed
so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even
as demand has fallen for mass-market paperback books and as
affluent, educated readers buy fewer titles, according to the Book
Industry Study Group, a trade group that tracks the reading habits
of 16,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the
top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the
Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and
sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and
their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the release of the survey on Friday, Peter Olson,
the chief executive of Random House, the unit of Bertelsmann AG
that is the nation's largest publisher, appeared on a panel,
``Bookselling in the Next Millennium.'' During the discussion, he
insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth
rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the new consumer-research study indicates that sales over
all declined almost 3 percent, to 1.04 billion books purchased _
literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of
booksellers. For the first time that electronic commerce was
measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the
book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share,
which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent. The
large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to
25.3 percent, reflecting their own slowing expansion of
brick-and-bookshelf stores. The rest of the bookselling market
includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains
to food and drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of
titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they
were not reaching more readers. The downturn in sales comes as the
economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent
publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York
stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to
appeal to independent booksellers. By necessity, those booksellers
are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of
their own, Book Sense, which has now signed up more than 860
members.
</P>
<P>
   Avin Domnitz, the chief executive of the American Booksellers
Association, said the study reflected other research the trade
group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book
Sense site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people, in particular,'' Domnitz said, are ``so busy and
so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on
their priority list.''
</P>
<P>
   That group is reading, he noted _ not necessarily traditional
books but perhaps information on line.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the
falling popularity of paperbacks; those books once ushered in a
revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy
portability. The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on
used bookstores, book clubs, mail-order companies, even drugstores
_ all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at
drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores _ reflecting a shift
in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger
type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks.
Cost may also have driven away potential customers: the average
price of paid for a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation
over the last five years, rising to $4.56 from $4.12 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the age factor, the Association of American
Publishers has created an publicity campaign featuring celebrity
bookworms and a slogan, ``Get Caught Reading,'' to try to reach the
young, but there's heavy work ahead. In particular, readers younger
than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20
percent. Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal, the
study showed, buying 15 percent more books.
</P>
<P>
   Readers with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are usually
heavy book-buyers, but last year they also cut back. In general,
readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on
nonfiction, like biographies and history, which declined in sales
by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The customers younger than 40 who did shift to online
book-shopping displayed rather different reading tastes than those
of the general market. Popular fiction topped E-commerce sales at
33 percent, followed by 14 percent for technical and science books,
12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for
psychological and recovery books. In the general market, popular
fiction has a much more commanding presence _ 51 percent _ followed
by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent .
</P>
<P>
   The study notes that religious-book buyers did not seem to
respond to electronic bookstores, but did buy enough titles in
other outlets to expand the segment's share of the market by more
than 1 percent. Over all, customers bought fewer books in every
category except in categories for travel and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Domnitz, whose organization helped finance the study, still
believes there is a potential for expanding the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that about half of the population is not going
to purchase books in the course of a year,'' he said. ``And so we
have to concentrate on those who do.''

`A DANGEROUS FRIEND:' HIGH IDEALS, ON THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think that the Vietnam War has been milked dry as a
subject for fiction, this impression will be reinforced at the
opening of Ward Just's extraordinary new novel, ``A Dangerous
Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the nameless narrator declares: ``I will insist at the
beginning that this is not a war story. There have been plenty of
those and will be many more, appalling stories of 19-year-olds
breaking down, frightened out of their wits, or engaging in acts of
unimaginable gallantry; and often all three at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he continues, ``this is a different cut of history, a
civilian cut, without feats of arms or battlefield chaos. If love
depends on faith, think of my narrative as a kind of romance, the
story of one man with a bad conscience and another with no
conscience and the Frenchman and his wife who lived in the parallel
world, the one we thought was a mirage from the century before, a
bankrupt colonial milieu that offered _ so many possibilities, as
Dicky Rostok said.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story still seems familiar, what with the man of bad
conscience, Sydney Parade, going to work in 1965 for the man with
no conscience, Dicky Rostok, leader of the so-called Llewellyn
Group, ``a team outside the normal chain of command, not for
intelligence or counter-insurgency _ the CIA already had more
people than the embassy, and its plate was full _ but for research
and rapid reaction when the usual channels broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the story you learn that Rostok wants Parade to use his
family's connections to befriend and get information from a
Frenchman and his American wife who run a rubber plantation in Xuan
Loc.
</P>
<P>
   You know from the wearily disillusioned tone of the narrative
that things will end badly and that Parade will turn out to be the
dangerous friend of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the shape of the story is predictable, Just more than
justifies its telling with the evocative detail he brings to it.
Not only has he used his experience reporting the war in the 1960s
(for Newsweek and The Washington Post) to bring the terrain and
weather and atmosphere of Vietnam alive, he also fashions a series
of eloquent symbols.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Parade first arrives in Vietnam he finds on
his desk an oblong carton from home that he thinks must contain his
father's prized shotguns, ``the twin Brownings he had won in a
poker game at the club,'' but that when opened yields ``not
firearms at all but two intricately carved boxes, each 10 inches by
14 inches, one marked IN and the other marked OUT in deep curving
script.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrative continues: ``The old man could be very droll. He
knew that the IN and OUT boxes were the maneuver battalions of
bureaucratic existence, now forward, now back, now concealed, now
full, now empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Just seems incomparably at home in his story. Gone is
the teasing obliqueness, the air of empty mystification that so
often marks his fiction (``The Congressman Who Loved Flaubert,''
``Nicholson at Large,'' ``Jack Gance'' and ``Echo House,'' among
his 14 previous novels and story collections). Instead his subtle
allusiveness is perfectly controlled, allowing the silences between
the lines to speak out loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he has invented an action involving a captured airborne
officer (``Saving Captain Smalley,'' you might call it) that neatly
sums up the frustration of the war from the American point of view,
the impossibility of penetrating the parallel world of residual
colonialism without destroying even what is worth preserving in it.
</P>
<P>
   One hesitates to call ``A Dangerous Friend'' brilliantly
Conradian, knowing how offensive it is to serious writers to be
defined in terms of other writers. But Just begs the comparison
himself by making Conrad a favorite of Rostok's, ``not the Conrad
of the African jungles but the Conrad of the open Asian seas, the
coming-of-age Conrad who was always conscious of the shadow line
between youth and maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, after the final collapse of Parade's illusions,
Rostok sums up what they have been through together in Conradian
terms, perfectly misreading both Conrad and what they have been
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad has no patience with illusions,'' he tells Parade.
``There's something of the manifest destiny in Joseph Conrad, don't
you think? And he's relevant in these times, because he hated the
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Parade looks hard at Rostok. ``Speechless was not the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Parade and Rostok stand shoulder to shoulder on a wharf,
watching stevedores unload a freighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were offloading America, the arsenal of democracy, its
knowledge and its wealth, its optimism and industrial might.
Typewriters, blackboards, two cases of thesauruses and three of
dictionaries, cartons of envelopes and note pads, pencils, paper
clips, gum erasers and ballpoint pens, account ledgers, file
folders, coffee mugs, paperweights and insect repellent and
scissors and pictures frames and desk lamps. Television sets were
followed by transistor radios, then telephones, movie projectors,
intercom systems, lecterns with microphones attached, and case
after case of plastic rulers. An American stood to one side with a
checklist on a clipboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Just's novel makes you want to run screaming into the street to
protest retrospectively the war he has so movingly recreated.

   NEW YORK _ Listeners who leaped up from Sofia Gubaidulina's new
piece at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night and hurried across Central
Park in time to hear Ms. Gubaidulina's new piece at the New York
Philharmonic must have experienced something of a culture shock.
``In the Shadow of the Tree,'' as played by the NHK Symphony under
Charles Dutoit, and ``Two Paths,'' a Philharmonic commission, ask
different questions of the composer's art and occupy vastly
separated worlds of style.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the music of this 67-year-old original, a woman who
follows many paths with unquenchable curiosity and conviction. Ms.
Gubaidulina's experience is vaguely reminiscent of Haydn's. Both
worked long years in comparative isolation and experimented with
little fear of censure: Haydn at the country palace of the
Esterhazys, Ms. Gubaidulina in the Tatar regions of the former
Soviet Union. The first had only his princely master to please. The
message of Soviet-style political correctness had weakened by the
time it reached Central Asia, and Ms. Gubaidulina found it
relatively easy to sidestep.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to describe her music in spiritual terms, but both
these pieces pursue specific problems of concerto writing. ``In the
Shadow of the Tree'' is another attempt at East-West dialogue, an
activity so often compromised by two incompatible sets of
instruments and the tunings they represent. Her solutions are
cunning.
</P>
<P>
   With hyper-enthusiasm, Kazue Sawai attacked three plucked and
stroked zitherlike instruments: two Japanese kotos, one a bass, and
a Chinese equivalent. The kotos, with their splayed tones and
intervals, live outside the Western notion of pitch relationships,
but introduced also is the Chinese element of five-note melody,
which acts as a kind of broker between traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasiness of Asian solo instruments against the European
orchestra is further mitigated by subtle doctorings of the latter.
Strings are tuned at half-step differences. Walls of tuned and
untuned percussion join the indeterminacy. So clever are the
solutions that the sounds of the koto, here somewhat amplified,
bleed naturally into the drifting orchestral sonorities. Somehow,
Western music becomes less a combatant than one more part of a
larger world.
</P>
<P>
   In both pieces Ms. Gubaidulina showed herself an absolute master
of orchestration. At Carnegie Hall the swoops of muted strings and
their dying downward glissandos were breathtakingly beautiful. In
``Two Paths,'' a dialogue between two violas and orchestra, the
shrieks, groans and chatterings seemed to take the human voice as
model.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic piece, as heard at Friday's repeat performance,
was conducted by Kurt Masur and featured two soloists from the
orchestra, Cynthia Phelps and Rebecca Young. ``Two Paths'' has the
dark, troubled rhetoric of modern Europe. Lower strings, brass and
bass clarinet create a nightscape of sorts; played against them are
agonizingly high harmonic tones on the solo instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Paths'' operates as question-and-answer: orchestra as
interrogator, often hectoring; the violists more placatory.
Separating solo instruments by nature not that resonant from their
larger partners resolves the uneven balance of power. It helps that
both Ms. Phelps and Ms. Young have the high-powered techniques
necessary to fill Avery Fisher Hall. The same kind of muscularity
was applied to Bach's two-viola ``Brandenburg Concerto'' at the
start of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic surrounded ``Two Paths'' with foolproof
favorites: the Schubert ``Unfinished'' and Mendelssohn ``Italian''
symphonies. At Carnegie Hall Dutoit and his Japanese players used
the presence of Itzhak Perlman and Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony as
bait. In both venues restive, shuffling and coughing audiences
transmitted a subversive impatience with Ms. Gubaidulina's music.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philharmonic's Schubert, the sum of the parts was greater
than the whole. The cellos sang the famous tunes with unearthly
elegance; the wind solos were beautiful. Yet Masur's slow tempos
made the heavy accents sound self-conscious and the well-played
individual sections isolated one from the other. With a certain
kind of spirituality in play, low-speed enterprises like this can
flourish. It didn't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect from a fastidious culture, the NHK Symphony
created a lovely sound, the strings with a genteel, almost covered
quality. Perlman's piece was the Barber Violin Concerto: direct,
gentle and songful music (excepting the whirlwind finale), which
these players treated with exquisite courtesy. It was nice to hear
Perlman playing so well and venturing outside the fame-and-fortune
repertory.

BAFFLED AS EVERYONE ELSE, NETWORK TV WAS DRAWN TO THE LITTLETON
SHOOTINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first frightening images flashed onto television
screens from Littleton, Colo., on Tuesday afternoon, April 20, it
was clearly a major story, one the cable news networks would cover
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the three major broadcast networks were covering it
almost the same way, devoting far more time to this massacre, on
their evening and morning news programs and prime-time news
magazines, than they had ever allocated to any similar shooting
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   They devoted so much time to the event that the first week's
coverage was called ``unprecedented and disproportionate'' by
Andrew Tyndall, a longtime industry consultant who tracks the
amount of coverage the weeknight news broadcasts give to various
stories. He noted that the 6:30 p.m. newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC
together spent 144 minutes on the Littleton tragedy over four days
_ more than twice as much as the 65 minutes spent on the Jonesboro,
Ark., school killings a year earlier. Those shootings also occurred
on a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage was far greater than that given to the 1997
Paducah, Ky., high school shooting, which left three dead (40
minutes over 5 days), and the 1991 cafeteria shooting in Killeen,
Tex., which killed 23 (27 minutes, 3 days).
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested a reason, and it had to do with race and
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have thought Jonesboro would be more horrifying because
it was children doing it,'' Tyndall said of the 11- and 13-year-old
boys who killed a teacher and four young girls in March 1998. ``Two
18-year-olds with guns who get angry and shoot people _ in Brooklyn
it wouldn't get much attention. The fact that this was an
upper-class suburb, and white upper-middle-class kids doing it, I
think influenced the coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League, agreed,
to a point. ``We seem be a little more immune to and oblivious to
violence in urban areas,'' he said. ``We assume it goes with the
territory. In the eyes of many white Americans, people of color are
not quite whole people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added: ``The gun violence that occurs in
black neighborhoods isn't like this. I can't recall an instance
where urban kids have gone in to blow things up. It may be some
gang stuff, or to settle some drug business. It's callous, but not
calculated, like what happened in Littleton. How do you find
Hitler? Why do kids like these even look for Hitler? This is beyond
the Ku Klux Klan even. I don't know what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans share Price's bafflement, which is a primary
reason television journalists give for the abundant Littleton
coverage _ coverage they insist was not excessive, given the many
factors involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story was bigger because the scope was bigger,'' said
Neal Shapiro, executive producer of NBC's ``Dateline.'' ``There
were more dead students.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline'' devoted a full hour to the Littleton tragedy each
night Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday of the first week, and
most of its hourlong program the following Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and others said that if two black 18-year-olds in an
urban school had killed 12 classmates and a teacher in the same
stylized way, and had placed bombs to blow up the school, the
networks would have covered it the same way. Others said,
privately, that they might not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was the worst shooting in any high school in the United
States ever, it would have gotten the same amount of coverage,''
Shapiro said, although the angles explored might have been
different.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that most school shootings have taken place in suburban
or rural areas, Paul Friedman, the executive producer of ABC's
``World News Tonight,'' said, ``I think the most surprising part
would be if it did take place in a major city.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that, along with the sheer horror of what happened in
Littleton, the incident was disturbing because it raised ``all the
questions we all have about raising children and getting along with
adolescents and understanding adolescents, as parents and authority
figures trying to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Ortiz, executive producer of ``CBS Evening News,'' said he,
his family and neighbors all felt ``forced to re-examine what our
kids are up to, what we knew about them, what video games they're
playing and what they are exposed to,'' because the killers in
Littleton appeared to be ``normal'' teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz also pointed out another reason the Littleton tragedy
got so much broadcast air time _ the agonizing way the story played
out, with mesmerizing live video. The first reports told of
hostages and gunfire, but not casualties. Slowly, over hours, came
reports of bombs and of bodies that could not be moved for fear of
booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every hour went by, the pictures that poured in were so
dramatic,'' Ortiz said. ``Kids running away, SWAT teams moving
around, shooting victims lying out in the open. It was obvious
there was something bigger than usual playing out. Then you heard
they were seemingly bright kids, and you heard about this trench
coat mafia, and as the hours went by it became curiouser and
curiouser.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of bewilderment made another difference, some
journalists said: People in Littleton did not shun the press, as
townspeople did after several other school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed an outlet,'' Susan Zirinsky, executive producer of
CBS' ``48 Hours,'' said of the teen-agers and parents. ``They
didn't understand what had happened, it was the most intense crisis
any of them had ever dealt with, and both the print and television
press became a vehicle for a cathartic experience for everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greenfield, the CNN commentator, who led CNN's ``town
meeting'' on the subject, said Littleton was different from other
school shooting stories because with the others, there seemed to be
some explanation for the violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had such emotional resonance,'' he said of the Littleton
story. ``And the news magazine shows, the prime-time shows, have
all bought into the idea that in order to make a mark in prime
time, a story needs to have a big emotional wallop. This story had
it in hearts and spades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was every parent's nightmare,'' he said.

VITAMIN-FORTIFIED AIR 
PROTECTING GOLFERS FROM THE SUN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cereal makers, milk producers and skin-care cosmetic companies
put vitamins in their products and call them vitamin fortified,
making consumers feel better about what they are ingesting or
rubbing on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, would people feel if air was vitamin fortified?
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mettler, an inventor from Rancho Cordova, Calif., thinks
vitamin-fortified air is a good way to deliver vitamins
effortlessly. So he designed an air freshener and room deodorizer
that releases vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who need vitamin supplements take them in tablets or
capsules. A few years ago, spray vitamins that can be spritzed into
the mouth became popular as a method to deliver the vitamins more
quickly to the blood. Mettler, who holds several patents for air
fresheners and deodorizers, has adopted the kind of spray that can
used for those products for his ``vitaminized'' system. His latest
patent adds soluble vitamins like ascorbic acid (vitamin C), beta
carotene (vitamin A) or vitamin E to a formula that includes
fragrance oil and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamins make up 1 percent to 12 percent of the mixture. The
fragrances, like those in conventional air fresheners, can be
derived from pine, fruit or flower oils. A propellant like
isobutane makes it possible to spray the freshener. Thus, Mettler
said, the air in a room can be vitamin fortified with isolated
sprays from a can. Or the vitamins can be dispersed using devices
covered in some of Mettler's older patents. One describes a
battery-operated air-freshening and deodorizing dispenser patented
in 1976. An electronic timer ejects doses of vitamins A, C and E at
intervals ranging from 5 seconds to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to control the frequency of emission of a constant
quantity of the composition permits the user to compensate for the
size of the room, the airflow and the number of occupants as may be
desired,'' Mettler said in the patent filing.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get vitamins into the air, he said, is ``to load
these vitaminized mixtures onto compressed fiber pads through which
air can be forced via a fan blowing air on the pad.'' Mettler
patented such a device in 1981. Either way is more efficient than
expecting people to carry around their own inhalers or other
individual vitamin spray canisters, Mettler said.
</P>
<P>
   In his patent, he writes that his ``intent is to provide an
improved room deodorizer that benefits anyone and everyone who
enters the room, by permitting those people to gain the benefits of
propellant-delivered vitamins present in the mist or discrete
droplets of the air of a nicely smelling room.''
</P>
<P>
   He also believes that inhaling vitamins is superior to
swallowing them in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cell systems of the nasal cavity have been found to absorb
certain vitamins rapidly and efficiently,'' Mettler said in his
patent. ``One thereby avoids degradation of the vitamin by stomach
acid, and the inhibition of delivery of the benefits due to the
presence of food in stomach or intestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mettler received patent 5,891,427.
</P>
<P>
   How to Save Golfers a Lot of Sun Block
</P>
<P>
   Golf is a game often played in sunny climates, which means that
a lot of golfers are exposed to the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays
for the many hours it takes to play a round.
</P>
<P>
   Most golf carts have canopies to shield players, but sometimes
that protective covering is deliberately eliminated. Ron Sanders,
an inventor and golfer, once played a course in Maine where the
carts did not have tops so that players could enjoy the spectacular
scenery. The view was beautiful, but the hot ride made him
uncomfortable. It also gave him the idea for a transparent,
ultraviolet-proof golf cart roof.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who founded a company in Great Neck, N.Y., called
Polymer Innovations Corp., has won a patent for the cart roof he
calls Sky-Vu. He says it fits the golf carts produced by three
leading manufacturers. He also cites research from the National
Golf Foundation showing that golf cart rentals account for more
than $2 billion in annual revenue, that 1.5 million golf carts are
in use and that 40,000 of those will need new tops each year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' canopy is made of a thin sheet of transparent plastic
like polyethylene terephthalate-glycol. A chemical additive that
blocks ultraviolet rays can either be affixed to the plastic sheet
with adhesive or impregnated into the sheet itself, according to
the patent filing.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' invention can also be used for boat tops.
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,843,548.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

GRACEFULLY RUFFLING FEATHERS WITH A PROVOCATIVE ESTHETIC
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Love it or hate it, the first full-evening production
of ``Swan Lake'' at the New York City Ballet is already the talk of
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Passions run high among aficionados when rules are broken. Peter
Martins' staging of the standard four-act ``Swan Lake'' is not as
extreme as Robert Wilson's experiment with light in ``Lohengrin''
at the Metropolitan Opera. But it is bold and provocative in its
own right, with Martins' dazzling new choreography successfully
complementing a radical stage design.
</P>
<P>
   The decor by Per Kirkeby, a Danish painter, comes as a shock. No
fairy tale festivities or magic woodland enter into his highly
abstract landscapes and austere interiors. This is a Nordic clime
into which color, when it does light up the stage, plays an
important psychological role.
</P>
<P>
   Color theory and changing spatial composition tell the story
here as much as the 19th-century mime that Martins has, for the
most part, discarded.
</P>
<P>
   At its New York City Ballet premiere on Thursday night at the
New York State Theater, this $1.5 million ``Swan Lake'' was more
fascinating than moving. The deeply lyrical and elegiac quality of
the lakeside scenes seemed sacrificed to a perfect neo-classicism,
expressed in patterns and steps, as derived from George
Balanchine's one-act ``Swan Lake,'' which will also remain in the
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But when led by the right Swan Queen and her prince, there is
still room even in this streamlined, modernized and swiftly paced
``Swan Lake'' for the emotional resonance that should be at its
core. Sadly, Darci Kistler and Damian Woetzel were deficient in
this respect at a gala on Thursday. But three other casts over the
weekend pointed in the right direction: Kyra Nichols and Philip
Neal on Friday, and on Saturday, Monique Meunier and Jock Soto
(matinee) and Miranda Weese and Peter Boal (evening).
</P>
<P>
   Soto and Ms. Meunier, with her wonderful amplitude of shape and
flow, knew best how to infuse drama and rapport into the encounters
between Prince Siegfried and Odette, the Swan Queen, and Odile, her
evil double.
</P>
<P>
   For although the choreography here tends toward the formal,
patterns and steps can be expressive in themselves. Contrary to
expectations, the production is not a pure-dance accident waiting
to happen. Martins follows the structure of the standard 1895
``Swan Lake'' by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. The emphasis is on
dancing rather than characterization. But here as in Martins'
splendid 1991 ``Sleeping Beauty,'' the reason for bringing dance
into relief is found in the company's esthetics.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Balanchine why he did not choreograph a
full-evening ``Swan Lake,'' he replied that Tchaikovsky, in his
ballet score, had essentially written a suite of dances and that
the story was unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet performs here in its usual neo-classical style,
chest pulled up and energetic in its attack. This does not mean
that these qualities cannot be used to dramatic effect. There is a
wonderful moment when Martins has the swan maidens attack the
hunters in the first lakeside scene.
</P>
<P>
   Martins has compressed four acts into two with one intermission
and the mood of each act is definitely influenced by the decor,
with important contributions from Mark Stanley, the lighting
designer. Martins originally presented this ``Swan Lake'' at the
Royal Danish Ballet in October 1996, and it has been restaged for
the U.S. premiere with the aid of Colleen Neary, a former City
Ballet principal who lives in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The front curtain is already a clue that realism will not run
through the production. Realism is reserved for the oppressive
world in which the Prince lives. Jackson Pollock might come to mind
when looking at the flowing paint on the first curtain; these veins
and roots, or scribbles, are echoed in many of the costumes,
including Odette's and Siegfried's.
</P>
<P>
   The two front curtains and lakeside backdrops are highly
effective; they are stunning as abstractions of nature and the
seasons. Branches, roots and ice come to mind in the first drop;
slate in the other. A splash of blue suggests a lake elsewhere. Act
I is more of a shock, with its no-frills courtyard surrounded by
ochre walls and arches below an abstraction of foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince in blue stands out in the spare setting. Eight women
in green with eight men in red, yellow and orange fill the huge
space with a swirl of color in the highly musical and exciting
waltz choreographed by Martins. Tiny girls and their boy escorts
weave through the waltz and when they end in tribute to the Prince
on his birthday, the audience applauds rightly.
</P>
<P>
   Martins has kept set pieces such as the adagio solo and Dance of
the Cygnets in the traditional second act. The standard Black Swan
pas de deux in the ballroom scene is included. In a few cases he
expands upon the original steps with new patterns as Balanchine did
with Ivanov's swan maidens. He does the same for Petipa's pas de
trois in Act I. As in other productions, there is totally new
choreography. The Prince gets a solo in the first lakeside scene,
danced to the music of the big swans. The Jester, derived from
Soviet productions, is no fool; he is a virtuoso. Benjamin Bowman,
Tom Gold and Adam Hendrickson were all outstanding on different
days.
</P>
<P>
   The character dances, on toe or in heels, have a hit in a sexy
harem number, especially as fabulously performance by Charles
Askegard and Maria Kowroski. Their music is the Russian Dance, and
it is odd in this context to hear the Russian melodies of the
violin solo, although the choreography is highly musical.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried's adagio with Odette is danced in a spotlight in the
usual Second Act, surrounded by a swan corps in blue light. Martins
uses the image of the deep curtsy that begins the adagio as a theme
for the corps, especially in Act IV, in which a huge circle of swan
maidens on the floor await Siegfried after he has betrayed Odette.
</P>
<P>
   He does so in an airless paneled room that resembles a courtroom
more than a ballroom. The courtiers are in Elizabethan dress, like
the Queen Mother, who has told the Prince to marry. The Jester,
aided by three little boys, ushers in the divertissement. This
section includes Martins' intricate neo-classical pas de quatre
from four years ago and standard character dances (Hungarian and
Spanish). There is a weak Neapolitan dance with the women on toe.
The six fiancees waltz on toe and Odile seduces the Prince as usual
in the traditional pas de deux, directed by Rothbart the magician,
who has a flair for flinging an orange cape.
</P>
<P>
   The mazurka is not part of the divertissement as usual; it
becomes suddenly a ghostly background, danced by courtiers, for a
new drama. Siegfried, who has sworn his love to Odette, is ready to
swear to Odile, but Rothbart violently stops him, gesturing as if
to ask him if he is sure.
</P>
<P>
   When the fatal second vow is taken, the Prince in this version
is doomed to remain alone. Odette, betrayed, exits, supposedly to
revert to swanhood. Rothbart dives into the wings leaving his cape
behind: an unsatisfactory touch.
</P>
<P>
   The production, dedicated to the memory of Lincoln Kirstein, a
co-founder of the City Ballet with Balanchine, has a sophistication
that other companies might envy. One looks forward to all the casts
later this week.

   It was a busy Friday for DDB Needham Worldwide Communications
Group in New York, a unit of Omnicom Group, which changed its name,
designated the next generation of leadership and landed a large
account.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham is dropping the ``Needham'' from its name, which
dates to 1986 when Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper Worldwide
merged to form the agency. Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief
executive, said the decision to ``simplify our branding'' was
spurred by the coming 50th anniversary of the founding of Doyle
Dane.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard, 64, is forming a worldwide operating committee
composed of executives who are likely to be top managers in the
next century. Ken Kaess, 44, president for North America, takes the
additional post of chairman of the committee, which formally
identifies him as Reinhard's eventual successor. Kaess will also
become a member of the agency's executive committee, along with a
creative executive, Nizan Guanaes, 40, president at DM9 DDB Brazil
in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   And Dairy Management Inc. in Rosemont, Ill., which conducts
advertising and promotional programs for the American Dairy
Association and the National Dairy Council, named DDB Chicago to
handle the creative portion of its cheese account, with billings
estimated at $29 million. Those duties had been handled by Leo
Burnett Co. in Chicago until that agency and Dairy Management
agreed to part ways in January.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review that had been
narrowed to DDB Chicago and one other finalist, Goodby, Silverstein
&AMP; Partners in San Francisco, also owned by Omnicom. TN Media in New
York, a unit of True North Communications, continues to handle
media duties.

   Internet advertising more than doubled during 1998, according to
a report for the Internet Advertising Bureau in New York prepared
by the New Media Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet ad revenue reached a record $1.92 billion last year,
the report said, up 111.8 percent from $906.5 million in 1997. For
the fourth quarter of 1998, ad revenue totaled $655.6 million, the
report said, an increase of 33.6 percent from $490.6 million in the
corresponding period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the Internet to blend ``traditional brand
building, retail sales and customer service in one place'' is the
reason that ad revenue ``has grown so quickly,'' Rich LeFurgy,
chairman at the bureau, said. ``And we're expecting continued
strong growth as traditional advertisers still sitting on the
sidelines start to come on board.''

DOG GONE, BUT NOT TO YARD IN SKY

<P>
   Dennis Grega owns what sound like perfect dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Dartanian, part malamute and part shepherd, and Alyosha, a
Samoyed, don't climb on the furniture. Barking is not a problem.
Cleanup is non-existent, and the dogs never threaten the postman.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Which cuts down on their usefulness as guard dogs considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Grega had both dogs preserved; they lie, seemingly asleep, in a
bedroom of his New York apartment. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, Fido, too, must shuffle off this canine
coil. But even the most devoted pet lover might wonder: What's the
point of keeping him around after he's gone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few years, it has alleviated the pain of losing
those animals,'' explained Grega, who works at a software company.
``I see them every day. . . . It's not like they're in the ground
decomposing. I can touch them. My kid actually likes to pet them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Four-year-old Dion doesn't think all dogs lie stone
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets along well with live dogs,'' Grega said, laughing.
``He'll even tell me we have two dogs, and they're both dead.'' &QL; 
`After-death pet care'
</P>
<P>
   Grega had his dogs preserved in Phoenix at Pet &AMP; Animal Lovers
Service, or PALS. The company specializes in after-death pet care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting more emotionally attached to pets,'' said
Katherine Heuerman, PALS founder. ``Everyone's going to (the option
of) getting their pets back.''
</P>
<P>
   Often in the form of ashes: Cremations make up the bulk of her
business, Heuerman said. PALS cremates 60 to 65 animals a week (the
crematoriums are open for pet owners to inspect).
</P>
<P>
   But preservation is growing; one or two people a month now
request it.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation is a form of taxidermy, Heuerman explained, only
more detailed. You didn't gurgle baby talk for 10 years to the
white-tailed buck mounted above the mantel, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fox or deer is wildlife,'' Heuerman said. ``People see them
once, they shoot them, they kill them. There is no emotional
attachment. We have to capture the personality.''
</P>
<P>
   So PALS requires at least three photos of the pet. Preservation
is not cheap; it starts at about $500. (Cremations start at $100,
and burials run $750 to $1,000, Heuerman said.) It's also slow,
taking six to 12 months. But to some, it's worth it. &QL; 
Peanut's place
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said to Peanut, `You'll never leave me,' '' said
Sandra Wade of Scottsdale. And so he hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut, a chocolate-brown poodle no longer among the living,
lies atop a red satin pillow in a cherry-wood bed on top of the
entertainment center in Wade's bedroom. He's encased in a
custom-made glass case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep him with me,'' Wade said. ``I didn't want to
cremate him, and I didn't want him rotting in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Peanut soon will be joined by Buddy, a white bichon frise, who
died in March and is being preserved, and, eventually, by her seven
other dogs. ``It's well worth the investment,'' Wade said.
``(Preserving Peanut) helped me. I cried when I saw him, but it was
happy. I feel very comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't. A dead pet sitting on a shelf staring back at me
sounds creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Grega understands that, noting that if he didn't know and love
Dartanian and Alyosha, he might find their presence weird, too. But
he did, so he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like they're asleep,'' he said. ``They're where
they've always been. They slept in these poses when they were
alive. If you imagine hard enough, you can imagine them sleeping
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He even talks to them, saying things like ``I miss you guys''
and ``I wish you were alive'' and ``I'm glad you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unusual things going on in this world,''
Grega said. ``While that probably is unusual, there are a lot of
things going on you could look at a lot more cross-eyed than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. I'm willing to let eternally sleeping dogs lie.
Someone else's dogs, that is. In someone else's house. &QL;

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Every weekday morning Hollywood awakens to ``the
trades,'' Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, which talk
about the deals, the rumors and the announcements that spin out of
film studios and cable and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Variety dominated the daily agenda, with The
Hollywood Reporter trying to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after The Hollywood Reporter handed over the top
editor's job to Anita M. Busch, a strong-willed and aggressive
former top reporter at Variety, the competition has intensified as
Ms. Busch has challenged her former employer in the hard-fought
battle for readers and advertisers in the insular world of
Hollywood. In the process, the 37-year-old editor, who as a
reporter was as feared by executives as she was relentless, has
stirred the attention of a town that enjoys watching a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're killing them with exclusives,'' Ms. Busch said tartly of
her competitor in an interview the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Though such a comment may be an overstatement, it angers Peter
Bart, the editor in chief of Variety who is a former studio
executive and former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody reading these papers day by day can draw their own
conclusions,'' Bart said. ``Our competition is not The Hollywood
Reporter but The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The
L.A. Times. The Reporter hasn't been competition for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``trades'' are the first papers read in offices throughout
Hollywood. Not only do Variety and The Hollywood Reporter set the
agenda, but they mirror the agendas of studios and talent agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't read the trades for information as much as the
spin,'' said Jeremy Zimmer, a partner at the United Talent Agency.
``The trades are like a bulletin board that people use. People
spin. People announce a slate of films that you know won't get
made. People announce a director is coming onto a project, when you
know there's not even a script ready. Some of it is wishful
thinking _ if you're trying to make a client appear hot then you
suggest that some director is pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information travels so quickly now,'' Zimmer went on. ``People
in the information flow generally know what's going on before they
read the trades. We say at staff meetings, `If we have to read it
in the trades we're in trouble.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to assess the impact of Ms. Busch on circulation
or advertising. But the constituency for the trade papers _ studio
executives, talent agents and producers _ say that, by the nature
of her reputation and personality, Ms. Busch has sharpened the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty lopsided race before Anita, but now it's much
closer,'' said Mark Gill, president of the Los Angeles office of
Miramax, the studio owned by the Walt Disney Co. ``Anita has bought
an increased sense of urgency and a really aggressive style, an
amazing set of contacts and a pretty good nose for news.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wiatt, co-chairman of International Creative Management, a
top talent agency, said: ``Anita's an unbelievably competitive
person. Her relationships at every level of the business are
superb. It's a more level playing field now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch herself is widely feared in Hollywood and disliked by
plenty of people, too, partly because as a journalist and editor,
she seems indifferent to head-on collisions with moguls as well as
her former bosses, like Bart.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Ms. Busch wrote an article that angered
Michael Ovitz, then the head of the Creative Artists Agency.
Knowing that Ms. Busch had a serious allergy to monosodium
glutamate, or MSG, the powder that is used in foods as a flavor
intensifier, Ovitz sent her a bottle of it with a one-word note:
``Enjoy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was a joke,'' Ms. Busch said. ``I tried to take
it like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Covering agents is the worst,'' she added. ``They're the most
thin-skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point The Hollywood Reporter needs all the help it can
get, even with the arrival of Ms. Busch and several highly skilled
reporters covering films and television. Robert J. Dowling, the
editor in chief and publisher since 1988, said that over the last
10 years, The Hollywood Reporter had increased its reporting staff,
added numerous calendars, guides and features, started a Web site
and added advertising revenue through special sections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who now believes The Hollywood Reporter is No. 2 to
Variety ``hasn't done any homework,'' he said. Referring to
Variety, he said, ``They are the No. 2 paper in town.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures don't quite attest to that _ and neither do the
comments heard about both newspapers across Hollywood, where
Variety is still the dominant trade paper. That The Hollywood
Reporter is the size of a magazine while Variety is larger and
easier to read does not help the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Started 95 years ago as publication for the vaudeville business,
Variety is owned by Cahners, a division of the international media
conglomerate Reed Elsevier Inc., and has a daily circulation of
30,406, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Gerry Byrne,
the publisher of Variety, said the newspaper now has a daily
circulation of 37,899, which includes the West Coast and the
``Gotham'' edition in New York, which was started last year.
</P>
<P>
   The circulation of the weekly edition of Variety, which is
available Sunday or Monday, is 35,012. The household income of the
average Variety reader is an extraordinary $450,000 a year, Byrne
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for The Hollywood Reporter, its daily circulation as of Sept.
30, 1998, was 24,203, the last figure available from the audit
bureau. The circulation of the newspaper's weekly edition, which is
published on Tuesday, is 35,564. The Hollywood Reporter is owned by
Billboard Publications Inc., a subsidiary of VNU, a Dutch company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch started out in Los Angeles as a reporter for The
Hollywood Reporter, then was lured to Variety and has now returned
to The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Granite City, Ill., the daughter of a
businessman, and worked as a business journalist for Crain
Communications in Chicago before moving to Los Angeles in 1990 to
cover marketing for The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that struck me as strange was people hanging
up on me,'' Ms. Busch recalled. She said one top studio marketing
executive told her: ``We don't talk about marketing. We're going to
have a very short relationship. Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``He hung up in my ear. It was so unprofessional.'' In
her previous job, she said, ``I had been talking to people like
Malcolm Forbes and heads of companies. The behavior was so
different here.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Ms. Busch said she learned the Hollywood way of
dealing with the trade press. She once had an exclusive story about
Kevin Costner, for example, but before she could publish it a
publicist leaked it to Variety to curry favor with the larger
paper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was often inundated with gifts. A Tiffany
apple from the movie executive Peter Guber was so expensive, she
said, that ``I sent it back.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she refused to negotiate with agents who were willing
to leak stories about their star clients only if Ms. Busch
guaranteed that a photo of the star would be on the front page and
that the agent's name would be conspicuously high in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch quickly distinguished herself with numerous exclusive
articles on film and television deals. She was soon hired away by
Variety, where she tangled not only with agents and studio
executives but also with Bart, her editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bart, who has transformed Variety since he took over the weekly,
and later the daily, more than 10 years ago, recalled: ``When I
came here there was really a rather elderly staff, manual
typewriters, eyeshades. a lot of problems with alcohol,
particularly after lunch. Culturally and politically we were worlds
apart from what we are today. Variety hated rock-and-roll. There
were demonstrations by gay groups. And the reasoning in some ways
was, if it was not good for the industry, don't publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Busch, Bart said that she was a good reporter but
that ``she consistently did not get along with the editors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch said she tangled with Bart over the way her articles
were edited, especially those that involved the editor's friends,
like Guber, Ovitz, the producer Arnon Milchan, Joe Roth, the Disney
studio chairman, and Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax. Bart
denies any such favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   But the breaking point, about two years ago, was a front-page
article in Variety disclosing that a top executive at
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was being dismissed by his boss, Frank Mancuso,
who ran the studio until he stepped down last week. The executive
first heard about his ouster when an agent-friend called him on the
morning that Variety ran the article and asked him, ``What are you
going to do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch, who did not write the article but left Variety soon
after it appeared, said she was appalled that no one at Variety had
called the executive for comment. She said it was part of an
arrangement between Bart and Mancuso. Bart insisted that Ms.
Busch's version was untrue and that he had instructed reporters to
call the executive the night before publication so the news would
not leak to other papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch is consumed with work. She lives in an apartment a few
blocks from the offices of The Hollywood Reporter, in the
mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles, and usually works six days a
week, if not seven. Her struggle to alter the culture of the trade
paper is difficult because she is also seeking to alter the way
Hollywood views the trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling everybody, `no trade-offs for story placement,' ''
Ms. Busch said. ``We don't publish one story so they can give us a
bigger story; we don't negotiate through all the spinning. I'm
telling people: `You can't lie to us. If you lie you're going to
have a credibility problem.' And I'm telling people to lighten up;
we're not dealing with national security here.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Ms. Busch, who calls her sources for
stories, helped come up with a front-page article for the trade
paper: that Anthony Hopkins had been signed to co-star in the Tom
Cruise film ``Mission Impossible: 2.'' She tried to find out what
role Hopkins would play, but met with tight secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally called someone and found out,'' Ms. Busch said.
``But I thought: This is just a movie. What's the big deal? What
does it really matter? It's not Kosovo.''

THOMPSON AND KIRSHENBAUM BOND ARE FORMING UNITS TO FOCUS ON
ENTERTAINMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two agencies are joining the growing chorus along
Madison Avenue singing ``That's Entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   At J. Walter Thompson New York, an executive from the William
Morris Agency, Marina Hahn, is arriving in the new post of
executive vice president for strategy and entertainment.
Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York is forming a division to
specialize in film, television and theatrical accounts. The
division, named KBE, opens with assignments that have billings
estimated at $15 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are indicative of the increasing attempts by agencies
to broaden their missions beyond conventional advertising and enter
fields that are fresher and faster-growing. The enormous
opportunities presented by what Michael J. Wolf, in his new book,
``The Entertainment Economy,'' calls ``the E-factor'' _ the
voracious appetite among Americans to be amused _ are too
potentially lucrative to ignore, particularly after Hollywood
talent agencies have sought to muscle in on the tasks that agencies
have long performed for marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies can't just develop 30-second TV spots anymore,'' said
Bob Jeffrey, president at Thompson New York, part of the J. Walter
Thompson unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this big responsibility to form marketing partnerships
with clients in more aggressive ways and grow brands with the total
spectrum of communications,'' he said. ``Entertainment is global,
ubiquitous, contemporary and sets trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hahn, 40, had been vice president and head of the East Coast
corporate advisory group at the New York office of William Morris.
She has also worked for the Sony Corp. of America, the Pepsi-Cola
Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. and what is now DDB Worldwide in New York,
a unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about using entertainment as a strategic tool,'' Ms.
Hahn said, ``combining the creativity and clout of the
entertainment industry with the resources of corporate America and
figuring out how to build brands in innovative ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than creating the next sponsorship or product
placement or hiring the next celebrity endorser,'' she added. ``You
have to think about the experiences, not just the brands.'' Among
marketers praised by Ms. Hahn and Jeffrey were the Walt Disney Co.;
the Tommy Hilfiger Corp.; Nike Inc., for the Niketown retail
stores, and the Starbucks Coffee Co..
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hahn will form and lead a group at Thompson New York that
will combine what had been separate operations handling account
planning and media planning with a new entertainment unit, which,
like KBE, will seek clients in Hollywood, book publishing, music
and theater. Another goal is to use entertainment expertise to sell
the packaged goods of clients of Thompson New York and other
Thompson offices.
</P>
<P>
   At KBE, one initial assignment comes from a partnership between
the Columbia Tristar Television Group, a division of Sony Pictures
Entertainment, and Children's Television Workshop, the nonprofit
company that developed ``Sesame Street.'' KBE is working on
projects for ``Sesame Street'' and will provide services including
advertising, interactive marketing and promotions for ``Dragon
Tales,'' a new animated series aimed at preschool children that is
to be broadcast by PBS in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about developing a brand, not just a successful
show,'' said Sherrie Rollins Westin, executive vice president for
marketing, communications and research at the workshop in New York.
``The launch of KBE speaks to bringing brand-building sensibilities
to entertainment and media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dragon Tales,'' featuring cartoon characters with names like
Cassie, Ord, Quetzal and the two-headed Zak &AMP; Wheelie, is being
produced by a new group at Sony Pictures Entertainment in Culver
City, Calif., devoted to television shows, movies and videos for
children and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the continuing fragmentation of the marketplace,
producers will have to take on more responsibility to supplement
the networks' efforts with their own show promotion,'' said Sander
Schwartz, president of the new group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks at Kirshenbaum Bond have shown an ability to
distinguish products of clients from the clutter and the
competition,'' he added, referring to work for Snapple and Target.
``I'm excited about them doing the same for `Dragon Tales.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another initial assignment for KBE comes from Radio City
Entertainment in New York, part of the Madison Square Garden
division of Cablevision Systems; Kirshenbaum Bond has handled
assignments for the company's Broadway musical, ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel.'' KBE's work will include campaigns for productions of
``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``A Christmas Carol'' and a Halloween
attraction with the entertaining name of Madison Scare Garden.
</P>
<P>
   KBE begins with about 10 employees under the direction of Jeff
Peters, 39, vice president and account director, and James
Hitchcock, 35, vice president and creative director. Peters joined
from (coincidentally) Thompson New York, where he had been a vice
president and marketing manager. Hitchcock had been a vice
president and associate creative director at Kirshenbaum Bond on
accounts like Target.
</P>
<P>
   Peters and Hitchcock will report to Jonathan Bond and Richard
Kirshenbaum, the co-chairmen at Kirshenbaum Bond.

   &UR; TWO GUYS FROM VERONA: A NOVEL OF SUBURBIA. &LR;  By James Kaplan.
Grove, $13. Set in an affluent New Jersey suburb in the very near
future, this bittersweet novel focuses on two middle-aged buddies _
one a prosperous businessman, the other a slacker _ whose lives are
shaken up when they attend their 25th high school reunion. The
result is ``a complex and often moving meditation on the passage of
time,'' Tom Perrotta wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TERRA INCOGNITA: TRAVELS IN ANTARCTICA. &LR;  By Sara Wheeler.
Modern Library, $12.95. In this irreverent travelogue, a British
journalist describes her love affair with a continent, its history
and the people who are drawn to a place that spends half the year
in darkness. Last year our reviewer, Michael Parfit, praised the
author's ``gifts of observation and language'' and her
``straightforward narrative of characters, landscape and personal
change.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; OUTSIDE PASSAGE: A
MEMOIR OF AN ALASKAN CHILDHOOD &LR; , by Julia Scully ($12.95), an
account of the author's hardscrabble youth, which led her from
Depression-era San Francisco to Alaska, where she lived with her
mother and sister in Nome during the winter and a remote mining
district during the summer. In this ``plain but lovely'' memoir,
``the subdued rhetoric of directness has a grace equal to a more
heightened rhetoric,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in these pages in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAMASCUS GATE. &LR;  By Robert Stone. Scribner, $14. The hero of
this complex novel is a skeptical American journalist living in
Israel who stumbles onto a plot by various fanatical groups to blow
up the Temple Mount, thus paving the way for the Second Coming.
Last year our reviewer, Jonathan Rosen, said Stone ``has faced his
novel with the literary equivalent of Jerusalem stone, the luminous
chiseled rock that lends authenticity to almost every building in
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEAST IN THE NURSERY: ON CURIOSITY AND OTHER THOUGHTS. &LR;  By
Adam Phillips. Vintage, $12. A British therapist argues that the
essential mission of psychoanalysis is to explore and treat
curiosity disorders and thereby enable suffering adults to witness
the world again with a child's blissfully wide-open eyes. Last year
our reviewer, Stephen Greenblatt, called this a ``lively and
intelligent book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNION STREET &AMP; BLOW YOUR HOUSE DOWN. &LR;  By Pat Barker. Picador
USA, $15. The British author's first two novels have been reissued
in a single volume. ``Union Street'' portrays the bleak lives of
seven working-class women struggling to get by in an unnamed city
in England's industrial north. In 1983 in the Book Review, Ivan
Gold called this ``a first-rate first novel'' marked by ``pungent,
raunchy, North Country dialogue'' and ``passages of fine
understated wit.'' ``Blow Your House Down'' explores the lives of
women in a similar grim urban setting, but this time they are
prostitutes being stalked by a serial killer. ``Barker is able to
make us see her characters from within, as they see themselves,''
Katha Pollitt wrote in 1984, calling the novel ``swift, spare and
utterly absorbing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO TIME TO DIE: LIVING WITH OVARIAN CANCER. &LR;  By Liz Tilberis
with Aimee Lee Ball. Avon, $14. The former editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar chronicled her recurring struggle with ovarian
cancer and her crusade to raise awareness of the disease as well as
her eventful life in the fashion business. Tilberis, who died last
month at the age of 51, ``sounds genuinely likable and down to
earth'' in this ``frank, often moving and surprisingly funny
memoir,'' Katherine Bouton wrote here in 1998.  &UR; CURING CANCER: THE
STORY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF OUR DEADLIEST
ILLNESS &LR; , by Michael Waldholz (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14),
focuses on the researchers responsible for the genetic
breakthroughs in cancer research in the last decade and the ethical
dramas that have emerged from their successes. ``The result reads
like an adventure story,'' Andrea Cooper wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR. &LR;  By John Irving. Ballantine, $14.95. The
four main characters in this freewheeling novel are all writers,
but the action is dominated by the youngest of them, Ruth Cole,
whose outrageous adventures feature the author's trademark brew of
sexual farce and sudden brutality. `` `A Widow for One Year' seems
to me the best story John Irving has as yet contrived,'' William H.
Pritchard wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIN ICE. &LR;  By Bruce McCall. Vintage, $14. In this withering
memoir, a writer and illustrator recalls his dismal youth in
Canada, land of the modest and early to bed, and how his growing
pains drove him to escape to the rowdier nation to the south.
``McCall's revenge on the land that bore (and bored) him is to make
its tedium richly funny,'' Blake Morrison said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AND BOTH SHALL ROW: A NOVELLA AND STORIES. &LR;  By Beth Lordan.
Picador USA, $12. These tales feature unglamorous country folks in
the Midwest whose small moments of intense clarity transcend words
and cannot be named, only described. In 1998 our reviewer, Robert
Houston, called this ``a fine, strong collection, written in a
voice that's utterly assured and utterly distinctive.''

REAL NETWORKS PLANS TO OFFER CD SOFTWARE FOR USE ON PC
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may be the most ambitious digital-age
challenge yet to the nation's recording industry, Real Networks, a
leading maker of Internet audio software, plans to announce on
Monday a system designed to let consumers copy, store and play
audio compact discs on personal computers. The system is also
designed to enable people to play music transmitted via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The software, Real Jukebox, will record and play music in
several technical formats including G2, a format developed by Real
Networks, and the increasingly popular MP3 standard that is widely
used by Internet music enthusiasts to swap music files, often
without regard for copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Networks announcement comes as the music recording
industry attempts to hammer out a digital music technology standard
that would protect intellectual property on the Internet. Monday's
announcement seems certain to intensify the debate over music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Real Jukebox is meant to conform to copyright law by means of an
electronic ``tether'' that restricts digital copies of the audio
CDs to the hard drive of the user's personal computer; that would
supposedly limit consumers to making but a single copy of a music
file for their personal use. But the software will give users the
option of shutting off the tethering feature.
</P>
<P>
   That would make it possible to attach a copy of a CD track or an
entire CD to an electronic mail message and send it to any number
of friends _ the kind of unfettered distribution that the recording
industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks executives said the company was actively
supporting a variety of copy protection standards, but that it was
also attempting to educate users about the balance between personal
use and intellectual property violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can turn the tethering feature off, but we remind them
that they can't legally take a file and mail it to 100 friends,''
Rob Glaser, chairman and chief executive of Real Networks, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A user who turns the tether feature off will see an on-screen
dialog box that explains the relevant issues of the Home Audio
Recording Act, a 1992 federal law enacted when digital audio tape,
or DAT, recorders were introduced to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That law allowed individuals to make a single digital copy of a
copyrighted recording for personal use, but barred further copying
and distribution of the recording to others. In reality, though,
adherence to law depends on the honor system.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser drew an analogy between his company's efforts and those
of manufacturers who produce automobiles that clearly have the
ability to exceed speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that sometimes I go 57 or 59 or sometimes when I'm
late for a flight, I go 70 and then I feel a little guilty,'' he
said. ``So far on the digital highway, the road hasn't had any
warning signs. This is the software equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks already has standing in the digital music
community by dint of its Real Audio software, the leading software
used for so-called streaming audio _ the broadcast-like
transmission over the Internet of radio programming and other
multimedia Web services. The company says that 60 million people
are registered users of Real Audio.
</P>
<P>
   One significant feature of Real Jukebox, which will be available
both in free and commercial versions, is that it will permit PC
users to make a copy of an audio CD in a fraction of the time it
takes to play it at normal speed _ and to do so even while listing
to the CD on a personal computer. A test version will be available
on Monday for downloading from the Real Networks site on the World
Wide Web, www.realnetworks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Real Networks' tethering strategy will appease the
recording industry is yet to be determined. The Recording Industry
Association of America, an industry group, went to court last year
to try to block distribution of the Rio, a portable player made by
Diamond Multimedia that enables consumers to listen to MP3 computer
files.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a California appeals court heard the
industry association's appeal of judge's refusal to issue a
preliminary injunction banning the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Real Networks announcement on Monday, the company
plans to say that Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., under its RCA
consumer brand, will produce a portable Jukebox Networks player.
Glaser said on Friday that he was in discussions with other
consumer electronics companies that planned to build playback
devices, which he said would reach the market later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the recording industry, which is at work on these
various issues under an effort called the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, has a stated goal of establishing a standard
copyright-protecting format that could be incorporated into
portable players that would reach stores by Christmas. In practical
terms, that would mean providing specifications to electronics
manufacturers by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the group behind the digital music initiative is deeply
divided. Among the most contentious of the unresolved issues is
whether new devices should be able to play music recorded not only
with a new, copyright-secure standard but also recordings made with
the existing, nonsecured MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Jukebox approach seems to be an acknowledgment that the
pirate-friendly MP3 format has such momentum that the recording
industry will have difficulty extinguishing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honor system being offered by Real Networks is the wild
card,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a
consumer electronics and computer industry consulting firm. ``The
Real Networks system is one of the brands that stands a chance of
gaining wide adoption, and this could raise the ire of the music
industry to a whole new degree.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Real Networks system also comes during a period of intensive
innovation and competition between different digital encoding and
compression schemes. Within the last month, both Apple Computer
Inc. and the Microsoft Corp. have introduced their own software for
digital Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   The various competitors are making a range of claims about audio
quality and compression efficiency. Currently, MP3 files require
about a megabyte of storage for each minute of audio playback, but
a number of the proprietary schemes do a much better job with
compression _ meaning that music can be stored in less space on the
user's hard disk. But any compression system has trouble competing
with the sound quality of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lower quality audio of Internet music will prove a
mrket factor is still to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where religion comes in,'' said Steve Fields, a
marketing executive at Pacific Microsonics, a Silicon Valley
company that has developed a technology for improving the audio
quality of CDs. ``In many cases, some of these formats will sound
fine to the untrained ear. But, emphatically, this is not
CD-quality audio.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not matter to the Internet audio market, according to
Doherty. ``These are matters that are highly subjective and age
dependent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Real Networks software may ultimately be
that it will permit computer users to build and exchange personal
playlists of songs. Personal computers, Glaser said, offer a level
of control over the sequence of musical selections that is not
possible with today's CD players.
</P>
<P>
   Real Jukebox will also be designed to work with Internet music
sites to permit users to use music search engines, download
recordings and purchase music over the Internet. The company said
Real Jukebox will incorporate Internet music distribution standards
now being developed by both IBM and AT&AMP;T.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Damp and chilly conditions will cover portions of the Middle
Atlantic and southern New England Coasts Monday as bands of showers
circulate westward around low pressure over the Atlantic Ocean. The
westward migration of the Atlantic moisture will cause clouds and
light sprinkles to reach as far west as the central Appalachians
and interior New England by afternoon. Meanwhile, strong high
pressure over Eastern Canada will thwart the northward advance of
the inclement weather, allowing sunny and warm weather to persist
over northern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly sunny skies will also cover the Southeast and Florida
Monday with comfortable humidity levels. Farther west, however,
southerly breezes from the Gulf of Mexico will fuel numerous
showers and isolated thunderstorms across eastern Texas and the
Mississippi Valley. Another area of showers will develop over the
northern Plains ahead of a cold front approaching from the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will cover the Northwest and northern Rockies
Monday as a fast-moving flow of air from the west imports Pacific
moisture inland. Showers will be generally intermittent though a
period of steadier, heavier rain will occur near the Washington
Coast as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead. Snow will whiten
the Cascades above 5,000 feet as the air is further moistened and
cooled upon ascending the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and warm conditions will cover the Southwestern deserts
while southern California stays dry though filaments of cirrus
clouds will dim the sun at times.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Florida Chill
</P>
<P>
   Numerous record low temperatures were established across Florida
this past weekend. Miami and Tampa fell to 60 and 52 degrees
respectively while at Orlando the mercury fell to 54, causing the
city to have its second consecutive day of record cold. Clear
skies, light winds in combination with unusually dry air over the
peninsula has prompted to the records. Humid air, which contains
high amounts of water vapor, cools at a slow rate because the water
vapor molecule is an efficient absorber of energy emitted by the
ground. Since dry air contains less water vapor, it cools at an
accelerated rate.

FEARFUL EYE: KEEPING WATCH ON SEX OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDI VILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The house near the middle of East Driftwood Drive
looked just like any other on the block, save for the perfectly
manicured pansies, petunias and geraniums that beckoned the
attention of passersby.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before police showed up in this idyllic south Tempe
neighborhood, papering it with bright pink fliers, knocking on some
500 doors and inviting residents to a community forum. (Tempe is
near Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   The man who had cultivated such beautiful blooms was a convicted
sex offender. Things in the Lakes community changed.
</P>
<P>
   At the grocery store, a mother grabbed her young son's arm and
pointed to ``the bad man.'' Women veered off the sidewalk into the
middle of the street when they reached the block where the man
lived. Families stopped letting their children play in the front
yard without supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a natural reaction,'' said Roger Glenn, 57, the
man who had altered the dynamics of the neighborhood. ``But if they
talked to me, they'd get a different opinion. I'm not a danger.
Just give me a chance and I'll prove it. I don't need to go back.
I'm too old for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, more and more neighborhoods are being alerted
when a sex offender moves in. The year-long experience of the Lakes
shows how such news can pit neighbor against neighbor, with some
camped firmly against sex offenders like Glenn, saying their pasts
automatically make them a danger, and others arguing that they
should get another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both sides find themselves forced to to confront
their fears, their prejudices and their notions of forgiveness. And
both sides ultimately change the way they live.
</P>
<P>
   Front gates in the Lakes were locked more than they weren't.
Doors got second deadbolts. Annette Capuchino got up three or four
times a night to check her house and make sure it was secure. She
bought a gun and obtained a concealed weapons permit. Pat Akey no
longer went outside after dark, yet she refused to buy
pepper-spray.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind notification is to create safer neighborhoods by
arming potential victims with the knowledge they need to protect
themselves. But is notification merely creating unnecessary
hysteria and hampering offenders from becoming productive members
of society?
</P>
<P>
   Fear is pervasive in newly notified neighborhoods, from the
mother who stands on the porch and watches her children walk two
doors down, to the dads who dust off their bikes to accompany
tikes, to the lady down the street who starts shooing kids toward
home when the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Capuchino could be watching a movie when ``all of a
sudden I get this fear he's right there.'' She drove her daughter,
Alicia, to school each morning, even though it was a five-minute
walk, and Alicia had to call and check in the minute she got home
in the afternoon. She wasn't allowed to walk up to the store or to
ride her new 10-speed bike alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm getting a phobia,'' Capuchino said. ``But I need to
do everything I can to feel safe and I don't. I don't like living
next to this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't slip up. You can't be comfortable. Not with the
person this close. I'm mad and I'm scared. I had to change my life
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuchino saved $2,200 over three years to be able to move to
the Lakes with 15-year-old Alicia. She had been living in south
Phoenix but figured the Lakes, with its prestige and its better
schools and nicer houses would make her feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong,'' Capuchino said simply.
</P>
<P>
   She is moving when her lease expires at the end of the month.
(May) Capuchino said it's wrong that area residents had to change
their lifestyles around one man, and it's not fair that they had to
live always ``on our guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever saw him, I'd probably spit on him,'' Capuchino said.
``Maybe he is a nice man, but I wouldn't want to know him like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She is looking for a home in north Phoenix. Her first question
to any leasing agent, she says, will be ``Do you know of any
registered sex offenders in the area?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that homeowners have to answer honestly, and one
where a ``Yes'' likely means their property values will be
significantly affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakes is generally a friendly area, with tree-lined streets,
well-traveled bike lanes and man-made lakes. It's a mix of retirees
and families, but the people moving in seem to be getting younger.
The homes and townhouses are well-kept, and some people dock boats
to their back patios. Rover Elementary School, Fees Junior High
School and Marcos de Niza High School are minutes away on foot.
There are two day care centers within a mile or so and parks, one
at the end of Glenn's street.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing anyone expected was to hear that a sex offender
had moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Most found out about Glenn when they arrived home on a cold
December day to the pink flier stuck in their doors. ``SEX OFFENDER
NOTIFICATION,'' it said in bold black letters.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn served 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in 1987
to attempted sexual assault and attempted kidnapping. The victim
was a 33-year-old woman who met Glenn when she was looking for a
job at his bar.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told police that Glenn became violent when she shunned
his sexual advances after a night of drinking and that he pulled
off her sweater and punched her in the mouth, fracturing her jaw.
Glenn insists that the woman persisted in calling him even after he
filled the bartending position and that she took off her own shirt
and injured her jaw when she fell and hit her head on a table while
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn hasn't had a drink since then and he maintains that the
woman leveled the charges in the hopes of getting a financial
settlement. He says that he pleaded guilty because he thought he
would get probation. He was 44 years old and didn't have any
history of sex crimes. His past convictions were mainly for
white-collar crimes stemming from his ownership in Detroit of a
mortgage and real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think,'' Glenn said of his past, ``but I know
myself. I'm not really a bad person. . . I'm going forward. I'm not
going backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to dwell on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn would have moved quietly into the Lakes last May, but he
made a mistake in registering after he was released from prison two
years ago: He listed his address as a P.O. Box. Police tracked him
down in August and arrested him for failing to register as a sex
offender. He is now on three years' probation for that.
</P>
<P>
   The community notification was done at the Lakes in early
December. Glenn, residents were told, was ranked Level 3, meaning
he was in the group considered most likely to reoffend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Educational materials, including information about community
notification, registration requirements, sex offender facts and
personal safety rules for children, were provided to Lakes
residents at a forum held three days after the notification.
Residents also were reminded that it's against the law to threaten
or harass a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   That warning may have spared Glenn the harassment that has
occasionally popped up across the country: vandalism, picketing,
beatings and verbal assaults. A single incident of a house burning
has been documented. And an Oregon offender had a gun pointed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In September 1996, someone burned a Scottsdale man's bushes
after his conviction for statutory rape and child rape was revealed
in anonymous fliers. The man slipped away from the neighborhood, in
the dark, four days later. His neighbors said they were proud of
what they'd done, hugged each other and watched their children
cheering that ``the bad man's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More commonly, neighbors rally against sex offenders, making it
so uncomfortable for them that they either move away or decide not
to move in at all. Some offenders find themselves evicted or
repeatedly turned down for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``It used to be a societal value that you pay your debt to
society then go about trying to rebuild your life,'' said Eleanor
Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona Civil Liberties Union.
``. . . I really don't understand the mentality that is more
interested in vengeance and punishment than in trying to remedy the
problem. We're not letting them move on and get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's just not realistic to expect society to give sex
offenders warm welcomes, equal privacy rights and immediate
acceptance, says David Beatty, the director of public policy for
the National Center for Victims of Crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they have paid their debt to society doesn't mean
they have earned the trust of society. That is not instantaneous
just because they walked out of the prison gates,'' Beatty says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Glenn tried to fit in. He kept his home immaculate
and planted fresh flowers as soon as the old ones wilted. He and
his girlfriend kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy doing what I'm doing now,'' Glenn said. ``I'm very
comfortable where I'm at. I like my freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't see his neighbors much. He got up every morning in
the dark and strolled through the neighborhood streets. With two
Diet Pepsis and two bananas, he reported to work at a Tempe travel
agency at 9 a.m. He took a two-hour lunch and worked, setting
appointments over the phone, until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a responsible person, in my eyes, in our society,'' said
Bill Fautsch, Glenn's boss. ``He pays his taxes. He just bought a
new car. He jogs. He's physically fit. This is not the animal they
typecast him as.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But a few neighbors initially wanted to circulate a petition
forcing Glenn to move. In the end, they changed their own lives
instead and learned to co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the idea of forgiving is there,'' said Akey, the block
watch captain on Glenn's block. ``. . . If he's on the level now,
if this is what should be, then maybe we should let it be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, forgiving is not an easy thing in neighborhoods where sex
offenders have moved in. Many find themselves unable to look past
the crime, especially if it involves children. And while some say
they are willing to dole out second chances to thieves or drug
addicts, sex offenders are held to a different set of standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been proven in a court of law as a sex offender and you
should be treated like one,'' Capuchino said. ``You should be
feared. He wants to walk around free and live a normal life, and I
don't think he should. I won't accept him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Geffen represented the other side of the debate. She's
``not a bleeding heart liberal,'' but Geffen prefered ``to believe
the best of him, that that night was a one-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I think everyone can make one mistake,'' Geffen said,
expressing an unpopular viewpoint. ``Any one of us, given the taste
or the temptation, might do something that we bitterly regret. I'm
sure there's not one of us who hasn't done something that we wish
we could take back, something that we say we'd give a year of our
life to take back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat out his 10 years and he deserves a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Statistically, there isn't any difference in the recidivism
rates of sex offenders who had been subject to notification and
those who had not, according to a 1995 study by the Washington
State Institute of Public Policy. However, the study did find that
offenders subject to community notification were arrested much more
quickly than comparable offenders who hadn't been subject to
notification.
</P>
<P>
   Of 125 of the most dangerous sex offenders released from
Washington State prisons between March 1, 1990 and Dec. 31, 1993,
18 of them, or 14 percent, were arrested for new sex offenses
within 54 months. And 63 percent of the new sex offenses occured in
the same jurisdiction where notification took place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Geffen said she never felt threatened or scared by
Glenn's presence. In fact, she still would greet him if she saw him
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not condoning what he did. I think it's utterly
disgusting,'' Geffen said. ``If I had my druthers, of course, I'd
rather he not live down the street from me, but I just think the
poor guy has to live somewhere. And until he does something to
prove the opposite, he deserves a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   If he reoffends, she said, lock him up and throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   Others found themselves unable to separate the intellect from
the emotion, the acceptance from the fear, the forgiveness from the
lingering prejudices. Although willing to concede that Glenn might
someday be able to prove himself to society and earn a second
chance, Akey steadfastly refused to be naive and say this
definitely wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   In her most liberal days 20 years ago, Akey would have
befriended Glenn. She used to say, ``Hello'' to him, but once she
knew who he was, Akey admitted, ``I would put my head down, look
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel he should have a second chance but on the
way is he going to hurt somebody who doesn't deserve to be hurt?''
Akey said. ``There's still that little bit of a fear. It is too
bad. I would hate to have that happen to me. I wouldn't want people
to hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fautsch, Glenn's boss, said he understands society's
apprehension about sex offenders, but he said that Glenn completed
the sentence that society handed down and it doesn't seem fair that
people judge him so harshly and won't let him move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line?'' Fautsch asked. ``It's OK for
Clinton to do what he did. Here I've got a fellow who comes to me
and is open and tells me about his crime, and he's persecuted for
it. It stung Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To make everything black and white and not make anything a
grey area, it's sad. He's a genuine and sincere individual. He has
changed. . . He just wants to finish his life in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says he has everything to lose if he doesn't toe the line,
and he's not willing to throw it all away. Rather, like many
others, he just wants to do his job, pay his bills and put
something away for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any trouble,'' Glenn said. ``I just want to fit
in. I just work hard and try to be a good person, and it'll all
take care of itself, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But on an overcast day late last week, (THURS 4/29. GLENN TURNED
IN THE KEYS TO HIS LANDLORD ON FRIDAY 4/30.) moving vans pulled up
to the house on Driftwood Drive and Glenn packed his things inside.
Neighbors let out a big hoorah: Glenn is buying a house somewhere
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And another neighborhood will be notified about a sex offender
in its midst. Another neighborhood will be forced to confront its
intolerance. Another neighborhood will change the way it lives. &QL;

   &UR; THE FRENCH FRY AS METAPHOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Manhattan,  &UR; Firat Yener  &LR; forwards a clipping from the
New York Post, in which supermodel  &UR; Irina Pantaeva &LR;  describes her
``love affair with the American french fry,'' which started when
she arrived in Manhattan, hoping ``that some day I would be able to
afford as many french fries as I wanted. ... They were like my
life: simple and unpretentious, full of struggle and promise.''
</P>
<P>
   As her career took off, writes Pantaeva, she was able to eat in
fancy restaurants ``where I could see the movie stars and
celebrities sitting across the room and enjoying fries just like
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``French fries unify old and young,'' she writes, ``rich and
poor; they are everywhere, shining its (sic) golden light on our
life, making it easy to digest the days, simplify the choices while
extending their welcome to breakfast, lunch and dinner. ... The
mighty french fries! One can only admire them.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Melissa Calavan &LR; , a high school student, writes to say
that when her grandmother gave her and her sister a card last
Christmas from the Heifer Project International ``saying that she
had donated a llama to some hungry person in our name,'' they were
horrified to think that the llama would be eaten. (Its purpose was
to aid in farmwork.) But is there any justice in the avian world?

<P>
   -  &UR; Sharon Braz  &LR; overheard a fellow BART passenger speaking on a
cell phone in Chinese, her voice getting louder and angrier as the
conversation continued. ``It became impossible to ignore her,''
writes Braz. ``More and more of the riders began to stare, since
her voice was rather intrusive.'' When she hung up at the end of
the conversation, she noticed the people staring, smiled and said
in English, ``It was my mother.'' The eavesdroppers nodded, writes
Braz, in instant understanding.
</P>
<P>
   - On her TV special last week about great women of the 20th
century,  &UR; Barbara Walters  &LR; asked  &UR; Jane Fonda &LR;  what woman had
influenced her the most. &UR; Coco Chanel &LR; , answered Fonda, who has
metamorphosed from actress to political activist to exercise
dervish to model wife. ``She freed us from the corset. Women don't
pass out today.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Lamar Alexander &LR;  revealed to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that
he used peroxide to color his hair orange _ the color of the
Tennessee Vols _ when he was a teen- &LR; ager, but he said his rebel
phase was not serious, and ``I didn't get arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   - If you want to know what good taste is right now, Elle
magazine advises, ``Crunch something. It's not about creamy or
chewy anymore.'' That's one more reason  &UR; Dennis Elliott &LR;  should
have stayed away from that Clover Stornetta chocolate milk he
bought recently that carried an expiration date of May 4, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Isaac Mizrahi &LR; , who closed his clothing business last year,
is previewing a cabaret show in New York this week. He hopes to
open off-Broadway in the fall, says the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE DRINK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Robert Kennedy Jr. &LR; , environmental lawyer, told New York
magazine that he believes in the Newman's Own brand of bottled
water, sold by  &UR; Paul Newman &LR; , because he thinks that the public has
a right to potable tap water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a political choice to drink bottled water,'' he said.
``We felt that this was the best place to educate the consumer that
we can't turn our backs on the public water supply.'' Selling
bottled water helps save tap water, he explained, sort of. ``It's
like diverting money from private schools back into the public
schools. I drink New York City tap water.''
</P>
<P>
   - Reading the newsletter of Poipu Ocean View Resorts Inc.,
 &UR; Richard O'Lone &LR;  came upon that company's plans to create a $14
million water park in Oahu, bringing to that desolate place
``waterfalls, lagoons and island vegetation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sliding pay scale. It's about putting butts into seats.
... They could have put anybody in `Jurassic Park.' The dinosaurs
were the stars of that one. `Die Hard' is a Bruce Willis vehicle,
and that's cool _ I knew that going in. But it could have been a
run-of-the-mill chase movie. Put people like me and Jeremy Irons in
it, and you have real human beings alongside that superman, John
McClane. So we do bring something to the party.''

<P>
   -  &UR; Samuel L. Jackson &LR;  assessing his roles in the movies, in

earned a total of $1.2 billion, more than any other actor's movies
have earned.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

Yugoslavia, as Clinton's top Russia hand hinted at U.S. flexibility
on the composition of a Kosovo peacekeeping force, the central area

   COPYCATS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ SWAT teams and bomb disposal
squads are showing up on school grounds with the regularity of
visiting football teams. Parents are wondering if the school year
is effectively finished. Teachers watch warily for bulging back
packs. Students look over their shoulders. Since the Colorado high
school massacre 13 days ago, more than a dozen Florida middle and
high school students have been questioned by police after making
specific threats to blow up or shoot teachers and students. Several
were suspended, a few arrested. Across the country, hundreds of
bomb threats have been reported at schools. A monotonous litany of
copycat calls and written warnings kept thousands out of class. On
Friday, many schools closed because of rumored violence, some tied
to the anniversary of Hitler's suicide. All of these incidents are
news because they affected families and educators in communities
coast to coast. Still, questions must be asked about how direct a
connection there is between each incident and the shootings at

 &HT;    McGwire, hot Tatis start week in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The St. Louis Cardinals bring their history-making
home run hitter to town tonight for a three-game series against the
Braves. But things are different this time.
</P>
<P>
   No one has asked for a pre-game press conference with Fernando
Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that McGwire guy is still around. But the Cardinal making
headlines now is third baseman Fernando Tatis, who made history a
week ago in Los Angeles by hitting two grand slams in the same
inning.
</P>
<P>
   He's among the National League home run leaders with eight.
McGwire, who set the all-time home run mark with 70 last season,
has a rather ordinary five in the first 22 games this year. No
matter, the Braves still expect huge crowds for Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Already, one fan has called the Braves to find out if the
Cardinals will be taking batting practice. Answer: Yes, the
visitors will hit today and Tuesday at 6:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are still available. Ticket manager Paul Adams said the
Braves are already looking at 36,000 for both Monday and Tuesday
nights and more than 43,000 for Wednesday's 1:10 p.m. business
man's special.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's three-game series in August against St. Louis set an
all-time Atlanta attendance record of 150,096. The first game of
that series ranks as the fifth-largest crowd (50,662) at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get here, there'll be a different kind of excitement
because Mac is here,'' said Braves pitcher Tom Glavine, who will
start tonight against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did last year is forever and that'll bring attention
to him wherever he goes,'' Glavine said. ``We expect as players
that there'll be a lot more excitement here and people rooting for
McGwire, that kind of stuff, just like they were last year. But the
fact they're coming here so early probably takes a little bit of
the luster off what it was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the series does have center fielder Brian Jordan's
attention. He played for the Cards last year. ``It'll be nice to
see my old teammates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be seeing an improved Cards team. St. Louis jumped off to
a good start with some surprisingly effective pitching. Kent
Bottenfield is 4-0 with a league-leading 1.53 earned run average.
Jose Jimenez, who pitches against Glavine tonight, is 2-1 despite a
5.40 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Mac, whose homer on opening day did not indicate
he'd struggle through April?
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, Mac will warm up,'' Jordan said. ``He's a
great-enough hitter that he makes adjustments, works really hard.
Mac will be there in the end.''

 &HT;    Elway bows out on top as retirement announced
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over 16 seasons John Elway performed with the
dispassionate precision of a surgeon, rallying the Denver Broncos
to comeback victories a league-record 47 times either in the fourth
quarter or overtime. When it came time for the final end-game
gambit of his storied career, however, Elway could no longer
control his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   For all his celebrated improvisational abilities, Elway on
Sunday afternoon finally got caught in a pressure situation the
quarterback couldn't calmly scramble beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a bet to Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski over how many
times he would cry during his official retirement announcement, the
future Hall of Fame passer tearfully acknowledged that the
worst-kept secret of the past week certainly represented the
best-case scenario for he and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never want to stop competing, but I just can't compete in
this game anymore at the level I need to,'' said Elway, who fought
back tears right from the start of a 30-minute press conference.
''I just can't do it physically anymore . . . and that's really
hard for me to admit. For 16 years, though, my family has focused
their lives around football. Now it's time for our lives to focus
around them.''
</P>
<P>
   In consummating a decision Elway revealed to close friends two
weeks ago, but which he delayed making public out of deference to
the victims of the masscare at Columbine High School, he opted for
health over the potential of becoming the first quarterback to win
three straight Super Bowl titles. Despite missing only 15 games to
injuries during his career, Elway, who turns 39 next month,
underwent 12 surgeries. While his career is marked by gaudy passing
statistics, a number that cannot be ignored is that he also was
sacked an NFL-record 559 times.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons alone, Elway was forced to overcome
shoulder, biceps, ankle, rib and hamstring injuries and several
doctors have advised that he eventually will require knee
replacement surgery. In addition, his wife Janet last summer had
extensive colon surgery and her lengthy recovery was difficult on
the couple and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and children, Elway was joined by his mother
and father, owner Pat Bowlen, coach Mike Shanahan and dozens of
teammates past and present for a moment everyone has known was
coming for the past week. For father Jack Elway, who coached his
son at Stanford, the moment was both bittersweet and balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my opinion,'' Jack Elway said, ''he could have played at a
high level for several more years. But to see what he's been
through the last few seasons, this is understandable. Sixteen years
in this league is a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically the retirement came on the 16th anniversary of the
May 2, 1983 trade that sent Elway, the first selection in that
year's draft, from the then-Baltimore Colts to the Broncos. In
attendance Sunday was former Broncos owner Edgar Kaiser, who made
the swap with late Colts owner Robert Irsay, a man personally
angered by Elway's vow that he would never play in Baltimore. In
exchange for Elway, the Colts received career backup quarterback
Mark Herrmann, standout offensive tackle Chris Hinton and Denver's
top pick in the 1984 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade, the Colts have won just 98 games and never
advanced to a Super Bowl. By comparison, Elway holds the NFL record
for regular-season victories by a starting quarterback (148) and
Super Bowl starts (five). Still, his brilliant tenure was
overshadowed by frustration and his Super Bowl failures until the
last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning those Super Bowls kind of sprinkled him with
stardust,'' said New York Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi, who
held the same position with Baltimore in 1983 and opposed Irsay on
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is Elway ranks among the top six quarterbacks of
the modern era and Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman, arguably the
father of the sophisticated aerial game, rates him the most
talented athlete at the position. It was trademark competitiveness,
though, which marked Elway's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being out there on Sunday afternoons, with the game on the
line and having to make a big play, that's what I'll miss the
most,'' Elway said.
</P>

COMPANIES THAT IGNORE ONLINE SECURITY ARE RISKING COSTUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Pa., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To placate those who worry about how secure it is to shop
online, companies typically say that buying on the Internet is no
more risky than giving a credit card to a waiter in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent reports of e-commerce security lapses, that analogy
may be giving waiters a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives agree that a vast majority of e-commerce
sites are secure, but some say the trend may actually be heading in
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies so fear being overtaken by a competitor who got
to the Web first _ of ``getting Amazoned,'' in the industry
vernacular _ that they rush past security issues in their zeal to
establish a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies lack the technical knowledge to use security
safeguards; others say they cannot afford security products and
advice. And there are those who simply do not consider it a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a dollar for every one of my clients that said,
`I don't care if the transaction is really secure; I just need my
customers to think it is,' '' said Larry Erlich, partner at
Domainregistry.com, a Philadelphia company that registers Internet
addresses and provides Web consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of one recently disclosed security problem, though,
the issue seems to have been not a lack of concern by the Internet
retailers but a limited technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a Seattle Internet service provider, Blarg
Online, reported that several software products that were used to
create the ``shopping cart'' technology employed by some Web
retailers could leave credit card numbers and other personal data
exposed on a company's server, if the software was improperly
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to get at that information simply needed to type a
few words and numbers into a search engine like Alta Vista, and
they would have been able to get access to a compromised site's
data files. The makers of the software say they have addressed the
problem, but industry experts said problems involving other
software and other Web sites could follow closely behind.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, said David Taylor, a vice president at the Gartner
Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm, is that many Internet
companies have realized the value in collecting and selling
customer data, ``and in their quest for that data, people are being
less than judicious about how they gather that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the leading Internet companies are not immune to security
problems. Earlier this month, for example, Yahoo acknowledged that
customer data of one of its merchants had been exposed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident, customers of Vitanet, a retailer of
nutritional products, had their addresses, order information and
partial credit card numbers posted on a demonstration site that
Yahoo had set up for study by would-be Web merchants. Only after
being alerted to the security lapse several weeks later did Yahoo
correct the problem, which it attributed to a software bug.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that stumble by Yahoo, many experts say that those most
vulnerable to security flaws are small and medium-size sites.
First, smaller operations often lack the money to hire security
auditors _ which can cost $15,000 or more for a one-week sweep of a
site _ and they generally lack the internal expertise to perform
such audits themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Second, because they typically operate with a lean technical
staff, such sites tend to rely on one software vendor for security
needs. In fact, it requires more than one type of software to
secure a site, security experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some consultants say it is really not very expensive to
provide at least a basic level of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going ballistic with security, you could spend a lot
of money,'' said Mamoon Yunus, a regional manager for i.Informix,
the e-commerce division of the computer services company Informix.
But otherwise, he said, ``it needn't cost a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, software designed to encrypt customer information
as it travels to the seller, such as that sold by Verisign, costs
$350 a year. And through companies like Cybercash, e-commerce sites
can get credit card encryption and processing services set up for
roughly $400, plus a fee of 20 to 25 cents a transaction. And for
as little as $30 a month, smaller merchants can get secure online
storefronts through companies like Cybercash and Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there's no reason to have a security problem,
except for a failure to do the homework,'' said Steven Kramer,
president of the Picture Palace, an online retailer of rare and
unusual movie videos.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run e-commerce sites say there is one additional issue
keeping companies from putting in elaborate security systems: the
customer's desire to move quickly through a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For increased security, customers would have to go through
multiple layers of registration and identity verification before
buying, and many would bristle at the inconvenience, said Steven
Rabin, chief technologist for Interworld, which develops sites for
a number of large retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, of Gartner Group, said that if reports of security
breakdowns continued, e-commerce companies could be under increased
pressure to regulate themselves if they do not want the government
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said more e-commerce sites should follow the lead of
Gateway, the computer seller, which includes a link to its privacy
and security statement on all of its Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, Gateway asserts that ``none of the tens of
thousands of people who have made purchases through Gateway's Web
site using SSL'' _ secure sockets layer technology _ ``have
reported fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their
online order.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if, in the event of a security breakdown, Gateway
would post information about it and the company's response, Chuck
Geiger, Gateway's vice president for e-commerce, said: ``It's a
good idea, but I'd have to consult with our legal and public
relations folks. But in terms of full disclosure and being honest,
it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that getting the entire industry to follow Gateway's
example could be difficult, though. ``The minute these companies
start talking about security, they run the risk of bringing the
party to a halt,'' he said. ``But this is something the government
could impose, because it wouldn't be expensive for a merchant to
do.''

PRIVATE DONORS UNITE TO SUPPORT ART SPURNED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen foundations and philanthropists, reacting to
cuts in federal arts spending, have joined forces to support
artists who challenge convention. The new group will attempt to
make up for some of the individual grants the federal government
ended in 1994 after years of controversy over works dealing with
nudity, sexuality and other provocative themes.
</P>
<P>
   The new nonprofit organization, called Creative Capital
Foundation, will be announced officially next week. But it has
already made it clear that it will not shy away from the kind of
innovative art that incited protests by religious and political
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a boisterous, diverse country, and we have always had
art that upsets people,'' said Archibald L. Gillies, president of
the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and one of the new
group's organizers. ``Controversy,'' he added, ``won't bother us at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital hopes to raise $40 million over the next 20
years. With current assets of more than $5 million, it plans to
make its first round of grants, totaling up to $1 million, early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The organization will actively proselytize for freedom of
expression. The grants it plans to give each year to 50 to 60
artists will requiring the winners to work with experts to develop
audiences for their art and to market it.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the late 1980s the National Endowment for the
Arts awarded as much as $10.5 million a year to more than 750
individual artists in grants of $1,100 to $45,000. But since then
the endowment has almost been eliminated several times by members
of Congress upset by those grants and by what they said was the
agency's distance from American values. It has survived, but with a
budget cut nearly in half from its peak to $98 million in the
current fiscal year and no appetite to make awards that would
restart the cultural wars of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital is stepping into that breach. ``The Supreme
Court has ruled about pornography, but anything beyond that is fair
game,'' Gillies said. ``In this organization's absolute principles,
one comes first and that is funding experimental, challenging art
on its merits. Then after selecting it, we see what the marketing
potential is. The nature of the content is not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   With such talk, Creative Capital is throwing down the gauntlet
to conservatives who in recent years have tried to shut down some
exhibitions and performances. Though the fights have most often
been about public financing of controversial art, mainly by the
endowment, some conflicts have also centered on state and local
arts grants and the commercial availability of provocative art.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Christian Coalition, Randy Tate, said on
learning on Friday of the new group: ``I won't condemn anything
until I see it, but I would hope they use great discretion and put
forward images that strengthen society and family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's grants come with a twist straight out of Wall Street
and reflecting the business background of some backers (like
Jeffrey Soros, nephew of George Soros, the billionaire financier).
Grant winners must agree to share a portion of proceeds from their
project. The cash will go back into Creative Capital's kitty,
increasing its capacity to finance additional artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Warhol Foundation, with a pledge to give $400,000 a year for
the next three years, is Creative Capital's largest contributor.
Others, including the Norton Family Foundation, the Rockefeller
Foundation, the Joe and Emily Lowe Foundation, the Joyce
Mertz-Gilmore Foundation and the Eli Broad Family Foundation, have
each promised up to $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital's executive director, Ruby Lerner, said
contributors knew that the group would seek out and not shrink from
artists like Karen Finley, who often performs in the nude and
famously smears her body in chocolate; Robert Mapplethorpe, whose
homoerotic photographs offended many, and other artists who caused
headline-making conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner said she told the contributors, ``We might get
through the first 20 years and not have a single controversy, but
we might have 50 of them in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative Capital plans to award grants of $5,000 to $20,000 to
performing, visual and film or video artists, as well as those who
make hybrid works. The money will be split roughly equally among
the four categories each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope that the culture wars are over, William J. Ivey, the
national endowment's new director, has put in a $150 million budget
request for the next fiscal year, up $52 million from the
endowment's current allocation, and has raised the possibility of
resuming individual grants. But he has made no promises about when
that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the arts say they cannot wait. ``The arts are
filled with energy, yet sources of public finance are more and more
precarious,'' said Catharine R. Stimpson, dean of the Graduate
School of Arts and Science at New York University. ``The important
issue is supporting creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stimpson has agreed to serve on Creative Capital's board, as
have Laurie Anderson, the performance artist; Lewis Hyde, the
writer; Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, and Louise A.
Velazquez, a senior business adviser at the Interval Research
Corp., a Silicon Valley company that is trying to engage the arts
and high-tech in new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   As the first big, national response to cuts in endowment grants,
Creative Capital could make a difference. But he and others agree
that an equally important effect may stem from the attempt to
enlarge the audience for contemporary art. ``Whenever individuals
engage art and artists in a personal way with good interpretation
and explanation, it always expands the audience,'' Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillies described the process that Creative Capital's founders
envisioned as broader than marketing. ``We will ask, `What does
this project need to succeed, what does an artist need to get to
the next level?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Artists will get individual advice from an array of volunteer
curators, producers, publicity agents and others who can help
artists devise a plan to present their work to the widest possible
audience.
</P>
<P>
   That plan helped woo contributors. ``Emerging artists get a lot
of one-time cash awards, but this affords them something else,''
said Dini S. Merz, a program officer at the Emily Hall Tremaine
Foundation, which is giving $300,000 over four years. ``It will
answer the question `How can we help artists help themselves?'''
</P>
<P>
   But will artists agree to such interference, and an untested
idea at that? Yong Soon Min, a Korean-born artist who lives in
California and is known for politically charged, feminist work,
said she had no problems with it. ``A marketing plan can be very
helpful,'' she said. Rather, her concerns centered on Creative
Capital's administrative ability to deliver on the promise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She appears to be typical. Ms. Lerner said that in meetings
Creative Capital has had with artists around the country not a
single one has raised objections.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue-sharing requirements apparently did not disturb
anyone either, though the details are sketchy. Ms. Lerner said they
would be worked out individually with each grant agreement, and
Gillies said Creative Capital would probably ask for 10 to 15
percent of a project's gross revenues. Creative Capital would also
have a cut if, say, a film, video or performance moved from a
nonprofit space to a commercial theater, as the musical ``Rent''
did, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The group has other plans to shore up the nation's artistic
infrastructure: an annual retreat for grant recipients, a quarterly
publication, a database of arts businesses and nonprofit groups,
public events and a Web site where artists can sell their art.
</P>
<P>
   All that is in the future. Creative Capital, with its small
staff, first has to hustle to erect a structure for doling out
money. Ms. Lerner is sending staff members into studios, theaters
and other arts centers looking for prospects, is soliciting
nominations from arts experts and on July 1 will start accepting
applications from artists.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make the initial cut will be asked for work samples, a
detailed budget for their project and a schedule. The applications
will go through a peer panel review process, with the winners
chosen or approved by the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology aside, Gillies said the winners would have projects
that have artistic merit, not simply shock value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we'll support everything controversial,'' he
said. ``We will support what people across the country are saying
is good art, is exciting, interesting art.''

COMPANIES DEVELOP ONLINE VOTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Fla., Minn., Mo., S.C., Texas, Utah, Wash.)  (rk) 
 By REBECCA RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As president of VoteHere.Net, a start-up company that builds
secure Internet voting systems, Jim Adler hears the same question
from investors again and again. They don't ask about politics or
security. They want to know what would happen if Microsoft moved
into the election business.
</P>
<P>
   Adler has a ready reply: ``Do you think the Justice Department
would let Microsoft run elections in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   VoteHere.Net, which is based in Kirkland, Wash., is one of a
handful of companies that are building systems to enable voters to
cast ballots over the Internet. Since no states allow Internet
voting _ few are even in the earliest stages of contemplating it _
the companies are focusing their efforts on building the trust of
election officials in their products and reputations.
</P>
<P>
   VoteHere.Net is new to the industry, but most of these companies
are already in the election business, selling voting machines and
computer equipment for reading ballot results, and they are
anticipating demand for Internet voting software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary focus is on continuing to sell our products and to
participate in the evolution,'' said Steve Knecht, western regional
manager for Global Election Systems. ``This is going to be a slow
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Global, based in McKinney, Texas, sells touch-screen voting
systems and equipment that scans ballot results into computers. The
company has also developed software to demonstrate how an Internet
voting system would work.
</P>
<P>
   The companies developing Internet voting products plan initially
to sell to non-governmental entities like universities, unions and
professional associations. Online elections among those groups,
company officials hope, will build public trust and brand
recognition that will serve the companies well if and when
legislatures approve online voting in the biggest potential market,
civic elections.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, only a few state legislatures have begun to
address Internet voting. Bills to initiate studies of the concept
were introduced recently in Minnesota and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Legislature passed a bill to study the issue
in 1997, but it was vetoed by the governor then, Pete Wilson,
because of fears of fraud and vote-tampering. In March,
California's secretary of state, Bill Jones, convened a task force
to study the issue and make recommendations to the Legislature
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida election officials had planned to test online voting
systems in elections this fall, but the project was delayed
indefinitely after cases of voter fraud in Miami raised fears about
security.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Pentagon, in an effort to make it
easier for far-flung military personnel to participate in the
electoral process, is sponsoring a pilot program through the
federal Voting Assistance Program. The experiment will enable
overseas residents of five states _ Florida, Missouri, South
Carolina, Texas and Utah _ both military and civilian, to vote via
the Internet in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With the inevitable political starts and stops on this issue,
five years could pass before any state election officials are
authorized to buy Internet voting systems. Moreover, the first
civic election held by Internet will attract substantial scrutiny.
Any problems _ from a breach in security to a glitch in tabulation
_ could prove disastrous for the company that builds the system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies entering the field accept those risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely imperative that it work right the first time,
so we are approaching cautiously,'' said Neil McClure, president of
Worldwide Election Systems in Lafayette, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   To McClure, improved security is one of the best reasons for
Internet voting. ``Any Internet voting system is going to be light
years ahead of a punch-card system in terms of security,'' he said.
``Those ballots are handled by human beings. The count could change
by the mere fact that the ballots were handled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three-year-old company has designed an Internet voting
system that can be integrated with its electronic voting machines
(although none of its products are yet on the market). The company
has spent a year adapting encryption technology to ensure the
system's security. Still, the company's strategy is to add online
voting capacity to conventional vote machines _ not to offer
Internet voting software as a stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're betting the company on this,'' McClure
said.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, however, VoteHere.Net is betting the company
on Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   Though developing these systems is a logical direction for
companies in the election business, VoteHere.Net came to the field
for very different reasons. The company started in 1996 as
Soundcode, which developed data security software. But Adler saw
that field increasingly dominated by large companies like Network
Associates and Security Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   So he put three engineers in the nine-person company to work
applying their encryption to an Internet voting system. They spent
a year on the project, and now patents for the product are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be eaten alive or move into a market that's new and
bold,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies already in the election business say that technology
firms like VoteHere.Net are at a disadvantage because they have not
dealt with the politics behind the development of election systems
and the requirements that vary from county to county.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few companies nationwide that understand the
election business,'' said Knecht of Global. ``There are many, many
companies interested in Internet voting that have little
understanding of election law.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, for one, is willing to learn. His company's research
shows that election officials nationwide spend $1 billion a year on
equipment for election day. But he recognizes that the business of
handling election data carries an exceptional burden of
responsibility. ``You have the spotlight on you all the time,'' he
said. ``You have to be squeaky clean.''

U.N. GROUP SUGGESTS NEW TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS FOR INTERNET
ADDRESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speculating in the registration and resale of
potentially valuable Internet addresses would effectively be
outlawed under new rules proposed by the intellectual property body
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also give companies and people with claims to
famous words or trademarks first claim to certain Internet
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, issued Friday evening to the Internet Corp.
for Assigned Names and Numbers, are the first attempt by any
official body to draft an international set of rules to combat the
much-maligned practice commonly referred to as cybersquatting.
</P>
<P>
   The report was requested by the Clinton administration last year
when it handed oversight of the Internet's addressing system to the
corporation, an international nonprofit organization known as
Icann.
</P>
<P>
   Icann will take public comment on the recommendations, then
begin reviewing them at its next meeting, May 25, in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a universal framework for disputes over Internet
addresses, or domains, is a priority for Icann. The group is in the
process of opening the business of registering domain names to
competition, and Icann eventually plans to expand the number of
so-called top-level domains beyond the current ones, which include
.com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been disputes after domain names like
McDonalds.com, have been registered to parties other than the
trademark holders.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of disputes over coveted names in the .com,
.net and .org registrations are largely believed to have peaked,
companies and trademark holders are worried about a renewed
cyberspace land rush when Icann starts adding new domains.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is the result of a nearly yearlong process,
recommends that Icann require anyone who registers for an Internet
domain first sign a contract that would define and bar ``abusive''
registration practices and would lay out the principles for
resolving accusations of cybersquatting.
</P>
<P>
   Under that contract, people accused of infringing on trademarks
or trying to peddle names for profit would be subject to a
mandatory arbitration process that could strip them of their
domains and require them to pay any fees incurred in resolving the
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases _ such as those between companies or people with
similar names or claims to the same domains _ would go either to
voluntary arbitration or to courts in the country where the domain
name holder and company that registered it are based.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are aimed at ``the most egregious problems
between intellectual property and domain names and at obtaining
effective solutions to those problems,'' said the 112-page report,
which the U.N.'s World Intellectual Property Organization posted on
its Web site (www.wipo.org) Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report takes more narrow aim at abusive
registration practices than a first draft issued by the U.N. body
late last year, critics say it still would give wealthy
corporations and trademark holders a new framework for laying claim
to property in what until now has been a free-wheeling arena where
the watchword was first come, first served.
</P>
<P>
   Others are concerned with a provision that recommends that Icann
establish a list of trademarks and other ``famous or well-known
marks'' that would be off limits to registration by the average
Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there is no definition of internationally
famous marks,'' said Michael A. Froomkin, a University of Miami law
professor who served on a panel of experts that made
recommendations to the U.N. group.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Oppedahl, a trademark lawyer in Frisco, Colo., described
the exclusionary list as ``WIPO's biggest blunder,'' which he
predicted would ``lead to endless acrimony and struggle as owners
of nonunique, noncoined trademarks manage to get their trademarks
on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, though, Froomkin _ who had been a harsh critic of the
earlier draft of the report _ said Friday's version was ``a good
faith effort to distinguish between what is true cybersquatting and
what is not.''

COMMENTARY: IMAGES ASSAIL, BUT ADVENTURE IS STILL AN OPEN BOOK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When people hold forth about the death of literature, I will
recall a series of lovely cemeteries I drove past in Mexico
recently, small fenced-in spaces with white headstones and brightly
colored decorations. They were clearly meant to be part of
everyone's everyday life, and the same is true of literature.
</P>
<P>
   We know that good and great works exist somewhere in the general
consciousness; in this classroom, library or street stall; as tome,
paperback or disk, or in the indiscriminate heap of our memories
where we would sometimes want to express ourselves in nothing but
the words of writers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a practice I find very comforting, especially in grimmer
moments. Self-reproach for instance: ``I was right not to be afraid
of any thief but myself, who will end by leaving me nothing.''
(Katherine Anne Porter.) Self-pity: Elizabeth Bishop's ``Pity
should begin at home.'' Or if that's insufficient, William Cowper's
more florid ``But I beneath a rougher sea/And whelm'd in deeper
gulphs than he.'' And for longing of a nonhuman kind, ``There is in
God (some say)/A deep, but dazzling darkness'' (Henry Vaughan).
</P>
<P>
   I don't worry that we live, as everyone says, in a culture of
images. I loathe plenty of them, but no more than I loathe plenty
of what I read. A little historical distance helps.
</P>
<P>
   Rereading Vachel Lindsay's 1915 book on film, ``The Art of the
Moving Picture'' (portentous but also gloriously smart), it was
useful to be reminded that the United States was still in its
visual infancy when the century began. Compared with the rest of
Europe, Lindsay said, England and the United States were
word-driven cultures. Public libraries were for the masses, museums
for the privileged. But when the movies arrived, masses began to
think in pictures. ``Edison is the new Gutenberg,'' Lindsay
proclaimed. ``He has invented the new printing.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say then that movies have been as important to America's
artists as the Renaissance was to Europe's and stop brooding so
about the effect of film (and television and video) on literature.
Anyway, our obsession with words is always making itself felt.
Critics imported the highly literary auteur theory from France to
help us start treating film as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Then we did the same thing with rock music. The first generation
of rock critics tended to be literature graduates who regularly
crowned their favorite performers with mythological and literary
allusions. It is still the ostentatiously verbal that most excites
rock critics and fans; the bardic balladeering of folk rock and the
rhymed rapacities of rap. (Strange, how potent cheap alliteration
is!) We sometimes overlook serious literature, and we certainly
have our struggles with literacy, but we are intensely verbal, and
we are always reading in some form or another.
</P>
<P>
   Part of our anxiety about the future of books and literature
must have to do with the anxieties of living on the technological
edge. Computers, CD-ROM's, E-books. We have to wonder whether they
will change the nature of how we perceive and learn. But again,
history is useful. Pick up a book like Alberto Manguel's ``History
of Reading,'' which is a leisurely ramble through the centuries
with readers and writers, both famous (Alexander the Great, St.
Augustine, Lady Murasaki) and obscure (monks, emancipated slaves,
young ladies sampling sentimental fiction). Then ask yourself if
the changes we are enduring are any greater than the shock of
moving from tablet to scroll to codex, from stone to papyrus,
woodcut block to reusable type and from scribes to printers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer screens, with their moving words and images and
symbols, are the link between our visual and literary cultures. You
sit alone at your screen, the solitary reader or writer. But go
online, visit a Web site, and you have entered a public space where
all kinds of information is being dispensed (as in a documentary or
newsreel), and all sorts of dramas are being enacted. You can't
really spend much time at a computer without knowing you are part
of an invisible multitude: Everything you read or write can be
transmitted and shared within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There is an urge now to make traditional book reading more
communal. Reading groups are everywhere; public readings
proliferate, and more and more writers see themselves as solo
performers in search of enraptured audiences, whether at poetry
slams or in small, diligently avant-garde spaces. There is a
19th-century quality to much of this: Think of all those young
women (reading groups are still made up largely of women)
exchanging romantic novels and talking about them excitedly. Think
of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Frederick Douglass, knocking them dead
on the Lyceum and Anti-Slavery Society circuits. And maybe because
we are so image saturated, that century-old excitement about
reading as a private and public act is being rediscovered.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to be a reader in our culture. But it can be hard
to admit how many kinds of readers exist inside you. What about
that magazine with the same title as a famous novel by William
Thackeray, the one so many people claim they read only on airplanes
or in public places? (``I wash my hands afterward,'' a colleague
claims.) Then there is the book (is it by John Grisham? Robert
Ludlam?) that intense mental effort or emotional pressure may drive
you to pick up. (``The prose is horrible, but he can tell a
story,'' a friend in the throes of Ludlam told me. ``I hate
myself.'')
</P>
<P>
   The ever-obsessed and ever-astute D.H. Lawrence was clearly
right when he compared reading with a furtive sexual experience;
his word was onanism, but a trashy pickup will do just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally you have a respectable bourgeois inside you who
responds with high-minded enthusiasm to some of the most important
books from your college reading syllabuses. With luck there is a
passion for some kind of genre writing. For it does what
storytelling used to: Its conventions provide us with deep
nonverbal satisfaction in advance. We know what we need, and we
know we will get it, just as people centuries ago knew what they
would get from ``The Odyssey,'' ``The Arabian Nights'' or any local
fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope we all have a curious iconoclast inside us, a reader
who wanders through fiction and nonfiction looking for worlds
elsewhere, for writing that provides a peculiar blend of the
selfless _ we surrender our imaginative lives to the life of the
book _ and the selfish. Thus we shape every line to our minutest
social and psychological needs. Every book alters this blend. Some
bring out everything mean and competitive in our imaginations. But
with the ones that matter most we transcend our everyday selves and
start to speak a richer, fuller language.

   Can't find good young reporters? Can't keep them when you've
found them? Thomson Newspapers thinks it may have the answer: Grow
your own. And grow your own journalism school to train them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the current journalism schools may not see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Reader Inc. Editorial Training Center plans to
open its doors in Oshkosh, Wis., to its first class of 20 students.
All will be recruited by some of Thomson's 56 newspapers, all
committed to going back to work at those newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is we can recruit some good people with roots in the
community,'' said Stewart Rieckman, executive editor of the Oshkosh
Northwestern (circulation 27,000).
</P>
<P>
   As soon as traditional journalism-school graduates hit the
newsroom, Rieckman said, ``they're looking for the next stepping
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Quinn, a senior vice president of Thomson Newspapers, said
the program would teach journalistic skills, but also explain in
detail the medium's business side.
</P>
<P>
   Trainees will ``spend a week in their home newspaper office
being acclimatized and electronically hooked up,'' Quinn said.
``Then they go for 12 weeks to the training center in Wisconsin and
then they go back for a further six weeks' training'' at the
sponsoring newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Their reward, if they make the grade, will be a job at a
starting salary of $17,000 to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Janeway, director of Columbia University's program for
Journalism in the Arts, called Reader Inc. ``a shot at
short-cutting'' a good journalism education. ``They're
rationalizing their own paltry investment in news editorial instead
of investing in salaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Quinn contends that traditional journalism schools impart a
subtle snobbery about small-town journalism that has hurt the
profession. ``I call them `wannabe' Woodward and Bernsteins,'' he
said. ``They turn up their noses at the kind of community
journalism that connects with readers.''

   A New Magazine's Debt to Its Writers
</P>
<P>
   By all outward appearances, Icon Magazine, a glossy monthly
aimed at the young men's market _ it features articles about
action-movie directors, supermodels, Charlton Heston and how to get
ahead in business _ seems to be doing as well as any two-year-old
magazine could be.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one fact: It hasn't yet paid more than two dozen
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which has an unaudited circulation of 250,000, was
founded by a 26-year-old entrepreneur named David Getson. It moved
from offices on lower Broadway to more spacious digs on Park Avenue
South earlier this year. Getson has hired additional staff members.
</P>
<P>
   And this spring, he retained the services of Richard Rubenstein
Public Relations _ headed by the son of Howard Rubenstein, the
communications consigliere to clients like the Duchess of York and
Rupert Murdoch _ to promote the magazine on the occasion of its
second anniversary this month.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that obvious magnanimity has upset the freelance
writers who have never been paid for work they have had published
in the magazine, and it points to one of the fundamental problems
that start-up magazines face: how to get good buzz going, which
costs money, and hire intelligent writers, who also cost money.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Servetar, a freelance writer who has not been paid $2,000
for two articles the magazine published a year ago, said, ``They
obviously have priorities, and writers are clearly not at the top
of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tomasky, the political columnist for New York magazine,
wrote a 4,500-word article that Icon published in the fall of 1998.
Tomasky said that after several months had gone by without sign of
a check _ for $4,500 _ he did not know quite how to react. ``I was
feeling a little sorry for them because they're young people and
they are trying to make a go of it, but my patience has perhaps
been too magnanimous at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getson said that at least two dozen writers were owed
substantial sums of money. He said that he started the magazine
with partial financing, and was completing an additional round of
fund raising. ``There have been some late bills and some writers
have understandably been upset,'' he said. ``You hope your writers
understand that this is not Hearst or Conde Nast.'' Getson added
that he had big expectations for his magazine: ``In five years,
we'll be the market leader in men's magazines. And we'll be paying
more than Vanity Fair.''

   A Literary Evening at the Playboy Mansion
</P>
<P>
   For lofty moments in American letters little could top the
Playboy Mansion party held last Friday evening by Grove/Atlantic to
celebrate the book ``The Century of Sex: Playboy's History of the
Sexual Revolution,'' which will be published this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While guests nibbled on tiny crab cakes and sipped white wine,
the author, James Petersen, gazed over the crowd of New York
publishers transplanted to Southern California for the annual fair
of Book Expo America and exhorted them to give their best human
call of the wild _ ``the sound you make at orgasm.'' The visitors
politely groaned and the host, publisher Morgan Entrekin, smiled a
little sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were then freed to wander the grounds of the Playboy
Mansion West in Holmby Hills, Calif., where the call of peacocks
and the chatter of monkeys filled the gathering dusk. In the dim
light, author Salman Rushdie and his lone guard strolled
purposefully past the mansion's fabled grotto and a private zoo of
chained parrots caged monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guests gathered inside a white party tent fragrant
with bouquets of pale pink roses. Some clustered by two towering
Playboy bunnies in satin and rabbit ears or craned for a glimpse of
Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner. And they snapped keepsake
photographs or made up excuses to talk to Heather Kozar, Playboy
magazine's newly named Playmate of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' was introduced to
Miss Kozar. She also met Grove's best-selling author, Mark Bowden,
whose book ``Black Hawk Down'' is a gritty account of the urban
street battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, that left hundreds dead.
Bowden ushered in two American veterans of the Mogadishu battle to
make brief small talk with the blond playmate. But after those
conversations, Miss Kozar confessed she was not one for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm not a big reader because it really puts me to
sleep,'' said Ms. Kozar, an Akron, Ohio, native who is turning 23
this week. ``I do read Playboy because I need to keep current.''

MANAGED CARE FIRMS TO RESTRICT COVERAGE FOR NEW DIET DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who hope to slim down with the help of Xenical, a newly
approved weight-loss drug, may have to pay for it themselves. A
number of managed care companies are categorizing Xenical as a
lifestyle product that they will cover only in exceptional cases _
for overweight people at risk for cardiovascular problems, or those
with diabetes, breathing problems or brittle bones.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts said, many people are likely to pay the $4 or
$5 a day themselves needed to buy Xenical, a treatment made by
Roche Holding AG of Switzerland. Analysts projected peak worldwide
sales of the drug at $600 million to as much as $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical, which the Food and Drug Administration approved last
Monday, is expected to go on sale in the United States in a few
weeks. It has already earned $100 million in sales in Europe this
year and could reach $3 billion annually in five years, said Samuel
Isaly, an analyst with Orbimed Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical will not be covered as ``a lifestyle drug for someone
who wants to lose 10 pounds for a wedding,'' said Deborah Bohren, a
spokeswoman in New York for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said,
``The slim, thin and lovely crowd will want to abuse this drug.''
Dr. W. Allen Schaffer, chief medical officer at Cigna Healthcare,
said that Cigna specifically excluded diet pills, along with
Rogaine and Propecia to grow hair and Renova, an anti-wrinkle
treatment. But Xenical might be covered, he said, as part of a
behavior modification program that increased its effectiveness, as
happened with smoking-cessation treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, patients lost 5 percent to 10 percent of their weight
after taking Xenical for a year. ``For severely obese patients,
every little bit helps,'' said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta
Partners. ``For the rest of the population, the cost benefit is far
from clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Several insurance executives compared Xenical to Viagra, Pfizer
Inc.'s widely publicized impotence treatment. Typically, these
insurers pay for Viagra only in limited amounts _ six pills each
month _ and only for men who have erectile dysfunction caused by
surgery or other medical causes. On that basis, their costs for
Viagra have been less than had been forecast. Sweig said that less
than half of the Viagra sales of $981 million in its first 12
months were covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint Health Networks, which owns Blue Cross of California,
spent less than two-tenths of 1 percent of its $400 million annual
drug budget for Viagra, said Robert Seidman, a Wellpoint vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would cover Xenical only for people with a
body mass index greater than 35, a technical measure that would
place a person in the severely obese category _ for example, 260
pounds for a person 6 feet tall or 197 pounds for a person 5 feet 3
inches tall. A body mass index of 25 signals a person is overweight
_ 141 pounds for a person 5 foot 3 _ and obesity begins at 30,
meaning a weight of 169 pounds for a person 5 foot 3.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans covers weight-loss drugs only for a few
groups that pay extra for the coverage, said Richard Wool, a
spokesman for Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Several managed care companies, including Kaiser Permanente and
Aetna U.S. Healthcare, said their Xenical policies would not be set
for several months, pending reviews of its benefits by committees
of doctors and pharmacists. Doctors at Kaiser could request an
exception ``for a medical necessity,'' said Beverly Hayon, a
spokeswoman for Kaiser, which is based in California.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care executives said side effects of the drug could be a
concern. Schaffer at Cigna said that Xenical worked by lowering fat
intake, affecting vitamins, too. ``People could end up with vitamin
deficiencies, in addition to diarrhea, which is also a side
effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers who developed the drug said that people who
achieved a more biologically acceptable weight would be healthier
and might be less likely to incur diseases that are expensive to
treat. And the drug is now being tested in Scandinavia as a therapy
for diabetic patients, regardless of their weight.

ALEXA'S CRUSADE CONTINUES 
FREE PC INC. LINES UP FINANCING 
DRAGON DEFIES EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Wash., Mass.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It began as a crusade: to archive for posterity the entire
contents of the World Wide Web, which had reached some 13 trillion
bytes at the latest count.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, this crusade by Brewster Kahle had a big
commercial payoff. His three-year-old company, Alexa Internet, was
acquired by the online retailer Amazon.com for nearly $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alexa's Internet software is part Web browser, part navigation
service; users download free from the Alexa.com Web site. After
that, whenever the user calls up any Web page, the software lists
four other recommended sites, based on the Web searching patterns
of other Alexa users.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle calls the approach contextual navigation, and Netscape
Communications, which is owned by America Online, has folded Alexa
into the latest version of its browser. While questions remain
about what Amazon.com intends to do with Alexa and its technology,
Kahle insists that the acquisition will give his company plenty of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be part of the Internet infrastructure, much
like the search engines have become,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle, who was a founder of the supercomputer company Thinking
Machines in 1983, moved on to the Internet search business. In
1989, well before the World Wide Web took hold, he developed the
Wide Area Information Server _ or WAIS _ for searching distant
databases on the Internet. Kahle sold that company, WAIS Inc., to
America Online three years ago for $15 million in stock, which he
used to bankroll Alexa Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has said it will let Alexa continue operating as a
separate company with its own headquarters in San Francisco, rather
than folding it into the Amazon.com corporate structure and moving
it to Seattle, as the company has done with nearly every other
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The name Alexa refers to the library of Alexandria, where the
ancient Greeks tried to amass the world's knowledge. Kahle said his
deal included a promise by Amazon.com's chief executive, Jeff
Bezos, to let him continue Alexa's ambitious project to archive the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Alexa provided the Library of Congress with a first
installment _ 44 tapes containing 2 trillion bytes of Web data, the
equivalent of 500,000 Web pages. Of course, since the Web continues
to grow by thousands of pages a day, cataloging it all could be a
never-ending task.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, someone has already registered the Internet
address Sisyphus.com.

   Free PC Plans to Announce a List of Big Investors
</P>
<P>
   Free PC Inc., the company that started the free-computer
movement in February by promising to give away 10,000 computers,
contends that it now has the financial backing to support the first
phase of its business model.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to announce Monday that it has lined up
$33.5 million in financing. Besides Barry Diller, the media mogul,
and the technology ``incubator'' Idea Labs, whose backing had
already been disclosed, Free PC plans to report that its other
investors include Goldman Sachs Group and Moore Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Donald LaVigne, chief executive of Free PC, which is based in
Pasadena, Calif., said the company would start shipping 10,000 free
computers next month, at a cost of about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make money through advertisements that
would be downloaded from the Internet and constantly displayed on
part of the free computers' monitor. Companies that have agreed to
advertise include Amazon.com; Citigroup's Citibank unit, Ebay; Time
Warner's New Line Cinema, and Volvo, according to Free PC
executives.

   Dragon Systems Postpones Its IPO Indefinitely
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Dragon Systems Inc. announced plans to sell a
minority stake to the public earlier this year, the company has
challenged convention. Amid a crowd of flimsy software industry
start-ups, it has a 16-year track record, real profits and no debt.
In a field run by youngsters, its 50-ish founders are still in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this little oddball is defying industry expectations once
again: As the typical high-technology entrepreneur races to sell a
stake to the public while the skittish bull market lasts, Dragon is
strolling in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon, whose Naturally Speaking products dominate the market
for continuous-speech recognition software, was originally
scheduled to sell its minority stake in March. But the sale was
quietly postponed, supposedly for a month, after sales in the
fourth quarter of 1998 failed to jump as robustly as many analysts
had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Newton, Mass., has now decided to
delay the offering indefinitely ``to pursue negotiations with
several potential strategic investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has the backing of Seagate Technology of Scotts Valley,
Calif., which owns about 35 percent of Dragon Systems. Seagate, a
leading maker of computer disk drives, has not announced any plans
to sell any shares as part of the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been exceptionally good, Dragon insists, with
revenue in the first quarter of 1999 setting a company record. But
Janet Baker, Dragon's chief executive, said that seeking private
investment now would allow the company ``to capitalize on the huge
growth potential of the speech market and result in an even more
successful IPO in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's shyness about going public did not deter Massachusetts
Investor's Digest from listing Ms. Baker and her husband, James
Baker, the pair of computer scientists who started Dragon in their
living room in 1982, among the state's top 10 entrepreneurs for
1999.

 &HT;    Braves unaccustomed to rash of errors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With two more errors Sunday, the Braves have committed
18 errors in their first 24 games. This is not an epidemic.
Montreal has already committed 30.
</P>
<P>
   But for a team that led the league in fielding last season and
committed a franchise record low 91 misplays, the feeling is an
unusual one. With third baseman Chipper Jones making throwing error
in the second inning and letting an Aaron Boone grounder go through
his legs in the fourth, the infield has made seven errors in its
last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys who have fielding averages of .960, .970 for their career
are going to field .960 and .970,'' said Jones, who fielded a
career-high .971 last year. ``We haven't played that well
defensively for a pretty good stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not a big deal. I'm sure we'll go a period where we
play very good for 20 or 25 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss accounted four three errors in his last four starts and
now has five in 22 games, almost half of the 12 errors he made in
96 games a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think errors are contagious,'' said Weiss, a career
.971 fielder at shortstop. ``Just one of those things. It all evens
out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Bro'
</P>
<P>
   Sunday marked the first time the Boone brothers ever opposed
each other on any level of competition, dating back all the way
through Little League. Until 1997 when they were united by the
Reds, they had never played on the same team together (Bret Boone
is four years older than Reds third baseman Aaron Boone), though
both played collegiately at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my brother and I want to see him do well,'' Bret Boone
said. ``I don't him to beat us with a big hit. That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer ready
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer finally allowed a run in his sixth re-hab
appearance at Class AAA Richmond, but while he has demonstrated he
is ready to return to the Atlanta pen, the Braves remain
uncommitted to calling him up. He can spend up to 30 days on injury
rehab assignment, which expires for Spring May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Springer has allowed one run and just three hits in seven
innings, striking out six of the 24 batters he has faced while
walking no one.
</P>
<P>
   Marking time
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were aghast at Mark Wohlers' first minor league
appearance Sunday, when he pitched for Class AAA Indianapolis at
Toledo. Wohlers lasted one-third of an innings, allowing a hit,
five walks, four wild pitches and three runs. He left the game with
the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers threw just nine strikes with 13 balls. Toledo batters
swung just three times, all three of those by ex-Brave Luis
Polonia.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Reds centerfielder Mike Cameron, who played baseball and
football at LaGrange High School, did not have the homecoming he
envisioned in his first series in his home state. Camero went
0-for-11 for the series with six strikeouts. He did however make a
superb running catch in the fourth Sunday, taking away an
extra-bases shot by Chipper Jones. . . . For the record, the last
Brave before Chipper Jones Saturday night to hit home runs from
both side of the plate in the same game was Jim Russell, who did it
for Boston on June 7, 1948.

 &HT;    Braves sweep Reds in 3-game series
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ History cast its first judgement Sunday upon the trade
that brought Bret Boone to Atlanta and sent Denny Neagle away. The
record notes that Neagle was bleeding from the ears before anyone
could begin to digest brunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves concluded a three-game sweep of Cincinnati with a 5-3
victory before 47,097 at Turner Field where the team has won nine
times in its first 13 dates. Rookie Odalis Perez (1-1) won his
first game as a member of the rotation, as all five starters have
now won in five consecutive starts, a first since Sept. 16-20,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams hits a solo homer and Javy Lopez struck two RBI
doubles off his old batterymate. Neagle did not last the third
inning in his shortest starting appearance in six years, retiring
just seven of the 14 men he faced and allowing four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who you're facing,'' said Neagle, winless in
three starts as a Red with his ERA up to 5.68. ``You make bad
pitches like that, they're going to get you. Even when I made good
pitches, they hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Boone was 2-for-4 while scoring twice, giving
him three runs scored and two RBI in his first series against his
old team. He hit .364 (4-for-11) over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of different,'' he said of the weekend. ``I was just on
the right team today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their season-high fifth straight and their eighth
game out of nine. Behind 3-0 after the first, the Reds never
recovered against Perez, who allowed five hits and two earned runs
while striking out seven and felt like he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We you have some support from the players, when they score
three or four runs, you might say, `I gotta do it,'' said the
rookie, who had given eight runs in his first 18 innings. ``They're
trying to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wound up hitting .109 for the series with 25 strikeouts
to go with just 10 hits. Quietly, the bullpen has also contributed,
Braves relievers working seven scoreless innings and allowing just
two singles in the first six games of the homestand. John Rocker
recorded his second save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starters are going good and I think our bullpen's doing a
great job too,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``You're not going to hold
`em or pitch great every game but we did our share of good
pitching.''

 &HT;    CAPTURED U.S. SOLDIERS
 &HT;    FREE AT LAST' IN GERMANY
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMSTEIN, Germany Hospital food probably never tasted so good as
three former POWs celebrated freedom with plates of hamburgers,
chicken and lasagna at an Army hospital here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The three U.S. soldiers, captured by Yugoslav forces and held
for more than a month, arrived Sunday to a heroes' welcome at
Ramstein Air Base, savoring their new freedom at an army hospital
where they are undergoing medical tests and military debriefings.
</P>
<P>
   Army doctors pronounced the three servicemen in reasonably good
health after an initial examination Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers -- Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas;
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Christopher Stone, 25, of
Smiths Creek, Mich. - were expected to be reunited Monday with
family members who were flying to Germany from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen arrived in Germany after an emotional, daylong
journey from Belgrade. Rev. Jesse Jackson, who negotiated their
release in an unofficial diplomatic mission to Yugoslavia,
accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not get any better than this!'' read an enormous
banner hung with yellow ribbons at the Ramstein Air Base, where
some 400 well-wishers greeted their military medical-transport jet.
</P>
<P>
   The day began in Belgrade with tearful telephone calls to family
members in the United States as Jackson and Yugoslav officials
signed documents authorizing their release. Later, Ramirez made his
first request, asking for a Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day as they crossed the border from Yugoslavia
into Croatia, the soldiers chanted with Jackson: ``Free at last,
free at last. Thank God almighty, we're free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip by road from Serbia to Croatia and then by air to this
sprawling U.S. base was punctuated with tears, smiles and uneasy
questions about what their release may or may not mean to the
future of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged Clinton and other NATO leaders to respond to the
release as a goodwill gesture by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and NATO officials declared that the soldiers' release
would not help a new diplomatic initiative by Russia's chief
mediator due in Washington today to meet with President Clinton or
prompt a halt in the intensifying NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added a sober note to the celebration over the soldiers'
release with a reminder of the plight of the ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said in a statement
released by the White House. ``Today we reaffirm our resolve to
persevere until they, too, can return with security and
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ramstein, Gonzales, Ramirez and Stone stepped off a C-9
military jet into the late afternoon sunshine to the cheers of the
large crowd of servicemen and families. Dressed in their green
camouflage combat fatigues and carrying folded American flags under
their arms, the ex-captives formed a line to salute an honor guard
from their 1st Infantry Division. They were then marched to two
army medical helicopters for the short flight to the Landstuhl
military hospital, where they are expected to remain for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial impression is that they are very happy to be back
and that they are very upbeat,'' said Col. Mack Blanton, chief of
clinical services in Landstuhl medical facility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of exposure to any sort of biological
weapons. There is also no evidence they were exposed to pressure
tactics or propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were free from their Yugoslav captors, but not from
questions about the circumstances of their abduction and the
conditions of their confinement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have insisted that the soldiers were on patrol
well inside the border of Macedonia when Serb forces seized them on
March 31. The following day, they were paraded on Serbian
television showing signs they had been battered on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   In debriefing the servicemen, military officials hope to learn
the details of how their routine border patrol went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Stone had said earlier on Sunday the bruises on his face were
the result of wounds suffered at the time of his capture.
</P>
<P>
   The mistreatment stopped after they were turned over to higher
Yugoslavian authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the guards who watched them in the solitary-confinement
cells treated them well and earned a measure of respect from the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving them it was kind of sad knowing there is this war is
going on and they are left behind,'' said Stone. ``I hope that in
some way our release will lead to negotiations for peace,'' Stone
said to reporters at the airport in Zagreb, adding they had been
treated well in captivity. ``It's sad that this is happening and we
pray for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may meet with the three soldiers during a visit to
Germany on Wednesday. The president is scheduled to tour two U.S.
bases to meet combat pilots taking part in the NATO air campaign
and review humanitarian efforts to aid Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the soldiers Monday will undergo further
tests -- including psychological examinations -- and debriefings
before being reunited with their families. Afterward, they will be
offered a rest period in the United States, or can elect to rejoin
their unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are cavalry men and they pride themselves on their
toughness,'' said Col. Michael Sullivan, spokesman for the U.S.
Army in Europe. ``But we pride ourselves on a process that allows
them to depressurize.''

FREED SOLDIERS IN GOOD HEALTH; JACKSON SAYS U.S. MUST RESPOND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Texas)  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany _ After 31 days of virtual isolation
in Yugoslav prison cells, where one man said he found comfort in an
American flag he drew on toilet paper and two found comfort in
prayer, three freed soldiers were cheered on their arrival here
Sunday and pronounced in apparent good health.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen will stay at the Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center, about seven miles from this air base, for another two or
three days of medical and psychological tests before a decision is
made whether they can go home with their families on leave,
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives are expected to start arriving in Germany on Monday
for private reunions with the three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all in good health,'' said Col. Mack Blanton, chief
of clinical services at Landstuhl, after the soldiers' first
checkup. ``The injuries that we've seen so far are not major
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the most noticeable symptom of their time in captivity
was that the former prisoners _ all in their early 20s _ could not
seem to get enough to eat, even though the crew of the C-9 medical
evacuation plane that picked them up in Zagreb, Croatia, had
brought stacks of pizza and take-out hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, carefree and bantering during much of their
nine-hour journey from the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, seemed
transformed by the time they stepped onto the tarmac from an Air
Force medical evacuation plane.
</P>
<P>
   They stood erect, gave a thumbs-up sign, crisply saluted a line
of senior officers who were waiting to greet them, and stiffly
submitted to hugs from their commanders before climbing into a
helicopter for the trip to the medical center.
</P>
<P>
   The three were accompanied by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had
gone to Belgrade with an interfaith delegation of American
religious leaders to appeal to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Jackson said the success of his
mission could be an opportunity to break what he called the ``cycle
of violence'' in the NATO bombing campaign and the ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis of the day was on the former prisoners, and not
on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, in a series of encounters with reporters,
described their last days in prison as nerve-wracking and, in the
final moments, bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., said
that on Friday afternoon they were taken from their prison cells _
he said he believed they were somewhere in Belgrade because they
could hear traffic noises from outside _ to meet Jackson for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   On the windows of the room where they waited, someone had taped
paper printed with a target. Since the start of NATO bombing, many
Yugoslavs have worn T-shirts or signs with targets as a protest
against the airstrikes. Seeing the bull's-eye drawings caused the
soldiers, who had been kept separately in small cells with almost
no contact with outsiders, some moments of alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were left to be in a bombing situation,'' Stone
said. ``But that wasn't the case. It was just a prank.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were told the next day, Saturday, just before bedtime,
that they would be released, and excitement kept them up all night,
said Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and Spc. Steven
Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But when the time came to say goodbye to their guards, the
soldiers said they felt mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very kind to us,'' said Stone. ``As we were leaving
them, it was kind of sad to know there's this war going on and
we're leaving and they're left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they shook hands with the guards and the Yugoslav army
officers who came for the soldiers in the morning to hand them over
to a visiting delegation of American religious leaders. ``We told
them that we would continue to pray for a peaceful end to this
crisis,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the air base, Jackson urged NATO and the United
States to respond to the gesture by reopening negotiations with
Milosevic, even though many officials have said he cannot be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would say that Milosevic let them go as a cynical
gesture, but what would they have said if he had kept them?''
Jackson said, adding that President Clinton, as commander in chief,
``must weigh in.''
</P>
<P>
   More details emerged about the imprisonment of the three during
their trip out of Belgrade because they stopped and spoke to
journalists several times along the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers said they could not much talk about the
circumstances of their capture until they were interviewed by
military investigators. But they did tell some of the clergy who
traveled with them after their release that in the first days after
they were seized, they were beaten and kicked and for a time had
hoods placed over their heads so they could not see where they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The mistreatment occurred only at the the beginning of their
captivity, said Stone, and then they were treated properly. He
should know, he said, because the first books provided the soldiers
by their prison guards were in English about the Geneva Convention.
``Oh, we sure did read them,'' he said with a smile. ``I think all
three of us now fully understand our rights under the Geneva
Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he drew himself an American flag on a piece of toilet
paper and kept it with him ``as a symbol of my country.'' He
brought it out with his few possessions when he was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Ramirez both talked extensively about how their
religious faith sustained them. ``I always had memories of my
family and friends and always the Lord my God as my companion,''
said Ramirez, who had a birthday while in captivity, on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson praised the three soldiers for behaving well while
living under pressure and, as he put it, ``in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They never broke. They kept their dignity, their poise, their
self-respect,'' he said. ``They represent the best that this
generation has to offer and we thank God to be their fellow
Americans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The freed prisoners left Belgrade at about 8:15 a.m., traveling
in a Yugoslav bus under police escort to the border with Croatia.
From the Croatian border, the soldiers were then transferred to a
Croation tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and _ still in the
company of the ministers, priests and other clergy in the Jackson
delegation _ driven to the Pleso airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were
flown to Ramstein.
</P>
<P>
   As he had since arriving in Belgrade on Thursday night, Jackson
proved himself a master at stage-managing events. In meetings with
Yugoslav officials, Jackson grabbed the initiative by seizing their
hands and holding on as he said prayers for peace in Kosovo. He
gave the soldiers quick lessons in media stardom, coaching the
three in a refrain that they were to repeat at his signal at
several stops on their journey to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Holding hands, they chanted for each new set of cameras, ``Free
at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers took their cues with good humor, bowing their heads
in prayer with Jackson when bidden, joining hands and doing their
chant. At one stop, however, Ramirez turned to Gonzales and joked,
``This is the last time we're going to hold hands.''

`Y2K' BUG TESTS THE PROFESSIONALISM OF PROGRAMMERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Mass., Me., Tenn.)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is spelled out in the code of ethics of the Association for
Computing Machinery, one of the world's oldest and largest computer
professional societies: ``An essential aim of computer
professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computer
systems, including threats to health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer professionals, the code continues, should warn their
bosses about any such threats and even blow the whistle if their
superiors ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't all those computer professionals do the ethical
thing and prevent or blow the whistle on the year 2000 computer
problem _ a glitch that some experts warn could cause such threats
to health and safety as malfunctioning medical equipment and
wayward airplanes when when the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Just how much programmers and their managers should be faulted
for this problem _ which was decades in the making _ is but one
question being raised about a profession that labors in obscurity,
but plays an increasingly vital role in society.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the year 2000 problem could lead to changes in
the way programs are written, just as earthquakes can lead to
stricter building codes. ``Y2K,'' as the problem is known, has
given new life to a debate about whether programmers should be
required to obtain professional certification, similar to that
required of doctors, lawyers and certain engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want an unlicensed engineer working on a bridge, but
you have unlicensed computer programmers working all the time,''
said Dr. Marsha C. Woodbury, chairwoman of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, an 1,800-member group that deals with
social consequences of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change could evaporate depending on the extent of
computing problems that occur after the stroke of midnight on Dec.
31. That is when millions of computers could fail to recognize that
the two-digit year date ``00'' means 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, well before New Year's, many computing professionals
see the close of an era. ``This is the end of 50 years of
infatuation and unconstrained trust in what information
technologists can deliver,'' said Paul A. Strassmann, a former
chief information officer for the Department of Defense and the
Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Strassmann notes, the government has stepped in, as with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's requirement, which took effect
last fall, that companies file detailed reports on the costs,
timetable and other implications of their Y2K repair efforts. That
was the first such detailed reporting required by the government
for data processing operations. It is one reason that Strassmann
formed the Software Testing Assurance Corp., aimed at verifying
companies' Y2K cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even without government pressure, big companies are finding that
the demands of cataloging all their software and repairing and
testing it for Y2K problems has forced them to improve their own
data processing procedures. This could be the silver lining of the
Y2K cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it helped us all grow up a little,'' said William
D. Friel, chief information officer at the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America. Prudential now keeps better track of what programs it
owns, has eliminated unnecessary programs and has bolstered
procedures for testing software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its high-technology image, developing software remains
more art than science, and a fairly unpredictable art at that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 percent of big corporate software development
projects were either late or over budget, and 28 percent failed
completely, according to a survey of 7,500 projects by the Standish
Group of research advisers in Dennis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Though the practitioners may speak of themselves as
professionals, computing does not have educational requirements and
licensing that many other professions do. ``Many have called
themselves software engineers,'' said John R. Speed, executive
director of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers. ``Wrong.
They're the local music dropout who chooses to use that title.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas last year became the first state to offer certification
for professional software engineers, although it is not required.
Candidates must have accredited degrees and at least 12 years'
experience or unaccredited degrees and at least 16 years'
experience. A certification test is also being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Like other states, Texas has long required that anyone who
designs a project that is for the public sector or that affects
public safety must be licensed as a professional engineer. Such
requirements were put in place after 1937, when an explosion at an
elementary school in New London, Texas, killed more than 300
children. The cause was a faulty regulator on a gas steam heater.
Nowadays, Speed said, the function performed by that mechanical
device would be handled by software.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the idea of licensing or certifying computer
programmers has long been discussed but never put in place, mainly
because programmers are in huge demand and many of the best do not
have formal training or education.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some experts say it is not clear that
certification would have prevented the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem had its genesis in the 1950s and 1960s, when using
two digits instead of four to represent the year in programming
could save expensive computer memory. It was assumed that the
programs would all be replaced by the year 2000. If anything, some
computer professionals say, the millennium bug is a testament to
how well programmers did their jobs, not how poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software was so adaptable it lasted all these years, so we
didn't have to retire it,'' said Tom DeMarco, a programmer, author
and consultant in Maine. ``Our undoing was we did it so much better
than we thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Few programmers feel pangs of conscience about Y2K in the way
that some nuclear physicists rue having brought the world the bomb.
A few programmers who say they did sound the alarm contend that
they were ignored by corporate management. Younger programmers see
the problem as one caused by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gotterbarn, director at the Software Engineering Ethics
Institute at East Tennessee State University, said Y2K resulted
from ``lack of foresight and bad guesses,'' not from ethical
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Where he sees mere mistakes, though, other experts say the
problem was a design flaw that could, and should, have been
prevented _ especially since the two-digit practice continued into
the 1990s, long after computer memory had become cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we see it for what it is _ we've made a giant
quality mistake here,'' said Leon A. Kappelman, an associate
professor of business computer information systems at the
University of North Texas and co-chairman of the Society for
Information Management's Year 2000 working group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem our code of ethics would tell us we shouldn't
have done that,'' Kappelman added, ``and once we did it we should
have been more proactive.'' But the code of ethics of the
Association for Computing Machinery, which has 80,000 members in
more than 100 countries, has no force behind it. Most programmers
are not even aware it exists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Woodbury of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
put it: ``Although computer science departments are supposed to
teach ethics along with programming, it's extremely unpopular.
People like me find ourselves isolated and even laughed at.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change. The Association for Computing Machinery, in
league with the 100,000-member Computer Society of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers, adopted a new software
engineering ethics code late last year. The code calls for
programmers to act in the public interest and to ``promote an
ethical approach to the practice of the profession,'' among other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is responsible for the Year 2000 glitch could become a
legal as well as an ethical question if, as expected, computer
problems lead to widespread lawsuits. A wide swath of corporate
America, including the computer industry, is backing legislation in
Congress that would limit lawsuits and liability for Y2K. Last week
the Senate at least temporarily shelved the bill, which had become
entangled by a number of other, partisan disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's get-out-of-jail-free cards,'' Kappelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Within corporations, the year 2000 problem has placed new
scrutiny on chief information officers. Some have been criticized
for not preventing the costly problem. But top management's greater
attention to computer operations can only be good in the long run,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was just something that happened behind closed
doors and now those doors are opened more,'' said Lauris Nance,
chief information officer of the Public Service Co. of North
Carolina, a gas utility. ``There's a general better appreciation of
the technical staff.'' Ms. Nance herself has received several
promotions for seizing upon the Y2K problem early.
</P>
<P>
   Strassmann, the former Pentagon technology official, predicts
that corporate chief information officers may one day be given
fiduciary responsibility that makes them legally accountable for
computing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Increased pressure on the information chiefs is leading to
change within corporate computing departments. When first
confronted a few years ago with the need to check and fix all their
programs, many computer departments were not even sure what and how
many programs their machines were running. Even when they were
identified, many programs lacked documentation _ the textual
commentaries that are supposed to let a subsequent programmer
follow what the author of the software was trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you had a lot of people fight you about documentation
and stuff,'' Ms. Nance said. Now, she said, programmers meet more
often as teams, and the company uses outside auditors to help
assess the risk of new technology projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes the year 2000 problem has meant for companies
that use and maintain software, it has placed new performance
pressures on companies that create software. A question in some
pending lawsuits is whether vendors are responsible for fixing
software they sold that is not ready for the year 2000. The need
for lawyers to bone up on software issues has effectively created a
new bar that will be in position to handle software liability
suits, even those unrelated to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future contracts are going to have much tighter provisions
about vendor responsibility for unforeseen events,'' said Jim
Jones, manager of the Y2K program at the Information Management
Forum, an organization of information technology executives from
large companies and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for many programmers, long stereotyped as antisocial
nerds, the ethics debate has thrust them into an
uncharacteristically visible role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to be the heroes or the goats of
1999,'' Allan E. Alter, a columnist, wrote in Computerworld, a
newspaper for information technology professionals. But ``we must
accept our inevitable public role. What the world wants from us is
level-headed, trustworthy guidance in a scary time.''

 &HT;    Clinton To Meet Russian Envoy
 &HT;    But Yugoslav Bombing Continues
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton agreed to meet here Monday with
Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, signaling an
intensification of the search for a diplomatic end to NATO's air
war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Clinton is to meet with civil rights leader Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who called for a halt in the NATO strikes Sunday
after securing the release of three American soldiers from
captivity in Yugoslavia. Jackson said he is carrying a letter to
Clinton from Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, though, Clinton said air strikes would
continue as part of a broader NATO effort to combat a campaign of
repression that has forced an estimated 1.5 million ethnic
Albanians to flee their homes in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' the statement read in part.
``Today we reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they, too, can
return _ with security and self government.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insisted that Monday's meeting with
Chernomyrdin arranged during a 15-minute telephone conversation
Sunday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin placed to Clinton was
not linked to the release of the Americans in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials spent much of Sunday, in fact, taking
pains to portray the prisoner release as a public relations ploy by
Milosevic to try to erode support within NATO countries for the
allied air strikes, now well into their sixth inconclusive week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a PR stunt,'' Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
told the NBC television network. ``Milosevic is an absolute master
manipulator in this kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Milosevic earned no points
by releasing the soldiers and would receive no respite from the air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not only not going to stop the bombing, we're going to
intensify the bombing,'' Cohen told NBC. ``We're prepared to wage
this campaign for some months to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the point, NATO pilots worked their way early
Monday through their fourth straight day of the most furious
attacks since the campaign began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of continuing clear skies, pilots pressed
strikes that resulted early Sunday in what Nato officials said was
the most effective assault to date directly on the Serb tanks,
troops and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is straightforward,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
told reporters in Brussels, ``to cut them off, pin them down and
take them out so that they have no option but to leave Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   As air strikes escalated, so did diplomatic efforts, with
Clinton scheduled to leave Tuesday on a trip that will take him to
U.S. military bases across Germany and to NATO headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, Russia's former premier, was to meet with Vice
President Al Gore early Monday afternoon and to see Clinton late in
the day, said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear him out,'' said Siewert, ``hear what he has to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes a day after Milosevic ordered the release of
three Americans Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich; Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and
Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas to Jackson, who
visited Belgrade on what the White House described as a personal
mission to try to win the soldiers' release.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation traveled overland from Yugoslavia's main state,
Serbia, to neighboring Croatia, then flew from there aboard a U.S.
C-9 Nightingale military medical plane to an Army base in Germany,
where the former captives were being held overnight for a medical
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Clinton should reward Belgrade by calling a halt to
the NATO bombing and sitting down with Milosevic face to face to
negotiate peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let them go,'' Jackson told the ABC television network.
``Let's celebrate that and let's seize an opportunity to move
toward diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson, ``a diplomatic gesture should get a diplomatic
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, though, made clear that the United States did not
regard Jackson's personal mission as diplomatic and that it would
not result in U.S. reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't characterize what Reverend Jackson did here as
free-lance diplomacy,'' Talbott said. ``He went with one objective
above all others, and that was to get the three servicemen out, and
he succeeded in that.''
</P>
<P>
   He called a meeting between Clinton and Milosevic, ``unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid such talk, there were fresh reminders of the risks the
continuing strikes pose to all parties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials admitted Sunday that a strike on a bridge at
Lusana, some 12 miles north of Kosovo's capital of Pristina,
destroyed a bus loaded with civilians. The Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry said 47 people - some of them children - were killed and
17 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Conrad Freytag, a NATO military spokesman, said the bridge
``was a legitimate military target,'' as it was used by Serb forces
to resupply units inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was not targeted, Freytag said, but crossed over the
bridge after a NATO pilot had released a bomb aimed for the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss of innocent life,'' Freytag said, ``is regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an American pilot ditched his F-16 fighter inside
Serbian territory early Sunday due to engine failure. The pilot
ejected and was recovered within two hours by a U.S. rescue team,
according to a Pentagon statement, which described the pilot as
being in good condition and said the cause of the malfunction was
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And a British Harrier attack jet flying what NATO described as a
training mission in support of Operation Allied Force went down in
the Adriatic Sea for reasons that were also under investigation.
The pilot ejected and was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen cast the release of the American soldiers as an attempt by
Milosevic to change the subject after army and police forces under
his command have gone on a rampage across Kosovo, executing an
estimated 4,000 ethnic Albanians and running another 1.5 million
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has characterized the activity as a crack down on
Albanian terrorists that got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gesture, if one can call it, of good will on his part
cannot obliterate or overcome the stench of evil and death that has
been inflicted in those killing fields in Kosovo,'' said Cohen.
``Under these circumstances, we have to keep our focus on what
Milosevic has done, continues to do, and what he has to do in order
to stop the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has demanded that Milosevic meet five terms before the
bombing will end:
</P>
<P>
   stop the repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   permit the introduction of a heavily-armed peacekeeping force
with NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   guarantee the safe return of all refugees.
</P>
<P>
   return to Kosovo the political autonomy it enjoyed before
Milosevic stripped the province of that autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of those demands, the United States has
been working closely with Russia which has close historical and
cultural ties with its Slavic kin, the Serbs to try to hammer out
an arrangement Milosevic might accept.
</P>
<P>
   He has agreed, in principal at least, to withdraw all except
12,000 of his forces from Kosovo a position the U.S. government has
rejected as insufficient but has refused to allow a NATO force into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, Clinton's top Russia hand, hinted at U.S. flexibility
over the force - the central issue dividing Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said such a force might be operated under the auspices
of the United Nations, if Russia agrees to allow NATO to lead the
peacekeepers. Russia is one of five permanent veto-wielding members
of the U.N. Security Council, so it's acquiescence would be
required for such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual modalities can be discussed,'' Talbott told the NBC
television network, ``as long as there will be NATO at the core and
it will have NATO command and control.''

SOUP AND SALAD FOLLOW GOURMAND CRUISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent meal aboard the Rhine cruise-boat Symphony was planned
and executed by a visiting, three-star French chef named Marc
Haeberlin.
</P>
<P>
   It began with an amuse bouche (literally, an amusement for the
mouth) consisting of snails and broth in a demitasse cup. The meal
also featured cubes of duck and vegetables la glee, a petite salad,
a portion of liver terrine, lobster cubes in a pearl barley soup,
roast lamb with wild mushrooms, Muenster-cheese potatoes and a
black-olive sauce, an assortment of French cheeses, then a spiced
charlotte with fresh fruits and a rich sabayon sauce, followed by
coffee and assorted petit fours.
</P>
<P>
   It recalled to mind the first ``cruise'' undertaken by Your
Obdt. Correspondent, aboard a troop ship headed for Korea. The chef
amused our mouths with a concoction he called ``saute on a
shingle,'' or something like that. His other specialty, served
standing up during North Pacific storms, was Chili Mal de Mer.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way, baby.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 Seattle residents recently lived the good life
aboard the Symphony and then _ after an interlude in Nancy and
Munich _ joined 24 others from this area aboard the Mozart for a
seven-day cruise on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   There were 19 cooks and helpers on the Mozart's kitchen staff.
Soup stocks and sauces were all created from scratch, bread and
desserts were baked daily, there were fresh fruits and vegetables
from South Africa, Israel and Spain, and a changing menu reflected
the boat's progress up the river and through the locks past Vienna,
Budapest, Bratislava and several other ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   One meal began with assorted seafood appetizers and progressed
through duckling soup with mandarins, a lobster-shrimp-salmon
strudel with Nantua sauce and wild rice, a Kir Royal sorbet, slices
of veal with port wine sauce, vegetables and individual potato
souffles, then cheese tartlets, baked Alaska with sabayon sauce, a
cheese course and, finally, coffee with freshly made truffle
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the kitchen's supply of ``saute on a shingle'' had
been exhausted before we came aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Both river boats also featured buffet breakfasts, four- and
five-course lunches, tea with pastries at 4 p.m., and a midnight
buffet snack. After awhile soup and salad sounded pretty good.
Particularly soups and salads like these.
</P>
<P>
   Soup Budapest
</P>
<P>
   7 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   half-cup rice
</P>
<P>
   1medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 carrots, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cabbage, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup green beans
</P>
<P>
   6 leaves fresh minced sage or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half or low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chopped, cooked chicken or turkey meat
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   half-cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   You can substitute your own choice of veggies in place of the
cabbage and green beans. If you prefer zucchini and turnips, that
doesn't necessarily mean you are a bad person. Just misguided.
</P>
<P>
   OK, heat the broth to boiling in a large pot. Add the rice,
cover and simmer 10 minutes. Add the veggies and sage. Simmer
covered until done, maybe another 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan heat the butter or oil. Add the flour and stir
over low heat until smooth. Add a cup of the half-and-half and keep
stirring until you have a thick sauce. Stir this into the soup
along with the rest of the half-and-half.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the chicken chunks and the parsley. Reheat, then add
salt and pepper to taste and serve. This should make six to eight
portions but save room for those homemade truffles.
</P>
<P>
   Salad Vienna
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces fresh or frozen green beans
</P>
<P>
   1 box frozen artichoke hearts
</P>
<P>
   half-cup sliced black olives
</P>
<P>
   half-cup sliced green olives
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 large tomato, cut in small cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 small green pepper, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   half-pound cheddar or other cheese, cubed
</P>
<P>
   two-thirds cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Garlic powder to taste
</P>
<P>
   Cook and drain the beans and artichoke hearts, according to
package instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the first eight ingredients in a bowl. Combine the oil and
vinegar and slop this gloop over the veggies as needed, one-quarter
cup at a time, saving the excess dressing for another salad.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the salad a couple of times then taste, and add salt,
pepper and garlic powder as needed. Serves six.
</P>
<P>
   One day, between a five-course lunch and a six-course dinner,
the hostess aboard the Symphony refereed a competition in which
couples tried to bust balloons by bumping their bellies together.
</P>
<P>
   See, that's why we ate so much. Like sumo wrestlers, we were in
training for international competition. It was sort of like a
little Olympics, with crepes and chocolate sauce available on the
sidelines between heats.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ It lasted no more than three minutes, three
minutes of savagery unleashed without even a word. ``They just
started shooting and I got hit in the shoulder. The dead bodies
behind me pushed me over the cliff and into the stream. I was lucky
because all of the dead bodies fell on top of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Isuf Zheniqi, who said he survived when 58 men died in a
massacre near Bela Crkva in southwestern Kosovo more than a month
ago, speaks out hesitantly, fearing Serbian forces might take
revenge on members of his family still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But after crawling out from under the bodies of his relatives,
neighbors and friends, with a bullet from a Serbian automatic rifle
embedded in his right shoulder and horrors filling his head, he has
carried around the names of almost all the men who died that day.
</P>
<P>
   In crimped handwriting he puts them down on the pages of an
address book, name after name of old men, young boys, teen-agers
and men, like himself, who were suspected by the Serbs of belonging
to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting to make Kosovo
independent from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the names of all but one. But he knows there were
58 because he helped bury them, each one with a written name.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees from Kosovo continue to flee across the border, the
accounts of atrocities committed by Serbian forces in Kosovo
multiply: a killing spree in the village of Velika Krusa, the
rampage of troops through the streets of Djakovica, the slaughter
of up to 100 men in the village of Meja.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts from different refugees are consistent enough to lend a
great deal of credibility to some of those accounts. But eyewitness
accounts by survivors like Zheniqi are rare, either because the
killing was done efficiently enough to prevent survivors, or
because the sheer terror of minutes like those on the embankment at
Bela Crkva prevents survivors from recounting their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   Zheniqi said that when he was brought across the border by
relatives he told human rights investigators what had happened at
Bela Crkva. But until now he has not given journalists a full
account his experience.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch separately interviewed Zheniqi and four other
witnesses, who corroborated parts of his account.
</P>
<P>
   Zheniqi was the only one who testified that he saw the actual
killing, Human Rights Watch officials said. Four women who were
separated from the men at Bela Crkva heard the shots as they were
walking to Zrze and later returned to see the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   And other refugees told Human Rights Watch that they were among
the group of 20 or so people who returned the day after the
killings to bury the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the witnesses gave us highly credible and unusually
consistent accounts of what happened at Bela Crkva,'' said Fred
Abrahams of Human Rights Watch. ``They corroborated what the
eyewitness told us.''
</P>
<P>
   The other witnesses appear to have left Kukes since they were
interviewed. It was impossible to confirm the killings
independently, beyond the refugee accounts, since reporters and
independent investigators have been unable to visit that area of
Kosovo since the bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   Today Zheniqi lives in a Kukes pool hall, with his daughter and
her family. He cannot use his right arm because of the bullet
wound, and during the days he can often be seen dozing in the sun
outside the pool hall, trying to steal some moments of the rest
that eludes him every night because of his terrible dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter tells me `Father, sleep, why don't you sleep?' ''
Zheniqi said. ``But I can't. All those dead bodies on top of mine.
When I meet someone from Kosovo and they ask me what happened, I
cry. I'm embarrassed, because I'm 39 years old and I'm crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The slightly built farmer, who worked for eight years in
Switzerland before returning to the fertile soil of southwestern
Kosovo, said that before the turmoil in Kosovo began over a year
ago, he had almost no contact with Serbs living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But the area was a known stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, and the Serbs were advancing ruthlessly on rebel positions,
including the area of Bela Crkva. Zheniqi said that he was not a
member of the rebel force and that none of those killed had any
connection to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   About 3:30 a.m. on March 25, on the first night of NATO bombings
in Yugoslavia, Serbian forces started their operation, Zheniqi
said. He said he saw about a dozen Serbian tanks take positions in
Bela Crkva. ``One was in front of my house,'' he said. Anticipating
violence, he took his family and his brother's family _ 17 people
in all _ and ran to the nearby mountains to hide.
</P>
<P>
   When the streets again fell silent, they returned, thinking the
tanks had moved on. But they hadn't. Smoke soon rose from the
houses of Bela Crkva that were closest to the road from Prizren to
Rahovec. Zheniqi and his family fled again, this time scrambling
down the deep banks of a large nearby stream. It was about 4:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people from the whole village started to collect there in
the stream,'' he said. They went to a place he called Ura e
Bellase, where a train trestle crossed the stream. About 800
villagers tried to hide beneath the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After daybreak, the villagers tried to move toward Zrze and
Rogovo, two nearby hamlets they thought would be safe. But Serbian
snipers followed their movements. About 9:30 in the morning,
Zheniqi said, 16 special policemen appeared, shooting their
automatic weapons in the air. Two families had strayed from the
group and Zheniqi said the Serbs opened fire, killing every member
of both except for a 2-year-old boy who had been protected by his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hid the baby in front of her and saved him,'' Zheniqi
said. His lips quivered and he could not talk. When he continued,
he said, ``I saw this with my own eyes, maybe 150 feet from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs then shot their rifles in the air again and shouted,
in Albanian, ``Get up and come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers climbed up the banks of the stream with their
hands over their heads. When they reached the train trestle, the
men were separated from the women and children, and ordered to
strip down to their undershorts.
</P>
<P>
   The police then went through their belongings, Zheniqi said,
taking anything of value. A local doctor trainee, Nesim Popaj,
tried to talk to the police in Serbian because his nephew, Shendet
Popaj, 17, had been thrown on the ground and was under a
policeman's boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb looked at the doctor, said just two or three words,
and told him to move over a bit,'' Zheniqi said. ``Then he shot
him. We were shocked. The man was a captain, using an automatic
rifle. He wore a green camouflage uniform, and on his shoulders
were stars. I don't know his name, but he was tall and he had a
scrunched-up mouth. I could recognize his picture easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were sent to Zrze. The men were allowed
to get dressed and then were forced to move over to the high ground
above the steam. Zheniqi was in the first line, at the edge of the
stream bank, with many men behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to say something to the Serbs but they didn't let
us,'' Zheniqi said. ``If we tried they just said, `Shut up.' We all
cried. Sahid Popaj cried from the moment we were forced to take off
our clothes to the moment he died. He just cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting started without a word from the policemen. Several
of them standing just behind the villagers opened fire with
automatic weapons. Being farthest away from the gunmen provided
Zheniqi with some cover, but he was still struck by a bullet in his
right shoulder. The shooting lasted about three minutes, he said.
The weight of the men falling behind him pushed him over into the
stream.
</P>
<P>
   He fell about six feet, landing in the water. ``At that moment,
I was just thinking of getting to one stone and from there holding
my head above the water. I stayed there like a dead man for a total
of maybe 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The terror had not ended. The policemen lowered themselves down
the embankment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone telling a guy in the stream: `He's breathing,
shoot him; he's breathing, shoot him,''' Zheniqi said. They found
nine men who had hidden themselves in the bushes, and killed them.
</P>
<P>
   He waited another 15 minutes, and when all was quiet he pulled
himself out from under the weight of his dead friends and
relatives. That was when he saw the extent of what had happened in
Bela Crkva. ``There in the stream, I saw terrible things: men
without eyes, men with half their heads blown off.''
</P>
<P>
   He staggered to Zrze, where he found some of his family and told
them about the killing. He said the men organized a group to go
back to the stream, but Zheniqi was not among them. He said they
found four other survivors, and piled them into the wagon behind
their tractor, dodging sniper fire. On the way back, two of the
survivors died.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, about 20 villagers from Bela Crkva returned
to the stream to bury the dead. Already, they were thinking of
justice and the memory of those who had been mowed down in three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote the names of all the dead on separate pieces of
paper,'' Zheniqi said. Then we put the papers inside plastic soda
bottles. There was one name in each bottle. We put the bottle
inside the grave, not on top. And we buried them, not far from the
stream.''

MAN CHARGED IN LONDON ATTACKS AIMED AT MINORITIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British police charged a 22-year-old engineer with
murder Sunday after three crude and brutal nail-bomb attacks on
ethnic minorities and gays in recent days that killed three people,
wounded more than 100 and confronted Britons with a violent
challenge to their avowed tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Scotland Yard official, David Veness, said the bombing
suspect, identified as David Copeland, had acted alone and was not
associated with the neo-Nazi White Wolves and Combat 18 groups that
took responsibility for attacks that left Londoners on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland was charged with three counts of murder and three
counts of causing an explosion with the intention of endangering
life.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers closed in on the Hampshire village of Cove,
southwest of London, early Saturday and made the arrest, hours
after a nail bomb exploded at the Admiral Duncan pub, a bar with a
largely gay clientele in London's Soho district.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that ``explosive materials'' had been found in
the modest, three-bedroom home they raided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no suggestion at this stage that the arrest is linked
in any way to the extreme right-wing groups which have been
reportedly claiming responsibility for these attacks on innocent
people,'' Veness said. He did not go into detail about Copeland's
possible motives, citing legal restrictions on pretrial disclosure
of information that can influence the outcome of court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But Veness left no doubt that the police believe the man they
arrested carried out all three bombing attacks that appeared aimed
at harming Afro-Caribbean residents of Brixton, south London, on
April 17, Asian residents of Brick Lane, east London, one week
later, and gay people in Soho two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appeared, and still appears, to be no trigger event or
specific date which has sparked these attacks, which were clearly
the responsibility of the same person,'' Veness said. He said the
bombs used in all three attacks were ``relatively rudimentary''
devices about the size of a shoe box, made up of a timer, detonator
and explosives packed with nails and other shrapnel. Copeland is
scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He was identified from closed-circuit television footage of a
young white man in a baseball cap recorded at a packed street
market in Brixton shortly before the first attack, on April 17. The
image was widely published in British newspapers in an effort to
identify the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The police also publicly identified two of the three dead from
Friday night's blast in Soho as Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant,
and John Light, 32, who had been the best man at her wedding two
years ago. Mrs. Dykes' husband, Julian, was critically injured and,
the police said, has not been told of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The trio had been visiting London to go to the theater and had
stopped at the Admiral Duncan on their way there. Of the 73 people
injured in the blast, eight were said by hospital authorities to be
in critical condition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is no stranger to far-right-wing organizations, from
pro-Nazi groups in the 1930s to groups such as the National Front
in the postwar era. But the supposition that right-wing extremists
had turned to violence had shaken many people and forced them to
ponder whether there had been a more basic shift in tactics among
far-right militants than had been assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Race relations _ particularly between black Britons and the
white-dominated police officers _ had been strained recently by an
official inquiry's conclusion that the police force had shown
racism in the investigation of the murder of a black teen-ager by a
white gang.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand people gathered in Soho Sunday to attend a vigil
for the dead in Friday's bombing. Paul Boateng, a black legislator
and a minister in the Home Office, told them, ``I am here to say on
behalf of your government that there is nothing so precious to the
creation of the just, tolerant human society that is our objective
than to preserve by all means its inclusivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed a gathering of Sikhs in
Birmingham, and likened his government's battle against prejudice
to NATO's campaign to stop Serbian authorities from hounding ethnic
Albanians to flee their homes in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one section of our community is under attack, we defend
them in the name of all the community,'' he said. ``When bombs
attack the black and Asian community in Britain, they attack the
whole of Britain. When the gay community is attacked and innocent
people are murdered, all the good people of Britain, whatever their
race, their life style, their class, unite in revulsion and
determination to bring the evil people to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true outcasts today, the true minorities, those truly
excluded are not the different races and religions of Britain, but
the racists, the bombers, the violent criminals who hate that
vision of Britain and try to destroy it.''

RAMBIS: RICE TO REMAIN SIDE DISH FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Glen Rice wants a greater role in the Los Angeles
Lakers' offense, but Sunday he was hampered only by his own
shooting woes.
</P>
<P>
   A day after voicing his displeasure with a diminished role in
the offense, Rice scored a season-low five points against the
Sonics. He missed his first seven shots and finished 2 of 10 from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of finding him when he's open,'' coach Kurt
Rambis said. ``He's getting open, we're just not finding him right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they are finding him, Rice is misfiring.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Rice said the Lakers haven't done enough to provide
him shots off of movement and screens and that it was hurting his
performance. Rambis said he's discussed the situation with Rice,
but said Rice needs to adjust to the Lakers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-way street. We have to learn to play with him, and
he has to learn to play within the structure of our team, too,''
Rambis said. ``He's gone from being the major go-to guy, to being
the second or third option sometimes in a lot of our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna take him awhile to get used to that. It's gonna
take our players a while to get used to what he likes to do. With
the short season, the trade, no practice time, it's just not
conducive to players learning how to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   But this season is nearing a conclusion, and it's possible that
Rice, who said he's ``not OK'' with his situation, might not stick
around into next season to make the relationship work.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he ``absolutely, wholeheartedly'' understands Rice's
frustration, but said Rice has to develop a spot-up shooting game
instead of waiting for screens that might never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it all comes down to is all the players have to
understand they have to make sacrifices for the benefit of the
ballclub,'' Rambis said. ``If that means giving up part of their
game for the team and improving in areas where they haven't been
asked to perform on past teams or past years, that's something we
all have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange days indeed: Lakers-Sonics on the last Sunday of the
regular season _ normally, that's a battle for Pacific Division
supremacy. Instead, Portland won the division, the Lakers are
battling for the fourth seed and their victory Sunday might have
knocked the Sonics out of the playoffs for the first time in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Strange? ``Nothing's strange for this season,'' Robert Horry
said. ``Everything has been off the whole season _ 50 games, three
games in three nights. It's almost like this season if you thought
something might happen, it wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent: Rookie swingman Ruben Patterson left the team to be with
an ill relative in Ohio and missed Sunday's game. The Lakers hope
he will return in time for tonight's home game against Dallas.

Slough, a few hundred yards from the fury of the swollen Skykomish
River, is the work of a coalition of community and tribal groups,
landowners and volunteers. By any measure, it seems an undisputed
success. But it is, in fact, at the heart of an intense dispute

13TH VICTIM FOUND IN SINKING OF BOAT IN ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., La., Mo., Texas, Ill., Calif.)   (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Returning to the bottom of the serene lake
where a tourist boat slipped below the surface on Saturday, a team
of divers found a 13th victim Sunday but failed to shed light on
what caused the boat to sink so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was identified by local authorities as Jim
Patton, 48, of Russellville, Ark., who had been missed by divers
when they recovered the bodies of the other victims on Saturday
afternoon. Sheriff Larry Selig of Garland County said the man's
15-year-old son, James Jr., who survived the accident, realized on
Saturday night that his father was not accounted for. Divers found
the body about 30 yards from the sunken boat.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Patton's wife, Floy, had died after
spending the night on life support, the sheriff said. The couple's
daughter, Jennifer, 20, also died on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims included a brother and sister, both under 5 years
old, and their father, all from Keithville, La.; and a 3-year-old
boy and his mother from Dyersburg, Tenn. Many of the victims were
trapped under a canopy when the amphibious boat began taking on
water several minutes into the aquatic leg of its journey.
</P>
<P>
   The accident seemed to startle but not benumb this leisurely
tourist region an hour southwest of Little Rock. Pleasure craft
sped blithely around a small buoy marking the site Sunday
afternoon, 300 feet from the shore of Lake Hamilton, and fishermen
returned to the surrounding docks.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had a few theories Sunday for how the boat could
have taken on water, but said they would have no definite answers
until after the boat could be raised, possibly on Monday. The
vessel, which had passed Coast Guard inspection on Feb. 23,
officials said, is submerged in 51 feet of water. Its owner, Land
and Lake Tours, is to return it to the surface using flotation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the victims were from out of town, the sinking
struck at the heart of the city's major industry. For four decades
the ungainly amphibious vehicles known as ``ducks'' have been a
familiar if curious sight around town, picking up passengers in
downtown Hot Springs, rolling on rubber tires down Highway 7 to
Lake Hamilton, and then slicing into the water for a $9 sightseeing
tour of the man-made lake and the old resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this where that duck went down?'' asked Webb Crouse, a
local fisherman who, like many residents, stopped by the lakeshore
Sunday, searching the calm waters in vain for the site of the
accident. ``It just doesn't make sense that one of those big old
things would just disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as they looked, the fleet of World War II surplus army
vessels had an exemplary safety record, never before suffering a
fatality. With their yellow and white hulls and candy-striped
canopies, the boats are a popular staple of the local tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ride on the amphibious duck is an unforgettable
experience,'' promises brochures that were still prominently
displayed Sunday in every hotel lobby. A cartoon-like map showed a
drawing of a boat making a big splash in precisely the spot of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Safety Board stood scratching their heads at the
shore like everyone else, baffled at the sinking. Many of the eight
survivors had said on Saturday that the boat took only 30 seconds
to go down in sunny, windy weather after taking on water in the
stern, descending to the bottom stern-first. But no one reported
how the water had entered the hull, made of quarter-inch steel and
built to handle 5,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Bowen, chief of the Coast Guard's merchant vessel
safety division, said it was conceivable that water had come in
around the propeller or rudder shafts. Or the hull could have
suffered some kind of structural failure. But he said the boat had
easily passed its inspection in February, just as have all the
other ducks in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the transportation safety board, John Hammerschmidt,
said Sunday that investigators had interviewed the operator of the
boat, Beth Hambrick, who told them that she had recently taken it
in for a repair to the rubber boot that surrounds the drive shaft
and prevents water from leaking in. The boot had been leaking, she
told board investigators, but had been repaired; Saturday's voyage
was the first since the boat returned from the repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard ordered that the dozen or so ducks operated by
two companies on Lake Hamilton cease operation until the cause of
Saturday's accident is determined, Bowen said. The Coast Guard is
weighing whether to impose a similar order on other amphibious
boats that operate elsewhere in the country, including Branson,
Mo., Galveston, Texas, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The 31-foot
boats, each weighing 7.5 tons, are part of a group of 21,000 built
by General Motors in 1943 as landing craft for allied troops
invading Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Land and Lake, Q. Bryum Hurst Jr., said on Saturday
that Ms. Hambrick, the boat's operator, had all the credentials
required by the Coast Guard to be captain of the vessel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The boat went down so suddenly that there was little for
survivors and witnesses to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' said Gary Ledin,
a survivor from Oakdale, Calif., who told The Hot Springs
Sentinel-Record on Saturday that he and his wife had less than 30
seconds to swim away from the boat and up to the surface. His wife,
Diane, managed to push her way through one of the windows, but many
other passengers were trapped beneath the red-and-white canopy.
Bowen said nine of the 13 victims were found beneath the canopy on
the boat; the survivors seemed to have been sitting in front of and
behind the canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were 38 life jackets on the boat, which seats 30,
none of the 20 passengers _ including the five children under 15
who died _ was wearing one. Federal and state laws require that the
jackets be on the boat, but not that passengers wear them. Arkansas
law requires children under 12 to wear a life jacket on
recreational vessels, but the sheriff said it was not clear whether
the law applied to a commercial boat operating on a waterway under
Coast Guard jurisdiction, like Lake Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Selig added that even if everyone had worn a jacket, it would
not necessarily have saved any lives. By making each person
bulkier, the jackets might have prevented people from escaping the
canopy and swimming away from the sinking boat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the survivors were rescued by other boaters and nearby
residents, but the job of lifesaving requires training. Danny
Harris, 16, said he was staying with friends at a nearby
condominium complex when he heard people screaming in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all ran down there,'' he said. ``I jumped in the water,
grabbed one of the guys who was trying to float, but he was
drowning me. So I had to swim back.'' He did not know if the man
whom he tried to rescue was later saved.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who included sheriff's employees and local
enthusiasts, described visibility at the bottom as essentially
zero, and said they found the bodies mostly by touch, about 40
minutes after the boat sank. When ambulances ran out of space,
divers had to place the bodies on nearby docks, and the sight
stunned nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop looking after a while,'' said Rhett Smith, a
computer operator living nearby.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Cal State Northridge had not committed to
building an on-campus football stadium, the Big Sky Conference
might have voted to end its affiliation with the school.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Big Sky commissioner Doug Fullerton said last
Friday, the day after CSUN President Blenda Wilson recommended the
North Campus site for building a football/soccer complex for the
Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``(CSUN) made a real commitment to an issue that is hanging out
there,'' Fullerton said. ``What attracted us to Northridge in the
first place was its potential for football.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton and the Big Sky have supported building an on-campus
stadium for CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe if you have athletics at all, you need the
ability to draw people back to your campus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Sky sent a ``memorandum of understanding'' to CSUN on
Sept. 27, 1995, describing the goals set by the conference for
upgrading the Matadors' football and basketball facilities. In
almost four years since Wilson signed the agreement, the North
Campus football stadium hadn't received any of the improvements
promised by CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   That failure, Fullerton said, hadn't gone unnoticed by the Big
Sky's university presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly an issue that will be discussed when the
presidents meet this summer,'' Fullerton said. ``There are
presidents that want a full disclosure of where we are going (with
CSUN's affiliation).''
</P>
<P>
   Vote of confidence: Sam Jankovich, CSUN's interim athletic
director, said the on-campus stadium recommendation by Wilson was
also an endorsement of head football coach Ron Ponciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that if this institution would support the
football program,'' Jankovich said, ``Ron Ponciano would be an
outstanding football coach here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano and his staff guided CSUN to a 7-4 record and its first
appearance in the Division I-A Top 25 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions: Myles Corrigan, one of four finalists to become
CSUN's permanent athletic director, faced tough questions in his
public forum last week about his role in Washington's NCAA
violations that put the Huskies football program on probation five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan, an assistant coach at the time, said he didn't have a
direct involvement in any of the violations. He is now the
assistant athletic director at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The next finalist, Moravian College Athletic Director Richard
Dull, could also be asked about his past at his public forum today
at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dull was the athletic director at Maryland in 1986 when
Terrapins basketball star Len Bias died from cocaine ingestion.
After months of controversy, Dull resigned. In 1991, he told The
Baltimore Sun he wasn't prepared for the scrutiny and at one point
thought he was having a heart attack in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Record breaker: Sophomore Annetta Wells, a sophomore from
Gardena, is on a record pace for breaking records.
</P>
<P>
   Wells set the Big Sky record in the 200 meters at the
California-Nevada State Championships in San Diego on April 24 with
a time of 23.52 seconds. Her time broke the meet record and was the
third-best mark in CSUN history.
</P>
<P>
   Wells also ran the anchor leg of the Matadors' 400 relay team
that broke the Big Sky record with a time of 44.82 seconds at the
California-Nevada Championships. The team of Wells, LaShaunda
Fowler, Anicia Rimm and Krystal Harris ran the second-fastest 400
relay in school history.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
How many Cuban National Team baseball players does it take to cause
an international incident? As many as the Orioles can stash in
their dugout to help get them out of the AL East basement.
Baltimore Orioles vs. Cuban National Team, Fox Sports Net West 2,
10 p.m. (delayed). 
TUESDAY 
Felipe Alou, who snubbed the Dodgers in the offseason, manages an
Expos team flopping around with a 7-16 record, 9{ games back in the
NL East. And no one in Montreal cares. What a sweet gig. Dodgers at
Montreal, Fox Sports West 2, 4 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
The punch-drunk NBA regular season comes to a staggering finish
with the Lakers guaranteed a playoff spot and the Clippers out of
it. We needed a 50-game schedule to figure that out? Miami at New
York, TBS, 5 p.m.; Seattle at Clippers, Channel 9, 7:30 p.m.;
Portland at Lakers, Fox Sports West, 7:30 p.m. (Note: The NBA
playoffs begin Saturday. NBC has a game at 2:30 p.m. and TNT has
one at 6 p.m. Sunday, NBC has games at 9:30 a.m., noon and 2:30
p.m.)  
THURSDAY 
It's Gabe Kapler's opportunity to get some TV time for the family
back home in Woodland Hills, but the guy the Angels really want to
see is Tigers reliever Mel Rojas. The exiled Dodger gave up 11
earned runs (five in the fifth, six in the sixth) during a
12/3-inning stint against Seattle the other day _ and managed to
avoid taking the loss. That went to C.J. Nitkowski, who threw five
pitches and issued a walk _ which came around to put the Mariners
ahead, thanks to Big Mel. Angels at Detroit, Fox Sports West, 4
p.m. 
FRIDAY 
Overexposed Fox Sports News anchor/celebrity Keith Olbermann, fresh
off a second-place finish on ``Jeopardy!,'' completes a week's run
on ``Hollywood Squares'' surrounded by cast members from
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' We know that former ``Squares'' host
Peter Marshall's son, Pete LaCock, used to play for the Chicago
Cubs. But that's where the sports connection must end. ``Hollywood
Squares,'' Channel 2, 7:30 p.m. 
SATURDAY 
Why isn't Pauley Pavilion the permanent home for the NCAA
volleyball finals? 'Cause UCLA might get an extra home game each
year? Not this time. In Thursday's semifinals, Long Beach State
will face Indiana-Purdue of Ft. Wayne and Brigham Young will take
on Penn State. NCAA men's volleyball finals, ESPN2, 8 p.m.
(delayed). (Also: ESPN2 has one semifinal live Thursday at 8:30
p.m. and the other on tape Friday at 9:30 p.m.) 
SUNDAY 
If she wants to watch the Dodgers or Lakers on her special day,
then it's her choice. Mother knows best. Here's an idea: Suggest a
brunch down at the local sports bar. Dodgers vs. Florida, Fox
Sports West 2, 1:10 p.m.

<P>
   It would be hard to find a parent more gung-ho about the
Internet than Faith Maupin, the moderator of an online discussion
forum for parents with teen-agers who spends much of her day
exchanging e-mail and wandering the Web. But after the shootings in
Littleton, Colo., last month, Ms. Maupin was shaken enough to sit
her own two teen-agers down for a heart-to-heart about their doings
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Did they ever find a recipe for a bomb? (Yes.) What sorts of
chat rooms did they frequent? (Various.) What, precisely, did they
have on their home pages at the moment? (Nothing alarming.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the other afternoon with my daughter learning far more
about World War II than I ever thought I'd know,'' said Ms. Maupin,
of Watsontown, Pa. ``But it still scares me that they can come
across things they're not even looking for. So I told them, they
need to tell me what they're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar family huddles are taking place across the country as
details emerge of the Internet's role in the lives of the two
students at Columbine High School in Littleton who killed 13 people
on April 20 before taking their own lives. And some parents are
doing more than asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents took my computer away today, because of what they
saw on television,'' one 10-year-old boy wrote to Jon Katz, a media
critic, who quoted from the e-mail in his column for the Slashdot
Web site last week. ``They told me they just couldn't be around
enough to make sure that I'm doing the right things on the
Internet. My Mom and Dad told me they didn't want to be standing at
my funeral someday because of things I was doing that they didn't
know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the two students involved in the shootings in
Littleton had played violent computer games and that one of them
had posted descriptions of making pipe bombs on a Web site appear
to have sharpened parents' concerns about the online activities
that are often the most mysterious corners of their children's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it was the one item checked on a mental list of
comparisons between their children and the gunmen in the Colorado
massacre. About 10 million American teen-agers use the Internet,
according to Jupiter Communications, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the profound ambivalence about the Internet that many
parents have voiced in recent days is more deeply rooted than a
reaction to the events at Columbine High School. A new study by the
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania found that even though a growing number of parents
consider the Internet an essential tool to which they must expose
their children, they feel distinctly uncomfortable with the
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sense that the Internet is important, but also
that it's a world out there you can't control,'' said Joseph Turow,
a professor at the university who directed the study of parental
attitudes toward the Internet. ``Even when parents make the
decision to embrace it, they are worried and skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, plenty of reasons for parents to be
apprehensive about the Internet. Unlike other forms of media, which
lend themselves more easily to ratings, the Internet is inevitably
a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   And efforts to regulate its content have run afoul of free
speech concerns. The first law passed by Congress to protect minors
from indecent material on the Internet was deemed unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court. A federal judge has issued a preliminary
injunction against a second law, and that action is under appeal.
The Senate is considering bipartisan legislation that would require
some schools and libraries to install software to block material
harmful to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some feel the current soul-searching, prompted in part by
the Littleton news, may herald more active parental monitoring of
their children's use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to parents about technology, it's a foreign
vocabulary to them,'' said Ginny Markell, the president-elect of
the national Parent-Teacher Association. ``Our kids are much better
at it. But we are coming around to the realization that this is
something that needs to be incorporated into the routine
responsibilities of basic parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategies adopted by parents across the country, who were
interviewed last week, range from moving the computer to a common
room to allow for easy supervision to reading teen-agers' e-mail
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's their privacy,'' said Maureen Carson, a
secretary on Long Island who has warned her three daughters, ages
9, 12, and 15, that she will read their e-mail as she chooses. ``I
tell them I'm the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who has studied the online lives of children and
teen-agers, applauds the consultative approach. Cyberspace is one
of the few places they have to experiment and learn, Professor
Turkle argues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the issue with the boys in Colorado is what were they
expressing, not whether they were expressing it on the Internet,''
she said. ``Parents should be very interested in what their kids
are doing on the screen. My concern is that the monitoring of
14-year-olds is just that it is going to close down the space where
they can have the privacy to be happy or unhappy adolescents.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mahaffey, 45, a lawyer in Washington, said he had simply
chosen to trust his kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that they talk to me about what they see and I can
rely on them to use their judgment,'' Mahaffey said. ``My son
learned how to play chess on the computer. Now he plays with other
people. My daughter does her homework on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, three-quarters of those responding to the Annenberg poll
say that the Internet ``is a place for children to discover
fascinating, useful things,'' while 72 percent say the Internet
helps their children with schoolwork. More than half said children
without Internet access were at a disadvantage compared with their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   What is difficult, several parents interviewed last week said,
is the sense of losing control once their children are set free on
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago when I was in school, you didn't have access
to millions of people to mess with your head,'' said Marti Seidel,
of Greensboro, N.C. ``What is on TV is sort of controlled. What is
in the movie theaters is sort of controlled. The influences that
you can be exposed to on the Internet are just a lot more
widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   To narrow that range, about 32 percent of American parents in
online households use software that aims to block Web sites that
contain sexually explicit or violent material, according to the
Annenberg poll.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hanna, 51, of Houston, plans to soon be among them.
After typing ``Drew Barrymore and pictures'' into an Internet
search engine, Hanna's 10-year-old son was linked to a pornography
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't bother me that bad if the kids found a nude
picture or two _ it's like finding a Playboy somewhere,'' said
Hanna, a stay-at-home father. ``But these links to triple-X sites
that have animated activity is a completely different matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Miller of Mill Valley, Calif., said she was moved to
action after hearing that the boys who shot their fellow students
in Littleton were avid players of the computer combat game Quake.
She has since forbidden her son Max, 9, to play his favorite game
Battlenet, where the object is to roam dungeons and kill enemies
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a violent film or TV show, I've always said absolutely
not,'' Ms. Miller said. ``But I realized maybe we're not being
vigilant about this because it's not familiar to me. Now we're
paying more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Stein, a lawyer in Philadelphia, might wish she had not
paid quite so much attention. Ms. Stein said she feared her
decision for the last two years to keep her Internet password a
secret from her two teen-agers may have deprived them of a certain
computer savviness that she sees among some of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep them away from chat rooms and maybe we were
too cautious,'' Ms. Stein said. ``They aren't as advanced as a lot
of their friends in that area, and after all, that's where the jobs
with the money are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the best parental rules have a way of being broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, sometimes I pick up the phone now and I hear the
modem is on,'' Ms. Stein added. ``I think actually sometime in the
last few months, they may have gotten the password.''

LUKAS GETS A LEG UP IN RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Charismatic's 31-1 upset Saturday clinched the
Kentucky Derby Trainer of the '90s title for D. Wayne Lukas, who
won his third Derby in the decade as Bob Baffert failed to win a
record third straight.
</P>
<P>
   But the Derby result did nothing to cool the Lukas-Baffert
rivalry _ which is real in fans' eyes if not in the minds of the
two Southern California-based trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt a real rivalry with him,'' Lukas insisted
Sunday morning, calling it a press creation. ``First it was Woody
(Stephens) and I. Then it was Nick (Zito) and I. Now it's Baffert
and I. I've been around long enough to know these things come and
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas credited Charismatic owners Bob and Beverly Lewis of
Newport Beach _ who also won the 1997 Derby with Baffert-trained
Silver Charm _ for preventing animosity by dividing their horses
and attention between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that (rivalry) with Wayne,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   But a rivalry would be natural. Both Lukas, 63, and Baffert, 46,
came up through the quarterhorse ranks. Both are proud and
press-savvy. And, along with two-time Derby winner Zito of New
York, they have dominated America's most famous thoroughbred race
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, each is intensely conscious of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Lukas, after asking reporters if anybody saw the ABC-TV
Derby coverage: ``Probably `The Bob Baffert Hour.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Lukas on Charismatic's fast improvement after starting
the year in claiming races: ``Did I out-train those guys or what?
... Did that sound like Baffert?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Baffert on the moment, as the Derby leaders stormed
through the Churchill Downs homestretch, when he realized the
Lewises' colt had a chance: ``First time I ever rooted for a Lukas
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert gave the proper credit to Lukas, who was named to
the racing Hall of Fame earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows he should have been a Hall of Famer a long time
ago,'' Baffert said of Lukas' fourth Derby win. ``They should have
waived the (25-year eligibility) rule _ like (hockey is doing for
Wayne) Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the trainer of the '90s. The guy is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas says he misjudged Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall,
getting away with running him in a claiming race in February. He
also thinks he did one of his best training jobs, waking the
horse's potential with longer, faster workouts starting before his
fourth-place finish in the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Before Charismatic's surprise, with jockey Chris Antley, Lukas
won the Kentucky Derby with the filly Winning Colors in '88 and
followed with Thunder Gulch in '95 and Grindstone in '96. The only
trainers with as many victories were Ben Jones (six between '38 and
'52) and Dick Thompson (four between '21 and '33).
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said matching Jones is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,'' he said. ``I'm healthy. I like what I'm
doing. I have the client base to get more good horses.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Lukas is aiming at the May 15 Preakness
Stakes in Baltimore with Charismatic and third-place Derby finisher
Cat Thief. He'll find that many of the Derby losers, coming out of
the roughly run race with good excuses, will try again in the
second leg of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Pimlico Race Course officials listed 10 Derby starters as
``probable'' for the Preakness: Charismatic, Cat Thief, Menifee
(second), Prime Timber (fourth), Kimberlite Pipe (sixth), Worldly
Manner (seventh), Lemon Drop Kid (ninth), Stephen Got Even (14th),
Adonis (17th) and Vicar (18th). One Derby starter was ``possible'':
K One King (eighth).
</P>
<P>
   Expected to try to join the series were Kentucky Oaks winner
Silverbulletday, Derby Trial winner Patience Game, Gotham winner
Badge, Flamingo runner-up Forty One Carats, Tesio winner Talk's
Cheap and Maryland-based Millions. The Preakness is limited to 14
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat everybody that showed up,'' Lukas said when asked if
the best horse won the Derby, in which most of the field ran into
traffic or had to race wide.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic was the 20th consecutive non-favorite to win the
Derby. Now, can he become the first Triple Crown winner since
Affirmed in '78?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to love the mile-and-a-half part,'' Lukas
said, looking ahead to the June 5 Belmont Stakes. ``If he can get
over the next one.'' The Preakness is 1 3/16 miles.

 NATO BEEFS UP ITS PUBLIC-INFORMATION STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
(mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO has called up reserves of spin in the
information battle over Kosovo, trying to take the initiative after
suffering earlier tactical reverses in news briefings in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The overall commander is still Jamie Shea, the gray-haired,
45-year-old Londoner who has personified the alliance's public face
to the world since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two weeks, Shea's original staff of six, tucked
away with support personnel behind the cafeteria, the bank and the
library, has been augmented by a multinational ``information
strategy cell'' of about 20 high-powered public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are P.J. Crowley, a member of the White House
national security staff; Jonathan Prince, one of President
Clinton's speechwriters, and Alastair Campbell, Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman, who commutes occasionally from London to
Brussels. Officials from France, Germany, the Netherlands and other
allied countries are expected to arrive within days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he expected to be here, Crowley said, ``My wife
asked me that question, too.'' Nobody knows, apparently, just as
nobody knows how long the war will last, but the information
strategy cell is already pumping out information from a secret war
room situated next to the North Atlantic Council, the
decision-making heart of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've helped enormously,'' said Shea, who became NATO
spokesman in 1993 but stumbled early in the air war, trying to
explain events like the bombing of a railroad bridge as a passenger
train started to cross, and later the mistaken bombing of ethnic
Albanian civilians fleeing Yugoslav military units on a road near
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   The second attack, in mid-April, posed one of Shea's greatest
problems when precise and timely information proved difficult to
obtain from the NATO military command in Mons, Belgium, which, as
one new information officer remarked Friday, is not exactly joined
at the hip with the policy-making civilian side of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   After first acknowledging that NATO bombs might have killed
civilians north of Djakovica, Shea and an allied military spokesmen
then said for four days that they did not know what had actually
happened, and retracted an earlier statement about a bombing of the
road east of the town, where Serbian television had broadcast
pictures of carnage that it said was caused by allied bombs.
</P>
<P>
   It took until April 19 for Shea's boss, Secretary-General Javier
Solana, and the alliance's top military commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, to sort out the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, of the U.S. Air Force, then took the
stand in Brussels to explain, in copious detail, how allied pilots
had indeed attacked what they thought was a Yugoslav military
convoy southeast of Djakovica and might have hit civilians by
mistake. That ended a daily barrage of reporters' questions about
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to that sequence, when Yugoslav news media reported
this week that NATO had bombed a civilian neighborhood in
Surdulica, the allies' new information machinery swung into
operation quickly. Officials say Campbell personally saw to it that
the military headquarters got an explanation for the bombing to
Shea within 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Shea, later backed up by a military spokesman,
Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani, told reporters that at least one
laser-guided bomb aimed at a military garrison had drifted off
target. Though Yugoslav officials said at least 20 people had been
killed at Surdulica, the accident never acquired the prominence of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Shea now talks with Clark daily by telephone, something he had
been unable to do before all his new help arrived. He now holds
morning news briefings on overnight bombing attacks, including
accidents like the missile hit on a residential building in Sofia,
Bulgaria, on Wednesday night, in addition to the televised
briefings at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get the message across better,'' a NATO
official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Paris a French Foreign Ministry official said several
information officers with experience in the Balkans would be
dispatched to Brussels soon to help deliver the message of France's
extensive contribution to the bombing to news media besides those
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, who never served a day in uniform because, he said,
Britain abolished compulsory military service when he was a small
boy, is actually a professor who still teaches at five institutions
in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``His students always rate him tops,'' said George Delcoigne, a
fellow professor at the Center of International and Strategic
Studies of the Free University of Brussels. ``He is friendly,
considerate and above all very entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea received a B.A. in modern history and French from Sussex
University in 1977 and a doctorate in modern history from Oxford
University (Lincoln College) in 1981. But he could hardly keep
racing out of NATO headquarters to go off and teach classes in the
middle of a war, so things have changed: Shea now has a small army
of specialists to help him concoct sound bites and focus the
alliance's message on the issues that its political masters want to
get across.
</P>
<P>
   That still sometimes seems to mean more information about what
the Yugoslavs are doing in Kosovo than about what the allies are
doing there, a peculiarity of these briefings since they began.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for example, the briefing opened with a long
disquisition by Shea on what he said were cracks in the facade of
unity behind President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now over the last few weeks we have had an impression that the
support of President Milosevic is virtually total,'' he said,
``that the whole country is radicalized behind a form of extreme
nationalism, that there is no opposition, that nobody dares to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe that this unity, based on fear, is beginning to
fragment in Serbia today and that opposition from within the
country to the campaign of `ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo and to the
course of confrontation with the international community, that that
opposition is beginning to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea named Vuk Draskovic, a Yugoslav deputy prime minister; the
mayor of Kacak, Serbia, and the heads of two Serbian political
parties as figures who had dared to dissent, going on to cite
reports that nine Yugoslav generals had been placed under house
arrest and that morale was cracking in the Yugoslav armed forces,
claims that were echoed later the same day at apparently
coordinated news briefings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But only an hour after Shea spoke, Draskovic was fired, and
later in the week American and NATO officials, speaking on
background, contradicted many of Shea's assertions about weakening
morale.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth in Belgrade, NATO's main public relations job
here, Shea says, is to tell as much as it can about its own
operations, which include not only the air war but also extensive
aid to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have poured out of
Kosovo since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   But, acknowledging the battering he has taken, he said the other
day, ``I think after this is all over I'll take a lesson in
humility and go back to teaching.''

<P>
   CHIJARASI, India _ Rani, an illiterate woman from the
washermen's caste, changed into her prettiest sari one recent
morning. Heavy with child, she boarded a series of crowded,
ramshackle buses for the dusty, 2 1/2-hour ride to the bureaucrat
who has become her teacher in the art of governing.
</P>
<P>
   Scorned by the upper-caste Brahmins who have long dominated this
small village, Rani _ who like many lower-caste women goes by only
one name _ is now head of the village council, or panchayat. ``I am
the boss,'' she said boldly.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of almost a million women who have been elected to
village governing councils since India adopted a constitutional
amendment in 1993 that set aside a third of all panchayat seats and
village chiefs' positions for women and set aside a percentage of
those for women from the lowest rungs of the caste system.
</P>
<P>
   This epic social experiment is playing out in more than 500,000
villages that are home to more than 600 million people _ about 1 of
every 10 people on earth. In many North Indian villages like this
one, women who are expected to veil their faces and submit to male
elders are now challenging centuries-old, feudal hierarchies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has turned power upside down,'' said Alam
Singh, a Brahmin farmer who was village head before Rani took over.
``The government is making these people sit on top of us. We are
the rulers, but now she is ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's stupid, she's illiterate, she doesn't listen to
anybody,'' he said, angrily poking the air with his finger.
</P>
<P>
   A new government-financed study, based on field work in 180
villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya
Pradesh and coordinated by the Center for Women's Development
Studies in New Delhi, found that while a third of the new women
panchayat members are just rubber stamps for their husbands,
two-thirds are actively engaged in learning the ropes and
exercising power.
</P>
<P>
   Like men, women panchayat leaders, too, are now involved in
obtaining village land for schools, selecting families who will
qualify for government housing and deciding how to distribute brick
lanes, latrines and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But changing deep-rooted social attitudes cannot be accomplished
by legal fiat.
</P>
<P>
   In Chijarasi, Rani has assumed the mantle of village chief _ but
whether she can hold on to it is another matter. While a third of
the seats on each panchayat are permanently reserved for women, the
panchayat-head slots for women _ one-third of the total _ rotate to
different villages every five years, when new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   In the next election, Rani's seat will no longer be reserved for
a low-caste woman. If she seeks re-election, she will have to run
against candidates from the land-owning Brahmin elite who have
always been in charge. Brahmin men, even those who believe she has
done a good job, say they will vote for one of their own next time.
</P>
<P>
   Generalizing about the experiences of villages _ each as
individual as a thumb print _ is risky, but government officials
say the new rules are having their greatest effects in states where
women have already made strides, for example in Kerala, where 9 of
every 10 rural women are literate.
</P>
<P>
   Change will come more slowly in a state like Uttar Pradesh,
India's most populous, where only 35 percent of rural women can
read and write, compared with 66 percent of the men.
</P>
<P>
   During six months of periodic visits to Chijarasi and Khoda, two
villages in Uttar Pradesh that are a mile apart, the subversive
nature of the change was apparent in Chijarasi, while the serious
obstacles were visible in both places.
</P>
<P>
   In Khoda, Munni Yadav is the pradhan, or village head, but her
husband, Bir Bal Singh Yadav, held the job for three decades before
he chose her to stand for election when the position was reserved
for a woman. Yadav, regally ensconced on his charpoy _ the
traditional Indian cot _ shooed his wife away to make tea and
declared that he would answer all questions. Each time she
attempted to speak, he cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lady is illiterate,'' he said, as his wife _ like a ghostly
shadow in a pale lavender sari _ walked around the courtyard, her
silver ankle bracelets tinkling softly. ``Shet has to attend the
meetings, but besides that, I do all the work and I explain matters
to the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   When the panchayat members gathered for a meeting in January,
Mrs. Yadav was sitting on the sidelines, holding her 3-year-old
granddaughter on her lap. The only woman in the center of the
courtyard with Yadav and the male panchayat members was wordlessly
pouring tea.
</P>
<P>
   Yadav, who belongs to the middling caste of cowherds, puffed
away on bidis _ hand-rolled cigarettes _ and accepted the greetings
of members. They said, bowing respectfully, ``Namaskar,
pradhanji,'' which, roughly translated, means ``Good day, mayor.''
Even Mrs. Yadav, herself the pradhan, called her husband by that
title and scolded visitors for failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an educated woman,'' said Mrs. Yadav, who won election
in a field of a dozen women candidates. ``I am a village woman. So
most of the work is done by my husband. We village women are not
supposed to come out of the house and speak with strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her submissive posture, Mrs. Yadav, who is 40, showed
flashes of spirit, when she was allowed to speak. She said she
would like to do more to educate girls, to attract a bank where
women could deposit their own money and to bring flush toilets to
the village.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband listening impatiently nearby, Mrs. Yadav said
the most remarkable thing that had ever happened to her since she
became pradhan was taking place at that very moment: someone was
listening to her views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my husband has not asked me these things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Chijarasi, Rani, who is 30, is also a traditional
village woman. She grew up in a hamlet where only boys were
educated. She drops her voice to a hoarse whisper and covers her
unflinching, hazel eyes with a veil in the presence of older
village men.
</P>
<P>
   But she is nobody's fool. Her whispery voice was loud enough to
put a stop to what she and others in the village say was her
predecessor's habit of collecting money from peddlers on behalf of
the village, then pocketing it for himself.
</P>
<P>
   After the long bus ride, Rani strode into the office of Kamlesh
Kumar, the state official who oversees development in 54 villages
including hers without benefit of even a telephone. Rakesh Gaur,
her husband and inseparable teammate in running the village, was
there to support her, but Rani did all the talking in her usual
animated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She leaned forward intently with her elbows resting on her
knees. The scarf that would have normally shrouded her face was
tucked behind one ear as she explained her latest suspicions to
Kumar: A group of influential villagers, in league with a former
petty bureaucrat, had told her to hand over the basta _ a book that
records the panchayat's business.
</P>
<P>
   She suspected they might be planning to jigger the records so
they could personally profit from selling some of the village land
that had just been chosen as the site of a new school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to give them the basta?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the edge of her chair, Rani awaited Kumar's reply.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the states are often laboratories of democracy, and it
was the southern state of Karnataka that pioneered the use of a
women's quota on village councils in the early 1980s as a means of
giving village women, who had lagged badly in many statistical
measures of well-being, a political toehold in the electoral
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, son of Indira
Gandhi _ the first and so far the only woman to be prime minister
of India _ picked up the idea and proposed it on a national level.
It was part of a broader constitutional amendment intended to
institutionalize democratically elected village councils and
decentralize authority to them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of affirmative action for oppressed, low-caste groups
had a long tradition in independent India. The innovation was to
apply the approach to women.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1992, a year after Gandhi was assassinated,
that Parliament _ then 93 percent male _ passed a version of the
panchayat amendment that retained the one-third set-aside for
women, with lower-caste women represented in proportion to their
percentage of the population. A year later, it went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent national governments have sought to extend the
women's quota to Parliament. But such proposals have gotten bogged
down in caste and religious politics, as some parties have pushed
for quotas, not just for women generally and low-caste women
specifically, but for Muslim and intermediate-caste women, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of the Congress Party president, Sonia
Gandhi, Rajiv's widow, the party decided last year to set aside a
third of all party positions for women, who now fill fewer than 10
percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   In villages, panchayats have turned into training grounds for
women who had been excluded from a role in village politics for
millennia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has given something to people who were absolute nobodies
and had no way of making it on their own,'' said Sudha Pillai,
joint secretary in India's Ministry of Rural Development. ``Power
has become the source of their growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other governments and political parties _ in Peru and Argentina,
Germany and Belgium _ are also experimenting with quotas for
women's political participation, but India's effort is by far the
largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best innovations in grass-roots democracy
in the world,'' said Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of the U.N.
Development Fund for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Rani, a cheerful, talkative young housewife who follows all the
proprieties of her village, seems an unlikely rebel. When she meets
an elder woman, Rani falls to her knees, wraps her arms around the
woman's legs and touches her feet.
</P>
<P>
   When guests arrive at her home, she disappears on her callused
bare feet, silver rings glinting on her toes, and returns to put
aluminum pitchers of steaming, sweet tea and frothy cups of buffalo
milk on the battered coffee table. She nurses her baby daughter,
Parvati, at the slightest whimper.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for Chijarasi, a village of 2,500 people,
to elect its first woman village head a year and a half ago, it was
she who was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   As is common in north Indian villages, politics is dominated by
caste-based voting. Chijarasi is divided into thirds: upper castes,
middle castes and lower castes. The only way to win a majority is
with an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The male Brahmin elite of the village say they supported Rani as
the least of the evils when it was announced that Chijarasi would
have to elect as its village chief a low-caste woman. The Brahmins
are the village's biggest landowners and dominant caste.
</P>
<P>
   In the caste ranking, Rani came from the upper rung of lower
castes. She and her husband are dhobis, people who wash and iron
clothes. They do not handle the substances the Brahmins of the
village believe exceedingly impure: animal skins, dead bodies and
human feces.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Brahmins knew that the dhobis were neither numerous
nor politically assertive in the village. And Rani was illiterate
and, they figured, malleable.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, 10 low-caste women sought to be elected
pradhan. Two were dhobis and eight were chamars, from a caste of
leather workers formerly considered untouchable. The chamar vote
fractured, and Rani prevailed with support from Brahmins and
Yadavs, an intermediate cowherds' caste _ an alliance that has made
her unpopular with other low-caste people in the village.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk one evening, a group of low-caste women gathered in a
lane to heap calumnies on Rani. ``We want land and houses!'' they
shouted angrily, and ``She has not given them to us!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rani replied wearily that 12 government-financed houses have
been built for low-caste families, but there is no money for more.
``And we don't have land in the village to distribute to the
landless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the caste divide, Rani has made an enemy
of the former pradhan, Alam Singh, whom she believed was corrupt.
Singh _ who denies that he ever did anything dishonest _ can barely
contain his rage when her name comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should be confined to the household and men should be
village heads,'' he said one afternoon, as men crowded around,
drawn by the raucous harangue of this almost toothless old man.
``The work of a woman is to cook the food and clean the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rani is caught in a sandwich of critics, with the
contemptuous former pradhan, a Brahmin, on one side and distrustful
lower-caste people on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But people from within and outside the village say she is an
honest woman who has done a good job.
</P>
<P>
   On a walk through the quiet lanes in October, past herds of
snoozing water buffalo and carts pulled by teams of oxen, Rani
pointed to the village hand pump she had gotten fixed. She showed
off the new brick lanes, electrical poles and street lights
installed on her watch and checked on the progress of a new
community hall, being built for 90,000 rupees, or about $2,100.
</P>
<P>
   Mahendra Singh, a Brahmin from another village who has taught in
Chijarasi's elementary school for 36 years, said he has seen the
local Brahmins try to sabotage her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They find it difficult to digest that a lower-caste woman is
the village head,'' he said. ``But she's doing a better job than
the others. When the village got 90,000 rupees for a community
hall, any other pradhan would have taken a cut of the money. She
did not.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also paid attention to the problems of women. Manju, a
28-year-old factory worker, came to her last year to say that her
drunk husband was beating her. Rani asked her own husband to talk
to Manju's husband. And Rani called the police and asked them to go
to the places in the village where men gather to tell them they
must not abuse their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Manju said that her husband has since stopped hitting her. ``I
had complained to the previous village head, but he didn't do
anything,'' Manju said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rani has lobbied state officials for a medical clinic. She
watched helplessly as five of her seven children died of diseases
she only vaguely understood _ a curse that she believes might have
been avoided had there been a convenient, reliable place in the
village to take them for checkups and vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials have promised to help,'' she said. ``But they
have done nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rani herself says she has learned how to operate as a pradhan in
her year-and-a-half on the job. She has gone to meetings in state
offices she never knew existed, watched as other pradhans raised
their voices to win more resources, then followed their example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gained a lot of confidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she has not tried to do it alone. She relies on her
10-year-old son, Vikram, to read documents aloud, his finger
tracing the lines of script as he haltingly says the words. She
sends her husband to speak on her behalf to village men.
</P>
<P>
   She asks the Brahmin elementary school teacher for advice about
how to deal with officials. And she has cultivated Kumar, the state
official who oversees her village.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about Rani is she asks for help,'' Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Rani turned to Kumar with her worry that a group
of villagers were trying to tamper with the panchyat record book
for their own gain. They had demanded she give it to them for five
days. She was unable to read the book's well-thumbed pages, but it
was a point of honor with her that they not be falsified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get my basta,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she waited fearfully that day for Kumar's reply to her
question: Did she have to hand it over?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not give the basta to anyone,'' he told her. ``And do not
sign any paper. They can do nothing to you unless they have a
two-thirds majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved, Rani smiled. With business out of the way, she, her
husband and Kumar chatted about village matters and the former
pradhan's efforts to undermine her.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kumar grew serious. And as he spoke of her honesty and her
pluck, it seemed that Rani sat up a little straighter and held her
head a little higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by her courage,'' he said. ``She's fought head
on with a very influential man of the upper caste who was head of
the village for a decade. And he has been defeated by the grit of
this low-caste woman.''
</P>
<P>
   With her resolve fortified and her rights established, Rani
caught the bus back to Chijarasi to take on her social betters once
again.

ELWAY INSPIRES PROSE, POETRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If John Elway taught us anything, it's how
important it is to read. Especially a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   (All right, so someone paid him to make that commercial. Like he
needed the money. But still, he had to say it).
</P>
<P>
   If Elway's retirement taught us anything, it's how important it
is not to read so much into it.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that Denver and the outlying areas are going
through a lot of pain. Some separation anxiety. Some feeling of
abandonment. But leave that for Columbine, guys.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some of what those who seem to care most deeply _ Denver
newspaper writers _ have tried to convey with their prose this week
about Elway's parting in such sweet ... aw, let 'em tell ya:
</P>
<P>
   _From Woody Paige of the Denver Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``What William Shakespeare could do with a quill pen and a piece
of paper, John Elway could do with a football and a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Let your indulgence set me free,' Shakespeare said, and
Elway proved ...
</P>
<P>
   `` `Let others judge me when I'm through,' (Elway) said. There
has been an occasional lapse on the field and off, a slip of the
ball or a slip of the tongue, but, like Michael Jordan and Wayne
Gretzky, Nobody Has Done It Better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parting, for the Bard and the Duke, is such sweet sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fare thee well, John.''
</P>
<P>
   _From Mark Kiszla of the Denver Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye always comes too soon from somebody you love. And has
any city ever adored an athlete more than Denver cheered John
Elway? ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget all the statistics. The best way to measure Elway? He
left us wanting more ...
</P>
<P>
   ``America will have to find somebody new to root for ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A man must carry on, because life does. And so Elway goes
...''
</P>
<P>
   _From Alex Marvez of the Rocky Mountain News:
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happens next for Elway? ... A career in politics is a
possibility, especially because Elway's popularity would make him a
serious candidate for any office he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood, Elway isn't entirely done with the Broncos.
Team owner Pat Bowlen plans to discuss an ownership stake with
Elway, who has said he would be receptive to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And doesn't the new stadium need to be named?''
</P>
<P>
   _From Ralph Routon of the Colorado Springs Gazette:
</P>
<P>
   ``He has led his last comeback. He has thrown his last touchdown
pass. He has won his last game. He has conquered his last
challenge, leaving everyone with a full chest of sweet memories to
treasure forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farewell, No. 7.''
</P>
<P>
   _From John Branch of the Colorado Springs Gazette:
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get a second chance to make a last impression. And
if Broncos fans are finding it difficult to smile knowing their
hero is gone, knowing that Elway's childhood is gone, we should
remember _ in the long run, we'll all be better for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that, more than anyone, includes John Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   _From the Denver Westword, the weekly alternative:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the continuing Columbine coverage ... the Elway
(retirement) infatuation that once would have commanded the entire
front page (of the Denver Post) received just a demure tease at the
bottom with the major Elway articles consigned to the sports
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``News judgment _ at last.''
</P>
<P>
   _From the Intermountain Jewish News of Denver:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's a headline on a feature about Israel's fears over
the approach of the millennium and its potential for religious
unrest. But you get the idea.

 &HT;    Gordon rediscovers victory lane
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ After three months of confusion on the
left-hand-turn circuit, things were made right Sunday as Jeff
Gordon restored his dominance in NASCAR's Winston Cup series.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, won the
California 500 for the second time in three years, leading 151 of
250 laps and beating points leader Jeff Burton to the finish by
4.49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon's third victory in 10 starts this season, but his
first since winning the Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway on March 14, a drought of _ gasp! _ five races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon seemed so relieved to win that he couldn't remember the
way to California Speedway's victory lane, where he celebrated his
win in the inaugural race here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't remember how to get there,'' said Gordon, who won
for the 45th time in 199 career starts. ``The last time, I took the
wrong route, so I just cut across the infield grass to get there
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading all but one of the final 87 laps, Gordon didn't
make up much ground on Burton in the points standings. Gordon
erased only 10 points of a 210-point deficit to Burton, who was the
runner-up for the second time in the last three races. Burton
increased his lead to 55 points over Dale Jarrett, who finished
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart both
finished in the top five for the second race in a row at third and
fourth, respectively. Labonte climbed to third in points, 154
behind Burton, while Stewart, a rookie, is sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended nearly two months of frustration for Gordon,
who didn't finish higher than third in the five events before
California, including DNFs at Texas and Talladega caused by wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels so good,'' he said. ``We've had a little bit of bad
luck here lately. We're human and we're going to have problems.
(But) we've got a better team than we've ever had before. We've had
some rough ones, but I knew we could get back to victory lane and
we proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also had some luck, which was missing in his recent lull.
After taking the lead from Burton on lap 128, Gordon made his
second green-flag pit stop three laps later. While his No. 24
Chevrolet was still on pit road, however, Ricky Rudd crashed into
the wall in turn 4, bringing out the third caution flag of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and his brother, Ward, and contenders Jarrett, Rusty
Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield made pit stops shortly before Gordon,
so they were left a lap behind leader Mark Martin after the
caution. Gordon's pit crew got him out in 17.6 seconds, enabling
him to beat Martin to the start/finish line under caution and
remain at the rear of the lead lap on the restart at lap 138.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw what was happening, I had my eye on the
leader and I knew that we didn't go a lap down,'' said Ray
Evernham, crew chief for Gordon's Rainbow Warriors. ``We were lucky
enough in that (Burton) and (Mayfield) had pitted earlier than we
did. We had a fairly big lead on Martin, so we were able to make
our pit stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin couldn't pass Gordon on the two-mile oval, and another
caution flag was thrown only two laps later. While the other
leaders made pit stops on lap 142, Gordon and Martin decided to
remain on the track. With 108 laps remaining, the pair would need
at least two more pit stops to have enough fuel to finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Jarrett's tires blew up only 12 laps later, drawing
the fifth caution of the race because of debris, which gave Gordon
a yellow-flag pit stop on lap 157. Gordon made his final pit stop
on lap 208, and the 15.9-second tuneup allowed him to increase his
lead over Labonte to nearly four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit stop is what did it,'' Gordon said. ``When it comes to
crunch time, when the pressure is on and it's time to make a great
pit stop, that's what these guys do. I got to the pits as fast as I
could, got to pit road and they did the rest of the work and got me
out really fast. I had a little bit of breathing room.

FOR JUNKER, TWO GRAND SLAMS IS VERY DEJA VU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the night Fernando Tatis made major-league
baseball history at Dodger Stadium, Lance Junker had gone out to
dinner with his wife. By the time he returned to his home in
Valencia and turned on the TV to watch what was left of the
Dodgers-Cardinals game, it had already happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that Vin Scully was talking about two grand slams
in one inning,'' Junker admitted to Mike Martinez of the San Jose
Mercury News. ``It didn't dawn on me that it was by one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Junker would know about that. Sixteen years earlier, on June 30,
1983 while playing for the Single-A Redwood Pioneers of the
California League, he did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember it like it was yesterday,'' said the former
Loyola Marymount University star, drafted by the San Francisco
Giants in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that two grand slams in one inning was
accomplished twice previously _ in 1947 by Ken Myers of the Las
Vegas Wranglers in the Sunset League and in 1952 by Armando Flores
of the Laredo Apaches in the Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   (And an ironic note: Myers was the pro scout who signed Junker
for the Giants).
</P>
<P>
   As for Junker, 39, his pro career ended when he was released
from the Angels in 1984 a few weeks into spring training. He's now
a vice president of sales for Aero Engineering, a defense
contractor and manufacturer of military spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   But a newspaper clipping of Junker's two-grand-slam inning is in
a collage, framed in the hallway of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if his leg was still in it: A cast worn by Michael
Jordan in 1985 following his only major injury while with the
Chicago Bulls was auctioned last week for close to $9,000 _ the
minimum opening bid was $2,000 _ according to William Mastro, whose
Mastro Fine Sports Auctions had the item among 1,500 lots for bid
via phone and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jordan's 1991 expired Illinois driver's license went for
nearly $14,000. Minimum bid was $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Elway factor: Last week, Las Vegas bookmakers had the Denver
Broncos as 7-2 favorites to win it all in '99. This week, Minnesota
is the 7-2 favorite; Denver is 5-1.

SAINTLY FRIAR GIVES ROME A DRILL FOR 2000 JUBILEE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Padre Pio, an enigmatic friar and mystic who has a vast
following in Italy and throughout the world, was beatified by Pope
John Paul II on Sunday before 300,000 devotees, who had joyfully
flooded into Rome for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and other Romans, however, reacted somewhat
differently. Rome braced itself for the influx of Padre Pio
worshipers by shuttering itself.
</P>
<P>
   School closings were ordered for Monday, when there will be a
special Mass, and _ perhaps more striking _ the regular Sunday
match of the Roma soccer team was postponed for the first time.
Traffic was rerouted, away from the city center.
</P>
<P>
   Tight security was deployed to keep out Padre Pio worshipers who
failed to reserve a spot in advance at St. Peter's or the auxiliary
site, the Basilica of St. John Lateran, where John Paul traveled by
helicopter after the beatification ceremony to pray before the
overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers' worst fears, which included predictions that there
would be 600,000 pilgrims, proved wrong, however. For an anxious
Italy, the tightly orchestrated beatification served as a drill for
the year 2000 Jubilee, when organizers estimate that more than 30
million people, including at least 2.5 million from the United
States, will visit Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco Rutelli, the mayor of Rome, congratulated the city
Sunday night on a ``brilliant'' success. Earlier last week, he went
on radio and television imploring believers to stay away unless
they had a ticket. ``Padre Pio followers are passionate, generous
and not easily controlled,'' he explained in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he said: ``The most positive success was that we were
able to organize the crowds. If we had not warned people to make
reservations, then there would have been chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings seemed to have scared many would-be pilgrims into
staying home and watching the event live on state television. Even
some of those who did come said they were nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith in Padre Pio, but I don't have a lot of faith in
Italian organization,'' Gina Rescina, a housewife from Noicattaro,
a small town in southern Italy, said after she got off a bus from
Bari to take the subway to St. Peter's Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She had made a reservation in January and paid $65 for a
round-trip package that included transportation, lunch at a convent
and a Padre Pio commemorative kit. She said her group's bus did not
show up on time in Bari on Saturday night. The pilgrims prayed to
Padre Pio, and a bus arrived an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the last step before sainthood. Padre Pio, a
Capuchin friar who died in 1968, is said by believers to have had
supernatural powers and a gift for healing, and he carried
stigmata, marks believed to represent the crucifixion wounds of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   He was revered by ordinary Catholics long before the Vatican
gave him official recognition. He was unusual among those
identified recently for sainthood in that his popular appeal
combined both medieval piety the ability to inspire a magazine- and
souvenir-selling celebrity cult that in Italy outshines that of
Diana, the late princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   For organizers, however, the ceremony mostly foreshadowed the
kinds of traffic and security hazards that could afflict Rome in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   City officials expressed relief over the orderly event, which
was preceded on Saturday night by a May Day rock concert that drew
500,000 people. But some critics, who resented the closing of
schools and postponement of the soccer match, saw it as a ominous
sign of how the Jubilee could disrupt normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that if this is a dress rehearsal for the
Jubilee, Rome can only function under a wartime curfew,''
complained Giovanni Negri, a member of the Lay Observatory of the
Jubilee, a watchdog group that monitors the planning.
</P>
<P>
   An advance-booking-only policy is not generally in the spirit of
religious pilgrimage, but it was one of several experiments the
Vatican allowed as a rehearsal for the Holy Year. The Vatican, in
fact, will soon put on sale Jubilee credit cards, allowing advance
booking for everything from papal audiences to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican planning for the Jubilee began in earnest in 1994. The
2,000th anniversary of the birth of Christ has special significance
for Christians. But it is also a Jubilee year, which now occurs
every 25 years. The tradition, borrowing from the ancient Jewish
law in which people forgave debts, summons believers to special
prayer and repentance.
</P>
<P>
   The church began inviting pilgrims to Rome on Jubilee years in
1300, when wars made it difficult for them to reach the Holy Land
in Jerusalem. Even 500 years ago, there were security risks. During
the 1450 jubilee, 200 pilgrims leaving a papal blessing mobbed the
only bridge over the Tiber, and 200 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Italian government budgeted $3.7 billion for
Jubilee construction and organization. Officials began sketching
out vast improvement plans, ranging from a new subway line to a
tunnel under Castel Sant'Angelo, near the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists and engineers blocked the tunnel, and other plans
had to be shelved, many of them because they could not be completed
in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a grandiose plan for the modernization of Rome, which
foresaw the creation of subways, trams and new highways, we have
gone to a modest plan of urban maintenance,'' Negri said grumpily.
Nevertheless, the city says there are now more than 700
construction sites ranging from street repair to building
renovations around Rome. They are all supposed to be finished by
Christmas, when the Holy Year begins.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a giant portrait of Padre Pio was hung from scaffolding
that has covered the facade of St. Peter's for many months.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the tourist season, as many as 900 tour buses
rumble through Rome every day. Plans to ban them from the center of
Rome throughout the Holy Year have enraged many tour operators.
They complain that they will have to park their buses at designated
lots outside the city and rely on city shuttle buses to ferry their
clients to the Vatican, the Colosseum and Piazza Navona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they kidding?'' said Luigi Curcio, a tour guide who
attended a meeting of angry tour operators last week. ``Two hundred
elderly New Jersey tourists are going to have to wait for a city
bus that already gives horrible service to Romans?''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much sympathy among city officials for those who
want to put tourists' needs first. Among tourists, ``we have to
change the hit-and-run attitude,'' said Marcello Fiori, a city hall
planner, who noted that it would not hurt tourists to walk more.
``Rome is not a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Vatican officials acknowledged that the beatification
events could offer lessons for the year 2000. ``Yes, it is better
to know today what the dangers and difficulties may be,'' said
Monsignor Crescenzio Sepe, general secretary of the Vatican's
Jubilee planning committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do rely on faith here,'' he said. ``We believe in
divine providence and that all will go well.''

40 YEARS AGO, L.A. COLISEUM LIGHTS UP FOR CAMPANELLA

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   May 3, 1975: With Drake Stadium holding a record 15,069 fans and
2,500 more trying to get in, UCLA freshman Willie Banks takes the
triple jump in a meet-record 55-feet, 1-inch in the last event to
give the Bruins a 75-70 victory over USC. Banks earlier beat
Trojans Olympic champ Randy Williams in the long jump. UCLA coach
Jim Bush, who would later coach at USC, proclaimed: ``This has to
be the greatest dual meet ever.'' (64)
</P>
<P>
   May 5, 1956: Jim Bailey becomes the first runner to break the
four-minute mile in the United States, running a 3:58.5 in Los
Angeles. It is almost two years to the day after Roger Bannister
ran a 3:59.4 in Oxford, England to become the first to break it.
</P>
<P>
   May 5, 1984: UCLA captures its fourth straight NCAA volleyball
title, a 15-11, 15-13, 16-18, 15-12 win over Pepperdine at Pauley
Pavilion to cap a 38-0 season. (69).
</P>
<P>
   May 6, 1961: In his final dual meet as USC track coach, Jess
Mortensen's team takes a 811/3-492/3 victory over UCLA. His team
never lost a dual meet _ he was 79-0.
</P>
<P>
   May 6, 1995: In a much anticipated bout for San Fernando Valley
fight fans, Sylmar's Rafael Ruelas meets Oscar de la Hoya in Las
Vegas. Ruelas loses his IBF lightweight title as he's knocked out
in the second round. On the undercard, brother Gabe Ruelas, the WBC
super featherweight champ, stops Jimmy Garcia in the 11th round.
Garcia collapses in his corner afterward and dies days later.
</P>
<P>
   May 7, 1959: On ``Roy Campanella Night'' at the Coliseum, a
crowd of 93,103 _ still the largest ever to see a baseball game,
and 20,000 were left wanting to get in _ attend an exhibition
between the Dodgers and New York Yankees to honor the former
Dodgers catcher, paralyzed after an automobile accident a year and
a half earlier. Between the fifth and sixth innings, Campanella was
wheeled to home plate by Pee Wee Reese, the Coliseum lights were
turned off and thousands of matches and lighters created a flicker
throughout the stadium. (29)!off
</P>
<P>
   May 7, 1970: Dodgers first baseman Wes Parker hits a 10th-inning
triple against the Mets to complete the cycle (with a single,
double and home run earlier). It's the last time a Dodger has
accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   May 7, 1972: The Lakers stop the New York Knicks 114-100 _ Gail
Goodrich scores 25, Wilt Chamberlain has 24 with a sprained wrist
and Jerry West adds 23 _ to win the NBA title in Game 5 at the
Forum. It's the first league championship for the team since its
move to L.A. from Minneapolis in 1960. (15)
</P>
<P>
   May 7, 1993: Wayne Gretzky becomes the first player to score 100
playoff goals, helping the Kings to a 7-4 win over Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays: Today: Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort (27) and
former Dodgers second baseman Davey Lopes (54). Wednesday: Former
USC basketball star Harold Miner (28). Saturday: Former USC
football star Ronnie Lott (40).

<P>
   Nonprofit organizations take in roughly a half-billion dollars a
year for lending their good names to the marketing of everything
from nicotine patches to pain relievers. But consumers are
sometimes confused about whether these are meant to be
endorsements, and regulators are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Full-page advertisements, for instance, ran last year for
Pravachol, a cholesterol-lowering drug made by Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., featuring the name and logo of the American Heart Association.
The association, which says the alliance was meant to educate the
public about heart attacks, was paid $600,000 to cooperate. Like
most charities, it insists that it does not make product
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Electrolux LLC, the maker of the new high-end Guardian vacuum
cleaner, sought out an exclusive arrangement with the Asthma and
Allergy Foundation as part of a campaign to persuade consumers that
a cleaner home is a healthier home. As a result, shoppers might be
impressed to see the foundation's logo prominently displayed on the
appliance's cartons and product literature and on the company's
World Wide Web site. Disclaimers, noting that the foundation ``does
not endorse any commercial products or services,'' appear in much
smaller print.
</P>
<P>
   And TV viewers who saw ads for Nicoderm in late 1997 might have
thought the American Cancer Society was vouching for the product.
SmithKline Beecham PLC, which makes Nicoderm, and the American
Cancer Society were described as ``partners in helping you quit,''
and the ads featured the society's name and logo. But the cancer
society, which receives upward of $1 million a year for the use of
its name and logo, says it endorses no commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they are called, the proliferation of such pitches has
not escaped the attention of state regulators, who are leaning hard
on some of the companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   In December, SmithKline settled with a dozen state attorneys
general who were concerned that the ads involving the cancer
society were misleading. In addition to paying the states a total
of $2.5 million, SmithKline agreed to spell out in its ads that
this was as much a business deal with the cancer society as it was
a joint effort to help people stop smoking. The words ``SB makes an
annual grant to the ACS for cancer research and education for the
use of their seal'' now flash on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Though the charity was not penalized, it acknowledges the perils
of such partnerships. ``Everybody is walking the line here, and we
all know it,'' Steve Dickinson, an American Cancer Society
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wage these battles one at a time, 16 attorneys
general, including those of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
now want to curb marketing pitches that may leave a misleading
impression of a charity's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, the attorneys general, whose responsibilities
include enforcing state consumer protection laws and monitoring
charities, issued a preliminary report about cause-related
marketing, in which companies and charities team up to sell
products or sponsor events or programs. The report _ ``What's in a
Nonprofit's Name?'' _ offers six guidelines that it wants both the
for-profit and not-for-profit sides to adopt voluntarily. Public
hearings are scheduled for May, with final recommendations to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Since American Express Co. learned in the mid-1980s that people
used their charge cards more when it promised to donate a penny
toward the Statue of Liberty restoration for every charged
purchase, corporations have hurried to sign up charities to help
sell their wares. Last year, they paid dozens of nonprofit
institutions an estimated $544 million, according to IEG
Sponsorship Report, a Chicago newsletter that tracks corporate
sponsorship and cause-related marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As advertisers deal with all this clutter out there, having a
cause deal will make a difference,'' said Lance Helgeson, the
newsletter's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   But when liaisons involve medical devices or health-related
products, regulators worry that consumers might misconstrue a
medical nonprofit group's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling their concern is the decision by many respected
charities, including the American Cancer Society and the American
Heart Association, to lend their names and logos to ads for
specific drugs or devices. The regulators fear that the public will
mistakenly infer that these groups, as experts in given diseases,
are backing certain products over others, said Barbara Tuerkheimer,
a Wisconsin assistant attorney general who is helping to lead the
16-state inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say the charities, which contend that these joint
campaigns get their message out to more people than the groups
could on their own. The Arthritis Foundation, for example, wanted
to educate people about the different types of arthritis. It
accepted $1 million a year from the McNeil Consumer Products
division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson to let McNeil start using its name to
market over-the-counter pain relievers in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, McNeil and the foundation settled with 19
attorneys general, with McNeil agreeing to pay $2 million and stop
making certain claims. Ads could not imply that the foundation had
helped create the pain relievers or that a portion of every
purchase was funding research, when actually a certain threshold
had to be met.
</P>
<P>
   The ads no longer run, and the partnership was not renewed. A
McNeil spokesman said the campaign was just not effective, while
Don Riggin, chief executive of the Arthritis Foundation, said his
organization felt ``very comfortable that this particular program
achieved our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many charities see these partnerships as an innocuous
way to tap a new source of badly needed revenue. ``I just don't see
the problem,'' said Joseph Bergen, chief operating officer of the
American Lung Association, which was promised $2.5 million in 1997
to lend its name to two years of anti-smoking efforts being
sponsored by McNeil, the maker of the Nicotrol patch.
</P>
<P>
   But charities have had an inkling for some time that these
partnerships could draw scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the American Cancer Society's own research, for
instance, suggests that consumers, who place an extraordinary
amount of trust in charities, assume the charity is standing behind
a product when its name is used. A 1994 study, sponsored by the
Michigan division of the society, concluded after conducting focus
groups and consumer interviews that the use of its logo ``is
considered an `endorsement' by the ACS by nearly all group
participants.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors who are members of the American Medical Association
and others were worried about just this type of confusion in August
1997, when a buoyant Sunbeam announced that the AMA had agreed to
affix its name on products ranging from blood pressure monitors to
heating pads. After the association backed off in the face of
intense criticism, it settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by
Sunbeam for nearly $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   What the regulators want, and some charities resist, is more
disclosure _ that if no endorsement is being made, the ad would
make that clear. The attorneys general also want the ads to state
whether the charities are being paid for the use of their names and
whether these arrangements are exclusive. Exclusive deals, the
attorneys general argue, reinforce a false impression that one
product is better than another.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to the charities' bottom lines is that if companies
have to reveal so much, they might not want to bother with the
joint campaigns. ``Companies may decide it is not worth their while
to have all this regulatory language,'' said David Livingston, an
executive vice president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bierig, a Chicago lawyer who represented the AMA in its
dispute with Sunbeam, urged regulators to seek a middle ground.
``In our zeal to get rid of some things,'' he said, ``we ought to
be careful not to discourage very well-motivated associations
between a nonprofit and a company.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little evidence of a pall. The American Cancer
Society now limits its exclusive arrangement with companies to
specific events, like the Great American Smokeout, with the view
that they can still team up with rival companies on other
occasions. Even with that risk, SmithKline, a corporate sponsor of
the event, was happy to renew its partnership with the charity,
said George Quesnelle, director of medical marketing and sales for
SmithKline Beecham's Consumer Healthcare division.
</P>
<P>
   But if public health is the goal, said Mildred Cho, a researcher
at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, charities should ask
themselves whether there really is a difference between allowing
their names to be used in marketing and an all-out endorsement.
``If they are not endorsing it, why are they putting their name on
it?'' she asked. ``If the goal is to educate generally about
smoking cessation or nutrition, you don't need to mention a
specific product.''

PIECE BY PIECE, QUILTERS ARE MARKING THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Millennium madness is not confined to survivalists
stockpiling goods or frenzied computer experts swatting software
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Quilters are already celebrating the thousand-year change.
Stitch by stitch they're creating their own historic millennium
quilts _ quilts with 2,000 tiny pieces.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Dyanne Kruger, a quilter in Vashon Island, Wash.,
who created a futuristic pattern that uses 2,000 pieces. She calls
her design ``Millennia Mania.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger put a photo of a finished quilt square on her Web site
offering interested quilters the pattern for $6.95. She's sold more
than 140 patterns in 12 weeks. See it at:
www.primechoice.com/blissbitsdesigns/
</P>
<P>
   Computers and quilts may sound like an unlikely combination, but
for Kruger and others, high tech brings this age-old craft into the
info age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get 2,000 different fabric pieces for a quilt,''
Kruger says. So like other resourceful quilters, she turned to the
Internet and began swapping quilt pieces after discovering that she
had plenty of company in the Y2K quilting craze.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at Keepsake Quilting, a New Hampshire publication, saw
her pattern and liked it so much they wanted to photograph her
``Millennia Mania'' quilt for a future issue. Kruger was flattered,
but her quilt was barely started. Only two blocks and 200 pieces of
it existed _ 1,800 scraps and 18 blocks to go.
</P>
<P>
   A ``cyber chum'' quilter in California volunteered to make six
of those blocks. An Arkansas quilter said she'd assemble two.
Kruger and friends from her Island stitchers group came up with the
rest and it was camera-ready in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Weinman, owner of Heartbeat Quilts in Hyannis, Mass., says
quilts have been used as commemoratives throughout history _
births, deaths, weddings and, more recently, to remember those
who've died from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. bicentennial in 1976 led to a huge surge of quilting,
Weinman says. ``It's been going strong ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage millennium quilts, Weinman's store is offering
``Millennium Charm Packs'' of 200 four-inch fabric squares, and
challenging customers to make quilts with at least 2,000 different
fabric pieces. A jury will select five finalists to hang in the
store, June through August 2000. Visitors will vote on their
favorite and the winner will receive a $500 shopping spree at
Heartbeat Quilts.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one catch. Fifty percent of the fabrics used must
come from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric companies are feeding this niche-market frenzy with
so-called ``millennium fabric lines,'' says Jason Yenter, vice
president of a Seattle quilting store, In The Beginning. One fabric
has a clock and antique watch motif; another has a numerical 2000
motif.
</P>
<P>
   What makes millennium quilts so appealing? They're not just
commemorative, they're challenging. A queen-size quilt in a
traditional log cabin pattern, for example, uses about 672 pieces
of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Putting 2,000 different fabric pieces in the same size quilt
means working with smaller pieces _ a greater design challenge and
a lot more stitching.
</P>
<P>
   Renton, Wash., quilter Sharon Houchens has purchased some
2000-motif fabric for the border of her millennium quilt, which
will have 2,001 pieces when complete. She quilts with a group at
Fairwood United Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   To get the 2,000 different fabric pieces needed for their
quilts, this group of quilters went into their fabric stashes for
250 different fabric pieces each, pieces big enough to make eight
2{-inch squares. Then they traded squares to use in an assortment
of quilt designs.
</P>
<P>
   One member is doing a heart-motif quilt, another is making a
friendship quilt. Houchens says she plans to have the top of her
trip-around-the-world pattern pieced by Dec. 31, 1999, and the
quilt completed before New Year's Eve 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to cut and trade fabrics, Pieces, a
Renton, Wash., quilting store, is selling packets of 167 fabric
squares each month. Customers who buy 12 of them will have 2,004
squares to quilt. Manager Vicki Ramseur says they have about 300
customers working on millennium quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are quilters who want to make their millennium quilt
projects really challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Raft of Snoqualmie, Wash., has been on the Internet
searching out fabric from all over the world for her quilt. She now
has fabric packets from all 50 states and 15 foreign countries.
Raft says it takes about 80 swaps to get 2,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   She's especially pleased to have found a fabric swapper in North
Dakota. ``Washington quilters are good swappers. North Dakota
swappers are hard to find,'' Raft says.

HIS FAMILY'S PAST IS SAID TO WEIGH ON NATO'S COMMANDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American general who is leading NATO's military
operation to stop Yugoslav troops from killing and expelling
Albanians from Kosovo discovered as an adult that he is the
grandson of a Russian Jew who fled his country to escape the
pogroms there a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Kanne Clark was raised as a Protestant in Little
Rock, Ark., where he was brought up by his mother and stepfather,
Victor Clark. He was ignorant of his ancestry, which disappeared
from his life with the death of his father, Benjamin Jacob Kanne
when Wesley was 5. He learned of his ethnic background when he was
in his 20s and embraced the discovery, according to several family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began the forced
exodus of Albanians from Kosovo, many have drawn parallels with the
expulsion of Jews from Russia and the Nazi mass murder of Jews
during the Holocaust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has not discussed his heritage with many people, sharing
his belated discovery of his biological father's family and
background with only a few close friends and his immediate family.
He declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, some of his relatives and friends say that
Clark was inspired by the story of his grandfather's persecution
and escape from his native land, and that his determination to
defeat Milosevic is fed in part by his empathy for the victims of
Serbian ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   After he was married, while studying at Oxford from 1966 to
1968, Wesley Clark was contacted by his father's relatives and
gradually became aware of who his father and grandparents were.
Soon after, he met some of the members of his lost family. He then
slowly became part of the Kanne family, beginning with the initial
phone call from a cousin in the late 1960s and culminating with an
invitation to his first cousin Barry Kanne to spend a quiet New
Year dinner with him in Belgium this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also has become fluent in the Russian language and in the
past three years has delved into the family history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's visited my mother several times in the past two years to
find out what he could about his father and grandfather _ she is
the oldest living relative and the repository of the family
history,'' said Barry Kanne, the general's first cousin and the son
of Benjamin Kanne's only brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1890s, Jacob Nemerovsky, the general's grandfather,
fled Russia in fear for his life during one of the episodic pogroms
against Jews. According to the family, Nemerovsky found safety in
Switzerland where he obtained a false passport under the family
name of Kanne, which he used to immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes and I talked about his family once on a military plane to
Bosnia,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the negotiator of the Dayton
peace plan. ``I told him how my wife discovered she was Jewish in
her 30s and he said, `That's funny, I have a sort of similar
story.'''
</P>
<P>
   (Another Clinton administration official, Madeleine Albright,
learned only after she was nominated as secretary of state that her
grandparents had died in concentration camps during the Holocaust.)
</P>
<P>
   The Kanne family say they believe that Clark has, in the Balkans
crisis, called on discipline and motivation that reminds them of
his father. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the retired chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and a confidant of Clark's, says that the
general has been under ``unbelievable stress'' as the Kosovo air
campaign has expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark has an infinite capacity for hard work and stress,''
Shalikashvili said. ``That's a characteristic of his _ he devotes
all of his energies to get the job done and done right.''
</P>
<P>
   These were also characteristics of his father B.J. Kanne, who in
a grainy 1927 newspaper photograph bears a remarkable resemblance
to the man commanding the biggest European conflict since World War
II. His father had made the news for resigning from his position as
assistant prosecuting attorney in Chicago that year in order to
``devote his entire time'' to run for election as alderman of the
Fourth Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very active in politics in Chicago, and a University of
Chicago graduate,'' said Harriet Salk, an older cousin of Clark who
lives in a suburb outside the city. ``And what a tall, good-looking
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers that handsome uncle from the family gatherings
every Friday night _ the beginning of Sabbath _ and again on Sunday
evening at the home of Grandmother Kanne, the widow of Jacob. The
family is not sure, but they believe she, too, fled Russia, coming
to America with Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   The general's father, who served as a Navy ensign during World
War I, practiced law in Chicago's corporation counsel for 20 years
and had joined a private firm with his brother Louis when he died
suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 51. He left behind his
widow, Veneta Kanne, and a lone son, Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, Mrs. Salk said, ``the constituents were lined up
for blocks to pay their respects to Wesley's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards, the young Wesley Clark moved with his mother to
her hometown of Little Rock, far away from the close knit Chicago
family of his hard-driving, ambitious father.
</P>
<P>
   His mother remarried Victor Clark, who adopted Wesley and gave
him his name, and thereafter the Kanne family learned of the
accomplishments of B.J.'s son from a distance. Florence Ellis, one
of the five sisters of B.J. Kanne, kept up a private correspondence
with Veneta Kanne Clark, and passed on the letters about Wesley to
the rest of the Kanne family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Wesley K. Clark graduated first in his high school class,
then first in his class at West Point, the family heaped praise on
Veneta for raising him so well and also avoided any direct contact
with Wesley out of respect for Veneta's new life, according to
cousin Barry Kanne.
</P>
<P>
   Then when Wesley Clark was attending Oxford as a Rhodes scholar,
one of the cousins, Molly Friedman from Cleveland, was visiting
England and called Wesley at the university. At that point Clark
didn't even know why he had the unusual middle name of Kanne, much
less who his real father or grandfather were, according to the
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a master's degree, Clark left Oxford to fight in
Vietnam, where he commanded a mechanized infantry company, was
wounded four times and received the Silver Star and Purple Heart
awards.
</P>
<P>
   He also converted to Roman Catholicism in Vietnam, abandoning
the Southern Baptist faith of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, Clark had few contacts with the Kanne
family as he climbed up the military ranks and began to build his
strong political network, beginning with his appointment as a White
House fellow immediately after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, Barry Kanne's daughter April introduced
herself to Clark's son, Wesley, Jr., when they were both studying
at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked him up and he had already heard a lot of the stories
at that point,'' said April Kanne Donnellan. ``After that I spent a
couple of Christmases at General Clark's home at Fort McNair.''
</P>
<P>
   Through their children's contacts, Clark finally met Barry
Kanne, his first cousin and the only other direct male descendant
of Jacob Nemorovsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was this contact about five years ago that led Clark to
embark on a more thorough search into his father's family. ``He
knew a moderate amount about the family when I met him,'' said
Barry Kanne. ``He was trying to fill in the gaps so I pointed him
towards Mom and he's visited her several times.''

 MILOSEVIC TO FREE THREE US SERVICEMEN
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said Saturday
he would release three US serviceman held captive for more than a
month, apparently hoping his good-will gesture might pave the way
to a negotiated end to NATO's punishing bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers are expected to be handed over Sunday to the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who arrived in Belgrade Friday on a mission,
conducted without the Clinton administration's blessing, to win
their freedom. The three will probably go to nearby Croatia, and
from there to a US military base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There were no conditions attached to the release, but Jackson
issued a plea to NATO for a pause that would give Serbs ``a night
of peace from bombs'' and allow for some kind of diplomatic effort
to take root.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who met with the three soldiers Friday and held prayers
and talks with Milosevic Saturday, said he would carry a letter to
President Clinton from the Serbian leader with a plea to end the
bombing, an outline of Milosevic's ideas on ending the crisis, and
an offer to meet with Clinton to discuss a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Serbian state television channel RTS reported that
a NATO attack killed between 34 and 60 people Saturday when a
missile hit a bus on a bridge north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   RTS showed pictures of the destroyed bus on a bridge and bodies
scattered nearby. RTS said four people survived the attack. Half
the vehicle plunged off the bridge while passengers in the other
half burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation. In Brussels, NATO
officials said they were checking the report. An alliance military
source said the bridge was not on NATO's target list, but added:
``This doesn't mean it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO conducted the heaviest bombing of Yugoslavia Saturday since
the campaign began six weeks ago, with 600 sorties for the second
day running.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes were aimed at attacking the ``nervous system'' of
Yugoslavia's armed forces, as well as signaling the Western
alliance's continued resolve to press ahead following a legislative
blow to the campaign Wednesday from the US House of
Representatives, which rejected a motion to support sending in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has not officially responded to Jackson's request for a
pause in the bombing campaign. But Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright reportedly told Jackson that while Washington welcomes the
release of the prisoners, its position ``remains unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   --Tanjug, Yugoslavia's state news agency, reported that NATO
missiles damaged a maternity hospital and police station in
Pancevo, north of Belgrade, as well as a bridge leading from the
Yugoslav province of Montenegro into Kosovo. The attack, according
to Tanjug, killed four, including two ethnic Albanian children.
</P>
<P>
   --The UN high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, said
the Yugoslav government estimated that 500 civilians have died as a
result of the NATO bombings. So far, NATO has acknowledged only 112
deaths caused by at least three errant bombings.
</P>
<P>
   --The European Union's ban on oil shipments, designed to starve
the Milosevic military machine of fuel, took effect Saturday as the
White House announced additional sweeping unilateral sanctions
against Yugoslavia. The US sanctions, which exempt the republic of
Montenegro, are designed to strengthen the embargo by banning
imports and exports of all ``goods, software, technology and
services,'' except medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO forces have captured a second Yugoslav soldier and are
holding him in Germany, the Pentagon said Saturday. Pentagon
spokesman Lt. Col. Lane Van de Steeg said he did not know the rank
of the Yugoslav officer or the circumstances of his capture.
</P>
<P>
   --Fresh violence broke out along the Kosovo-Albanian border in
the town of Letaj, in an area where hundreds of thousands of
refugees have crossed. The area is also increasingly being used by
the Kosovo Liberation Army as a staging ground for raids against
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   --Refugees continued to spill over the Albanian border following
exodus of 12,000 Kosovar Albanians on Friday alone. Thousands more
were expected over the weekend, according to the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   --There were repeated, but unconfirmed reports that Serb
military forces were pulling males of all ages off Kosovo refugee
convoys making their way to the border. One report said men were
picked from their vehicles and forcibly put on a bus holding more
than 100 male Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   --The Pentagon designated Fort Dix, N.J., as the processing
point for 20,000 Albanian refugees who are being flown into the
United States for temporary shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Balkans envoy Viktor S. Chernomyrdin returned from his
mission to Bonn, Rome, and Belgrade with a pessimistic view on the
prospects for peace, saying the chances of arriving at a political
settlement were slim following the West's dismissal of a seven
point Russian-Yugoslav proposal for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister, however, said he would press on with
his mission to sell the plan to Western leaders this week.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has said he would withdraw troops from Kosovo to a
``pre-war'' level but only if NATO halted the bombing campaign and
removed its forces from Yugoslavia's frontiers. He has refused,
however, to bow to the alliance's demand that an armed
international presence be allowed into Kosovo to ensure the safe
return of almost 1 million ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   US officials dismissed the plan as long as it did not call for a
larger withdrawal of Serb military, police and paramilitary forces
from the region, as well as an armed peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told the German magazine
Der Spiegel that the alliance's campaign was achieving its goals
and with the imminent deployment of US Apache helicopters, moving
into its ``final phase.''
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing in Brussels Saturday, NATO announced its jets and
missiles had struck an untold number of tanks, command posts,
armored vehicles and mortar positions, as well as military
airfields in the cities of Sombor and Ponikve, and an oil refinery
in Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   Also hit were transmission towers and control buildings for the
Yugoslav radio relay network in seven locations, what Peter Daniel,
a NATO spokesman, called the ``nervous system that keeps the
Milosevic machine informed and in touch.''

LONDON GRIPPED BY FEAR OF RACIST BOMBINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Golders Green, the heart of this city's Jewish
community, usually is quiet on Saturdays as Orthodox Jews observe
the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, it was less crowded than usual. Even secular Jews
stayed out of the shops, and the gentiles who often take advantage
of a quiet day to shop stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many people think Golders Green, or some place
like it, is the next target of a bomber believed to be a racist who
has struck three times in London in 14 days, killing two and
wounding more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why a group of Orthodox men, dressed in traditional
black garb, stopped a stranger who was asking questions along the
Finchley Road Saturday. The stranger was a newspaper reporter, and
so there were handshakes and good wishes all around. But in a city
of 7 million, all strangers are now suspect.
</P>
<P>
   London, no stranger to bombs, is in the grip of a smoldering
panic. The nail bombs that have raised tensions all over London
have been left in gym bags in crowded areas and have followed a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   First it was Brixton, the symbolic capital of London's black
community. Thirty-nine people were injured in the April 17
explosion, five of them seriously, including a baby who had to have
a 4-inch nail removed from his head.
</P>
<P>
   The second bomb exploded a week ago Saturday on Brick Lane in
the East End, the heart of the Bangladeshi community. Six people
were injured but none seriously because a passerby had found the
bag and had left it in the trunk of his car to find police when it
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, a gay pub in the middle of Soho, the most
tolerant neighborhood in London, was blown up. Two people were
killed, more than 70 wounded, 23 of them seriously. Several had
limbs blown off.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Police, well-trained in counterterrorism after
30 years of dealing with Irish Republican Army bombs, have launched
a massive criminal investigation but have not found the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are focusing on extreme right-wing, Neo-Nazi groups,
some of which have claimed responsibility for the bombs. While
several anonymous callers claiming to represent these groups have
said they carried out the bombings, police say they don't know who
is behind the attacks. However, they say they are certain that a
hatred of minority groups is at the core of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Police have arrested and questioned three men before releasing
them. One man remained under arrest Saturday &UR;  &LR; night for
questioning. But charges related to the bombings were not imminent,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and government officials are worried about panic
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attack on all of us,'' said Paul Condon, chief of
the Metropolitan Police. ``It's a time for calm. It's a time for
vigilance. It's a time for the community to work together to defeat
these cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   With the police unable to say for sure who is behind the
attacks, minority communities are taking matters into their own
hands. Michael Whine, head of the British Board of Jewish Deputies,
said Jewish groups across the city are patrolling their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to inciting fear, the bombings also have tapped
Londoners' traditional defiance. In the wake of the bombings,
thousands of Londoners have donated blood. Many say they refuse to
be threatened off their streets.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Watson, a leader of Stonewall, a gay-rights group, said his
organization spent Saturday appealing to gay men to return to Old
Compton Street, center of the gay bar scene in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be intimidated off our streets,'' said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Bombings are nothing new to Londoners. The Nazis blitzed them in
the 1940s. The IRA killed dozens of people with no-warning bombs in
the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, bombs have been used by animal
rights extremists and even someone with a grudge against a
supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has been about 15 years since the IRA abandoned its
no-warning bombs that indiscriminately killed civilians. And
Londoners always have taken comfort in the fact that the diversity
of their city, home to so many different colors and cultures, would
deter extremists, lest they kill some of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is that very diversity that has become the target,
creating fear and uncertainty in one of the world's biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Because John Murphy's name adorns his North London pub, the bar
is a potential target. The racist groups that have claimed
responsibility for the bombs say that Jews and Irish are on their
hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Murphy followed a young man he didn't know into the
pub's bathroom to make sure he didn't leave anything in the
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing to say, but if someone I don't know
comes in here, I've got to expect the worst,'' said Murphy, shaking
his head. ``If you look where the bombs have been already, you'd
see that the Jews and the Irish are next. It's dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   While whoever is planting the bombs wants to kill and maim
minorities, the attacks inevitably are hitting civilians from all
walks of life. The Brixton market that was bombed is patronized by
as many whites as blacks. Whites far outnumber minorities in the
restaurants around Brick Lane that had their windows blown out last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And although Old Compton Street is popular with gays, not unlike
Bay Village in Boston, area restaurants are frequented by
straights, and its narrow lanes are used by pedestrians on the way
to Chinatown and the theaters in Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gray, 33, had delivered a package on Brewer Street, just
beyond Old Compton Street, and had just walked past the Admiral
Duncan pub before it exploded Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty seconds earlier, and I would have been walking right in
front of the pub,'' he said Saturday, driving his taxi in Highgate,
a North London neighborhood. ``That's what so crazy about this. The
people who are planting the bombs want to kill minorities, but
we're all minorities now. We're all vulnerable now. We're all
targets.''

CLINTON TO MEET WITH RUSSIAN ENVOY ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Hawaii)  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Sunday that President Clinton
planned to meet Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy for the
Balkans, on Monday to discuss possible solutions to the war in
Kosovo. Administration officials said it was unclear whether the
Russian was bringing any new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The visit follows Chernomyrdin's meeting with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Friday, and a series of
diplomatic moves by Milosevic, including the abrupt release of
three American prisoners of war. The moves were apparently aimed at
improving Milosevic's image in the West even as his forces were
expelling tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo's
second-largest town.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to see Chernomyrdin after Russian President Boris
Yeltsin telephoned the president Sunday morning and asked him to
see the envoy, the White House said. Clinton and Yeltsin did not
discuss the substance of what Chernomyrdin wanted to talk about,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, administration officials _ who have watched as
Milosevic tried to seize the diplomatic initiative in the last
three days _ remained resolute in their determination to continue
the bombing of Yugoslavia and to stick with NATO's demands for
ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said. ``Today we
reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they too can return with
security and self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott dismissed as a ``PR
stunt'' a letter from the Yugoslav leader to Clinton, which
contained a suggestion of a meeting between the American and
Yugoslav leaders, according to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who left
Belgrade Sunday with the three freed American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott insisted that NATO was bombing Milosevic's government,
not negotiating with it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium,
that Milosevic could not expect a reward for the release of the
captured soldiers. Indeed, the ferocity of the air war seemed
unabated, as Belgrade and much of Yugoslavia were blacked out after
NATO struck a major power plant on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they did not know what else in the
form of specific proposals was in the letter that Jackson was
bringing from Milosevic. They expected to learn its contents when
Clinton meets with Jackson late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration officials said they considered
Chernomyrdin's visit more important than the aftermath of Jackson's
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic interpretation of Chernomyrdin's visit was
that it showed that Milosevic was beginning to feel the pressure
from the stepped-up NATO air assaults and was putting out feelers
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see if there is anything real or it's all for
show,'' a senior administration official said. ``We want to hear
Chernomyrdin out and hear his sense of the lay of the land. It's a
tough time to say no to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's visit was potentially the first in a series of
diplomatic efforts this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels on
Wednesday, en route to visiting with U.S. troops based in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His NATO visit was planned before Chernomyrdin's trip to
Washington was scheduled. But diplomats said it was possible that
Clinton would discuss the Russian efforts with the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's chief decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow announced that Chernomyrdin would also go to New York to
brief U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. From there, he will go to
London and Paris, Moscow said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's travels suggested that he was assuming the mantle
of ``shuttle diplomat'' on Kosovo, a position the Russians coveted,
a senior administration official said. But there were mixed
opinions among Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers about
Chernomyrdin's taking on this role at this point, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has encouraged the Russians to play an active
role in trying to mediate the Kosovo war, in part because of
concern that the air assaults cannot go on indefinitely without
losing American public support. There is also concern about how
long European members of NATO can remain united in their support of
the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   And, not least, the administration has been keen to hand Russia
a major role as a way of positioning Moscow within the
anti-Milosevic fold and isolating the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Milosevic's moves in the last three days _ the
release of the three American prisoners, an interview in which he
outlined his ideas for a settlement, and a nine-hour discussion
with Chernomyrdin on Friday _ were an effort to show that he can be
reasoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Yugoslav leader has shown no flexibility on
NATO's key demand: an international security force in Kosovo, with
NATO at its core. A strong military force is essential, NATO has
said, to insure the return of more than 600,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees and to protect them once they are home.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with United Press International, Milosevic said
he would agree to a ``United Nations mission'' composed of European
countries that did not belong to NATO, as well as Russia. Members
of this mission could be lightly armed with defensive weapons, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader also suggested that he would start to draw
down his troops in Kosovo if NATO withdrew its forces in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials immediately rejected Milosevic's proposals. Under
his conditions, they said, the refugees would refuse to go back to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, NATO has modified its language on what
would constitute an international security force, shifting from a
force led by NATO to a force with NATO at its core, and finally to
a force that NATO was ``ready'' to lead.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said it was crucial in the talks with
Chernomyrdin not to waver on the issue of the force. If the
alliance showed any lack of firmness on this issue, the official
said, Milosevic would sit back and wait for further weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had been discouraged by the White House from going
to Belgrade to try to secure the release of the prisoners, appeared
to have grasped some initiative from the administration through his
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Journeying with the three released soldiers first to Croatia,
and then to Germany, Jackson said in repeated interviews that the
administration should stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said that Clinton told Jackson in a
telephone call after the release of the soldiers that NATO would
continue with its airstrikes. The spokesman added that Clinton did
thank Jackson for securing the release of the three, and would meet
with him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said that by releasing the
prisoners and sending a letter to Clinton, Milosevic was intent on
putting ``us in a sticky position.'' By making his various offers,
the Yugoslav leader was clearly hoping to split the NATO alliance,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Milosevic's mind, he said, the idea that a U.N. mission in
Kosovo could be lightly armed was probably a concession. In
December, the Yugoslav leader rejected an appeal from the American
head of the international monitoring mission, William Walker, that
the monitors be allowed to carry side arms.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-member bipartisan delegation from Congress, after meeting
in Vienna, Austria, for two days with a group of Russian lawmakers
and a representative of Milosevic, put forth their own ideas for a
peace framework, but NATO said it was not interested. Their
statement called for ``a parallel solution'' involving an end to
NATO's bombing, withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, and a
halt to armed resistance by the Kosovo Liberation Army's
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The American lawmakers were led by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and
Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said efforts like
this were worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, that as Jesse Jackson would say, give peace a chance
here,'' he said on the CNN program ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be some momentum,'' he said. ``There seems to
be an opportunity _ we should seize this moment. As a matter of
fact, you know, I had doubts about the bombing campaign from the
beginning. I didn't think we had done enough in the diplomatic
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said there was ``wiggle room'' in negotiations over the
composition and military power of any international force that
would move into Kosovo to enforce a peace agreement. ``I don't, for
instance, see why the United States has to have troops involved,''
he said.

HESTON REBUTS CRITICS OF RIFLE ASSOCIATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Undaunted by thousands of gun-control activists who
formed a human chain outside, the National Rifle Association held a
brief but defiant annual meeting here Saturday. Leaders defended
gun owners' rights and lashed out at criminals, political
opportunists, the media, and the loss of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual right to bear arms is freedom's insurance
policy, not just for your children, but for infinite generations to
come,'' NRA president and actor Charlton Heston told several
thousand cheering members, praising their ``courage'' to attend.
``We must not let human tragedy lay waste to the most rare and
hard-won human right in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston struck back at criticisms of the NRA that flourished in
the days after the Columbine High School massacre, which took place
just 10 miles away. Wearing a blue-and-silver ribbon on his lapel
to honor the victims, he derisively quoted a statement praising gun
control by Adolf Hitler, whose birth date was chosen by the gunmen
for their April 20 killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty secret of this day and age is political gain and
media ratings all too often bloom on fresh graves,'' Heston said.
``We're often cast as the villain. That is not our role in American
society, and we will not be forced to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston reserved some of his harshest comments for the media. He
called coverage of the killings ``pornography'' and accused
reporters of perching ``like vultures on the balconies of hotels
for a hundred miles around.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the NRA meeting at a downtown hotel, about 4,000
gun-control demonstrators gathered five blocks away on the steps of
the gold-domed Colorado State House. Among them was Thomas Mauser,
whose son Daniel was among the 12 students and one teacher murdered
at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA deserves credit as a promoter of gun safety and
representative of hunters,'' said Mauser, who carried a sign with a
photo of his smiling, towheaded son. ``But it and other gun
organizations deserve our condemnation for their relentless
promotion of gun proliferation and protection of all types of guns,
regardless of their dangerousness.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice cracking, Mauser described how his son was fatally
shot in the face with a TEC-DC9, a 9mm semiautomatic handgun with a
30-bullet clip. He said the only purpose for such a gun was as a
``killing machine,'' and asked: ``Can you relate to that pain, Mr.
Heston?''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the crowd was a statue of a Civil War-era
soldier bearing a rifle. To cheers and whistles, a man climbed the
10-foot pedestal and placed a bright-pink sign in the soldier's
arms reading, ``Let's cradle children, not Uzis.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA convention originally was expected to attract 22,000
members. In the end, all but about 3,000 stayed away when the
organization cut the session from three days to one, and canceled
all planned events except the two-hour business meeting. NRA
officials abandoned the traditional introduction of its oldest and
youngest members, an apparent concession to the recent uproar about
children and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's mayor had asked the group to cancel the convention
altogether to give the community time to heal, but NRA officials
said they were required by law to hold an annual meeting and there
was no reason they should be blamed for the actions of Columbine
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally
safe schools,'' said Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice
president. He said the real problem is failure to prosecute
criminals who gain illegal access to guns, saying there were only
13 prosecutions of the 6,000 students caught with guns at school in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre also criticized proposals that have gained ground in
the past 11 days to impose new restrictions on weapon sales at gun
shows, which now can take place among unlicensed sellers without
background checks or compliance with other gun-control measures.
Investigators have said three of the four weapons used at Columbine
were bought by Klebold's girlfriend at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider instant checks at gun shows when, and only
when, this administration stops demanding new gun taxes and stops
illegally compiling the records of millions of lawful gun buyers,''
LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   While Heston and LaPierre won rousing ovations, both were
upstaged by Colorado Secretary of State Vikki Buckley, who brought
the crowd to its feet by declaring: ``Welcome to Colorado, a state
where some of us believe strongly in the entire Constitution of the
United States, including the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who is black, spoke passionately to a nearly all-white
audience about racism, her own experience as a shooting victim, a
loss of family values, irresponsible sex, and what she called
``new-age hate crimes'' _ a phrase she used in speaking at the
funeral last week of Columbine High senior Isaiah Shoels, the only
black person killed in the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file NRA members defended their right to attend the
meeting. ``Who's running this country? The criminals or the
law-abiding people?'' asked Albert Tierney, a lawyer from Norwell,
Mass., who said he has been an NRA member on and off for more than
50 years. ``The NRA is being treated as a scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, NRA member Connie Truax of Golden, Colo., sold
dozens of blue-and-silver ribbons for $1 each. She said the
proceeds would go to a student relief fund at Columbine.
``Murderers killed these 12 students and one teacher. Blaming the
guns they used is missing the point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, more than 2,000 of the gun-control advocates
marched from the Statehouse to the site of the NRA meeting, forming
a human chain and ringing bells in an otherwise silent protest.
There was a heavy police presence for the peaceful march. No
arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think the NRA's agenda is irresponsible,'' said Ted
Pascoe, executive director of the Colorado Coalition Against Gun
Violence, which organized the protest. ``We hope this has a lasting
effect by sending a message that the NRA is not welcome in our
city, particularly at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun activists in Colorado claimed partial victory after the
Columbine shootings; three bills they opposed that were heading
toward passage _ including one lifting a state ban on concealed
weapons _ were withdrawn, their prospects now in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was young and old, with a heavy dose of high school
students. ``I'm here because I don't like the fact that I don't
feel safe at school,'' said Beth Diebert, 17, a high school senior
from Boulder. ``It's become personal. People my age are the ones
who got killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest drew the attention of members of a tour group from
Holland, where gun violence is a rarity. They stood near the
Statehouse and gaped at the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible for us to think that the gun lobby here is so
strong,'' said Lenie Ruigrok of Utrecht, Holland. ``We can't
imagine the need for so many people to protest this.''

SEVERAL HOPEFULS SPEND WEEKEND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John Kasich went fly-fishing in Franklin.
Lamar Alexander knocked on doors in Bedford, delivering videotapes
of himself. And Bob Smith hopped from Hollis to Newmarket and
Portsmouth to Derry in a quest to speak to as many voters as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   It was all in a day's campaigning Saturday as Republican
candidates for president began massing here for Sunday night's
party kickoff dinner, a chance to persuade political activists to
sign on to their teams.
</P>
<P>
   There is a notable absence this weekend. But that candidate,
Texas Governor George W. Bush, has already made headway picking up
volunteers and commitments, even though he has not yet visited the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, for example, many Republicans decided to skip the
recent party fund-raising dinner featuring John McCain because they
already had decided on a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of old-line Republicans didn't want to come because they
had made up their mind that they were going to be Bush people if
and when he decided to come to the state,'' said Bill Conner,
chairman of the Lebanon Republican Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon MacDonald, Dan Quayle's New Hampshire adviser, said it is
not uncommon in the quest for support to find people who already
have chosen the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to people who are looking at Bush, or who have
decided to go to Bush,'' he said, adding that Quayle also is
competing for support among the more conservative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still people who are out there and undecided,''
MacDonald said. ``You often hear, `You're one of three people or
you're one of four people.' You sort of take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's first primary here is still about 10 months away,
but the battle for activists who will volunteer their time on a
campaign is already especially intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be frustrating for candidates and their supporters to
be watching this when (Bush) hasn't done anything,'' said David M.
Carney, a veteran Republican strategist who is unaligned in the
2000 race. ``I can see the frustration. But New Hampshire has taken
front-runners and shredded them before, and they'll do it again if
Bush doesn't deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   That is something that McCain, the Arizona senator, knows
first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate Governor Bush in doing a good job in New
Hampshire and other states,'' said McCain, who is not attending
 &UR; tonight &LR; 's dinner because it is his son's 13th birthday. ``It
doesn't bother us very much. I can recall previous campaigns where
the person who had the most endorsements didn't win the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McCain watched voters here humiliate Bob Dole with a
second-place finish behind Patrick J. Buchanan, even though Dole
had received more endorsements and public commitments of support
than any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, is eyeing Bush's surge
with some skepticism. The compressed primary schedule, he said,
will make it more dangerous for front-runners who stumble and will
boost insurgent candidates who do well in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Governor Bush credit,'' he said. ``He's winning the
preseason with money and endorsements, and he's creating great
expectations for himself. I hope to do well in the regular
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, the Ohio congressman, said he believes there is no
substitute for frequent visits to the state. He acknowledges that
he has no qualms about begging for support. So far, he has been to
12 coffee gatherings, 10 Republican Party events, and five Main
Street walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if you don't have anything to say or they don't
like you, frequency can't make up for it,'' Kasich said.

MILOSEVIC SENDS JACKSON BACK TO US WITH AN OLIVE BRANCH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his stunning decision Saturday to free three
captive American soldiers, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
raised the stakes in the diplomatic struggle for peace in the
Balkans amid signs of wavering public support in the United States
for the NATO siege of Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in freeing the prisoners even as his troops control
the Kosovo province they have purged of many ethnic Albanian
civilians, was seen by foreign policy specialists as seizing an
opportunity to shake President Clinton's resolve and to step up his
urgent quest for an end to the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise move, Milosevic sends the Rev. Jesse Jackson
back to Washington with an olive branch and a message that, Jackson
said, ``cannot be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step of peace and reconciliation,'' Jackson
told reporters in Belgrade. ``We should miss no opportunity to
choose peace with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, who suffered a public relations setback last week
when the House refused to endorse his Kosovo policy, the
development presents another obstacle to building support for
pushing ahead with the massive US military role in the NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown growing public concern about Clinton's
handling of the crisis. And the House's refusal to officially back
the US role in the NATO campaign reflected increasing wariness in
Congress about the direction the conflict is taking. The House
debate even raised ghosts of Vietnam-era rhetoric, as several
lawmakers urged the administration to ``give peace a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's move was seen in part as an attempt to exploit the
antiwar feeling that emerged in the House. ``It's interesting that
this release comes shortly after that vote,'' said Lee Hamilton,
former chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Milosevic, the time for peace seems ripe, analysts said. He
has fulfilled his goal of controlling most of Kosovo. But the
economic capacity of his Serbian republic is being decimated by
escalating NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to get any better than this for him,'' said
Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former special assistant to President
Bush for national security affairs. ``It makes sense that he is
thinking about what he can do to get the bombing to stop so he
might hold on to his presidency and at least claim victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass said Milosevic's move reflects his increasing diplomatic
attempts to extricate himself from the NATO siege. Milosevic
decided to free the prisoners the day after the United States and
NATO rejected his six-point plan for a war settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been in regular contact with Russia's envoy to the
Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who is trying to mediate a
resolution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Milosevic is throwing out ideas and pushing buttons
that may weaken American resolve or NATO resolve or both,'' Haass
said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, Milosevic is expected to give Jackson a
new settlement plan to deliver personally to Clinton. Jackson said
the letter will include an offer by Milosevic to meet face-to-face
with Clinton ``and to take this matter to resolution through
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was golfing Saturday with his friend Vernon E.
Jordan Jr. when Milosevic's decision was announced, is expected to
have little appetite for appearing publicly with the Yugoslav
president.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO also were poised to rebuff Jackson's
plea to suspend the airstrikes to give Yugoslavia ``a night of
peace from bombs'' before the expected release of the prisoners
Sunday. The appeal came shortly after Clinton announced plans to
tighten US economic sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Milosevic's image could be bolstered in NATO
countries by photographs of him praying with Jackson and a
delegation of US religious leaders shortly before he decided to
release the prisoners. In a stark juxtaposition, Milosevic, who
faces possible war-crime charges for presiding over a campaign of
killing, rape, and gunpoint expulsion that has driven 1.4 million
ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo and created refugee
crises throughout the Balkans, is shown praying for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's public approval ratings are expected to soar, just
weeks after he announced he would not seek the Democratic
nomination for president. He also has given Clinton little choice
other than to praise him for his diplomatic coup, even though
Jackson's triumph has complicated Clinton's challenge in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's success came despite the White House's refusal to
sanction his mission, which the administration warned could be
exploited by Milosevic for propaganda purposes. Yet if Milosevic
makes good on his pledge to free the soldiers, the Clinton
administration would be left to criticize Jackson's efforts at its
own political peril.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is spelled out in the code of ethics of the Association for
Computing Machinery, one of the world's oldest and largest computer
professional societies: ``An essential aim of computer
professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computer
systems, including threats to health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer professionals, the code continues, should warn their
bosses about any such threats and even blow the whistle if their
superiors ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't all those computer professionals do the ethical
thing and prevent or blow the whistle on the year 2000 computer
problem _ a glitch that some experts warn could cause such threats
to health and safety as malfunctioning medical equipment and
wayward airplanes when when the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Just how much programmers and their managers should be faulted
for this problem _ which was decades in the making _ is but one
question being raised about a profession that labors in obscurity,
but plays an increasingly vital role in society.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the year 2000 problem could lead to changes in
the way programs are written, just as earthquakes can lead to
stricter building codes. ``Y2K,'' as the problem is known, has
given new life to a debate about whether programmers should be
required to obtain professional certification, similar to that
required of doctors, lawyers and certain engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want an unlicensed engineer working on a bridge, but
you have unlicensed computer programmers working all the time,''
said Dr. Marsha C. Woodbury, chairwoman of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, an 1,800-member group that deals with
social consequences of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change could evaporate depending on the extent of
computing problems that occur after the stroke of midnight on Dec.
31. That is when millions of computers could fail to recognize that
the two-digit year date ``00'' means 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, well before New Year's, many computing professionals
see the close of an era. ``This is the end of 50 years of
infatuation and unconstrained trust in what information
technologists can deliver,'' said Paul A. Strassmann, a former
chief information officer for the Department of Defense and the
Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Strassmann notes, the government has stepped in, as with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's requirement, which took effect
last fall, that companies file detailed reports on the costs,
timetable and other implications of their Y2K repair efforts. That
was the first such detailed reporting required by the government
for data processing operations. It is one reason that Strassmann
formed the Software Testing Assurance Corp., aimed at verifying
companies' Y2K cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even without government pressure, big companies are finding that
the demands of cataloging all their software and repairing and
testing it for Y2K problems has forced them to improve their own
data processing procedures. This could be the silver lining of the
Y2K cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it helped us all grow up a little,'' said William
D. Friel, chief information officer at the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America. Prudential now keeps better track of what programs it
owns, has eliminated unnecessary programs and has bolstered
procedures for testing software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its high-technology image, developing software remains
more art than science, and a fairly unpredictable art at that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 percent of big corporate software development
projects were either late or over budget, and 28 percent failed
completely, according to a survey of 7,500 projects by the Standish
Group of research advisers in Dennis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Though the practitioners may speak of themselves as
professionals, computing does not have educational requirements and
licensing that many other professions do. ``Many have called
themselves software engineers,'' said John R. Speed, executive
director of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers. ``Wrong.
They're the local music dropout who chooses to use that title.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas last year became the first state to offer certification
for professional software engineers, although it is not required.
Candidates must have accredited degrees and at least 12 years'
experience or unaccredited degrees and at least 16 years'
experience. A certification test is also being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Like other states, Texas has long required that anyone who
designs a project that is for the public sector or that affects
public safety must be licensed as a professional engineer. Such
requirements were put in place after 1937, when an explosion at an
elementary school in New London, Texas, killed more than 300
children. The cause was a faulty regulator on a gas steam heater.
Nowadays, Speed said, the function performed by that mechanical
device would be handled by software.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the idea of licensing or certifying computer
programmers has long been discussed but never put in place, mainly
because programmers are in huge demand and many of the best do not
have formal training or education.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some experts say it is not clear that
certification would have prevented the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem had its genesis in the 1950s and 1960s, when using
two digits instead of four to represent the year in programming
could save expensive computer memory. It was assumed that the
programs would all be replaced by the year 2000. If anything, some
computer professionals say, the millennium bug is a testament to
how well programmers did their jobs, not how poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software was so adaptable it lasted all these years, so we
didn't have to retire it,'' said Tom DeMarco, a programmer, author
and consultant in Maine. ``Our undoing was we did it so much better
than we thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Few programmers feel pangs of conscience about Y2K in the way
that some nuclear physicists rue having brought the world the bomb.
A few programmers who say they did sound the alarm contend that
they were ignored by corporate management. Younger programmers see
the problem as one caused by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gotterbarn, director at the Software Engineering Ethics
Institute at East Tennessee State University, said Y2K resulted
from ``lack of foresight and bad guesses,'' not from ethical
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Where he sees mere mistakes, though, other experts say the
problem was a design flaw that could, and should, have been
prevented _ especially since the two-digit practice continued into
the 1990s, long after computer memory had become cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we see it for what it is _ we've made a giant
quality mistake here,'' said Leon A. Kappelman, an associate
professor of business computer information systems at the
University of North Texas and co-chairman of the Society for
Information Management's Year 2000 working group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem our code of ethics would tell us we shouldn't
have done that,'' Kappelman added, ``and once we did it we should
have been more proactive.'' But the code of ethics of the
Association for Computing Machinery, which has 80,000 members in
more than 100 countries, has no force behind it. Most programmers
are not even aware it exists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Woodbury of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
put it: ``Although computer science departments are supposed to
teach ethics along with programming, it's extremely unpopular.
People like me find ourselves isolated and even laughed at.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change. The Association for Computing Machinery, in
league with the 100,000-member Computer Society of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers, adopted a new software
engineering ethics code late last year. The code calls for
programmers to act in the public interest and to ``promote an
ethical approach to the practice of the profession,'' among other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is responsible for the Year 2000 glitch could become a
legal as well as an ethical question if, as expected, computer
problems lead to widespread lawsuits. A wide swath of corporate
America, including the computer industry, is backing legislation in
Congress that would limit lawsuits and liability for Y2K. Last week
the Senate at least temporarily shelved the bill, which had become
entangled by a number of other, partisan disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's get-out-of-jail-free cards,'' Kappelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Within corporations, the year 2000 problem has placed new
scrutiny on chief information officers. Some have been criticized
for not preventing the costly problem. But top management's greater
attention to computer operations can only be good in the long run,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was just something that happened behind closed
doors and now those doors are opened more,'' said Lauris Nance,
chief information officer of the Public Service Co. of North
Carolina, a gas utility. ``There's a general better appreciation of
the technical staff.'' Ms. Nance herself has received several
promotions for seizing upon the Y2K problem early.
</P>
<P>
   Strassmann, the former Pentagon technology official, predicts
that corporate chief information officers may one day be given
fiduciary responsibility that makes them legally accountable for
computing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Increased pressure on the information chiefs is leading to
change within corporate computing departments. When first
confronted a few years ago with the need to check and fix all their
programs, many computer departments were not even sure what and how
many programs their machines were running. Even when they were
identified, many programs lacked documentation _ the textual
commentaries that are supposed to let a subsequent programmer
follow what the author of the software was trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you had a lot of people fight you about documentation
and stuff,'' Ms. Nance said. Now, she said, programmers meet more
often as teams, and the company uses outside auditors to help
assess the risk of new technology projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes the year 2000 problem has meant for companies
that use and maintain software, it has placed new performance
pressures on companies that create software. A question in some
pending lawsuits is whether vendors are responsible for fixing
software they sold that is not ready for the year 2000. The need
for lawyers to bone up on software issues has effectively created a
new bar that will be in position to handle software liability
suits, even those unrelated to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future contracts are going to have much tighter provisions
about vendor responsibility for unforeseen events,'' said Jim
Jones, manager of the Y2K program at the Information Management
Forum, an organization of information technology executives from
large companies and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for many programmers, long stereotyped as antisocial
nerds, the ethics debate has thrust them into an
uncharacteristically visible role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to be the heroes or the goats of
1999,'' Allan E. Alter, a columnist, wrote in Computerworld, a
newspaper for information technology professionals. But ``we must
accept our inevitable public role. What the world wants from us is
level-headed, trustworthy guidance in a scary time.''

HOW KRAFT MADE DECISION TO KEEP PATRIOTS IN MASSACHUSETTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beginning of the end of Robert Kraft's partnership with
Connecticut can be traced to last Thursday morning, when a team of
consultants to his New England Patriots assembled in a conference
room on the 34th floor of the Kraft Group headquarters in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of sifting through all the data, the experts hired
by the Patriots were ready to give Kraft and his son Jonathan a
bleak assessment: Connecticut was unlikely to have a stadium, to be
built for the Patriots on a polluted site, ready by the 2002
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts and team vice president Andy Wasynczuk had known for
months that Connecticut was struggling with the site. But the
consultants left little doubt that Connecticut would miss the 2002
timetable specific in its contract with the team. And the Krafts
faced a deadline set for Sunday under which they could pull out of
the deal without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a firm decision right then, according to people
familiar with the meeting and on whose accounts this article is
based. Just a growing sense of the inevitable. But there was one
last chance the deal might be saved. Coincidentally, the Krafts
were scheduled to meet with Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland
that afternoon. Perhaps if he agreed to extend the penalty-free
exit clause in the contract for another 30 to 60 days, the team
could then see if more encouraging news was available from state
officials feverishly working to prepare the site.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Krafts heard their consultants' discouraging
report, the team's Connecticut lobbyist, Jay Malcynski arrived at
the One Boston Place office. A close personal and professional
friend of Rowland, Malcynski has enormous clout and access in the
Connecticut capital. He was hired to help the Patriots get their
new home in Hartford built as planned. Now, more than ever, that
plan was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with the governor had originally been set for the
week before, but Rowland had asked to reschedule it for Thursday
afternoon. For the next hour or so, the Krafts discussed the
consultants' critical assessment with Malcynski and explored
whether Rowland might be willing to extend the penalty-free
deadline. ``It was a chance for the team to show good faith by
giving Connecticut more time to wipe away the doubts,'' said one
person close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts made it clear they were discouraged by the
consultants' analysis. But Malcynski didn't beliee Rowland would
agree to an extension, especially since Massachusetts was
fast-tracking a counteroffer to keep the Patriots. The Krafts were
told Rowland feared that giving the team more time would simply
encourage the Bay State to up its ante. At the very least, it would
give Massachusetts lawmakers and the National Football League more
time to kill Connecticut's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch of takeout burritos, the Patriots and their
lobbyist continued to talk about the team's options. Malcynski
pressed the Krafts not to back out of the deal, even if the stadium
opening slipped to 2003. The Krafts made it clear they were not
willing to add yet another year to the deadline, especially since
their original agreement with Connecticut had promised a 2001
completion date.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts, sensing they would not be able to negotiate with
Rowland, wondered aloud whether there was any point in flying to
Hartford for the meeting with the governor. In the end, they
decided it would be more respectful to keep the appointment and
discuss their reservations face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   The two Krafts, Wasnyczuk, and Malcynski drove to Logan Airport
after lunch, intending to fly to Hartford for a 4 p.m. meeting with
the governor. But upon arriving at the terminal, they discovered
the small plane they had chartered was not available. It took
several hours to find one, during which time the men cooled their
heels at a private airport lounge. Rowland was not happy about the
delay and offered to meet the Kraft contingent halfway. Instead,
the two sides agreed to postpone the meeting until after 8 p.m. so
Rowland could attend his daughter's violin concert before returning
to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts had been assured their meeting with Rowland would be
private, but after a call from the Patriots' spokesman, they
discovered the news media had been alerted to the meeting. When
they arrived at the State House around 6 that evening, the Krafts
were greeted by a crush of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay at the airport had given the press time to swarm the
Capitol, and after hours of waiting they were hungry,'' said one
source at the scene. Feeling ambushed, the Krafts entered the
governor's office without addressing reporters and waited for
Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The Kraft party was seated in a relatively dark room just off
the governor's office known as ``the cave.'' As they waited, they
watched sports on TV and ate pepperoni pizzas supplied by the
governor's office. The governor arrived sometime after 7 and the
meeting between Kraft and Rowland began.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft outlined his concerns about the state's ability to finish
the stadium by 2002. Connecticut officials, including some
overseeing the project, continued to insist they could meet the
deadline. Kraft then offered to wait a month before deciding, if
the state would extend Sunday's penalty-free exit date for one
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland refused.
</P>
<P>
   The governor pressed Kraft to explain why he would even consider
walking away from such a lucrative deal _ estimated to be worth up
to $1 billion over 30 years _ over a one-year delay.
</P>
<P>
   People close to both sides tell basically the same story up
until this point. Now, their accounts diverge. The Patriots say
they detailed their concerns and made clear they were not willing
to accept a 2003 season opening for the stadium. Patriots sources
say Kraft's message was unambiguous: The pact was in peril.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut officials say Kraft held out hope that the 2002
deadline could still be met, and was willing to keep the deal
alive. At one point, a clearly frustrated Rowland told the Krafts
it was time to ``fish or cut bait,'' people from both sides
confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kraft then told Connecticut officials he would get them an
answer within 24 hours, Rowland's side says. They were confident
that the team would stick with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 98 percent sure the Patriots were going to go
forward,'' said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani. ``They had presented
no rational arguments for pulling out.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended. Each side drafted press statements, but
Rowland objected to Kraft's wording, calling it a ``death watch.''
Connecticut officials edited the remarks, and Rowland and Kraft
went to face reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is not an option,'' Rowland told reporters at 11:25,
saying he and the team would spend the next five weeks trying to
win NFL approval of the move. Kraft was noncommital, saying only
that his ``goal'' remained to play in Hartford in 2002. The two men
took no questions and shook hands briefly before exiting from
different doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts flew back to Boston, arriving after midnight. Father
and son spoke only briefly in front of their parked cars. They knew
that with no extra time from Connecticut to further study the site,
the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was already Friday morning. By that afternoon the deal would
be dead.

PATRIOTS OWNER SPURNS HARTFORD STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft walked away
from the richest stadium deal ever in professional sports Friday, a
joyous victory for Massachusetts sports fans but a devastating blow
to Hartford's revitalization dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Governor John G. Rowland, Kraft explained that
the team did not believe Connecticut could finish the proposed $374
million by 2002 as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have not seen sufficient evidence to give us
adequate assurance that the planned Hartford stadium can be ready
for the beginning of 2002 season on the terms we contemplated in
our agreement,'' Kraft said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut had struggled to determine how much money and how
much time it would take to prepare the heavily polluted site for
construction. Under his deal with Connecticut, Kraft was free to
back out without penalty by Sunday if he concluded the stadium
could not be completed on time or within budget.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's consultants told him Thursday that it would likely be
2003 at the earliest before the Patriots could play in the new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who less than 24 hours earlier stood alongside Kraft
and expressed confidence the Hartford deal would go through,
denounced the Patriots' pullout and threatened to sue the Kraft
family and the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one walks away from a $374 million plan because a schedule
not might hit the exact date he would like to see it happen,'' he
said. ``We'll find out soon enough what the real reason was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the fear of litigation prevent us from doing our
job,'' said Joseph Brown, an NFL vice president. `'In this case, we
went to Massachusetts to see if a viable alternative existed and to
help make one a reality. It was Mr. Kraft's decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The league said it expected to take up the alternative stadium
offer cobbled together earlier this week by Massachusetts when team
owners meet in Atlanta in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's brief statement, which repeatedly praised Connecticut's
efforts over the past year, did not mention the Bay State's rival
bid. But most in Massachusetts thought the message was clear: the
Patriots would stay in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Patriots will be playing football in
Massachusetts, where they belong,'' said Governor Paul Cellucci
from California, where he was promoting Massachusetts to the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like winning a game in overtime,'' declared Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham. ``It's a win for Patriots fans, the
state, and taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who many argued drove the
Patriots into Connecticut's arms by blocking a bid last year to use
state funds to help the team build a new facility in Foxborough,
praised Kraft's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Kraft deserves an awful lot of credit for the
decision he made,'' Finneran said. ``Mr. Kraft is the first to
break a very discouraging _ and what I have said is an
inappropriate _ trend, and that deserves commendation.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Bay State leaders said there would be no problem
passing a bill to keep the team in Massachusetts before NFL owners
meet May 25. Birmingham said he expected the Senate to pass the
measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the agreement Birmingham, Cellucci, and Finneran
negotiated late Tuesday night, the state would provide $70 million
in funds for roads, sewers and other public improvements around a
new Foxboro Stadium. In return, Kraft would build a privately
financed $250 million stadium, with assistance from the NFL. The
Massachusetts plan would also require him to pay up to $1 million a
year to the state to offset the infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Connecticut offered not only a taxpayer-funded
stadium, but also a host of benefits, including a promise that the
state would pick up the tab for any unsold luxury or club seats
over the next 30 years. Sports financing experts have said the
guarantees alone would have been worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply unprecedented,'' said Marc Ganis, head of
Sportscorp, a Chicago consulting firm specializing in stadium
development firm. ``That's bankable money the team could count on
for the next 30 years. The idea of walking away from that without
having a another deal firmly in hand is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Local business and political leaders said they were confident
Kraft wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts, but many were
stunned that he chose to terminate his deal in Connecticut before
lawmakers formally adopted a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a sign that he is committed to his home state in
a way few of us could imagine,'' said former Democratic National
Committee chairman Paul Kirk to whom the NFL turned to orchestrate
a last-minute campaign to keep the team in Foxborough. ``He's put a
lot of trust in the state's political leaders and the business
community living up to their verbal commitments. And I expect all
the parties will.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL tapped Kirk because it wanted to stop the Patriots from
abandoning the nation's sixth-largest media market for Hartford,
ranked 27th. National broadcast revenues, which are split among all
owners, are the lifeblood of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said it would not comment on Rowland's threat of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft launched his search for a new stadium because Foxboro
ranks last in the league in the number of premium seats, an
important revenue for team owners. Foxboro Stadium has 39 luxury
suites and no club seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a new stadium on land Kraft already owns in
Foxborough is likely to sport 100 to 125 luxury suites and 6,000 to
8,000 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community's commitment to long-term sales of
luxury boxes is key,'' the source said. ``The Patriots cannot
afford to pay for their own stadium and keep a competitive team on
the field without luxury box sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that if Kraft accepts the Massachusetts deal, a new
Foxboro Stadium could be built by 2002, perhaps even 2001, because
the site does not suffer from the pollution woes of the property
offered by Rowland along the Connecticut River. Hartford's proposal
was also hampered by delays in arranging the relocation of a steam
plant and its corporate headquarters from the site.
</P>
<P>
   The aborted stadium was slated to be the centerpiece of
Adriaen's Landing, a billion-dollar redevelopment project that
Rowland and Hartford civic leaders hoped would revitalize the
ailing city. Those project, unveiled in May 1998, included a domed
stadium with at least 35,000 seats for UConn, but were greatly
modified when the Patriots agreed to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the project would continue. ``The original
Adriaen's Landing project was very sufficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft had agreed to invest $75 million in the project, building
a hotel, NFL entertainment complex, and fitness center. But a
carefully crafted contract, negotiated with the aid of his son
Jonathan, gave him the right to pull out by Sunday if he was
uncertain the stadium would be ready by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it slipped to 2003, who could tell if would slip to 2004,''
said one person familiar with contract. ``There was too much
risk.''

A HARD DAY'S NIGHT WELL WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The game started in April but didn't end
until May. Ray Bourque skated for 53 1/2 minutes, including a short
stint in goal. The Bruins won after midnight, in double overtime,
as the Greensboro Coliseum PA piped, ``Let's Spend the Night
Together.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it feels like the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, they say a playoff series hasn't really begun until
the road team wins a game. In Boston, we know the playoffs haven't
officially started until Harry Sinden blows a gasket complaining
about the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins filed a protest Saturday in an attempt to get
Carolina winger Gary Roberts suspended before Game 6 (Sunday) of
this suddenly spicy first-round playoff series. Roberts
cross-checked Boston center Tim Taylor into the boards in the first
minute of the third period of Boston's 4-3 sudden-death victory
Friday/Saturday. Taylor suffered a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be suspended,'' Sinden said of Roberts. ``It's a
cross-check from behind into the boards. The last thing we want in
our league is that check. There's no defense for it. The player who
is hit is most vulnerable and we can't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins may not get satisfaction from the league office, but
Boston fans are sure to send a message to the Hurricanes at the
Vault.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns, making light of the bogus black curtain
that hides 10,000 Greensboro seats and allows the Hurricanes to
claim phony sellouts, said, ``We have the same curtain at home.
We're going to pull it up and there'll be another 10,000 fans
there. You think it's loud here? You haven't heard nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greensboro, watching hockey is something you do between those
satisfying cigarette breaks between periods. Carolina fans practice
their ``Boston sucks'' while sucking on every kind of Winston and
Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes the Boston fandom will return the favor Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bring it back to Boston,'' said the coach. ``There'll be
a lot of noise and a lot of fun. Both teams have proven they want
it. Nothing means nothing now. Once the puck hits the ice Sunday,
it'll be a battle. Somebody's going to come out of this playoff
series awfully sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the survivor of this first-rounder might not have much
left for Round 2. The Friday night/Saturday morning special was
grueling, even for the heroic Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for everybody,'' said the exhausted captain.
``Especially a 38-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so tired he didn't see Anson Carter's winning goal in the
15th minute of the second overtime just after midnight. Bourque was
on the bench, catching his breath with his head down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt relief,'' he said. ``I didn't want to go out for
another shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the room, the veteran blue liner added, ``It's a
huge game. This is the first time these guys have won a
double-overtime game. It's important for the younger guys in the
room. They're learning how to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns provided some spark of his own after the Bruins fell
behind, 2-0. He told his team they might as well warm up the
airplane and get out of town if they kept playing so passively. The
Bruins responded by potting three of their first six shots in the
third (better than Antoine Walker at the line most nights), scoring
three goals in 1:52. Boston has outscored Carolina by an aggregate
9-3 in the third periods.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had plenty of opportunities in overtime, none better
than Martin Gelinas's botched attempt from in front of the crease.
Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe had been taken out of the play and it was
left to Bourque to stand in front of the net while Gelinas fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He double-hit it,'' said Bourque. ``He just missed it. I've
done that on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gelinas will probably have a hard time sleeping tonight,''
added Burns. ``He certainly missed that one, but that's what
overtime's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Overtime was long and the players and fans were tired. Scores of
Carolina fans carried sleeping children out of the arena before
Carter banged home the winner.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Bruins have a chance to end one of our city's
longest droughts. No Boston team has won a playoff series since the
Brian Sutter Bruins topped Montreal in seven games in the spring of
1994.

COMMENTARY:   THE PRICE OF DISTRUST 
 (RK)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: In 4th graf from bottom, Arbatovnik refers to Russian liberal
politician Alexei Arbatov)  By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is not only ambivalent about buying into
``Clinton's War,'' it is also of two minds about being ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the war to make Kosovo safe for Kosovars is a
war without an entrance strategy. By its unwillingness to enter
Serbian territory to stop the killing at the start, NATO conceded
defeat. The bombing is simply intended to coerce the Serbian leader
to give up at the negotiating table all he has won on the killing
field. He won't.
</P>
<P>
   He will make a deal. By urging that Russia be the broker,
Clinton knows he can do no better than compromise with criminality.
That means we are not fighting to win but are merely punishing to
settle.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that no majority has formed in Congress to adopt
the McCain-Biden resolution giving the president authority to use
``all necessary force'' to achieve a clear victory. Few want to go
out on a limb for Clinton knowing that he is preparing to saw that
limb off behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has so few followers in Congress because he is himself
the world's leading follower. He steers not by the compass but by
the telltale, driven by polls that dictate both how far he can go
and how little he can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   The real debate, then, is not intervention vs. isolation, not
sanctity of borders vs. self-determination of nations, not Munich
vs. Vietnam, not NATO credibility vs. America the globocop. The
central question is: Do we trust this president to use all force
necessary to establish the principle that no nation can drive out
an unwanted people?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. The distrust is palpable. Give him the tools
and he will not finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that such distrust is well founded is in the erosion of
NATO's key goal: muscular protection of refugees trusting enough to
return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At first, that was to be done by ``a NATO force,'' rather than
U.N. peacekeepers. The fallback was to ``a NATO-led force,''
including Russians. Now the formulation is ``ready to lead,'' if
anybody asks, or ``a force with NATO at its core,'' which means
Serb-favoring Russians, Ukrainians and Argentinians, with
Hungarians and Czechs to give the illusion of ``a NATO core.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were an ethnic-Albanian woman whose husband had been
massacred, sister raped, children scattered and house burned down
on orders from Belgrade _ would you go back home under such
featherweight protection?
</P>
<P>
   Only a fool would trust an observer group so rotten to its
``core.'' And yet that is the concession NATO has made even before
formal negotiations begin.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect next? After a few more weeks of feckless
bombing while Milosevic completes his dirty work in Kosovo, Victor
Chernomyrdin or Jimmy Carter or somebody will intercede to arrange
a cease-fire. Film will be shot of Serb tanks (only 30 were hit in
a month of really smart bombing) rolling back from Kosovo as
bombardment halts and the embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Rogov, the Moscow Arbatovnik, laid out the Russian deal
in Sunday's Washington Post: (1) autonomy for Kosovo but no
independence or partition; (2) Milosevic troops out but Serb
``border guards'' to remain in Kosovo, (3) and peace ``enforcers''
under not NATO but U.N. and Helsinki Pact bureaucrats. As a grand
concession, NATO would be allowed to care for refugees in Albania
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be a triumph for mass murderers
everywhere, and Clinton will insist on face-savers: war-crimes
trials for sergeants and below, a Brit and a Frenchman in command
of a NATO platoon of Pomeranian grenadiers, no wearing of blue
helmets and absolutely no reparations to Serbia to rebuild bridges
in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Britain's Tony Blair will prod Clinton to do better, and
all Serb troops and paramilitary thugs will be invited out of
Kosovo. But the returning KLA will find mass graves and will likely
lash out at Serbs; after an indecent interval Belgrade will assert
sovereignty with troops in police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen to the principle of no reward for internal
aggression? It will be left for resolution to our next president,
who, in another test, will have the strength of the people's trust.

AN ACE BANDAGE FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-A'S-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ He is the first pitcher in the major leagues
to win five games this spring. He struck out 13 batters in seven
innings Saturday, matching his most dominant outing in a Red Sox
uniform, even though his fastball was the only pitch he trusted.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, he will end _ by Mother's Day _ any debate on who
should start the All-Star Game in Fenway Park in July.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite a 7-2 win over the Oakland A's that elevated a
team that couldn't have looked more bedraggled than it had one
night before, Pedro Martinez finds himself under siege. Again.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was one of 125 pitches he threw _ the fastball he
planted between the numbers on Olmedo Saenz's back in the seventh
inning _ to resurrect accusations that the Dominican is as
diabolical as he is dandy. That he throws his 95-mile-an-hour
fastball not only past people, but at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with what he did,'' A's manager Art Howe said
after the game. ``He has a history of that. What's going to happen
is he's going to get somebody hurt over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was them, I'd start policing him a little better. He's
too good a pitcher for that BS.''
</P>
<P>
   Saenz is a Panamanian version of Brian Daubach, a career minor
leaguer who hit plenty of homers in the bushes but is just now
getting his first taste of the big leagues. On Friday night, he
pinch hit against Sox reliever Jim Corsi and was hit by a pitch
with the bases loaded, a pitch that Corsi said Saenz made no
attempt to elude.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz remained in the game, then hit a three-run home run off
another Sox reliever, Derek Lowe, to break a 9-9 tie in a 13-9 win.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Saenz pinch hit again with the Sox ahead, 5-1, with
one out and nobody on in the seventh. One pitch later, he was
wincing in pain as he walked down to first base. He believes, as
did Howe, that Martinez had committed a deliberate act of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his (expletive) approach,'' said Saenz, still
steaming afterward. ``To hit me right on my (expletive) back. I
didn't do anything to show anybody up. I was just doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, A's reliever Buddy Groom threw a pitch over the
head of Nomar Garciaparra, which elicited no response from either
Garciaparra or plate umpire Joe Brinkman. But when Tim Worrell, the
A's fourth pitcher, threw a ball at Jose Offerman's belt buckle in
the ninth _ Offerman stepped back from harm's way _ Scott issued a
cease-and-desist warning to Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Martinez not only professed his innocence in the
strongest possible terms, he also pleaded ignorance of the events
of the night before. Martinez said he left the game early to return
to the hotel for a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was (Saenz) the one who hit the home run?'' Martinez said,
looking unblinkingly at his questioners. ``I wasn't watching the
game. I don't know him. I have no idea who he is. I don't think I
ever faced him. I had no reason to hit him. Just because my team
gave it up (a home run), that's no reason to hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you get fresh with me, or if you show me up, I'll drill
your ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, who has trumped last week's 0-for-22 slump with an
11-for-22 outburst, had three hits on a day the Sox had 15 _ a
season high. John Valentin also registered three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's 13 strikeouts matched his previous high with the Sox
and fell one short of his career best.
</P>
<P>
   He limited the A's to just five hits and a run, which came after
the Sox had taken a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary opened the scoring with his seventh home run of the
season to start the second, and the Sox made A's starter Gil
Heredia disappear in a flurry of base hits in a four-run fourth
that featured four doubles and two singles, all hit with authority.
Even the outs that inning were loud. A's centerfielder Jason
McDonald took a home run away from Jason Varitek with a leaping
catch at the wall, and he also overtook O'Leary's drive over his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been swinging the bats better,'' said Varitek, who had
two hits. ``We just haven't pitched well and hit well at the same
time. Those days are going to come.''

 &HT;    Jarrett takes fifth the hard way
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Dale Jarrett has been NASCAR's most consistent
driver for nearly two months, with top-five finishes in the last
seven races.
</P>
<P>
   None was as tough as his fifth-place outing in Sunday's
California 500 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where to start with what happened,'' Jarrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who started second behind race winner Jeff Gordon, led
the first lap and was running fifth 60 laps into the 250-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   Then things took a turn for the worse. Jarrett's pit crew took
19.4 seconds on his first green-flag pit stop on lap 77, nearly
three seconds longer than Mark Martin's 16.2-second stop.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the least of Jarrett's problems. He made
his third pit stop on lap 126 and got caught a lap down to Martin
when Ricky Rudd crashed in turn 4. After another caution on lap
140, Jarrett tried to pit, but pit road wasn't open yet because of
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   On lap 153, one of Jarrett's tires blew up. Fortunately, the
mishap left debris on the track, so he wasn't forced to make an
unscheduled stop after nearly pulling onto pit road. Still, he was
running 12th five laps later.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Jarrett rebounded to finish fifth. As a result, points
leader Jeff Burton widened his lead over Jarrett by just 15 points,
for a lead of 55 after 10 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 20 laps to go, I would have never figured we could
finish in the top five,'' Jarrett said. ``I was hoping we could
finish in the top 15 and not lose too many points. With everything
that happened to us, we could have lost a lot of points.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of gas
</P>
<P>
   How do you go from winning a race to running out of gas? Ask
Dale Earnhardt. That's what happened on lap 86 after Earnhardt
didn't pit with the lead-lap cars six or seven laps earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's crew apparently saw Ted Musgrave's No. 75 Ford
slowing on the track and thought a caution flag might be thrown.
What they didn't know was that Musgrave had run out of gas.
Earnhardt ran out of gas and had to coast into the pits.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt lost a lap to the leaders. He regained it two laps
later, but still finished 12th, one lap behind the top nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a fair day,'' he said. ``We were mediocre on the
race track and mediocre in the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's hot _ literally
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tony Stewart hasn't made many mistakes in his first 10
Winston Cup events, but he made one before Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who climbed to sixth in points with his second straight
top-5, forgot to wear his heat-resistant boots, which go over his
driving shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out about 50 laps into the race,'' Stewart said. ``I
paid for it the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   On lap 147, Stewart tried to pass Rusty Wallace, but he got
loose and nearly spun out. He fell from fifth to 11th, but
eventually made his way back to the front pack.$20 million Bill
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott's 19th-place finish earned the Dawsonville native
$48,325, pushing him past $20 million in career earnings. Elliott
joins Earnhardt and Gordon as the only drivers to surpass that
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did it all go?'' Elliott said earlier. ``It's sure a
long way
</P>
<P>
   from the $640 I earned at my first race (at Rockingham, N.C., in
1976).''

NATO ADMITS MISSILE HIT BUS BUT CALLS BRIDGE A VALID TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO acknowledged Sunday that one of its missiles
had accidentally hit a bus in Kosovo on Saturday but insisted that
the bridge the bus was crossing had been a legitimate military
target.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said the attack on the bridge,
about 10 miles north of Pristina, the Kosovo capital, killed 47
passengers on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said the bus began to cross the concrete bridge
only after the pilot had fired the missile, and that the pilot had
not seen the vehicle. The nationality of the pilot and the type of
plane involved in the attack were not immediately revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not target the bus and there was no intention to harm
civilians, and any loss of innocent life is regretted,'' said Col.
Konrad Freytag, a NATO spokesman. ``This was a legitimate military
target on a key north-south resupply route for the federal Republic
of Yugoslavia military and special police operations.''
</P>
<P>
   During a day of intensive airstrikes on Yugoslavia, NATO and the
Pentagon also reported the loss Sunday of two American warplanes.
An F-16 fighter went down over Yugoslavia near the Bosnian border
and a Harrier jump-jet crashed into the Adriatic Sea during a
training exercise. Both pilots were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said the F-16 pilot ejected from his plane at about 2:20
a.m. after the engine failed for reasons that have not been
determined. He was rescued about two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is safely back at his operating base, where he is receiving
medical attention and being debriefed,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman in Brussels, Belgium. NATO and Pentagon officials said
they had no evidence to support news reports in Yugoslavia that the
plane, which was returning from a combat mission over Yugoslavia,
had been shot down.

   The Navy said the Harrier lost power and crashed into the sea
about 25 miles east of Brindisi, Italy, during a training flight,
and that the pilot was recovered by a rescue helicopter after
spending about five minutes in the water.

   Yugoslav television repeatedly showed grisly footage of the
charred hulk of the bus destroyed Saturday and the bodies of the
people who had been trapped inside. The attack left NATO spokesmen
on the defensive during a briefing at the alliance headquarters in
Brussels.

<P>
   ``I want to underline that we did not bomb the bus,'' Freytag
said, noting that he had seen video displays of the attack from the
cockpit of the fighter. ``We did not target the bus. I have seen
the video and on that video it shows much earlier another vehicle
passing the bridge and not being harmed at all.''

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When the horses charged into the stretch, Cat
Thief taking the lead at the quarter-pole from Worldly Manner, Cat
Thief's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, began cheering wildly: `C'mon, Cat
Thief. Cat Thief, c'mon! We got it! Cat Thief, c'mon! We've got
it!''
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 yards from the wire, though, despite Lukas's pleadings
and urgings, another horse came up to Cat Thief and passed him. For
a moment, Lukas seemed stunned, stunned into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic!'' he then shouted. The new leader, the horse
charging home to win the 125th Kentucky Derby, was none other than
Lukas's other horse, the forgotten former claiming horse,
Charismatic, stunning one and all, especially the bettors, who had
him 30-1.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic paid a whopping $64.60, the third-highest payoff in
Derby history behind Donerail's $184.90 in 1913 and the $72.40 paid
to the backers of Gallahadion in 1940. The 7-1 Menifee finished
second Saturday, closing stoutly to miss by a neck, while the 7-1
Cat Thief was third.
</P>
<P>
   Rich men and rich women, sheikhs and princes, horse fanciers and
experts, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, to
buy young horses who just might deliver the thrill that Charismatic
brought to Lukas and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 11, in the sixth race at Santa Anita, Charismatic
was entered into a claiming race and could have been bought by any
horseman for $62,500. Charismatic had been bought as a yearling for
$200,000 but had become more and more ordinary ``and I thought we'd
maybe get sixty-two fifty if somebody claimed him and pay some of
the bills,'' said Bob Lewis. Charismatic couldn't even win that
race ``but we took a calculated risk with him,'' said Lukas, ``just
so we could build up his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic became the first horse to have run in a claiming
race and win the Derby since Dust Commander did it in 1970.
Saturday's winning time of 2:03 1/5 was most ordinary, the slowest
winning Derby time on a fast track since Cannonade plodded home in
2:04 in the 100th edition in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Charismatic went unclaimed, as claiming races most
often are for ordinary and inferior horses. And when Charismatic
escaped the claiming box unscathed, said Lukas, ``I told Bob
(Lewis) that we'd never do that again. We breathed a sigh of
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Derby was so wide open that the 151,051 fans at
Churchill Downs were as confused as no Derby crowd in the 125 years
of the classic had been confused. Only once in Derby history had a
favorite ever gone off as high as 4-1 (Prairie Bayou, $4.40 to 1 in
1993), and Saturday's favorite was the highest in history. The Bob
Baffert entry of General Challenge and Excellent Meeting was sent
off at $4.80 to 1. (His Prime Timber finished fourth).
</P>
<P>
   And it was clear from that tote board that something was amiss
with Baffert's entry, which had been the morning line favorite at
5-1. The backstretch grapevine at Churchill Downs is so finely
tuned that when Baffert's entry went up in odds, rather than down,
it was clear they would not be winning the third Derby in a row for
Baffert. Excellent Meeting finished fifth and General Challenge
finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief instant, at the top of the stretch, Sheikh Mohammed
al Maktoum's Worldly Manner took the lead, shocking all who had
belittled the Godolphin Stable's approach toward training for this
Derby. But then Cat Thief passed Worldly Manner and Charismatic
swooped by them all.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was vindication for Lukas, who had been under
criticism in recent years for entering so many horses in the Derby
(34), but his fourth Derby silenced all. It was vindication also
for jockey Chris Antley, beset by weight and substance abuse
problems since winning the 1991 Derby with Strike The Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the name `Forrest Gump' in South Carolina,'' said a
tearful Antley of his running many miles a day on his comeback
attempt and not giving up despite many telling him he could not
make it back after a year away from the sport. ``I was in South
Carolina for about a year and for the last eight months I was
trying to get my wieght down. I didn't think I would be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Antley's father, Les, advised his 33-year-old son to give
it up. ``My day said, `Start another business,' '' said Antley.
`You don't need to ride . . . it's dangerous.' But I told my father
that I had a goal in life and I would get to that goal. I will be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears still flowed from Antley, who now weighs 114 pounds, but
had seen his weight balloon up to 147. ``Last November,'' he said,
``I told my dad, `The Derby's coming up and wouldn't it be neat if
I rode in it.' I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley was so wrapped in the emotion of winning the race that he
removed his left hand from the reins in the final yards, nearly
costing him the race to the fast-closing Menifee, who missed
winning by a neck (Cat Thief finished three-quarters of a length
behind Menifee). ``Yes,'' said Antley, ``I pointed my finger. I
looked up and thanked God.''
</P>
<P>
   The win by Charismatic also was vindication for Secretariat, who
still holds the Derby record for fastest time, set in 1973. In the
last 25 years, no horse with Secretariat blood in his veins ever
had won the Derby. Saturday, all three of the top finishers _
Charismatic, Menifee, and Cat Thief _ were descendants of
Secretariat.

DID LA STEP OVER LINE?

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Two minor league players have told baseball
officials an astonishing tale of international intrigue, accusing
the Los Angeles Dodgers of holding secret tryouts in Cuba,
orchestrating the players' escape from the communist-ruled island,
then ordering them to lie about the elaborate scheme.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the allegations would place the Dodgers in violation of
Major League Baseball rules that prohibit teams from scouting in
Cuba, and possibly the longstanding US trade embargo. They also
would represent the most brazen effort yet to strip Cuba of one of
its greatest natural resources: the talented ballplayers who have
been defecting from the country in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-odd defections, the latest of which occurred last month
at a junior tournament in Caracas, have created tension between the
government of Fidel Castro and Major League Baseball, tension that
has been eased recently by home-and-home exhibition games between
the Cuban national team and the Baltimore Orioles. The second game
is scheduled for Monday night at Baltimore's Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Avila, a Dodgers senior vice president, angrily denied the
latest accusations, which were outlined in a letter sent last month
to Major League Baseball officials in New York. First baseman Juan
Carlos Diaz, 23, and outfielder Josue Perez, 21, have asked to be
declared free agents on grounds that they were signed illegally and
at less than market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that nobody should go to Cuba,'' said Avila, who
once led troops into Havana with Castro's 26th of July Movement,
then returned to try to overthrow him at the Bay of Pigs. ``Look, I
don't work for the immigration. I don't work for the State
Department. I don't work for the police department. If somebody
went to Cuba, it's not my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Peguero, the scout alleged to have arranged the
defections, also denied the reports. In an interview from Santo
Domingo, Peguero said he had not been in Cuba in more than 10 years
and suggested that the players were trying to blackmail the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invent many things when money's involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and Perez, he said, ``arrived on their own, like millions
and millions of others have arrived in Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Diaz, who slugged 30 homers last year at Single A and Double
A, and Perez, a whippet-fast spray hitter who is with the Dodgers'
Single A club at Vero Beach, Fla., told nearly identical stories
during separate interviews recently at the Dodgers' spring training
facility here.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said he was first approached in December 1995 by Peguero
after a developmental league game in Havana. He said the scout
identified himself as a Dodger representative, asked for his
address, and invited him to a tryout the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Peguero appeared at his home around 9 a.m. the next day with
bats, balls, and a video camera, Diaz said. He said Peguero took
him to a nearby field, pitched batting practice to him, timed him
running the 60-yard dash, and had him field errant throws at first
base. He said Peguero taped most of the workout and called him
later to say that Dodger officials were pleased with his tryout and
wanted to bring him to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after their first meeting, Diaz said, Peguero
returned to Cuba with a woman he introduced as a cousin and told
Diaz that she was having surgery. Diaz said Peguero's cousin then
fabricated the story that enabled him to obtain a visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told the authorities that I was a friend, that my family
had helped find a Cuban doctor for her surgery, and that she wanted
to invite me to the Dominican Republic as a sign of her
gratitude,'' said Diaz, adding that the woman paid all of his
travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Once he was in the Dominican Republic, the Dodgers placed Diaz
in their training academy at Campo Las Palmas outside Santo
Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they paid off people or what, but I
immediately got my provisional residency papers, which enabled me
to sign,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was called into Avila's office and told he would
receive a signing bonus of $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything,'' he said. ``Look, I was in the
Dominican Republic. The (other) players were getting $2,000,
$2,500, $4,000 bonuses to sign. I saw $65,000 and thought this was
super. Now I realize that what they did was abusive. I have
demonstrated that I was worth more than $65,000.''
</P>
<P>
   After he signed, Diaz said, Peguero and Avila told him to lie if
he ever was asked how he escaped to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They warned me against speaking with reporters,'' he said,
``that if anyone asked to say I was invited to the Dominican
Republic by a girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said the Dodgers initially listed him as a Dominican native
on team rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Peguero insisted that Diaz had, in fact, come to the Dominican
Republic with a woman, but not the Dodger scout's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He arrived with a girlfriend,'' Peguero said. ``He said he was
in love or something like that. We didn't sign him until he got his
Dominican residency.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Diaz, in turn, recommended Perez, who was signed under
the same circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that teams have been sending scouts into Cuba have
circulated for years, but the allegations against the Dodgers are
by far the most specific. Stunning in their sheer audacity, the
stories, if confirmed, would raise to a new level the risk that
teams seem willing to take in their insatiable quest for fresh
talent.
</P>
<P>
   In the only documented case of scouting in Cuba, a
Cuban-American agent from Miami, Juan Ignacio Hernandez, was
arrested in 1996 for allegedly trying to persuade players at a
junior tournament in the city of Sancti Spiritus to defect.
Hernandez also had made contact with pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez (no relation), who later defected and has become a star
with the Yankees. Cuban authorities sentenced the agent to 15 years
in prison and shortly thereafter banned El Duque from Cuban
baseball for life.
</P>
<P>
   A scout with an American League team said the Commissioner's
Office has repeatedly warned teams against going into Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've sent e-mails to each office that you're not allowed to
go down there,'' said the scout. ``They've made it very clear that
you can't negotiate with any Cuban players even if you're out of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball,
declined comment on the reports. Sandy Alderson of the
Commissioner's Office confirmed that he received the aformentioned
letter but otherwise declined comment. In the past, the
Commissioner's Office has said that teams could face fines,
suspensions, or loss of draft choices if found in violation of the
rules against scouting in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Dodgers also would have violated the 36-year trade
embargo, which prohibits American companies from conducting
business on the island, is unclear. According to the Treasury
Department, which enforces the embargo, teams are prohibited from
visiting Cuba to scout or recruit. A Treasury official said the
embargo permits only humanitarian and cultural exchanges, such as
the Orioles series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting ballplayers is not part of that,'' said the
official.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can be fined up to $55,000 for violations. The
maximum corporate fine is $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling effect of Juan Ignacio Hernandez's arrest was
believed to have deterred most scouts from entering Cuba. But
Perez, the outfielder, said Peguero helped him defect on Feb. 23,
1997, after a courtship that began in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Peguero held another tryout for him in 1996, Perez said, then
came to Havana at the end of the year to arrange the escape. He
introduced Perez to a young woman, who he said would arrange the
formal invitation for him to leave. Perez said he was given a
30-day tourist visa, traveled with the woman to the Dominican
Republic, then never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said the Dodgers forbade him from seeing an agent after
placing him in Campo Las Palmas. After several months, Avila and
Peguero signed him for a $40,000 bonus, but told him not to tell
anyone how he had gotten to the Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `It's $40,000, sign here,' '' said Perez. ``If I
didn't sign, what was I going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Perez eventually retained an agent, Los Angeles-based Gus
Dominguez, who was also Diaz's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began to open my eyes,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, reached in Los Angeles, confirmed that the two
players had filed a grievance but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he feared that he might be found out before he left
Cuba, Perez, seated at a restaurant in Vero Beach, said, ``If
you're fearful, you won't get anywhere in life. I wouldn't be
sitting here talking to you if I was fearful. Pablo said he would
take care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said Peguero told him that after one trip to Cuba his plane
was held up by Cuban security agents and he was escorted from the
plane and interrogated. The agents eventually allowed him to leave,
Diaz said the scout told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He vowed never to set foot in Cuba again,'' Diaz said.

REVOLUTION GO DOWN FIGHTING

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution finally lost a game in
regulation time Saturday night. And a 2-1 defeat against the
Colorado Rapids cost the Revolution a chance to move into first
place in the Eastern Conference of MLS.
</P>
<P>
   In their first five games, the Revolution had two
regulation-time victories, and had trailed for a total of only 21
minutes. But they presented a makeshift defense in their sixth
game, and the Rapids capitalized on the Revolution's
disorganization in the first half, and scored a disputed goal in
the second half as the Revolution pressed for the winner while
playing an offside trap.
</P>
<P>
   Even player-coach Walter Zenga, whose goalkeeping had
compensated for defensive mistakes in previous matches, could not
prevent a defeat. Panamanian striker Jorge Dely Valdes of Colorado
finished a move started by Wolde Harris for the first goal in the
seventh minute. Dely Valdes was kept onside by Manny Motajo, who
was making his first start as a replacement for Richard Goulooze
(calf strain) in central defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado had several other chances in the first half as the
Revolution defenders never seemed settled. Brian Dunseth, who is
better suited for the middle, struggled with his passing on the
right side as Mike Burns (hamstring pull) missed his first match.
Motajo was benched after halftime. And the Revolution, with only 13
field players available, had few answers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore tied the score with a powerful, bouncing free kick
from outside 25 yards in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivan McKinley-Dan Calichman combination solidified the
central defense in the second half and gave the Revolution a chance
to win. They went to a three-defender scheme and depended more on
the offside trap, which seemed to be well executed.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris scored the game-winner in the 81st minute after a
David Vaudreuil pass to Joey DiGiamarino was allowed. DiGiamarino
had difficulty with his first touch, but had so much room that he
had time to settle and cross for Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a ton of offsides that weren't called,'' Calichman
said. ``But just because they don't call it doesn't mean we can't
stop the play. We played poorly and were beaten by the better team.
The loss of concentration for a minute, actually for a second, cost
us a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slow start, the Revolution had chances in the first
half as Colorado failed to control the tempo and made several
appalling giveaways. Paulo Dos Santos, an original member of the
Revolution who was starting for the first time, slammed a shot off
the crossbar in the 13th minute.
</P>
<P>
   By the second half, the Revolution pressed forward, searching
for the winner. The three Revolution substitutes in the second half
were all attackers. Jamar Beasley pressured the Rapids with his
speed after replacing Motajo. But Johnny Torres and Tony Kuhn
failed to add to the attack, and Kuhn's giveaway set up Colorado's
winning counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's frustration became apparent late in the match
as McKinley was ejected by referee Ruben Rodhas after a clash with
Colorado goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann. Zenga and assistant coach
Giuseppe Galderisi pursued the refereeing crew after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play our game and I didn't play well,'' Jair said.
``They scored early and got their confidence, but we believed we
could win in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, you get a little down. But it's still the
beginning of the season.''

OWNERS OF ONE WILD LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Patrick Sullivan reacted like a fan when he heard the
Patriots' stadium deal in Hartford had fallen through and they were
staying in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great news. I was one of those people not necessarily
fearing a move to Hartford, but one who feared they might move to
Houston,'' said Sullivan, the team's former general manager and son
of William Sullivan, the founder and longtime owner of the Patriots
who died Feb. 23, 1998, at 82.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Sullivan is a private citizen these days, although he
still is linked to the league by his television production
business. He still lives in the area and is a season ticket-holder.
</P>
<P>
   There are many things Sullivan misses about the game, but there
are many things he's glad he never will have to deal with again.
</P>
<P>
   No more lawsuits. No more failed attempts to build stadiums,
lucrative deals that would have made life a little easier for his
father. No more dealing with player agents, whose influence began
to rise at an alarming rate toward the end of his reign. Best of
all, no more controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on what now may be the final chapter of Patriots
stadium follies, he was taken by the great interest shown by the
Boston business community in the team, which many believe spurred
Massachusetts lawmakers to finally agree on a $70 million
infrastructure package for the Patriots, now owned by Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan wished this interest was as loud and strong back in the
1960s and '70s, when the Patriots had a chance to stay in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the support of the business leaders, I said, `Wow,
this happened about 30 years too late,' '' Sullivan said.
``Obviously it's great that it happened now so the team can open a
state-of-the-art stadium in Foxborough and keep the team in this
area, but if that commitment had been shown by the business leaders
years ago, I think the Patriots would have been in Boston. To me,
the real tragedy in all of this is that nothing could be worked out
in Boston. The Patriots should have been in Boston and my father
really dedicated himself to keeping them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan remembers a 1964 plan that was approved by the city and
state to build a $98 million retractable-roof stadium at the end of
the Massachusetts Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a 55,000-seat stadium, with parking
garages, a hotel,'' recalled Sullivan. ``It was way ahead of its
time. The state was going to build it but it called for all four
sports teams to commit to 20-year leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox and Tom Yawkey wanted out of Fenway Park. The
Celtics wanted out of the Garden. But what killed the deal was the
Bruins. They controlled all of the concessions at the Garden and
they wanted to keep that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Sullivan said a football-only stadium across from the
Keystone plant at Neponset eventually was crushed by ``a lot of
political mumbo-jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until a few months later, when E.M. Lowe was convinced
by Prescott Hobson to donate land at the racetrack in Foxborough to
Stadium Reality Trust, that the deal there became a reality. At the
time there was also the possibility the Patriots would move to the
Rockingham Park area in Salem, N.H., but that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Foxborough. Schaefer Stadium, with concrete slabs
and aluminum seats that made a warm fall day seem wintry, was built
at a cost of $6.8 million, giving the Patriots a home for the last
28 years after opening Aug. 15, 1971, amid chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Massive traffic jams on Route 1, bad plumbing, locker room
urinals mistakenly placed too high, and incidents of bad behavior
by fans on Monday nights all had Boston-area fans wondering whether
it was a good idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems at the stadium were corrected little by
little over the years by Foxborough officials and ultimately by
Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been plenty of problems with the team overall,
most the result of ownership inadequacies and financial problems
that, in part, were because of the increasingly inadequate stadium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kiam, owner of the Remington company, owned the team from
1988-92 after a proposed deal between Billy Sullivan and Kraft fell
through. While Kiam bought the team for a song, his efforts to
purchase the stadium failed because Kraft outbid him. That left
Kiam holding on to a team that couldn't generate enough revenue
from the luxury boxes, parking, and concessions, much of which
belonged to Kraft, with another entity owning some parking.
</P>
<P>
   There were failed attempts by Kiam to sell the team to groups in
Memphis, Jacksonville, and Baltimore, and Kiam's own financial
downfall and the bad publicity created by the sexual harassment
suit principally involving Zeke Mowatt and former Herald writer
Lisa Olson made Kiam's tenure a circus.
</P>
<P>
   Not more than two months after he bought the team, he told then
Boston Mayor Ray Flynn he needed a new stadium or he'd be forced to
sell out of New England. Kiam never got his stadium and he never
recovered from his bad business deal.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kiam there was Fran Murray, a bright, articulate man from
Philadelphia who in 1986 saved the Sullivans from bankruptcy by
borrowing $21 million (which gave him 49 percent ownership) to
become a partner with an option to purchase the team. That was,
only to find on the day he was supposed to exercise his right to
buy the team along with Reebok head Paul Fireman, the Sullivans had
made a deal with Kiam. Murray never had met Kiam, but he was now
his reluctant partner.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was also the first to attempt to orchestrate a deal with
Hartford, dealing with former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr.
on a $130 million stadium plan that also fell through.
</P>
<P>
   When Kiam finally sold to James Orthwein in May of 1992, Murray
remained minority owner. He eventually sold his interest to
Orthwein in November of '92 and concentrated his efforts in St.
Louis to get what became the RCA Dome built.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis businessman Orthwein always was seen as a temporary
owner, one who wanted a pro football team in his hometown and tried
to move the Patriots there.
</P>
<P>
   Orthwein and his business partners were unable to crack a
determined Kraft, who owned the stadium after purchasing it out of
bankruptcy court for $50 million. Kraft had an iron-clad lease that
the Patriots had to play their home games at Foxboro Stadium for
the length of the lease. Any attempt to move the team would result
in a lawsuit that Kraft would win easily. The lease was Kraft's key
to finally purchasing the team.
</P>
<P>
   Orthwein pushed hard for the megaplex deal in Boston in 1993,
but that also never came to fruition. Unable to get his hands on
Kraft's stadium, he sold the team to Kraft for a reported $168
million, a deal that became official Feb. 25, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as coach, and
the team made Drew Bledsoe the No. 1 pick in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Sullivan, Murray, and Kiam all wound up suing the NFL.
Sullivan retrieved about $11.5 million after some wins and losses;
he had claimed the NFL essentially forced him to sell the team by
not letting him make a public stock offering. Murray had his suit
in federal court thrown out when a judge ruled the league had not
acted improperly in arbitrating his dispute with Kiam or in its
handling of Murray's application for an expansion team in St.
Louis. Kiam, claiming the NFL wouldn't allow him to move the team,
lost a $150 million antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   Orthwein went off to St. Louis, where he has a minority
ownership interest in the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Kraft began the most stable period of ownership the
Patriots ever had had. The day after Kraft bought the team, 5,958
season tickets were sold, and by April 29, 1995, every game was
sold out before the season for the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers, including former Gov. William Weld, promised
Kraft would be taken care of with a new football facility. A
promise one might say finally was kept, but not after much
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Sullivan, meanwhile, had his ups and downs with the
owners after his father. During the sexual harassment incident and
a 1-15 season in 1990, Kiam suspended Sullivan. A year later Sam
Jankovich was brought in and Sullivan was under his control. That
marriage didn't last long, and Sullivan left his role of football
executive for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that problem with Victor, but hey, that goes with the
territory,'' said Sullivan. ``It's over. There's nothing more to be
said about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan never knew Orthwein, but was certainly familiar with
the Krafts. ``My dad had known them because they had been season
ticket-holders for years and they had owned the Boston Lobsters,''
said Sullivan. ``We tried to sell them the team, but Bob had an
adviser who we called `Dr. No.' Anything we proposed he would say
no. So we called him `Dr. No.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some disagreements, but the Krafts have been great
owners of the team. Bob and Myra Kraft are two of the most generous
people you'll ever find in the Boston area. They have done so much
good for so many people. And now Bob has stepped up and turned down
a lot of money to keep the team where he feels it belongs. That's
great. It really shows his commitment to the people of this area
and I think dad had that commitment as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a true home and stable ownership. It's only taken 39
years to get to this point.

WITHOUT ELWAY, BRONCOS MAY NOT MAKE RUN FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As of Sunday, the Jacksonville Jaguars are the team to
beat in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   That simple fact says as much about John Elway as the NFL-record
148 regular-season and 47 come-from-behind victories he led the
Denver Broncos to during a 16-year career that officially comes to
an end with his retirement announcement.
</P>
<P>
   For as much as people have insisted that the Broncos of late
were Terrell Davis's team, another man drove the bus in Denver and
he is gone now and the Broncos will pay a price for that next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of Elway is not like the 49ers letting Joe
Montana go to Kansas City when he was past his prime, as Elway also
is. There is no Steve Young behind Elway as there was behind
Montana in San Francisco. There is Bubby Brister, and that
eventually will show those who called the Broncos Davis's team that
it never really was.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a great runner, perhaps the best in the game today
(although for my money Barry Sanders is still unbeatable). But
great runners seldom can carry their team to the Super Bowl.
Quarterbacks do that, as no less a fan of the running game than
Bill Parcells knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterbacks, like coaches, are judged by their jewelry,''
Parcells loves to say, and Elway is proof of that, being the only
quarterback to lead a team to five Super Bowls while playing with
33 running backs and 22 receivers during his career.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot often go the distance without a great defense or a
great quarterback or both in the NFL. A great runner is a weapon of
supreme significance, but he alone cannot often affect a season the
way a great quarterback can. If that were so, Walter Payton, Eric
Dickerson, Earl Campbell, Jim Brown, Tony Dorsett, O.J. Simpson,
and Sanders would have more than three world championship rings
among them, for they were among the game's greatest runners, far
greater for far longer than Davis has been.
</P>
<P>
   So the loss of Elway cannot be minimized for the Broncos, who
have averaged 13 wins a season the past three years while winning
back-to-back Super Bowls. The presence of Brister, who at 37 has
not started more than eight games in a season since 1990, or Chris
Miller, a 34-year-old returning pensioner who retired four years
ago because of repeated concussions, will cost the Broncos a game
or two next season. Not because of their own failures, but simply
because they are not Elway. And that will cost Denver the chance to
three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing Davis can do about that. After rushing for
2,008 yards last season, there is simply nothing more he can do for
his team that he's already done.
</P>
<P>
   That is not meant to imply he's washed up, it is just to make
clear that whether he rushes for 1,700 or 1,800 or 2,000 yards he
cannot replace what Elway brought to the Broncos, even in his
declining years, because Elway brought fear to the stadium with him
on the opponent's bus. Fear and the clear understanding of every
defensive coordinator in the game that you could not stack your
defense to simply stop Davis even if this was now his team, nor
could you safely assume you had the Broncos beaten as long as Elway
had the ball and enough time to produce a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is gone now and a quarterback named Bubby cannot
bring it back. It leaves Sunday when Elway walks out of his last
press conference in Denver and into the sunset of his athletic
life. The respect will remain for the Broncos because Mike Shanahan
has built a solid team around a star runner and a talented
offensive line, but respect is not the same as fear. Fear leads
opponents to limit what they'll try to do. Fear freezes opponents
for a fatal moment _ all the time a quarterback like Elway needs to
beat them. Fear is far more debilitating to an opponent than
respect.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fear of Davis's Broncos this year because no
one will fear the man who hands him the ball. That's what the
retirement of Elway has taken away from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years Shanahan has been considered a genius for
the multiheaded offensive system he has designed for the Broncos,
and he may well be a genius of design, the Bill Gates of offensive
football. But a programmer eventually has to turn his program over
to an operator, and if that operator pushes the wrong buttons at
the wrong moments errors result, and eventually the system shuts
down. The Broncos' system seldom shut down when Elway was running
it and often exceeded its capabilities in the years Dan Reeves was
giving him one that included an undersized defense and no running
back at all. Shanahan did better by Elway and consequently he did
slightly better by the Broncos, twice winning the season's final
game.
</P>
<P>
   Now Shanahan will to try to do it the other way _ with a great
running back but a far less resourceful operator running his
system. He will have a chance now that he never really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a chance to prove he really is a genius, because
he'll have to be the one to win it all without John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath waiting for the multimillion-dollar fines
and temporary loss of services of the players in question that some
predicted the Cowboys faced for allegedly reaching agreements with
free agents Rocket Ismail, Mark Stepnoski, and Quentin Coryatt
without officially signing them because it would endanger the
team's salary cap compliance. While the league is looking into the
matter at the insistence of several Cowboys opponents, the fact is
no team or free agent has to sign a contract the moment a
settlement is reached. Second, if the Cowboys don't sign them, both
sides remain at risk, gambling that injury or another offer won't
conspire to break their oral contract, if there is such a thing in
professional sports. If a player, or a team, is willing to gamble
by waiting for the papers to be signed, there is little the NFL can
do about it but fume. That this violates the spirit of the salary
cap is obvious, but such actions go all the way back to the cap's
earliest days and, in fact, are commonplace. Onetime Bengals
lineman Max Montoya, for example, agreed to a contract in
Cincinnati the first year of free agency but didn't sign it and 10
days later jumped to the Raiders because he got an unexpected
bigger offer. The Bengals were irate but had no recourse. That is
the gamble Dallas owner Jerry Jones took when he reportedly reached
agreements with all three players that took them off the market but
had not cleared enough salary cap room to officially sign them. The
NFL can do nothing about this until it changes its cap regulations
to give a team X amount of time to file a signed contract after an
agreement is reached . . . Time and his waistline caught up with
quotable Nate Newton Thursday when Jones announced that he did not
plan to re-sign the six-time All-Pro who has played 13 years in
Dallas. The Cowboys are planning to move their best lineman, Larry
Allen, into Newton's left guard spot from left tackle and are
hoping No. 2 draft choice Solomon Page can handle one of the tackle
jobs . . . Gil Brandt, one of the originators of the computerized
information-gathering that now passes for scouting in the NFL, has
to laugh at the way his ideas are now being used. ``We started all
that in Dallas to find a way to break the tie when you have six
guys who are about identical in ability and all look alike,''
Brandt explained. ``It was never really supposed to be the main
deciding factor. Last year only two offensive linemen ran the 40
under 5 flat: Kyle Turley and Steve McKinney. They both ended up
starting every game at New Orleans and Indianapolis. But the two
strongest guys got cut. Next year it could be the opposite.
Sometimes things change. The more I scouted over the years, the
more I began to believe that if you can find a way to see who will
really work hard at being good after they sign, you'll have the key
factor to success. When Calvin Hill came to us, his goal was to
make more money every year. Because of that he was always working.
Do you think Terry Glenn has worked hard to get better? Joey
Galloway (Glenn's former Ohio State teammate) was always in the
workout room if you went to Ohio State and looked for him. Others
aren't.'' . . . According to Brandt, all you have to do is watch
film of Saints No. 1-and-only draft choice Ricky Williams against
Nebraska last season to understand the kind of player he is. ``He
runs 50 yards to tackle a guy from behind and he makes a pickup
block on a blitz that was beautiful to watch,'' Brandt said. ``You
already know he can run the ball but you get the Nebraska tape and
you know he's a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During rookie minicamp last week, University of Maine wide
receiver Drew O'Connor made a good first impression on Tampa Bay
coach Tony Dungy, which is what an unknown free agent has to do.
The 6-foot-3 1/2-inch O'Connor, who had 71 receptions for 1,027
yards in Orono, was signed after the draft because his size and
hands caught the eye of area scout Joe DiMarzo, who twice went to
Orono to work O'Connor out. The Bucs have four sure-shot receivers
on their roster but Dungy may keep seven and is looking for size in
several of them. If O'Connor can show he has the speed to get off
the line, he has a shot at a job . . . Seattle coach Mike Holmgren
is wasting little time letting the Seahawks know it's a new day. He
already has conducted two minicamps and ripped several veterans for
missing much of the second one with injuries. Although he did not
single out running back Ricky Watters and defensive tackle Cortez
Kennedy, who claimed hamstring and back problems, he says,
``There's a handful of fellas that are going to have to learn how
we do things. They are good football players but they have to learn
how we practice.'' What he meant by that was every day. Holmgren
has another minicamp next month and two more planned for June . . .
The Bengals will bring in veteran cornerback Cris Dishman this week
for a look, and so will Kansas City. The 34-year-old Dishman was
released by the Redskins after they drafted Champ Bailey last
month, allowing them to avoid paying Dishman $2.7 million this
year. The Bengals are looking for a veteran backup to play behind
rookie Charles Fisher, and Dishman could be the man if his contract
demands are low.

 ELWAY FINDS IT HARD TO SAY GOODBYE  (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ It is something most athletes, especially
great competitors like John Elway, find incredibly hard to say:
that their bodies, after years of pounding, can no longer perform
at a top level.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Elway has stared at his ailing knees, remembered
the pain-killing shots he took for his injured ribs and tired of
the rigorous physical therapy sessions he endured just to attend
practice for the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, 38, knew what was happening. Age had caught him in the
way no defensive lineman ever could. That is why Sunday at a
suburban Denver hotel he officially announced his retirement from
the NFL after 16 marvelous seasons, including two Super Bowl
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Elway will go down as one of the best quarterbacks in history,
but even he could not overcome the toll football took on his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard,'' said an emotional Elway, who cried several
times during his nearly one-hour news conference before his family,
members of the Broncos and more than 100 members of the news media.
``There's an over-under in the locker room on how many times I'm
going to cry. It's been great. It was a tough decision to make. I
really don't look at it like it's a retirement. It's a graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for me to move on. I can't do it physically anymore,
and that's really hard for me to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway missed just 15 starts in 16 seasons because of illness or
injury, but he was one of the strongest _ and toughest _
quarterbacks ever, despite being sacked an NFL-record 559 times in
256 games. He played through broken bones, pulled muscles and
several severe knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Elway will most likely have his arthritic left knee
replaced in the coming years. Recently, Elway has had to spend
increasing time with Steve Antonopulos, the team's athletic
trainer, who patched up the future Hall of Famer like a rag doll
before and after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had to go through so many things just to get ready for
practice,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's retirement was known for a week but was delayed because
of the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. His
news conference began with a moment of silence for the victims and
Elway wore a blue-and-silver ribbon on his suit jacket in memory of
the slain students and teacher. Elway was joined on the stage by
the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, and coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Elway leaves as the NFL's winningest quarterback with 148
victories. It is likely that Miami's Dan Marino, who has 142, will
pass him next season. But Marino would probably trade all of those
victories for a Super Bowl championship, something that had eluded
and haunted Elway for years.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his career, Elway was viewed as a spoiled brat, the
son of a coach who demanded a trade from the Baltimore Colts when
they took him as the first pick in the 1983 draft and a quarterback
who got into arguments with his former coach, Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   What truly angered and later motivated Elway was how he was
viewed as the quarterback who could not win a championship. Earlier
in his career, Elway had lost three Super Bowls by a total score of
136-40, and his critics, like former Pittsburgh Steelers
quarterback Terry Bradshaw, often ripped him for not being able to
win the big one.
</P>
<P>
   Elway would later call those losses, combined with his rift with
Reeves, among the saddest days of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed when Shanahan was named coach of the Broncos
in 1995. The first thing Shanahan did was give Elway more control
of the offense, including more freedom to call his own plays.
Shanahan also opened the offense up, allowing Elway to fully
utilize his strong arm and athletic gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, Shanahan drafted a little-known running
back from Georgia named Terrell Davis in the sixth round in 1995.
Elway and Davis would prove to be a potent combination.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Elway had a franchise running
back. Teams could no longer focus all of their efforts on him; they
had to account for Davis, a slashing, powerful runner.
</P>
<P>
   The combination proved dangerous two seasons ago, with Davis
rushing for 1,750 yards and 15 touchdowns during the regular season
to help the Broncos to a 12-4 record. Then, behind Elway's powerful
arm and Davis' legs, the Broncos gained one of the biggest upsets
in championship history by beating a heavily favored Green Bay team
in Super Bowl XXXII, 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elway who made the critical play, leaping over three
Packers and scrambling for 6 yards and a first down near the Green
Bay goal line. Elway, running on those creaky knees, was hit in
midair and spun like a top.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos made it back to the Super Bowl last season, and
Elway faced Reeves, the coach he had not liked playing for. (Of the
dozens of people Elway thanked Sunday, Reeves was not one of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons dared Elway to beat them by often lining up seven
men near the line of scrimmage, and Elway did, throwing for 336
yards. He was named the most valuable player as Denver beat
Atlanta, 34-19. The only thing sweeter for Elway than beating
Reeves was hoisting the Lombardi trophy over his head with Bradshaw
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that impressed me about John was the poise,''
Shanahan said, ``the performance under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who was a nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback, provided some
of the most incredible moments in football history. Perhaps the
most memorable was the 1986 AFC championship game against
Cleveland. Denver began a drive at its 2-yard line, trailing the
Browns by 20-13 late in the game. Elway led the Broncos on a
15-play, 98-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass with 37
seconds left. Denver won, 23-20, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The record book is spiced with Elway's name. He finishes with
51,475 passing yards (second), 4,123 completions (second), 300
touchdown passes (third), 7,250 passing attempts (second), and 12
3,000-yard passing seasons (second).
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that John was the greatest to play the game,''
Bowlen said.

</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Having grown weary of hearing about how open scoring is
going to save boxing, and realizing that things are kind of slow in
the ring at the moment, this seems to me like the right time to get
into an argument instead of a fight, and what better way to do that
than to reopen the debate over who is boxing's pound-for-pound
champion?
</P>
<P>
   That title has for all intents and purposes been vacant since
the fall of Pernell Whitaker, who for many years held it so firmly
that the editors of Ring magazine finally went so far as to award
him a belt. But time and a fast-lane lifestyle finally eroded
Whitaker's skills, and since his loss to Oscar De La Hoya two years
ago the debate over his heir has raged without conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a clear-cut pound-for-pound champion and the
likelihood that none of those at the top of the list will ever meet
only add to the debate. Here is one man's learned opinion of
today's Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   1. Oscar De La Hoya (30-0, 24 KOs, World Boxing Council
welterweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has faced consistently better competition than Roy
Jones or any of the world's other top fighters and showed his
mettle in a recent victory over previously undefeated Ike Quartey.
That night he passed his first big test, coming on in the final
three rounds to beat an opponent as tough as he is but apparently
not as determined.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's critics believed The Golden Boy would fold under
such pressure but the fact is he's been coming through whenever
he's been in the spotlight since the 1992 Olympics. Until something
_ or someone _ changes that, De La Hoya should be considered the
best.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roy Jones (39-1, 33 KOs, World Boxing Association-WBC light
heavyweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   Jones may have more talent, speed, and pure artistry than anyone
in boxing, including De La Hoya, but his reluctance to fight the
best of a sad lot of available middleweight, super middleweight,
and light heavyweight opponents is a problem. It is not that Jones
fears anyone, but his insistence on purses that exceed his fights'
value has caused him to miss several opportunities to cement his
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Until he answers a stiff challenge, a question will remain
unanswered. Such a test may come next month when he tries to unify
the 175-pound title by taking on International Boxing Federation
champion Reggie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shane Mosley (32-0, 30 KOs, IBF lightweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   Mosley was the Boxing Writers' Association 1998 Fighter of the
Year, and for good reason. He is the dominant 135-pounder in the
world and no one else is close. He can box or punch, and his talent
seems as limitless as Jones's and De La Hoya's.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley may stay at 135 to try to unify the title _ especially
now that Stevie Johnson is back in the picture _ but he continues
to struggle to make weight. For his latest title defense, he gained
16 pounds in one day after the weigh-in, and entered the ring at
151 to face John Brown. Those struggles may lead him to move up to
junior welterweight, but if he does, there's no one at 140 who will
beat him either.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mark Johnson (37-1, 26 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tired of having no challenger at flyweight so he vacated
the IBF title and moved up to junior bantamweight. As a flyweight
he was the best in the world at 112 pounds and last weekend he
easily outpointed Thailand's Ratanachai Vorapin to win the vacant
IBF 115-pound championship.
</P>
<P>
   5. Johnny Tapia (46-0-2, 25 KOs, WBA bantamweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   Tapia goes unnoticed by many but he's 20-0-1 in world title
fights, took apart Danny Romero when many thought he would
struggle, and has always answered the bell. Until that changes, he
deserves this slot or maybe even a higher one.
</P>
<P>
   6. Felix Trinidad (34-0, 29 KOs, IBF welterweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   The belief is that Trinidad has greatness inside him, and
perhaps he does, but his list of opponents is less impressive than
even Jones's. For as often as De La Hoya has been criticized in
some corners for ducking tough fights, who has Trinidad fought?
</P>
<P>
   There is no Quartey or anyone close to him on Trinidad's resume,
and by the time he got to Whitaker, De La Hoya had already unmasked
the former champion.
</P>
<P>
   Until Trinidad gets into the ring with someone who can bring the
best out of him, as Quartey did for De La Hoya, you have to wonder
why his handlers are holding him back. Is it his chin, which has
been heard to sound like cracking glass several times?
</P>
<P>
   If not, why doesn't promoter Don King match him with
hard-punching but vulnerable WBA champion James Page to get
Trinidad two belts, instead of matching him with the likes of
Vincent Pettway?
</P>
<P>
   7. Tim Austin (19-0-1, 18 KOs, IBF bantamweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   Austin gets less publicity than any top-drawer champion around
but he showed guts and boxing ability in winning the title from
Mbulelo Botile two years ago despite breaking his jaw. He is a
power puncher who also can box, and if he were a bigger man in a
more high-profile division, fight fans would think more of him.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bernard Hopkins (35-2-1, 27 KOs, IBF middleweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins loves to talk but he also loves to fight. He is the
dominant middleweight in the world today, and even though it's a
thin division, there's no one in his class that Hopkins can't
handle.
</P>
<P>
   People forget that he fought a close fight with Jones when the
two met several years back as middleweights and Jones didn't
exactly beat the door down to give him a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   9. Ricardo Lopez (47-0-1, 35 KOs, WBA strawweight champion).
</P>
<P>
   You win as many title fights in a row as this guy, and I don't
care if you weigh eight pounds, you can fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has struggled some of late and may be reaching the point
where it's taking too much out of him to continue boxing at 108
pounds, but whatever weight class he fights in, he'll be one of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   10. Ike Quartey (34-1-1, 29 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   How do you drop him out of the top 10 for losing a close
decision to De La Hoya? Quartey seemed to fade at the end of that
fight, as he has in other bouts lately, but he can still punch with
power and do damage with his jab, as De La Hoya's face showed.
</P>
<P>
   Many considered him one of the top five fighters in the world
before his loss to De La Hoya, and his late fade that night doesn't
drop him much. He would be a stiff challenge for Trinidad, which is
one reason they haven't fought, and he may end up with a chance to
redeem himself in a rematch with De La Hoya before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may wonder where Floyd Mayweather Jr., Fernando
Vargas, and Prince Naseem Hamed are, but they are where they
belong. Not on this list. Mayweather is a talent and he has the
arrogance of a great champion, but he is too young now to break
into the pound-for-pound rankings. The same is true for Vargas,
although within a year both could make it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hamed, this is not a list of pound-for-pound biggest
punchers _ which he would be at or near the top of _ nor is it a
list of pound-for-pound most irksome showmen. Although Hamed has
the gift of power, he is a completely off-balance fighter who one
day will pay for that vulnerability. And, by the way, when is he
going to fight somebody?

CALCAVECCHIA SHOT WAS OUT OF BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Even if we could award him a mulligan, it would not
help. The damage has been done. Mark Calcavecchia said something
that angered an awful lot of people, and the comments will haunt
him forever. Three weeks after he said Arnold Palmer should stop
playing in the Masters, the mention of Calcavecchia's name is met
with disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was he thinking?'' asked a gentleman the other day after
our group had completed a round of golf. The man, whom I had never
met, had a fluid swing and a strong passion for the game, which I
guessed he had been playing for parts of five decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be real curious to find out what was behind his remarks,''
said James Dodson, who worked with Palmer to produce ``A Golfer's
Life,'' a wonderful book that tells the story of arguably our most
cherished sports hero, a man who earned adulation not because he
won major championships but because he lost them with dignity and
never forgot to thank people for the chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   That is the thing about Palmer, said Dodson: ``He always knew
how to say thank you to the public. There'll never be anyone as
beloved as Palmer, and perhaps some players resent his success.''
</P>
<P>
   People want Palmer to play at Augusta every April, and he should
for as long as he wants. The Masters is like no other tournament;
it is about tradition, something we carelessly toss aside far too
often. Palmer is not taking up anyone's spot. He earned the right
to be there. Calcavecchia and too many players like him are too
busy having things given to them to understand what that means. Too
busy worrying about the endorsement deals of tomorrow to respect
the sacrifices of yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   To many others, Palmer stands for integrity and honor.
</P>
<P>
   Advised of Calcavecchia's comments, Palmer said only, ``That's
his opinion, and he's welcomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because Arnold Palmer understood public relations
better than anyone,'' said Dodson. ``He knew when to open his mouth
and when to say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad we can't say the same about Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   You just know that US captain Ben Crenshaw will have no shortage
of volunteers asking to step up against Jarmo Sandelin should the
Swede continue his fine play and make the European Ryder Cup team.
Sandelin won last week's Spanish Open and is fifth in the Ryder Cup
point standings. He is mentioned first by many players, however,
when they are asked if anyone out there disturbs them. Sandelin did
what was generally thought impossible _ upset Phil Mickelson _ in
the 1996 Dunhill Cup and is the guy who rubbed it in to Mark
O'Meara with the ugly ball-marking incident at the Lancome Trophy
in 1997. Months after O'Meara had won the event, a film clip of the
tournament showed that he had placed his ball an inch or two closer
to the hole than where he marked it. O'Meara said it was
unintentional, and only Sandelin expressed outrage. The Swede, who
finished second, called on O'Meara to relinquish the title and
referred to him as ``Mark O'Nearer.'' So last year's Masters champ
may be first in line to request that Crenshaw put him up against
the guy with the snakeskin golf boots. Sandelin may be the zaniest
of the three Swedes who could spice up the Ryder Cup. Jesper
Parnevik (keeps hat flipped up, eats volcanic sand, wears pants
three sizes too small) and Per-Ulrik Johansson (is it a beret or is
his cap on backwards?) are the others. Sandelin was introduced to
the sport through miniature golf, and he wields a 52-inch driver.
Unfortunately for him _ and the European team that would have to
take him _ Sandelin quite often hasn't a clue as to where his drive
is going. He is long, but he can be very, very crooked. Not the
type of game you bring to The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Tom Lehman has moved up in the Ryder Cup standings.
He's 20th after a solid performance at Greensboro (69-68-69-69),
and sometimes lost in all the talk about David Duval and Tiger
Woods is the notion that Lehman may be the best Ryder Cup player
the US has. He didn't get rattled when Seve Ballesteros tried to
fluster him in 1995 (Lehman won, 4 and 3) and he put a 7-and-6
beating on Ignacio Garrido at Valderrama in 1997. Lehman is 3-2-2
in his two Ryder Cup appearances . . . Business is brisk for those
trying to move Ryder Cup tickets. One broker said he is selling
them for $3,000. He is getting his tickets, he said, from people
chosen in the PGA of America's drawing (5,000 entrants won the
right to buy two tickets for $275 each). ``They probably didn't
intend to sell them,'' said the broker, ``but when they found out
they could get $2,000 each, they remembered they could see it on
NBC.'' How does the Ryder Cup ticket compare with an All-Star Game
ticket for Fenway Park July 13? The latter is going for about
$1,500. But when you consider that the Brookline spectacle is a
three-day event, baseball is the higher sell . . . Not a bad start
to last week's Spanish Open for Juan Carlos Aguero:
eagle-birdie-birdie-birdie-birdie. But he played the next 67 holes
in just 10 under and finished in a tie for fifth . . . Ireland's
Christy O'Connor Jr., who closed with a 65 to tie for fourth at
last week's Home Depot Invitational, has another Senior Tour
exemption into next week's Nationwide event in Atlanta . . . On the
heels of Sergio Garcia's solid debut as a professional (9 under,
T-25 at the Spanish Open) comes this statistical update: Justin
Rose remains perfect since turning pro after his stunning
performance at last summer's British Open. He has missed 17 cuts in
17 starts. Garcia, by the way, makes his US pro debut at the Byron
Nelson May 13-16 . . . Another amateur star who has found the pro
life less than rewarding is Scotland's Gordon Sherry. He is playing
on the Challenge Tour, Europe's equivalent to the Nike.

FORMER BULLS SEE ANOTHER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last year at this time, they were the defending world
champions, en route to a sixth title in eight years. Then came the
diaspora and now the Chicago Bulls are almost unrecognizable to
those who once wore the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   We know what happened. The Big Guy retired and Big Chief
Triangle took a year off _ at least _ from coaching. Then the
dominoes fell. Scottie Pippen went to Houston. Luc Longley and Joe
Kleine went to Phoenix. Jud Buechler went to Detroit. Steve Kerr
went to San Antonio. Dennis Rodman went to Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   All but Rodman should be in the postseason again. All could go
home ringless for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   They've kept in touch. They've watched the disintegration from
afar. They've reminisced about the glory years. They know it will
never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that all of us left made it easier, I think,'' Kerr
was saying from Vancouver this past week. ``If I had been the only
one, it would have been harder. But they really broke up that team
and the core has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Chicago general manager Jerry Krause knows what he has in
mind for the Bulls and, based on what we see, he must know
something no one else does. The Bulls didn't want to become the
Celtics. They didn't. They became the Clippers. Or worse. We all
expected a dropoff, but did we think they'd be this bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to believe that this is what they wanted; I
refuse to believe that,'' Kleine said. ``It's kind of shocking. I
was in Boston when they started to go down, but they had a reason _
injuries. Without those injuries, they'd have competed in the '90s.
That's a gamble they took and I think it was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Bulls used to be a joy. Now it's eye pollution. The
Bulls are en route to becoming the lowest-scoring team since the
advent of the shot clock in 1954. They're averaging about 5 points
a game less than anyone else and threatening to become the first
team since the 1961 Celtics to shoot less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics reveal only what's happening on the court. To the
ex-Bulls, the parting was also the end of a lifestyle. They've had
to become normal NBA players again, if there is such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all living in a fantasy in Chicago,'' said Buechler,
who told of how he would call a restaurant when the team was on the
road and ask the manager if a table could be set aside so the Bulls
could eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're thinking Michael, Scotty, and Dennis,'' said Buechler.
``Meanwhile, it's me, Steve Kerr and the trainer. They're like,
`Anybody else?' But we always had a great table.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``It was a great thing to be a part of, the whole
experience of being on that team. Those memories are the most
important thing. I have great feelings about Chicago. My last game,
we won the world championship. That's something I'm always going to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something they'll all have.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ballots for league awards are due Sunday. For the first time
since 1985-86, we won't have a Bull winning a single postseason
honor. As always, there is plenty of room for debate on just about
every choice. Here's my ballot and the reasons for the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Most Valuable Player: Tim Duncan, San Antonio. ``I would vote
for him, too, if I had a vote, but maybe I'm a little biased,''
Kerr says. ``He's awesome.'' This was basically a three-man race
among Duncan, Karl Malone, and Alonzo Mourning, all of whom are
worthy. They're 1-2-3 on my ballot, with Allen Iverson and Chris
Webber rounding out the top five. Duncan has become the leader and
conscience of a very good San Antonio team. Sure, he has help, but
so do the others. In a couple of years, this could be his league
and you might even see him on national television when the Lakers
aren't busy.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year: Jason Williams, Sacramento. This also is a
three-man race, with Paul Pierce and the likely winner, Vince
Carter. Williams, however, plays the toughest position of the
three, has had more responsibility, and likely has taken his team
into the postseason. That's good enough for me. Plus, he's done the
impossible: He's made the Kings a must-see team. Eventually, cable
got the message. NBC still prefers the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Jerry Sloan, Utah. When is this guy going to
get his due? All he does is win. Pat Riley was my original choice,
but how can you vote for a guy who goes 0-3 against the Celtics?
Mike Dunleavy is another good choice, but he had a young, intact
team and the best schedule. I say it's time to reward Sloan, who,
heading into the final weekend, again had the team with the best
record.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth Man Award: Rasheed Wallace, Portland. Someone on this team
has to be rewarded; why not this guy? It speaks to the main reasons
for the Blazers' success this season: depth, unselfishness, and
versatility. Wallace didn't pout when he was removed from the
starting lineup. He became an incendiary force off the bench.
That's what sixth men are supposed to do. Darrell Armstrong (see
below) and Jalen Rose should also get serious support.
</P>
<P>
   Most Improved Player: Darrell Armstrong, Orlando. He'll get a
lot of votes for sixth man, but he's also back in the starting
lineup. What he's really done is elevate his game exponentially,
and that's the kind of thing that gets you this award. Alas, he
should be wary. Of the last 11 winners, only one is still with the
team for which he played in his coming-out season (last year's
winner, Alan Henderson) and a handful are either out of the game or
were injured and didn't play this season, including Pervis Ellison
and Gheorghe Muresan.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive Player of the Year: Alonzo Mourning, Miami. He keeps
it in the Georgetown family, taking it from two-time defender
Dikembe Mutombo. 'Zo has finally put it all together this season at
both ends. He's a big reason why the Heat are one of the best
defensive teams of the season when they play anyone other than the
Celtics. Miami has been at or near the top all season for fewest
points allowed and defensive field goal percentage. That's 'Zo's
turf.
</P>
<P>
   All-NBA teams. There are obvious choices here, but one criterion
I try to use is whether the player's numbers mean anything if his
team stinks. This is known as the Antoine Walker Rule. As this was
written, all 15 players were either guaranteed to be in the
playoffs or were close.
</P>
<P>
   First team: Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Alonzo Mourning, Jason
Kidd, Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Second team: Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Shaquille O'Neal, Allen
Iverson, Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Third team: Kevin Garnett, Brian Grant, Hakeem Olajuwon, John
Stockton, Anfernee Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning is overdue for an appearance on any All-NBA team; he's
never made one. Ditto for Kidd. There were some tough omissions
(Antonio McDyess, Tim Hardaway, Ray Allen), but what's striking is
the number of future Hall of Famers/Dream Teamers who aren't here.
Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, David Robinson, and
Mitch Richmond are all out. Pippen has made one of the teams every
year since 1992 and Richmond has been a staple since 1994. Ewing,
however, has made only one All-NBA team since 1993 (the second in
1997) while Barkley hasn't been on any All-NBA team since 1996.
Grant was a sentimental pick; someone from Portland deserves a
selection and he epitomizes what the Trail Blazers are all about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey isn't campaigning to have the ``interim'' dropped from
his job title, but he wouldn't mind if the Nets just went out and
did it on their own. Unless the Nets can get Phil Jackson, who
sounds happy matching guitar riffs with Robbie Robertson at
Woodstock, why not keep Case? The players like him, he's the
anti-Calipari and he knows the drill. Casey also says he has had no
problems with Stephon Marbury or, even more important, any of the
Marbury entourage, which can be considerable. ``I like him,'' Casey
said of Marbury. ``I think when he first came here, he was
bewildered. First, he got traded. Then, there was a coaching
change. He didn't know me. I didn't know him. But he's been great.
He has won over the older guys. He's a talented kid and he does a
number of good things on offense and defense.'' Casey said Marbury
has been under more pressure lately because the offense goes
through him now almost exclusively . . . Rick Pitino says he has a
budget for next year that will approximate the salary cap plus the
veteran exception. That adds up to around $36 million. The Celtics
already are committed to spending more than $40 million and then
will have to make decisions on Tony Battie (unless he's traded) and
Ron Mercer (unless he goes elsewhere). The Celtics' cap figure for
next year is around $44 million because Dino Radja's money is still
on the books and not all of Dwayne Schintzius's $1.5 million (yup,
that's right) is guaranteed . . . The Western Conference is in for
a doozy of a finish for the final three playoff spots. A .500
record might not be good enough. The team that looks to be in
trouble is the Timberwolves, who finish on the road at Houston and
Phoenix. Seattle has two of its three at home and closes with games
against Dallas and the Clippers. Sacramento has it even better:
home games with Phoenix and Vancouver and a roadie at Denver. As
for Phoenix, it has a biggie Sunday in Arco Arena, its only visit
to Sacramento . . . Kerr almost has disappeared in San Antonio. He,
Buechler, Longley, and Pippen are discovering that the Bulls play
one way, and the rest of the NBA plays another way. Chicago still
uses the triangle offense, which is almost antithetical, some
coaches would say heretical, to the boring, dump-it-in, post-up,
reverse the ball, stand-around style that everyone else uses.
``It's a unique way to play, that's for sure,'' Kerr said . . .
Jerry West nearly quit the Lakers last year, or threatened to, and
was rewarded with a huge contract extension that kicks in next
season. However, several NBA people say West is so fed up with what
has gone on this season that he'll resign and leave Jerry Buss's
money on the table. Buss ignored West's pleas to extend or fire Del
Harris last summer. Then, when it was clear Harris had to go, he
turned to someone with no head coaching experience, Kurt Rambis, to
oversee the circus. The Rodman fiasco was all Buss's doing; West
stayed away from that as if it were the Ebola virus. He then made a
trade that, in the short run, has totally backfired. West has not
been visible at a Lakers game for almost a month, and when he ran
into reporters last week, he said simply, ``Blame me.''

BUCKS STAY ON ROAD TO PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No Glenn Robinson. No Dell Curry. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Bucks, minus their top rebounder and scorer in
Robinson and the league's best 3-point shooter in Curry, rallied
from a 16-point deficit in the first quarter to knock off the
Celtics, 88-79, at the FleetCenter Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory before a crowd of 18,089 ended Milwaukee's
seven-game road losing streak, enabled the Bucks to sweep a season
series from Boston for the first time since 1970-71, and, most
important, solidify their already strong hold on a playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big thing is to get to the playoffs, and the door to them
is still open,'' said Bucks coach George Karl. ``It's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, who play Monday in New York then wind up their
season Wednesday at home against Charlotte, were up, 49-43, at the
break, but came out cold in the third quarter and stayed that way.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino's boys scored 30 points in the first quarter, which
equaled their entire output in the second half; a half in which the
Bucks turned up the defensive pressure and turned over the
basketball just twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half, we were real sloppy,'' said the Bucks' Armon
Gilliam. ``I don't want to make any excuses, but we got in at 4
a.m. I think that had to do with part of our slow start.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the way they finished that counted.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen's 3-pointer put the Bucks ahead for good, 55-52, and
Chris Gatling punished the Celtics under the offensive glass for a
crucial stretch of the third quarter. The visitors held a 71-65
lead after three, thanks in large part to the Celtics shooting 5
for 15 from the field and the Bucks 12 for 25. The Celtics not only
had trouble shooting in the quarter, but also in holding on to it _
seven turnovers for 10 Bucks points.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a great victory (in Miami Thursday), this is a
disappointing loss,'' said Pitino. ``Their half-court trap hurt us
a little bit. We didn't do what we did against Miami _ reverse the
basketball, make the extra pass, and get good, strong moves to the
basket. But we forced 14 turnovers at halftime and ended up with
only 16 and that's extremely disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell, just off the injured list, took Marlon Garnett into
the paint and hit a jumper for a 67-61 lead. He then closed out the
quarter with a 15-foot jumper after Dana Barros coughed the ball up
at midcourt. Paul Pierce's 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter
cut the deficit to 71-68, but Ron Mercer's turnover was followed by
an Allen jumper and a 5-point Bucks lead.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had a game-high 26 points, wouldn't let the Bucks
wilt: When Barros canned a 3-pointer, he came right back with a
rainbow for a 75-71 lead midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam's free throws upped it to 77-71 and after a Celtics
miss, Michael Curry converted two more freebies for 79-71 lead with
4:52 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's slam with 3:36 to go gave Milwaukee its first
double-digit lead and the Celtics drought continued. They scored
just 8 points in the first nine minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we weren't scoring it was hard to step up our press,''
said Mercer, who led the Celtics with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were clearly more energized early in the game. The
Bucks clutched and grabbed their way to passing the personal foul
limit with five minutes to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Pierce freebies made it 18-10 and when Barros hit two
3-pointers, sandwiched around a Pierce steal at midcourt, it was a
24-10 Celtics lead with 3:22 to go. Time out, Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   A Pair of Mercer hoops made it 28-12 _ the Celtics' high-water
mark _ before Allen answered with a long 3-pointer and top of the
key jumper.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Mercer baskets kept the lead respectable, but a
Cassell 3-point play got the Bucks to within 34-28 and when Vinny
Del Negro swished a trey, the Celtics lead was down to 36-31.

BOSTON CASTAWAY GORING TURNS UP ON ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His trademark, beyond that flimsy toy helmet, was his
relentless skating, not to mention an accurate pair of hands that
were good for 888 career points.
</P>
<P>
   But Butch Goring was accomplished in the back end of the ice,
too, which for years made him the defensive dose of reality in that
Points 'R Us lineup in Los Angeles, and then made him the
stabilizing, two-way pivot who helped the Islanders to their four
Stanley Cup championships in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen years after getting sacked as coach of the
Bruins, the 49-year-old Goring returned to the NHL Friday as the
new boss behind the Islander bench. Given the Isles' woes of late
(five straight seasons, no playoffs), he may want to find a thicker
helmet for his new endeavor. Either way, it's good to see another
good head back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream come true,'' Goring said at his news
conference on Long Island. ``I'm going to coach this team the way I
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring's sentiments were similar when he followed Gerry Cheevers
and Harry Sinden to the throne here in the Hub in the fall of '85.
Claimed on waivers by the Bruins that January, when Cheevers was
still coach, Goring was behind the bench come September, another
ex-Bruin immediately made head coach without so much as a moment's
worth of coaching experience. Imagine what would play on the silver
screen if Hollywood chose its directors so cavalierly. He was
willing, but unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Goring was fired early in his second season in Boston and has
spent the better part of a decade-plus coaching in the minors,
relentlessly pursuing a return to the bigs. Rumored as a possible
candidate for the vacant Los Angeles coaching job, he was in
Edmonton scouting the NHL playoffs last week when Islander GM Mike
Milbury called him for an interview on Long Island. By Thursday
night, Goring had a three-year deal worth $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch,'' said Milbury, the former Bruin
defenseman/coach/assistant GM, ex-Boston College coach, and former
broadcaster, ``has Islander blood.''
</P>
<P>
   That orange-and-blue hemoglobin and hype aside, Goring, more
importantly, was twice named the International Hockey League's
coach of the year _ after directing the Utah Grizzlies to
championships in '95 and '96. He knows what he's doing. He'll no
doubt run efficient practices and keep that controlled effective
distance between bench and player that was so much Al Arbour's
stamp when ``Radar'' was masterminding the Islander bench in their
glory years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Goring said Nov. 6, 1986, the day after he
was fired by the Bruins immediately following a loss in Buffalo.
``I'm mad. Hockey's certainly not fair and this is not fair. This
is no easy pill to swallow. And I don't think gassing me is the
answer. But we'll never know, I guess.''
</P>
<P>

   The Flyers sometimes call in David Scott, a sports psychologist,
to help flex their cerebral muscles. The good doc likes to inject
some wit. He recently held a team viewing of the '70s favorite,
``Monty Python and the Holy Grail,'' in which a battling knight
utters, ``It's only a flesh wound!'' as his limbs are hacked off,
one by one . . . Ex-Sabre Matthew Barnaby, now with the Penguins,
traded some verbal shots with Devils tough guy Lyle Odelein early
in the Pittsburgh-New Jersey series. It began when Barnaby referred
to Odelein as ``Cornelius,'' a reference to one of the lead
characters in ``Planet of the Apes.'' Odelein returned fire with
disparaging words about Barnaby's wife, saying she is ``God-awful
to look at.'' Wonder what page of the NHLPA Good Vibes &AMP;
Brotherhood Handbook covers those kinds of salutations . . .
Vancouver GM Brian Burke disagrees with the suggestion here to
disallow icing the puck during penalty-killing situations, a rule
change that would result in an immediate whistle and a faceoff in
the defensive end _ all aimed at increasing scoring via more
power-play goals. ``Too drastic,'' said Burke. ``It would kill the
balance of power in the game, and give far too much of an advantage
to teams with strong power plays.'' Burke doesn't believe the game
needs more scoring. Case in point: the Bruins-Hurricanes series.
Burke: ``What tremendous entertainment _ lots of hitting, great
scoring chances _ and no one cares that the goals are down. It's
just great hockey. It just goes to show, once more, that the best
playoffs in all pro sports are in the NHL. This is my feeling about
more goal scoring: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' . . . Jaromir
Jagr exited the Penguins-Devils series with what was reported as a
groin pull after Game 1. But Devils forward Bobby Holik has learned
not to trust injury reports during the playoffs. ``Unless a guy has
a broken arm,'' said Holik, ``and you can see it hanging off his
body.'' Yeah, just a flesh wound. Jagr, by the way, tried to hurry
back to Pittsburgh to visit an acupuncturist, but returned to the
team hotel after spending nine hours at Newark Airport, unable to
catch a flight . . . The Oilers were swept out of the first round
by Dallas, prompting Edmonton boss Glen Sather to ask coach Ron Low
if he wanted to come back next season _ not exactly a vote of
confidence. If Low gets the gate, look for ex-Oiler defenseman
Kevin Lowe to land the job. Lowe on such a prospect: ``I don't even
want to touch that. My hopes are, quite frankly, to keep working
with Ron next season.'' . . . Mike Smith made it known in Toronto
that he'll give the front office two weeks after the Leafs' season
ends to decide whether they want him as GM.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABC/Disney/ESPN wants to hire the recently retired Wayne Gretzky
as a broadcast commentator for next season. The Great One's dad,
Walter, said the day his son retired that he doubted Wayne would
find a liking for mike work: ``He'd have to be at a certain place
at a certain time to do that. Wayne's never played the game that
way.'' . . . No surprise, of course, that the Hockey Hall of Fame
took another step toward adding Gretzky this summer, far ahead of
the standard three-year waiting period. As for what sweater he'll
be depicted in when enshrined, the suggestion here is to place the
NHL shield on his chest, and festoon it with the smaller logos of
Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis, and New York. The league as much
as invited that when it proclaimed the afternoon of his last game
that Gretzky's No. 99 would never be worn again in the NHL . . .
Gotta like the Kansas City Blades running a ``Toothless Night''
promotion. Anyone who sported the gapped look got in for free. In
all, 269 walked through the wickets at no charge and 49 got in at
half-price. The 50 percent discount went to those who only had a
chipped tooth or two. Must have been a big night, too, at the
candy-apple counter . . . Will NHL players be seen at the 2002
Olympics in Salt Lake City? USA Hockey was hoping to hear from the
NHL about now, but the International Ice Hockey Federation recently
told the NHL it could wait on its decision until August . . . Race
relations took another hit in the NHL last week when Flyer tough
guy Sandy McCarthy, his father black and his mother a Native
American, accused Leafs pugilist Tie Domi of ``dropping the
n-word'' on him. Domi denied using the racial slur. The blend of
the league is such, said Flyer netminder John Vanbiesbrouck, that
``people are always picking on you . . . you are the Russian or the
Czech, or you are the Indian or the Chief. We are living in a
stereotyped world, when nicknames come before names, and that
sometimes leads to other things.'' . . . The Flyers haven't suited
up defenseman Luke Richardson in the Toronto series. Two years ago,
he was playing 28 minutes a night for the Oilers in their
postseason series with the Stars. From 28 to zero in two years. And
remember, the Flyers wooed him away from Edmonton with a five-year
deal worth $12.5 million. Ouch . . . Word around Chicago is that
the Hawks will part with 33-year-old Bob Probert, once the most
fearsome dude on double-runners before falling into the addiction
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   The Senators had, and still have, a talented team. But their
four-game sweep by the Sabres in Round 1 proved once more that
skill is only part of the postseason equation. They'll have to
improve on both size and grit over the summer if they're going to
think about making a serious run. When it was clear in Game 1 that
their top gun, Alexei Yashin, couldn't shake superchecker Michael
Peca, the series was effectively placed in Dominik Hasek's pocket.
``They don't have any physical defensemen or other people (i.e.
enforcers) in their lineup,'' said Peca. The good news for the
Senators: It's a whole lot easier to stock grit and muscle than to
go out and find a half-dozen or so skilled shooters . . . There was
nothing in the Red Wings-Ducks series, a 4-0 Detroit sweep, that
would make anyone think the Wings will be deterred from a third
straight Cup (the first threepeat since the Islanders won four
straight, 1980-83). One big key to their success has been the
defensive pairing of Nicklas Lidstrom and Chris Chelios, perhaps
the most menacing blue line tandem in the game (Lidstrom had been
with Larry Murphy). It takes a lot of the sting out of losing Uwe
Krupp to a back injury. Signed to a four-year, $16 million free
agent deal last summer, Krupp collected all of 5 points this season
_ only 2 more than Red Wings goalie Chris Osgood . . . Eric Lindros
is back on skates, joining the Flyers in noncontact drills. His
blood level is still down by 10 percent (he lost three liters when
his lung collapsed) and his weight is around 227 pounds (10 under
his playing level), but he remains hopeful of playing in Round 2 if
the Flyers advance . . . Flyer coach Roger Neilson, amid claims
that Philly was roughing up Toronto netminder Curtis Joseph,
reminisced last week about his days as Vancouver coach when Canucks
tough guy Tiger Williams took on Islander netminder Battlin' Billy
Smith in the '82 Cup finals. ``I'm going to get him,'' said
Williams, tired of Smith's repeated slashes. ``Just watch.''
Neilson picks up the story: ``The next thing, I look over, and
Tiger's on top of him. Billy wore a chain around his neck and Tiger
grabbed it and just started choking him.'' Ah, whatever happened to
old time hockey . . . USA Hockey, located in Colorado Springs, will
hire a public relations/marketing intern this summer, a spot opened
up in memory of Brian Fishman, a 28-year-old staff member who died
in January of carbon monoxide poisoning. The ideal candidate would
be a graduating college senior interested in the sports
PR/marketing field. If interested, write Brian Fishman Internship
Program, USA Hockey, 1775 Bob Johnson Drive, Colorado Springs, CO
80906.

DAVID DUKE MISSES LOUISIANA RUNOFF BUT HAS STRONG SHOWING 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   METAIRIE, La. _ Despite having five viable and conservative
alternatives, one of every five voters in Louisiana's 1st
Congressional District voted on Saturday for David E. Duke, a
former Ku Klux Klan leader and self-styled defender of the rights
of European-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, a Republican, fell just short of qualifying for a May 29
runoff for the seat vacated by Robert L. Livingston, who stunned
his constituents late last year by acknowledging extramarital
affairs and resigning just as he was about to become speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Treen, a former governor and congressman, and state
Rep. David Vitter finished atop the nine-person field but neither
won the majority needed to avoid a runoff. Both are Republicans,
insuring that the party will regain the 12-seat majority it held in
the House before Livingston's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Treen finished with 25 percent, followed by Vitter with 22
percent and Duke with 19 percent. Polls had shown Duke with about
half that amount, and the result vindicated his assertion that he
flies under the radar of conventional public opinion research.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's surprisingly strong showing caused some anxiety during
the night for establishment Republican leaders who feared that a
Duke victory, or even a place in the runoff, would deeply embarrass
a party that is trying to broaden its appeal, particularly with
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sweating bullets,'' said Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep.
W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, the Republican dean of Louisiana's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Following Duke was Monica L. Monica, a Republican
ophthalmologist, who finished fourth with 16 percent, despite
spending more than $1.2 million, most of it her own. State Rep.
Bill Strain, a conservative Democrat who seemed to take votes from
Duke, finished fifth with 11 percent and Rob Couhig, a Republican
lawyer and the owner of New Orleans' minor league baseball team,
had 6 percent. Three fringe candidates shared the rest of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana has an unusual open primary system that allows
Republicans and Democrats to run against one another in a first
primary. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two finishers
compete in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff will highlight the stylistic differences between
Treen, 70, the first Republican since Reconstruction to represent
this state in Congress or as governor, and Vitter, a 37-year-old
lawyer, Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar who has served for
eight years in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Treen cites his experience and relationships with congressional
leaders. He has been endorsed by Livingston and Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the majority leader. Vitter counters that Treen's age
may limit his ability to amass power in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which begins in the northern suburbs of New
Orleans and stretches across Lake Pontchartrain to the farms and
timberland along the Mississippi border, is considered the most
conservative and reliably Republican district in the state.
Eighty-five percent of the registered voters in the district are
white, and many have fled what they consider to be high crime and
inadequate schools in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Duke finished first in Tangipahoa Parish and a close second to
Strain in Washington Parish, both rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Duke won a legislative seat in 1989 and won more than half of
the white vote in losing races for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and for
governor in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Saturday night, Duke asserted that he would
have made the runoff if Strain had not been in the race. Susan E.
Howell, a political scientist at the University of New Orleans,
agreed. ``That Democrat saved the Republicans a significant
embarrassment,'' Ms. Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Howell, like other analysts of the race, said she was
surprised by Duke's showing because of the many other choices on
the ballot for conservative Republican voters. ``People over the
years have asked me what percentage of the vote in Louisiana or in
a district like the 1st is hard-core racist, and I never knew what
to say,'' Ms. Howell said. ``Now we know, and it's one out of
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, who calls in a new book for an Aryan resurgence and
voluntary homelands for minorities, said that his supporters were
aware of his past and his views. ``This has got to say something
very powerful about the issues I represent,'' he said. ``These
people did not go into this unaware.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while he had no immediate plans to wage another
campaign, he was ``absolutely committed to spending the rest of my
life as a spokesman for the rights of European-Americans.'' Phil
Baum, the executive director of the American Jewish Congress, said
he was particularly disturbed that Louisiana's Republican leaders,
including Gov. Mike Foster and state Republican Chairman Mike
Francis, had refused to join the party's national leadership in
denouncing Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Treen nor Vitter publicly repudiated Duke during the
campaign, although both criticized his views in interviews. Now
both must seek the votes of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Vitter, who hopes to paint Treen as a go-along Republican, said
Sunday that many voters supported Duke out of an ``underlying
frustration with the current congressional leadership that we're
not moving boldly on real tax reform and ending affirmative
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Treen commended Duke as a vigorous campaigner and maintained
that he won support by muting his views in this campaign. But in
fact, it is hard to imagine that Duke, who ran television
advertisements denouncing Kwanzaa and Malcolm X postage stamps,
could have been much more pointed.

 McLAREN ASSISTED BY DIVINE INTERVENTION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was going to be on his own. He was adamant about
that. Harry Sinden couldn't dissuade him, try as he did. The Bruins
president/general manager admired the kid's independent sense while
at the same time doubting his common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McLaren was, after all, barely 18 _ old enough to risk a
face full of stitches in the National Hockey League but not
necessarily capable of crossing the street in a strange city on his
own. There are certain NHL traditions, and one is that a teen
tenderfoot be billeted with a host family for a year or two, the
better to ease his transition to adulthood off the ice even as he's
being thrust into a man's job on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age,'' says Sinden, ``they're learning about life in
the NHL _ the travel, living in the big city, getting the proper
rest and diet. We suggested that he live with a family.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLaren, the Bruins' first draft pick (ninth overall) in
1995 and an instant revelation who had cracked the Boston defense
corps in his first camp, would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd like the challenge of being my own boss, taking
care of myself, getting to know the city,'' he recalls now, four
years later. ``And it was a huge adjustment _ the cooking, the
cleaning . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Bruins were willing to let McLaren burn the
occasional roast or overflow the washing machine a few times, they
have another tradition on which there is no room for compromise.
First-year defensemen generally are given a chaperone on the ice to
facilitate their education in the game's toughest position, like it
or not. And since McLaren's escort was Boston's defensive icon, Ray
Bourque, what wasn't to like?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the biggest influence in my hockey career,'' says
McLaren. ``I had the chance to play with him, learn from him, watch
him. He showed me what it takes to compete in games, to belong at
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   So well has Bourque advised and McLaren adhered that the protege
looms as the heir apparent to the father confessor.
</P>
<P>
   No one is planning a farewell tour for Bourque, 38, the 20-year
veteran who is under contract through next season and still is
performing like a thoroughbred while logging pack mule playing
time. The latest evidence was his 53 1/2-minute epic in Friday's
4-3 double-overtime win that gave the Bruins a 3-2 lead over the
Carolina Hurricanes in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference
quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   But pure chronological inevitability indicates that Bourque will
be gone sooner rather than later, and it stands to reason that the
6-foot-4-inch, 219-pound MacLaren, now an old-timer of 21, will
inherit the defensive mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that,'' says McLaren, who has graduated to a
defense pairing with Don Sweeney the past two seasons while Bourque
initiates Hal Gill. ``But I don't think I'm going to replace Ray by
myself. Here's a guy who's been around so long and done so much _
we'll need six guys to replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden feels comfortable with the probable chain of succession,
mindful that Boston's winning percentage this year was about .600
with McLaren in the lineup, and while he was missing 30 games
because of a contract holdout and later a shoulder injury, the
Bruins stumbled along at a .400 clip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was impossible to foresee this impact four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 18, they're pretty raw,'' Sinden says. ``It's really a
lottery. But Kyle was picked out by our chief scout at the time,
Bart Bradley, as the best player out there. And based on the
progress he's made the last two years, he's headed that way _ he
has all the capabilities to be the leader of the defense corps.
He's a real heavy hitter, and that sets a tone. He's good with the
puck, can make plays, and takes care of our end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very popular with his teammates, too. By example was the
way Ray led. In the last five years, he's become more of a
locker-room example. I can see Kyle assuming that role more quickly
than Ray did. He's more outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque himself endorses the eventual elevation of McLaren, of
whom he has been a fan and confidant from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie, I saw a player who had a lot of poise,'' says
Bourque. ``He's a big presence, a big guy, who plays good, strong
defense, makes big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren was born with the size. But developing into a true
presence was a slow evolution, and it was in this area that Bourque
proved indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt comfortable that he could ask me anything and
I'd listen,'' says Bourque, who was in the same situation as
McLaren at age 18. ``Here was a kid who was being asked to step in
and play regular minutes. There's a lot of pressure on you to play
as a veteran right away. I tried to emphasize consistency to him,
that he had to come out the same way every night. I told him to
relax, let the game come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand that McLaren may be Bourque's successor but he won't
be Bourque. He lacks the veteran's offensive flair _ ``I'm not an
80- or 90-point scorer,'' he says _ and nothing about his game hits
you over the head, except perhaps one of his frequent concussive
checks.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren works in the shadows, tending to the details that don't
make it to billboards but form the foundation of dependable
defense. This series has been no exception. Though McLaren was
partially culpable on Sami Kapanen's goal with 1:45 left in
regulation Friday that necessitated overtime _ and Bourque's
marathon _ he has been an invaluable contributor in subtle ways.
Whether he's thumping the likes of Carolina strong man Keith
Primeau or keeping the area around Byron Dafoe's net clear of
debris and danger or serving as an adjunct to Bourque on the
power-play point, he has been a model of reliability.
</P>
<P>
   It's the basics on which he prides himself. Given the choice
between flash and substance, McLaren says, ``I'd take solid. I love
hitting guys in the corner, playing defense. I'm not going to go on
offense like Ray or Paul Coffey. Maybe I'll make the occasional
great play. But if I can be a 30-point scorer and play great
defense, I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true stay-at-home defenseman.

BOURQUE TOOK LONG ROAD DOWN MEMORY LANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He thought about drawing a parallel, using a
nine-year-old example to help his teammates understand the wonder
of the situation they were in. He thought about dipping back into
his past, hard as it may have been, to make them realize that what
they were feeling at this moment was special. He thought about 1990
and all the emotions, the drama, the history.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Bruins captain Ray Bourque decided not to
mention the triple-overtime game against the Edmonton Oilers in
Game 1 of the 1990 Stanley Cup finals while his current teammates
were embroiled in an overtime contest of their own, against the
Carolina Hurricanes, in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference
quarterfinals Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bourque did what he's done for 20 years. He led by
example. When the Bruins looked in danger of being run over after
falling behind, 2-0, through two periods, it was Bourque who helped
bring them back. He scored 34 seconds into the third period to cut
the deficit in half. Darren Van Impe, assisted by Bourque, tied it
up at 1:59, and P.J. Axelsson gave Boston its first lead at 2:26.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Kapanen tied it with 1:45 left in regulation, but then it
was Bourque who assisted on Anson Carter's winning goal at 14:45 of
the second overtime. The Bruins are now up, three games to two,
with the series switching back to the FleetCenter, where they can
close it out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If you look back at that remarkable Edmonton game, it was
Bourque who brought the Bruins back to life then, too, scoring a
pair of third-period goals to send the game into extras. That game,
the longest in Stanley Cup finals history, lasted 115 minutes, 13
seconds and Bourque played a whopping 58:26 on that steamy May
night at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday against the Hurricanes, Bourque, nine years older,
played 53:26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go out there for another shift,'' said
Bourque, who had 57 tours of duty and was trying to recover from
one when the winning goal went in. ``I didn't see it. I just had my
head down and I was trying to rest for my next shift. I got my head
up and I see A.C. going for a dive. It was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the triple-overtime loss was the worst feeling.
That night, battling both exhaustion and dehydration from the
scorching heat and humidity inside the arena, Bourque felt fine
despite his workload _ at least until he had a chance to relax at
home. Then he began cramping everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was downstairs and I was trying to yell at my wife to help
me,'' he said, smiling at the memory. ``I couldn't get up the
stairs. It was like I was paralyzed. That was painful.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's game, Bourque said he felt fine again, for the
most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good up until the second overtime,'' he said. ``It was
tough but I think it was tough for a lot of people, not only for a
38-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's agenda was rest, a lot of water, even more massage,
and more rest to recover for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque understated his role in Friday's win. Both coaches had a
difficult time finding the praise for the job he did.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Paul Maurice was most impressed by Bourque's breaking
up of Martin Gelinas's bid on an open net at 5:14 of overtime No.
2. Goalie Byron Dafoe was out of the net, and Gelinas was staring
at an empty cage. Bourque got back first. Gelinas hit the puck, it
popped up, Bourque tried to whack Gelinas's stick, Gelinas hit the
puck again, and it bounced out of harm's way. It appeared that
Bourque had saved it with the shaft of his stick but Bourque said
he actually missed the puck as Gelinas hit it the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He double-hit it,'' said Bourque. ``He hit it forward and then
he hit it backward. We caught a huge break. I couldn't believe it.
I've done that on the golf course and then you look around and say,
`Did I just do that?' He couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice tipped his cap to the veteran who is six years the
coach's senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are star players, then there are the handful of special
players,'' said Maurice. ``Either he makes them happen or they
happen to (him) or it's the right person playing the right sport.
If you're from Boston, you're bored of it by now, you see it happen
enough. Those of us who get to enjoy something like that, we only
see it once in a while, thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston coach Pat Burns found Bourque's yeoman duty ``completely
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's game was not the Stanley Cup finals, nor was it a
series clincher, but it was clearly something special for Bourque,
and it reminded him of that wonderful, horrible game in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to mention that between periods,'' he said. ``I
didn't, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of funny to consider where some of his current
teammates were then.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McLaren was 12 years old. Sergei Samsonov was 11. Joe
Thornton was, yikes, 10. Dmitri Khristich was playing his second
full year for Sokol Kiev of the Russian League.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, too, remembers that year well. He was coaching the
Montreal Canadiens, who had been steamrolled by Boston in five
games in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie coincidence comes in the form of defenseman Glen
Wesley. It was Wesley who missed an open net for Boston in the
second overtime in that Edmonton game. On Friday night, Wesley, who
is now playing for Carolina, hit the crossbar 2:21 into the first
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The only Bruins player other than Bourque who remains from the
1990 game is defenseman Don Sweeney, who was just 23 then. One of
the enduring images in the aftermath of that game was a photo of
Sweeney, sitting on the ice, legs outstretched, his back against
the boards, his tongue sticking out in exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   That triple-OT win was the springboard Edmonton used to win the
Stanley Cup, which they skated around the Garden a few nights
later. Mark Messier, the Oilers captain, carried the hardware
around Bourque's rink and soon was presented with the Hart Trophy
as the league's MVP, an honor many felt Bourque deserved. Bruins
president/general manager Harry Sinden was one of those who thought
Bourque was robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's dream is still to win that Cup, and Friday's victory
is another step toward that goal. As long as they are still
playing, there is always a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge win for us,'' he said. ``It's the first time some
of these guys won a double-overtime game. It puts us in the
driver's seat. I've been saying the whole series, this is so
important for the young guys in this room just to get a taste of
how you have to battle to get through a series and it's so tough
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, Bourque's teammates will want to ask him about that
game.

LATEST HEROICS SHOW TEAM MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the risk of playing the race card _ gotcha reading
hockey now, don't I? _ the fact that Anson Carter is black has
absolutely nothing to do with his heroics Friday night in
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   But the added fact that no one from around here has done
anything bigger on ice since maybe Mike Eruzione or Nancy Kerrigan
makes the fact that he is black worth talking about only because it
fits the crazy mosaic that's going on here in the Hub of Hockey
right now.
</P>
<P>
   It's just different. That's all I'm saying. It's all very
different.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, what could be more upside-down, inside-out and contrary
to the way hockey usually goes around here _ contrary to the way
all sports go around and around and around here _ than looking up
after midnight and seeing a black kid in a Boston uniform score a
huge goal in overtime at Greensboro, N.C., and all but clinch a
playoff series? Whew. Pause here and use that sentence to catch
your breath. Here in the land of let's be individuals, let's be
new, refreshing, and out of the ordinary, you're telling me you've
got better than that? No you don't.
</P>
<P>
   We in the sports department have an overused habit of
highlighting key words in italic print when we want to drive a
point home. In the above paragraph, that would mean putting the
italics to just about every word.
</P>
<P>
   The hour was late.
</P>
<P>
   The locale was not exactly Original Six stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is obviously not what you'd call cut from the same ol'
bolt of cloth. In case you didn't notice, No. 33 in the Black 'n
Gold looks a lot more like Bill Russell than Billy O'Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone worth the spoked B on his or her needlepointed pillow
knows that the Bruins, the playoffs, and overtime fit together like
Harry Sinden and the chapter chairman of the Up With Spending
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you don't understand all that, here's what I want you
do. Put down this paper, find a Bruins fan, and count the time
between saying, ``Petr Klima,'' and he or she begins spewing
invectives the way Linda Blair went projectile in ``The Exorcist.''
It just hasn't been a pretty sight around here in the spring once
the hockey clock goes beyond 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But with 5:15 remaining in the second overtime Friday night,
Carter put a chink in our thick Calvinist flak jacket. With help
from Ray Bourque (there, some things remain the same), and Jumbo
Joe Thornton, Carter swooped in on goaltender Arturs Irbe (hey,
find a name like that in a Toronto-Montreal summary, circa 1957)
and stepped through the looking glass into a fairytale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not my best move,'' Carter would say after lifting the Bruins
to a 4-3 victory with his neat little backhand tuck at the left
post. ``I've got something even a little better than that in my bag
of tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Carter's got better than that? I'm getting woozy.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody better give this guy a Billy Buckner reality check. How
'bout we get Mike Torrez to swing by the Vault Sunday night prior
to the Bruins facing Carolina in Game 6, and remind Mr. Carter that
things are just never that good. Not here in the Hub of Horror. If
you've got something better, and you're keeping it hidden under the
table, up your sleeve, or tucked away in the barn rafters with your
'63 Mantle card, you go with it and go with it now, baby.
</P>
<P>
   What are you saying, tomorrow? Tomorrow around here is used for
explaining what went wrong yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know about having something better. What we know,
Chicken Little, is that the sky always falls with a thud in our
ballparks and arenas. After the crash, we shovel, we plant, we talk
about next year. As sure as Carl Yastrzemski and Luis Aparicio once
turned base-running into bumper cars, we know that's true. As sure
as Don Cherry could have used a Hooked on Numerals crash course, we
know that the feeling of control is just a Satanic deception, so
much straw over the trap door to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, we knew that Babe Ruth had an OK swing. But who wanted to
take the big fella out of the rotation? No one around here.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Carter. He's different, for reasons as obvious as the
way he looks and as subtle as the way he talks. He's a decent
player, not great, with shooting, passing, and skating skills that
range from middle of the pack to slightly better in the NHL. His
greatest single attribute thus far, in his 26 months as a Bruins
employee, is that his learning curve keeps meandering upward. It's
not something you see shift to shift, but it seems like in six- to
eight-week chunks he keeps getting a little bit better. One minute
his shot doesn't look like it can break tissue paper. The next
minute, he's potting the winner with the finesse of Jean Ratelle.
</P>
<P>
   He's just that kind of athlete that, if he took up pole vaulting
tomorrow, he'd barely be able to clear the counter at Pizza Hut. A
month later, he'd be springing over the Leaning Tower of Pisa and
landing with a theory on how to make the thing stand straight.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is cocky, self-assured, but not boastful. He's probably
got it in his head that he can be another Mike Bossy. I don't think
he's got that kind of skill, but I am the same guy who figured the
Senators and Avalanche would battle it out in the Cup final this
year. The Senators now are golfing. The Avalanche, like their name,
are rolling downhill fast.
</P>
<P>
   Carter talks in a soft voice and dresses like a baseball player
on offdays, with ballcap turned around backward and oversized chain
swinging freely across a T-shirt. Parkie, Cheesie, and Doakie never
saw such a sight. He puts on his sunglasses and you'd swear he took
the wrong exit off Storrow Drive and is running late for batting
practice at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins can clinch a playoff series Sunday, something they
haven't done since 1994. That's different. And they're in this
position, in large part, because they've got this black kid from
Toronto skating the wing, having a blast, sometimes looking like
the most out-of-place person you've ever seen in a Bruins uniform,
other times looking as normal as Springsteen drooped on a mike with
guitar slung over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It's different. Most of all, it's fun. And we don't get to say
that all that often around here.

THIRD TIME ISN'T CHARM FOR BAFFERT 
</HEADLINE>
 DERBY-BAFFERT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Three was one too many.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert flirted with history Saturday as he sent out
three starters in an attempt to become the first to train three
consecutive winners of the Kentucky Derby. But for a man who talks
often about believing in fate, it wasn't meant be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was trouble on the first turn, there were too many
horses,'' said Baffert. ``The first turn is tough, but, what can
you do? You can't keep horses out of the Derby. My horses tried to
run late, but it wasn't enough. I'm just glad the Lewises won. You
can't win them all. We'll just regroup and come back for the next
one. That's all you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to act. We're sort of lost souls. We didn't
have any luck, three horses and so much traffic. Prime Timber ran a
good race, but Excellent Meeting ran the best of all my horses. She
was dead last and she was coming best at the end. General Challenge
had a horrible trip, just a horrible trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Beverly Lewis have two trainers, D. Wayne Lukas, who
trained Charismatic to victory Saturday, and Baffert, who trained
their Silver Charm to a Derby win in 1997. While Charismatic, a
former claimer, ran into the winner's circle, Baffert's entrants
ran fourth (Prime Timber); fifth (the filly Excellent Meeting), and
11th (General Challenge). While there wasn't a pebble in Baffert's
path when Silver Charm and Real Quiet (1998) captured the Run for
The Roses, his horses had some problems Saturday and their jockeys
told a tale of woe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a horrible trip,'' said Kent Desormeaux, who rode
Excellent Meeting. ``We got pinched back leaving the gate, and then
the horses in front were getting shuffled back, and I ended up last
when she wants to go. I literally galloped her to the three-eighths
pole. The horse on my outside finally turned me loose, and she went
under the wire full of run. She never took a deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the trip was for Excellent Meeting, it was worse for
General Challenge, the other member of the Golden Eagle Farm entry
that was coupled as the 7-2 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my worst trip ever in horse racing,'' said Gary
Stevens, who was aboard General Challenge. ``We got away from the
gate not too bad, I did get bumped out of there but not too bad.
Then when I went up into the first turn, I was down there between
Charismatic and Prime Timber and they put the squeeze on me. They
picked me up and carried me about four strides. I don't know how I
didn't fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when I was over on the far turn, I got hit again. I
finally got him out and made a little late run, but by then it
didn't much matter. Today, we got a nightmare trip. You had people
running over each other trying to get positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a horse like mine, who is hard to contain back off the
pace, it just turned into a disaster. That was the roughest Derby
I've ever ridden. But it was nobody's fault. It's just racing.''
</P>
<P>
   David Flores, aboard Prime Timber, had the least trouble of the
Baffert contingent, but it was no stroll in the park for him
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little tough there, but I was feeling good about my
chances,'' said Flores. ``I had to use him to get into position,
then they ran away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber will go to the Preakness at Pimlico May 15, and
Silverbulletday, who won the Kentucky Oaks on Friday in grand
style, may go to the Preakness, as well. ``Excellent Meeting and
General Challenge go back to California,'' said Baffert. ``Prime
Timber goes to the Preakness, and I'm considering Silvebulletday,
as well. I'm just disappointed my horses didn't get the chance to
run in the Derby. I knew we were dead at the first turn. Now, I
won't have to worry about the Triple Crown this year.''

ANALYSIS: RUSSIA STAKES ITS PRESTIGE ON BALKAN DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ By dispatching his special envoy to
Washington for talks on ending the Yugoslav conflict, President
Boris Yeltsin has put Russia at the center of international
diplomacy, reviving relations with Washington and NATO. Perhaps
more to the point for Yeltsin, it also plays well at home.
</P>
<P>
   The move has quieted the hard-line critics who have lamented
Moscow's dwindling influence, and has even enabled the president to
settle a few scores with some of his political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that it remains unclear whether the Kremlin has
real influence over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
whether it is willing to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have been knocking at the door and demanding to
be treated as an important player,'' said Toby T. Gati, a former
senior State Department official. ``Now they have got the biggest
welcome they can have: the welcome at the White House. But this is
a high-stakes game. The question is whether they can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   An initial answer may come Monday afternoon when Viktor
Chernomyrdin _ the former prime minister whom Yeltsin fired last
year and then tried unsuccessfully to rehire _ meets with President
Clinton. Yeltsin suggested the meeting in a 15-minute telephone
call to Clinton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yeltsin had compelling reasons to plunge into Balkan
diplomacy. Since NATO's bombs first started raining down on
Yugoslavia more than five weeks ago, the Kremlin has been on the
political defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists have charged that the NATO raids show how weak
and marginalized Russia has become on Yeltsin's watch. Hard-liners
have demanded that the Kremlin provide military assistance to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Such a step would frustrate Yeltsin's longstanding policy of
maintaining a good working relationship with the West, no small
consideration for a nation still sorely in need of billions of
dollars in credits from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Yeltsin sought to fend off his critics by turning up
the anti-NATO rhetoric. Russian officials denounced the allied air
strikes in vitriolic terms, warning that the military campaign
might even spark a third world war. When it came to deeds, however,
the Kremlin was careful to stay clear of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, that approach merely reinforced the
perception that Russia was powerless to end the fighting. Neither
NATO nor Belgrade seemed to care very much what Moscow thought.
</P>
<P>
   So Yeltsin switched his strategy. He appointed Chernomyrdin
special envoy on the Yugoslav conflict and sent him to Belgrade in
search of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a cut-throat world of Russian politics, the Chernomyrdin
appointment also served another purpose. It enabled Yeltsin to
diminish the political role of Yevgeni Primakov, Yeltsin's current
prime minister and a former foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has become increasingly unhappy with the ambitious
Primakov, who has done little to pull Russia out of its economic
morass while seeking to position himself as a potential successor
to the ailing president.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Chernomyrdin's diplomacy is simply a
matter of political theater. Russia has a genuine stake in
brokering a settlement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air strikes have dragged on, there has been increasing
talk in allied capitals of a possible land offensive. A NATO ground
assault to seize Kosovo would further inflame anti-Western opinion
in Moscow and renew the bitter criticism at home of Yeltsin's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Brokering an agreement, however, is the hard part. As Russian
officials see it, Chernomyrdin has several important strengths,
including a good working relationship with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating a settlement might also help Chernomyrdin revive his
moribund political career, though almost certainly not to the point
where it would make him a plausible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chernomyrdin's mission is heavy with political risks.
Having claimed the world spotlight, Russia has staked its prestige
on diplomacy. If it fails to make headway, Russia may soon find
itself back on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the issues are still formidable. NATO and
Belgrade have been far apart on the main issues, including the
alliance's demand that NATO troops be deployed in Kosovo to protect
ethnic Albanians and that all Serb forces be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Another divisive question concerns the final political status of
the Kosovo region. NATO is proposing that it be an
``internationally protected area'' that is only nominally within
Yugoslavia. Belgrade wants clearer administrative responsibility
over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear that Moscow and Washington agree on how Russia
should go about its mediating role. Russia has tended to cast
itself as a sort of marriage counselor that expects concessions
from NATO, as well as Belgrade. The United States, however, insists
that NATO's demands are firm and that it is the Milosevic regime
that will have to make the major concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, for his part, met on Friday with Milosevic. He
left without declaring a breakthrough and was careful not to
promise one on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the situation to be far from simple,''
Chernomyrdin said. ``But it gives us hope that efforts which Russia
has taken and will take are significant.''

PHILLIES ROUT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Philadelphia's Curt Schilling did what Kevin
Brown was expected to do and because of it the Los Angeles Dodgers'
five-game winning streak is over.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling pitched out of a bases-loaded, none-out jam in the
sixth inning. In the bottom of the inning, Dodgers second baseman
Eric Young couldn't come up with a line drive with the bases
loaded. It led to three runs and the Phillies went on to beat the
Dodgers 12-3 Sunday in the finale of a three-game series at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The score got out of hand when reliever Jeff Kubenka allowed six
runs in the eighth, but the line drive was where the game turned.
It set up a broken-bat single by Philadelphia's Doug Glanville that
scored two runs and gave the Phillies a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have days when you can't buy a break,'' Brown said. `` I
had a chance to keep the game (close) and it didn't happen. You
make a pitch down the middle of the plate and he lines it at
somebody and everyone says, `Hip, hip, hooray. You got out of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You make a good pitch and the guy breaks his bat and two runs
score.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Young, who's played well in the field,
had an opportunity to make a play on a ball but couldn't get the
handle.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers tied it in the top of the fourth on Todd
Hundley's two-run homer, Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu led off the
bottom of the inning with a triple. With one out and the infield
in, Rob Ducey hit a sharp grounder to Young at second. Young
couldn't get a grip on it to throw home, but he did get Ducey at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one, ground ball hit hard, either I come up with it
or I don't,'' Young said. ``The line drive kind of knuckled at me.
Those are plays you either come up with or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who lasted six innings in his shortest stint since
opening day, put himself in trouble with uncharacteristic wildness.
He walked four for the second consecutive game, including three
straight with one out in the sixth. It set up Desi Relaford's liner
Young couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said the 20 mph winds blowing in
the face of the pitchers hurt Brown's and Schilling's control.
Brown didn't go that far, but he didn't deny the wind's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make a judgment on that,'' said Brown, who fell to
2-2. ``Obviously, I didn't do a good job adjusting to it. It's not
a reason I didn't win. I didn't get balls where I wanted them. It
was one of those days. I didn't think anything went right.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling also scuffled with his control with a season-high four
walks. But he was able to take a few deep breaths behind the
pitcher's mound before pitching out of similar trouble in the top
of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi and Dave Hansen to load
the bases with none out, and the Dodgers had their left-handers in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling fell behind in the count 3-0 to the switch-hitting
Hundley, but battled back to strike him out. Ditto with lefty Todd
Hollandsworth for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him do it before and that's what makes him great,''
Hansen said. ``He regrouped, tied his shoes and went after it. He
went to the back of the mound, did his Al Hrabosky imitation and
came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who threw an insane 134 pitches in 71/3 innings, got
out of the sixth inning by getting hot-hitting Adrian Beltre to
ground into a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Schilling credit,'' Johnson said. ``Bases
loaded, 3-0 on a couple of good hitters and getting out of it
without a run. We could have broken the game open right there and
didn't. Schilling made the pitches.''

BROADCAST OF ETHNIC REMARK STIRS TENSIONS IN ISRAELI RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Entering its home stretch, Israel's volatile
election campaign generated fresh controversy Sunday with the
broadcast of remarks that had the ring of an ethnic slur.
</P>
<P>
   An actress who supports Ehud Barak, the leader of the Labor
Party, called working-class Sephardic Jewish backers of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyhau ``riffraff,'' setting off a storm of
protest and damaging Barak's efforts to capture Sephardic votes.
</P>
<P>
   The statements by the actress, Tiki Dayan, forced Barak into
urgent damage control. It also breathed new life into Netanyahu's
campaign at a time when Barak had been appearing to open up a lead
in public opinion polls, a little more than two weeks before the
May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The incident exposed ethnic tensions simmering just below the
surface of the campaign, in which Barak has been reaching out to
disadvantaged Sephardic voters by focusing on issues such as
unemployment and education.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dayan spoke on Friday at a gathering of performing artists
who support Barak, and her remarks were broadcast Sunday morning on
Israel Radio. They touched a raw nerve, exposing social fault lines
that have traditionally divided Labor supporters from backers of
the Likud, many of them working-class Sephardic Jews living in
low-income neighborhoods and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a different people, don't you
understand,'' Ms. Dayan told the gathering, which Barak attended.
``We're talking about people who've been made into the most
important people here, to the people in the market, to the
riffraff, to those who say, `Even if he were Arafat I would vote
for Bibi.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dayan added: ``That's how they think and that's how they
talk. Speak to them in a way they'll understand: clear, open,
straight, humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a former army chief of staff, described the decision to
broadcast the remarks as a ``cluster bomb'' aimed at his campaign.
Shlomo Ben-Ami, a prominent Sephardic member of Labor, called the
comments ``semiracist'' and ``verbal pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly to make up for his failure to denounce the
statements when they were made, Barak condemned them repeatedly in
radio interviews Sunday and demanded that Ms. Dayan apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dayan, noting that she was herself Sephardic and had
portrayed Sephardic characters, said she was sorry for using the
term ``riffraff,'' and she warned against attempts by the Likud to
exploit her statements to fan ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu asserted that Ms. Dayan's remarks had simply shown
that Labor remains the same remote, elitist party that has
alienated Sephardic voters for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same arrogant left, the same small group in the
suburbs of north Tel Aviv who think they can run the country,''
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a parallel between Ms. Dayan's remarks and an ethnic
slur used at a Labor party rally in 1981 by an Israeli entertainer,
Dudu Topaz, who called Likud supporters ``chakhchakhim,'' a
pejorative reference to Moroccan-born Jews. Backlash against that
epithet is said to have helped Prime Minister Menachem Begin win
re-election.

LOW-WAGE BUSINESSES ADD TO NUMBER OF UNINSURED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-spreading gap between the wages of
undereducated workers in menial jobs and those of skilled college
graduates is contributing to another gap, in workers' health
benefits, a research journal reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lending a new perspective on the swelling numbers of Americans
without health insurance, an article to be published on Monday in
the journal Health Affairs says that a phenomenon feeding the
benefits gap is the proliferation of low-wage businesses, like
stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings,'' the authors say, ``strongly suggest that
low-wage families'' can often protect themselves from losing health
insurance ``if they find work in firms where a substantial share of
the employees earn more than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gabel, the lead author, an economist and benefits
specialist at the Hospital Research and Educational Trust, said in
an interview, ``The pattern we see is that employers that have a
high-income work force offer better benefits, no matter how you
choose to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The article notes that after taking inflation into account,
wages for high school graduates fell 11 percent from 1973 to 1997,
while those of college graduates rose 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The journal says that the rise in the numbers of uninsured
Americans, from 38 million in 1992 to 43 million in 1997, has
touched most segments of the population, but the poor especially.
</P>
<P>
   Over the five years, the study says, the percentage of heads of
households with high school diplomas who lacked coverage rose to
28.6 percent, from 26.2 percent. But for those with college
degrees, the percentage was much lower and barely budged, to 8.1
percent from 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The authors looked in particular at relationships showing that
low-paid employees of companies with high proportions of well-paid
employees were more likely to be offered benefits, and to get more
choices in coverage, with smaller deductions from their pay, than
those at businesses with few well-paid employees.
</P>
<P>
   The article does not identify the 2,763 private and public
employers the authors examined. But the authors show that low-wage
workers serving hamburgers in the cafeteria of, say, a General
Motors or a Merrill Lynch, which have relatively few such workers,
are more likely to have health benefits than those at, say,
McDonald's or Burger King, which have many low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   For the article, the authors used two surveys conducted last
year. One, by KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm, surveyed
1,583 small and large employers. The other, by the Kaiser Family
Foundation, surveyed 1,180 small businesses employing 3 to 199
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For each employer, the authors weighed the numbers of well-paid
workers _ those earning more than $75,000 a year _ against those
earning less than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The authors put those employers with the highest proportion of
the lowest-paid workers into a ``low wage'' category and those with
the highest proportion of high-paid workers into a ``high wage''
category. Workers at the high-wage companies _ whether poorly paid
or well paid themselves _ got the better deal. They paid 21 percent
of the employers' premiums for individual coverage, compared with
24 percent at low-wage firms. And for family coverage, workers at
high-wage firms paid 27 percent of the cost, compared with 41
percent for low-wage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the smaller companies, the authors found that only 39
percent of the low-wage companies offered health benefits, compared
with 82 percent of the high-wage firms.

 &HT;    Highlights from the star Wars convention
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Two distinct kinds of fans attended the Star Wars
Celebration here this weekend: those who wanted to know what's
going to happen in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, and
those who absolutely did not.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans who wanted to avoid spoiling the surprise
outnumbered the ones looking for definitive answers about five to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan MacKnight of Athens, Ohio, said he'll buy the
novelization of the Phantom Menace as soon as it goes on sale.
``But I won't even open it until I've seen the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to preserve the surprise didn't stop MacKnight and
others from speculating about Episode I and the planned Episodes II
and III. And much of the speculation centered around how Anakin
Skywalker, a 9-year-old boy in Episode I, becomes the menacing
Darth Vader introduced in 1977's Episode IV.
</P>
<P>
   Max Clark of Beavercreek, Ohio, expects a battle between young
Anakin and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. ``It's going to end with
Anakin falling into acid or molten metal,'' Clark said. ``His body
will be so badly damaged that he won't be able to survive without
the helmet and breathing equipment Darth Vader uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of discussion on the last day of the celebration
was the probable impact Episode I will have on pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Carla Beth Perry of Longmont, Colo., came to the
celebration Sunday wearing makeup inspired by the character Queen
Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up wanting to be Princess Leia,'' she said, ``and now
we'll have a new generation of little girls wanting to be Queen
Amidala.''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't immersed yourself in Episode I lore yet, here are
some of the Star Wars images that are most likely to spillover from
the world of hard-core fans into the wider culture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Maul: Even before the fan event in Denver, the
red-and-black wasp pattern face of super villain Darth Maul has
popped up on the covers of popular magazines. His malevolent sneer
and double-bladed light saber were highlights of the first Episode
I advertising trailer. At the celebration, Darth Maul and Ray Park,
the actor who portrayed him, emerged as superstars. Walking among
the displays were short, tall, fat, skinny, old and young versions
of Darth Maul in homemade costumes of varying quality. Expect to
see the same at Halloween parties and science-fiction conventions
for the next couple years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Desert chic: Many of the characters in Episode I will be
dressed in loose fitting tunics in desert shades of beige, tan and
brown. The simple shapes and rough woven fabrics could easily find
their way into fall fashion lines. And the hairstyle sported in the
movie by Liar Neeson _ shoulder-length hair with a portion gathered
into a pony tail in back _ was the dominant look for men with the
required locks at the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amidala and Anakin: Just as Darth Maul was a major hit with
adults, children at the celebration identified with young Queen
Amidala and Anakin Skywalker. Anakin in helmet and goggles promises
to be the No. 1 boy's costume this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toys: Some toys went on sale today, and an early hit is likely
to be small action figures with electronic dog tags. The dog tags
have voice and sound implanted that can be downloaded and replayed
with a device called the Comm Tech chip reader, available for about
$20 to $25. The must-have toy for Christmas, however, will be Queen
Amidala's Royal Star Ship. This bright silver, highly detailed ship
is large enough to hold about six of the action figures and comes
with its own detachable landing yacht. It won't be available until
October and will sell for about $100.

 &HT;    Internet - maligned since Littleton - also comforts youths
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebar top COPYCATS-COX.)
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Angry, hurt or overwhelmed by fear after
the high school shootings in Colorado, thousands of young people
across the country are seeking comfort in the familiar glow of
their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton tragedy quickly became the dominant topic in
Internet chat rooms and discussion groups geared to teens. Shielded
behind screen names, many assumed the role of analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply cried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel unhappy,'' one girl wrote. ``Can I get a hug?
Anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberhugs flowed back. So did advice to demand a ``REAL one,
from your folks!''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest reaction has come from self-labeled geeks, Goths
and assorted outsiders _ kids who identify with the killers' image
as oddballs who were shunned and perhaps bullied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet that the people that were killed had provoked the
killers in the past,'' wrote Andrew. ``I'm not saying it's right
either, but what goes around comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Slashdot (www.slashdot.org), which serves
high-tech and computer-game fans, published an attack on ``geek
profiling.'' The article criticized attempts by schools and the
media to identify potentially violent kids by singling out those
who dress differently or prefer video games to traditional school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the site received more than 2,000 e-mail messages
from teenagers. Some expressed resentment at being even vaguely
identified with the horror. ``How dare you glorify these scum? They
were Nazi thugs, nothing more, nothing less,'' one wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Killer's page part of story
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's connection to the story became inseparable with
the revelation that one of the killers built and maintained a Web
page with a violent theme.
</P>
<P>
   Among the postings by Eric Harris were lyrics by an obscure
German band (``Chaos-panic /No resistance/ Detonations in a
distance'') and bomb-building instructions. Harris and Dylan
Klebold, the other gunman, also both posted personal profiles on
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of Harris reportedly included provocative notes such
as, ``Personal Quote: it's fun being schizophrenic,'' and, ``Kill
Em AALLLL!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The postings were expunged within a day or two of the killings,
but not before they were copied and posted elsewhere by others _
including a Broward County high school student, who quickly came
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There are now numerous sites that claim to offer the words and
artwork or both killers.
</P>
<P>
   Web pages, the Internet equivalent of highway billboards, have
become easy to make and cheap or even free to post for anyone with
an Internet account. Many contain hate speech, obscenities, threats
and revolting images. Most are quickly submerged in the
ever-expanding sea of more than 100 million other Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Profiles aim to shock
</P>
<P>
   Users' self profiles are often clearly written for shock value:
One America Online member currently lists his marital status as ``3
dead girls'' and his hobby as ``killin red necks.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL won't comment on postings by the Colorado teens, saying it
has been asked not to discuss the case by the FBI. But the on-line
service does review member profiles periodically for profanity and
threats, said AOL spokeswoman Kim McCreery. The Internet is so vast
that few topics are unaddressed. For example, Harris' bomb
instructions added little to the voluminous advice available on
incendiary destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A brief Web search turned up several do-it-yourself manuals on
homemade weapons and bombs. Included are diagrams and ingredients
for pipe bombs, fire bombs and flame throwers.
</P>
<P>
   The search also turned up instructions for making school bomb
threats more realistic by planting fake bombs and using chemicals
to create a burning smell in the halls and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For the more ambitious, or destructive, there are even plans for
atomic devices. Diagrams for nuclear weapons are posted by the
physics department of the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A disclaimer at that site warns: ``We here at UC Berkeley do not
recommend using this file beyond the realm of casual or academic
curiosity.'' Any attempt to build an A-bomb at home would likely
result in death from radiation poisoning, it concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to maim?
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely a teen could scrounge up the fissionable material
to get that far, but the consequences could be just as deadly for
anyone who tried to follow other Internet bomb-making recipes.
There is no way of knowing whether they are reliable, or perhaps
designed to maim the people who try them.
</P>
<P>
   The same caution about verity applies to other Internet advice,
such as the seemingly sober thoughts of a Connecticut teen who
created an ``unofficial'' Web site for his high school.
</P>
<P>
   It includes instructions under the heading, ``What to do if an
intruder comes into your school.'' The first steps follow common
sense: Find a place to hide, find a phone to call 911, lie on the
floor, pull down the shades.
</P>
<P>
   The last may be a sign of what's on many minds: ``Call CNN.''

SONICS GET KOBE'D
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Someday it will be blacktop lingo: ``He went Kobe on
me.'' A heavy sigh will follow. And you'll know just what the
neighborhood kid meant by the expression. And you'll probably pity
him.
</P>
<P>
   To wit, ``going Kobe'' will be loosely defined as an unworldly,
unstoppable outburst of offense, crammed into a brief window of 10
or so minutes. It is a sight to behold. And it is devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Seattle SuperSonics, whose playoff hopes probably
died Sunday in a third-quarter Kobefest, as young Kobe Bryant
scored 19 points in a 9-minute, 44-second span to lead the Los
Angeles Lakers to a 91-84 victory at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   With that sizzling run, Bryant helped the Lakers win their
second straight, strengthen their grip on the fourth seed in the
West and make the Sonics mathematical long shots to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal did the rest with a 33-point, 12-rebound
performance, including a 21-point first half that set up Bryant's
third-quarter extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Shaq, `You can line 'em up, and I'll shoot them down,'
'' Bryant said. ``When I caught the ball, I noticed they were
backing off. I just figured why not shoot it?''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and made 9 of 10 in the quarter _ on fadeaways, on
pull-up jumpers, on a 3-pointer, on layups, and, at the end of the
run, on a breakaway one-handed jam for emphasis. He scored nine
straight points in one burst and eight straight in another for a
17-2 run that was all Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Final score in the third quarter: Kobe 19, Sonics 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets it going, he makes a couple, you can tell that he
starts getting `geeked,''' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``He just plays
stronger, he plays harder, he plays more confident. You can see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers emerged from the third with a 70-57 lead. Turned out,
it almost wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal dominated two quarters and Bryant the next, no
Laker could get going in a fourth quarter that saw the team shoot
27.8 percent. O'Neal missed 4 of 5 shots, and Gary Payton replaced
Hersey Hawkins in defending Bryant, holding him to three points in
the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice's 3-pointer, his first field goal of the night, pushed
the Lakers' lead to a game-high 16 points to open the fourth. Then
Payton took over, scoring nine points in a 16-3 Sonics run that cut
the lead to 76-73.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored 14 of his 29 points in the fourth, but the Lakers
rediscovered their defense, which held Seattle to 37.5 percent
shooting for the game. The Sonics never got closer than three
points.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that was failed strategy. With three minutes left,
Seattle coach Paul Westphal, desperate and and watching his team's
playoff hopes fade, put Dale Ellis on O'Neal with orders to foul;
almost every Lakers possession became an O'Neal trip to the foul
line, and Ellis committed all six of his fouls in the quarter,
three against O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, coming off a 14-for-17 free-throw performance three days
prior, delivered just enough this time. He hit 5 of 9 fouls shots
in the last three minutes, and the Lakers scored nine of their
final 13 points on free throws to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a 53 percent career free-throw shooter, was unoffended
by the early intentional fouling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys probably don't believe this, but I sit around the
house ... and dream of my team down by one, they foul and put me at
the line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he vowed to make teams pay for the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna always make one. I'm gonna start making two at a
time. I ain't missing no more. I'm ticked off at myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, the Lakers are generally happy with
themselves, having parlayed last week's team meeting into two solid
wins and something resembling momentum heading into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see,'' Robert Horry said. ``It's good to go out
and play one good game. But when you carry it over that's the more
important thing. So we carried it over today, which is great for
us. There's still some things we gotta work on. We see the things
we need to work on, we get it done _ that's the sign of us growing
as a team.''

A MELDING OF EXTREMES AT CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fellini could not have directed the scene better.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Correspondents Association Dinner, the annual
roast at which the Washington press corps honors the president,
mingles with government sources and _ in recent years _ gawks at
Hollywood celebrities, the level of surrealism was high.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail party before Saturday night's dinner, hosted by
George magazine, Susan McDougal, who went to prison rather than
testify against President Clinton in the Whitewater affair, stooped
over in her lavender evening gown to embrace Larry Flynt, the
Hustler magazine publisher who offered money to women who could
reveal the sexual transgressions of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A guest of George's editor in chief, John F. Kennedy Jr., Flynt
sat in his trademark gold wheelchair, wearing a satin kelly-green
dinner jacket with embroidered lapels. As the crowd stared, Ms.
McDougal eased herself into Flynt's lap, whispered in his ear,
stood up and announced, ``It's so good to be outside'' _ a
reference to the end of her prison term.
</P>
<P>
   A huddle of photographers sprang to life to photograph the pair.
Kennedy beamed. Despite the fact that one of his invited guests,
Richard Mellon Scaife, the conservative multimillionaire who has
been critical of Clinton, did not show up for the dinner, Kennedy
was still able to host six tables of guests that included Flynt,
actor Sean Penn and actress Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was afraid of the press coverage,'' Kennedy said of
Scaife.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, however, is not. A provocative guest list is standard
equipment for the dinner, which has become an opportunity for
magazine publishers to show off prize celebrity catches and
generate some publicity for their publications.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy defended his guest list, saying that ``this event, and
the culture of our magazine, is about the melding of extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the dinner has increasingly melded those
extremes, attracting the famous and infamous each year, from Fawn
Hall in 1987 to Paula Jones in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Warren Beatty publicized his political movie
``Bulworth,'' and seven camera crews trailed Paula Jones wherever
she went. For the last six years Vanity Fair magazine has held an
after-dinner party that has been monitored by camera crews from
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, George magazine upheld the level of notoriety with
Flynt, but, in general, the star power was less blinding, and the
connections linking stars to the dinner were more tenuous. Vanity
Fair invited actor Val Kilmer. Clinton's personal secretary, Betty
Currie, was a guest of Newsweek magazine. People magazine brought
Camryn Manheim, the actress who plays a lawyer on the television
series ``The Practice'' _ and who is not starring in a political
movie but was happy to talk about her new book, ``Wake Up, I'm
Fat.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario that perhaps best exemplified the transition from
the old-style correspondents' dinner, when the most famous faces
belonged to Cabinet members, Ben Bradlee, the editor who shepherded
The Washington Post through Watergate, was the dinner guest of In
Style, the monthly magazine devoted to celebrity fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that movie stars regularly appear at a dinner intended
for political writers was emphasized by Brian Williams, the MSNBC
anchor who delivered the evening's opening remarks. He thanked the
``Hollywood celebrities for inviting the Washington press corps to
dinner.'' And hundreds of autograph-seekers gathered at the rope
line cordoning off the entrance to the dinner, which was held in
the Washington Hilton, the only hotel with a banquet room large
enough to hold the 2,700 guests.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stewart Powell, the acting president of the
correspondents' association, arranged a dinner that insured that
the president would avoid embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relying on a comedian who might make rancorous fun
of the president and first lady, Powell hired Aretha Franklin to
perform _ at a cost of $55,000 _ and the only person who might have
been embarrassed was Helen Thomas, the veteran Washington
correspondent, who danced a seated rendition of the Funky Chicken
on stage while Ms. Franklin sang ``Freeway of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek reporter whose reporting ushered
in the Monica Lewinsky story, received an award, but Williams
presented it, and the president, who in past years has stood with
award recipients for a handshake and a photo opportunity, arrived
at the dinner late enough to miss Isikoff's award and any possibly
awkward moment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, the Washington bureau chief of The New York
Times, expressed his concerns about the tone of the dinner, and the
newspaper did not buy a table this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinner had gotten out of hand even before last night,''
Oreskes said. ``I hope that all the journalists there had a good
time because the profession is paying a price for this evening
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Donaldson, the White House reporter for ABC News, said that
when he first attended the dinner in the early 1960s, he was ``in
awe of the secretary of defense, the secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when the president came in,'' Donaldson added, ``I was
just a puddle. Now it's the Hollywood stars. As we were leaving
last night, at the rope line, there was such a crush of cameras and
people squealing. I couldn't tell who it was but it was not the
secretary of defense, I assure you.''

<P>
   In what would apparently be the first initial public offering of
stock in a company that focuses exclusively on transmitting phone
calls using Internet technology, RSL Communications Ltd. plans to
announce Monday that it intends to sell stock in its Delta 3
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Delta 3 is one of the leaders in the still-burgeoning field
known as Internet telephony _ a technique for carrying phone calls
using Internet systems that, whatever the sound quality so far, is
more cost effective than traditional telephone networks. Many
analysts expect Internet technology to become one of the main means
for carrying phone calls as more communications companies focus
their networks on Internet-based data, audio and video
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to attract eyeballs and to provide more products and
services, we decided to give Delta 3 the ability to do financing on
their own,'' Itzhak Fisher, RSL's chief executive, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   RSL, which is registered in Bermuda but has its operating
headquarters in New York, is a small but fast-growing company
focused on selling international communications to small and
medium-sized business customers. The letters RSL are the initials
of the company's controlling shareholder, Ronald S. Lauder, the
cosmetics heir. RSL's shares, which trade in the Nasdaq market,
closed on Friday at $32.75, up 87.5 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher would not say how much money Delta 3 intended to raise in
the offering, but RSL plans to offer 20 percent of the Internet
telephony operation to the public, with the company retaining the
rest. to the public, with the company retaining the rest.
</P>
<P>
   RSL plans to file registration documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by next month and to offer Delta 3 shares to
the public in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Net2Phone unit of the publicly held IDT Corp., based
in Hackensack, N.J., is considered the biggest Internet telephony
operation. IDT has not announced any plans to issue separate stock
for Net2Phone. Most of the other Internet phone companies are small
and still private, which would position the Delta 3 offering as
perhaps the first ``pure play'' investment in Internet telephony.
</P>
<P>
   But the business case for Internet telephony is in flux. A few
years ago, transmitting international phone calls using Internet
technology was profitable because it allowed carriers to avoid the
high tariffs that many foreign countries levy on traditional phone
calls. The arbitrage between high tariffs on normal phone calls and
no tariffs on Internet communications allowed Internet-based
companies to undercut traditional carriers while still making
money. Sensing this opportunity, RSL took a controlling stake in
Delta 3 in 1997 and acquired the entire company last year.
</P>
<P>
   But those foreign phone fees are coming down, partly as a result
of global trade agreements. That means that the arbitrage
opportunity that was the original driver of Internet telephony is
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   So RSL has been trying to reposition Delta 3 as something other
than a bargain-basement option for budget-sensitive consumers. (The
sound quality of Internet phone calls, while improving, still does
not generally equal that of traditional calls.) The new goal is to
become an integrated provider of voice communications over the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world that is deregulating that fast, where the cost
structure is going so rapidly down, the ability to use IP as an
arbitrage opportunity is going away,'' Fisher said, referring to
Internet Protocol, the language of cyberspace. ``It has worked for
us for the last two years very well and it will continue to work
for us in some countries. But now we will be offering value-added
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the services Delta 3 is aiming to provide are phone calls
from computers and billing on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, RSL announced quarterly financial results that were
better than most analysts had expected. The company reported a loss
of $57 million, or $1.08 a share. But the consensus prediction of
Wall Street analysts had been for a loss of $1.30 a share. Revenue
more than doubled, to $340.3 million from $131.6 million in the
first quarter of last year.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ At night in Kosovo, the only light is
that thrown by burning tires, set aflame by police apparently to
alert the very few drivers that they are approaching a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers keep a low profile, and _ with gasoline
rationed and life constrained by constant air raids _ their
vehicles are almost the only ones on any roads in Serbia. Those who
man checkpoints along the road exude an air of calm correctness
when checking drivers' documents. Where bridges are down, police
block the roads with mounds of earth and divert traffic through
bumpy side roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not concerned for ourselves. We are soldiers or police,
it is our job to risk our lives,'' said one policeman on the road.
``But we care about the children, the civilians and the old people.
For them, it is terrifying with the bombs and the sirens going on
every day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who were escorted into Kosovo by Yugoslav Defense
Ministry officials after a NATO missile slammed into a bus,
reportedly killing 47 people, at Luzane, just 12 miles north of
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, gained a fleeting impression of how
police are working there.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police seem to be surviving and coping with the NATO
attacks and emerging unfazed. One policeman, just back from a
40-day shift in Kosovo, made light of his tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Looking healthy and well fed, he said his unit had never lacked
supplies. They had based themselves in an abandoned Albanian
village, near Djakovica in western Kosovo, and had been able to
cook for themselves. They even had time to make themselves cookies,
he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers are said by NATO officials, refugees and the
few foreigners who have traveled the province since NATO started
bombing to be using the cover of civilian villages all over Kosovo
to avoid airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman suggested that the threat from the air was
limiting the security forces' ability to move, or at least making
them think twice about doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main danger from NATO is when we are traveling from one
position to another,'' said the policeman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had come under attack from planes when on the road
several times. Each time the planes had seemed to fire a warning
shot at the head of the column, giving the men in the convoy a
split second to jump clear of their cars, before the missiles
struck methodically along the column of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman said that the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army were using mines to ambush police convoys on the roads more
now than in the past. He indicated that they present little threat,
attacking only sporadically and usually in pairs or even alone.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians boarding buses in Belgrade Sunday for Kosovo or
southern Serbia displayed similar acceptance that danger was simply
a part of life right now.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya, who had come from Bosnia to visit her parents in
Belgrade, was one of many passengers buying daily newspapers that
bore graphic pictures of the mangled wreck of the Nis-Pristina bus
hit by NATO's missile. ``I have lived through seven years of
that,'' she said, alluding to the years of war, hardship and
lawlessness in Bosnia since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their fears, Serbs were continuing Sunday to travel.
Several buses left for Pristina in the morning. Many passengers had
little option but to take them. At 2 p.m. Steva Nikolic and his
family were waiting to travel home to Mitrovica in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me the creeps,'' he said, folding up his newspaper.
``What do you mean, am I scared? I have four children, a wife who
is expecting and my parents-in-law with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A refugee from Tuzla in Bosnia, Nikolic has lived in Kosovo for
the last three years in a former barracks, along with 150 other
Serb refugees. Just 500 yards away is a military barracks that had
been hit by NATO bombs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day my table moved right across the room when a bomb
exploded. The whole building lifted and shook. We are very
scared,'' he said. He had brought his family up to Belgrade for a
few days to escape the bombing, but they had nowhere to stay and
had to return home. ``What can I do?''

NATO ATTACK DARKENS BELGRADE AND AREAS OF SERBIA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ All of Belgrade and parts of Serbia were
plunged into darkness just after 10 o'clock Sunday night, when NATO
warplanes hit a major hydro-electric power station west of the
capital, in Obrenovac, said a Serbian Cabinet minister, Goran
Matic.
</P>
<P>
   As anti-aircraft fire filled the skies over Belgrade, lights all
over the city suddenly went dark, leaving the eerie sight of cars
speeding across Belgrade bridges. The official Serbian radio later
reported that power had been restored in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the power station was hinted at in some of the
recent propaganda leaflets dropped by NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   One leaflet, which may have been a warning of the strike Sunday
night, showed a picture of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
with an arrow pointing backward. Above the president's name it
said: ``No gasoline, no electricity, no trade, no freedom, no
future.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side it said: ``As long as Milosevic is going to
continue his program of destruction, rape and murder in Kosovo,
Serbia will go deeper into isolation. Don't be prisoners of
Milosevic's awfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier foreshadowing apparently came late last month from
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. Referring to several
protests staged by citizens of the capital and the Yugoslav
government since the NATO bombings began, he said, ``You can have
your rock concerts, but pretty soon it's going to be Belgrade
unplugged.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs reacted immediately with anger. A woman who works for a
Western news agency said: ``This really makes me annoyed. This is
not a military target. This is just trying to demoralize ordinary
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the power station seemed a clear rejection of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's request that the White House consider a halt
to bombing after Milosevic released three captive American soldiers
early Sunday. The attack on what appeared to be a civilian target
came less than 12 hours after Jackson and his party of religious
leaders flew with the three soldiers to freedom in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we make a gesture of good will, they respond with
escalation,'' said a senior Yugoslav official. ``Someone has
decided to keep using the stick, and why?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about politics, but pure power,'' he added. ``It's
just to show muscle, it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has vowed to intensify its air attacks against Yugoslavia,
vowing to force a change in Belgrade's policies toward Kosovo,
where tens of thousand of ethnic Albanian have been forced from
their homes. The heaviest NATO bombings since the air war began 40
days ago have occurred in the last few days. NATO planes have been
flying more than 600 sorties a day, last week hitting Milosevic's
official residence in an exclusive area of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of sorties has increased so has the number of
accidents. In the last week NATO has bombed residential areas of
Belgrade, Prizren and Surdulica _ all by mistake. NATO sent a
missile into Bulgaria, a prospective alliance member, where it
sliced the roof off a house.
</P>
<P>
   The intention clearly seems to be to try to force Milosevic to
yield by increasing the pain on ordinary citizens, with the
mounting discomforts ranging from a severe shortage of cigarettes _
which should not be underestimated in the Balkans _ to a monthly
ration of gasoline that is now only five gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Different parts of Belgrade have been blacked out by previous
raids, but never the entire city at once, and transportation has
been increasingly difficult, with much of the country's bridge and
rail network destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs have proved resilient improvisers, however,
usually patching together repairs that allow basic services to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all NATO's effort to drive Serbian state television off
the air _ by striking at transmitting stations and offices _ it has
been able to keep broadcasting to most parts of the country. Now
NATO has apparently decided to cut power to the television sets
themselves.

HEAD SCARF PUTS ASSEMBLY IN TURKEY INTO UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The newly elected Turkish Parliament erupted
in fury on Sunday and prevented one of its female members from
taking her oath of office while wearing a head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of angry members rose to their feet, clapped rhythmically
and chanted ``Out! Out!'' as the newly elected member, 31-year-old
Merve Kavakci, entered the chamber with a navy blue scarf covering
her hair and the sides of her face.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci had said her scarf simply reflected her private
commitment to Islam, but many Turks consider it an inflammatory
provocation. Turkey is strongly secular, and its political and
military leaders fiercely resist any religious influence in public
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the angriest members of Parliament was Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, who arrived to take his oath after President
Suleyman Demirel asked him to form Turkey's next government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please put this lady in her place,'' Ecevit told the acting
speaker of Parliament, Ali Reza Septioglu, after Ms. Kavakci
appeared wearing her scarf, as she had said she would.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a speech to the assembled members, Ecevit said: ``No
one may interfere with the private life of individuals, but this is
not a private space. This is the supreme foundation of the state.
It is not a place in which to challenge the state.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that speech, Septioglu called for a recess. When
it was over, Ms. Kavakci did not return to take her oath with other
members of Parliament. As a result, she is not qualified to take
part in deliberations. It is unclear whether she will take the oath
in the future and if so, under what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci is a member of the religious-oriented Virtue Party,
which secularists have denounced as subversive. The party lost
nearly one-third of its strength in last month's election, falling
from 21 percent of the vote in 1995 to 15 percent. But military
commanders and their civilian allies, like Ecevit, still consider
it a serious threat to national unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that support Islamic politics rallied to Ms.
Kavakci's defense. ``The people want their representatives to
repeal laws that restrict freedom of expression,'' one of them,
Milli Gazete, said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The clash in Parliament reflected a profound debate that is
spreading through Turkish society. Most members of the political
elite believe that restrictions on free expression are necessary to
prevent the rise of religious fundamentalism, separatism and other
causes they consider hostile to Western values. Others argue that
Turkey should be able to tolerate unrestricted political debate,
even over highly sensitive issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The oath of office that Ms. Kavakci was prevented from taking
includes a vow to uphold the ``principles and reforms of Ataturk.''
Three-quarters of a century ago, the founder of the Turkish
Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, decreed reforms that shattered
centuries-old traditions. He abolished the sultanate, banned
religious brotherhoods, adopted Latin script to replace Arabic and
banned the fez, the veil and the head scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places I have seen women who put a piece of cloth or a
towel or something like it over their heads to hide their faces,''
Ataturk said in a 1925 speech. ``Can the mothers and daughters of a
civilized nation adopt this strange manner, this barbarous posture?
It is a spectacle that makes the nation an object of ridicule. It
must be remedied at once.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The lingering, day-after-the-Derby question
Sunday was whether Charismatic made more history than he prevented.
</P>
<P>
   The full-bodied chestnut colt recorded the third-biggest upset
the Kentucky Derby has ever known, a glorious way to say goodbye to
the 1900s. But here is the heartache by the numbers: no favorite,
no California horse, no gelding and no filly has won this race in
21, 38, 71 and 13 years, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Topping off a week that saw him elected to the Racing Hall of
Fame, D. Wayne Lukas tried to tell us that Charismatic had the
right stuff, but hardly anyone was listening. ``This horse can be
my Villanova,'' said Lukas, referring to the unsung team that
knocked off seemingly invincible Georgetown in the 1985 college
basketball final. An old high school coach, Lukas is fond of
dropping a hoops reference into his turf talk.
</P>
<P>
   True to his school, the school of hard knocks, hard work and
hard cash, the Gray Fox won his fourth Derby, adding this year's
trophy to those captured by Winning Colors (1988), Thunder Gulch
(1995) and Grindstone (1996). He did it with a colt who had run 14
times with only a single victory in a stakes race, who was almost a
discard, and who went to the post at odds of 30-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have ever misread a colt so badly as I did
this one early on,'' said Lukas, who believed Charismatic needed to
go on a diet. ``I made up my mind to burn the fat off him and see
if there was anything there. The more I drilled him, the better he
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding the horse was just big, not blubbery, he took a closer
look and saw an emerging star. This was after Lukas and owners Bob
and Beverly Lewis had twice entered him in claiming races, where he
could have been bought by anyone for $62,500. The Lewises had
purchased the son of Summer Squall for $210,000 right off the
breeding farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you go along and nothing happens,'' said Bob Lewis,
``and you feel like you need to cut your losses.'' In February at
Santa Anita, the colt went unclaimed after finishing second _ and
moved up to first when the winner was disqualified. ``I was sitting
in the box with Bob,'' recalled Lukas. ``I said, `Whew, we're not
doing this again.'''
</P>
<P>
   If he can deceive his trainer, what chance did the rest of us
have? The more likely Lukas entry was thought to be Cat Thief _ who
led briefly and finished third. Charismatic received a sure and
well-timed ride from Chris Antley but was the beneficiary of the
horse hockey game going on around him. He still had to hold off
Menifee, who lost by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   More than one jockey argued that the best colt did not win. The
125th Kentucky Derby drew the second-largest crowd and the
second-largest betting pool, but few of the riders in the field of
19 actually saw much of the race because they were busy getting
bumped, bounced or clipped, while others pinballed their way around
the track.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic will go for the second jewel of the Triple Crown,
the Preakness, on May 15 at Baltimore, and you doubt he will be
favored. Lukas concedes the Belmont will be more to his liking, a
long-distance test for a colt that ``can run all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert will try to rebound from his failed effort to win a
third straight Kentucky Derby by sending Prime Timber and Excellent
Meeting, who finished fourth and fifth, to the Preakness. They will
be joined by his superstar filly, Silverbulletday, who ran away
with the Kentucky Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenger, the colt Baffert prized the most, wound up a
wobbly 11th and is going home to California. This is a rough
league. One loss and you're off the team.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic paid a bountiful $64.60 to win. He may have once
looked like something out of the five-and-dime store, but he's a
million-dollar baby now.
</P>
<P>
   Between a colt regarded as too pudgy and a jockey who had to
battle his own bulge, this was a race Weight Watchers could have
endorsed. Antley, who won the 1991 Derby on Strike the Gold, had to
overcome a larger handicap. He was out of racing for 18 months
while he struggled with a recurring drug problem. As he fought to
get clean and sober, he had to run his own marathons to get rid of
34 unwanted pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Making Antley's success more poignant was a message from Pat
Valenzuela, who is in California trying to get his life together
after 10 years of alcohol and drug abuse. The jockey who rode
Sunday Silence to victory in the 1986 Derby and Preakness sent
good-luck wishes to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, who gave Menifee a terrific ride, is another who had to
get himself off drugs and up from the pits. Their stories are not
unique, which may be a reflection of the pressure to make the
weight and the money and temptations that come with winning.
</P>
<P>
   No, the race isn't always to the swift.

CHINA'S RULERS ON GUARD AS SECT PUSHES THE ENVELOPE OF WHAT'S
ALLOWED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The police were out in force in several Chinese cities
over the weekend, seeking to head off rumored plans for new
demonstrations by a spiritual sect that staged a giant vigil in
Beijing a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents have been reported, and national leaders are
pondering how to deal with the group, called Buddhist Law, which
has gained millions of fervent followers. The government normally
maintains control over mass movements and religions and does not
allow social groups to be directed from abroad, as this group is.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is not political and insists that it is not a
religion, Buddhist Law has pushed the edge of what is allowed. With
last week's demonstration by 10,000 members seeking legal approval,
the group also showed a remarkable ability to muster its believers.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist rulers have tried to avoid provoking the
organization, whose members are seen as decent citizens. But the
leadership cannot be happy to see the emergence of a social wild
card.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law, or Falun Gong, was first preached in 1992 by Li
Hongzhi, who was already a master of the ancient art of qigong
(pronounced che-goong) in which breathing and meditation are used
to channel vital forces.
</P>
<P>
   Li, now 48, combined concepts from qigong, Buddhism and Taoism
with his own mystical theories. Last year, saying he was under
official pressure, Li moved to New York, but he remains the sect's
absolute leader.
</P>
<P>
   The word Falun means ``law wheel,'' a high-energy rotating body
said to be in a practitioner's abdomen that harnesses cosmic forces
and expels bad elements. Followers are told to harness this power,
rather than using medicines, to cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional martial arts like qigong were suppressed here as
superstition in the 1960s and 1970s, but in the more open climate
that followed they have revived. Leaders of traditional groups here
who blatantly cross over into fraud have been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although it obviously has great popular appeal, particularly
among retirees and middle-aged women, Li's new sect has had
critics. More traditional qigong sects are mainly devoted to health
and fitness. The government's limited oversight is wielded through
the martial arts department of the Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, that department began evaluating qigong sects for
legal approval. But a scholar who advised the department, Luo Shao,
said that the evaluation methods were ill-defined and that many
officials were followers of qigong, ensuring a lack of critical
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   So far the agency has studied only 11 sects out of hundreds, not
including Buddhist Law, and approved them all, said Luo, an expert
on Buddhist history at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a
strong critic of the group.
</P>
<P>
   New offshoots like this one, with charismatic leaders and
broad-ranging mystical beliefs, have been attacked as heretical
cults by some scholars here as well as by mainstream qigong groups
and Buddhist leaders. Members resent the characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law was accepted into the semiofficial China Qigong
Science Association in 1993, but expelled in 1996 for what were
considered its extreme claims. In a letter sent to followers in
December, Li said he had withdrawn because the purpose of
``so-called fitness-maintenance qigong'' is to ``swindle money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's demonstration was triggered by a harsh article in a
youth magazine in the city of Tianjin. Group members who tried to
protest were reportedly manhandled and detained, sparking wide
anger.
</P>
<P>
   The author of that article, which said the group spread lies and
could cause mental illness, was He Zuoxiu, an elderly physicist who
helped develop China's nuclear weapons. He has been a longtime
crusader against anti-scientific ideas.
</P>
<P>
   His own definition of scientific is not universally shared,
though. A die-hard Marxist, he rails against capitalistic
tendencies and said in a recent article, ``Not only do the natural
sciences count as science, but Marxism is also science and Deng
Xiaoping Theory is also science.''

NONE MAY KNOW NUNN STILL AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Nunn is no longer considered one of the
best fighters in the world. At 36, it's too late for him to realize
the greatness so many had predicted. And, it appears, he won't be
retiring as the multimillionaire he might've been.
</P>
<P>
   He won't leave boxing without an impressive body of work.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Davenport, Iowa, who has long trained in Van Nuys
has remained at or near the top of every weight division in which
he has fought for almost 15 years, a remarkable run of consistency
that lives on.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time world champion, now a light heavyweight, faces
once-beaten William Guthrie on Sunday in North Dakota with the
winner expected to be in line for a world-title shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through all that,'' said Nunn, referring to the
pound-for-pound debate. ``It's OK if my name doesn't come up. It's
nothing I dwell on. I dwell on getting out there and performing on
a high level.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I continue to go to the gym every day, run, fight
and beat the best, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn was once as feared as any fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- and late '80s, his combination of immense boxing
skills and speed was too much for his first 36 opponents. Among his
victims: Frank Tate (for the IBF middleweight championship), Juan
Roldan, Sumbu Kalambay, Iran Barkley, Marlon Starling and Donald
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   He had created an ominous illusion of invincibility against some
the sport's biggest names.
</P>
<P>
   However, it didn't last long: Nunn ran into trouble and out of
luck beginning in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   _He lost three big fights _ to James Toney, Steve Little and
Frank Liles _ within a 3{-year period.
</P>
<P>
   _He had personal problems _ a few run-ins with the law and a
self-destructive tendency to lose focus on boxing. An adviser of
Nunn once blamed it on distractive elements in Davenport, which he
called ``a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   _And Nunn abandoned those who had guided him to the top _ Van
Nuys-based Dan and Jo Goossen _ in favor of Don King shortly before
the Toney fight in hopes of earning more money. Instead, his career
went downhill and would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's as good as any light heavyweight in the world this
side of Roy Jones Jr. His skills remain sharp and he insists his
vast experience compensates for any physical deficiencies that
might come with age.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to prove it in his latest championship bout but lost
what many believe was a bad decision to then-WBC champ Graciano
Rocchigiani in the German's home country last year. It was Nunn's
15th world-title fight and would've been his third championship.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 36-year-old who now has had 57 pro fights (53-4,
with 34 knockouts).
</P>
<P>
   However, few noticed: He is largely anonymous these days in
relation to fighters like Jones, Oscar De La Hoya and several
heavyweights. Mention his name and you're likely to hear, ``Oh,
he's still around?''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn admits if he had Evander Holyfield-like commitment, things
might've been different. At the same time, he has come to terms
with any lost opportunities. He likes the person he has become _ he
says he has settled down _ and is grateful he can still fight at a
championship level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone ever really (realizes his or her
potential),'' Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a learning experience. There are things I've done I
realize I can't do now. It's something I had to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me a better individual. And, hey, I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, now the head of America Presents, will always
bemoan Nunn's fate to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, he saw a lot of Sugar Ray Leonard in Nunn _
the ability, an engaging personality, a great smile. That Nunn
never created a Leonard-like legend saddens Goossen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Goossen has to give Nunn his admiration. After
all, how many fighters remain on top in this roughest of games as
long as Nunn has?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel bad when a person doesn't reach goals that you
know are attainable,'' Goossen said. ``From that standpoint, I'll
always be disappointed that Mike didn't become one of the greatest
fighters who ever laced up gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, considering the bumps in the road, he kept
himself on top for a very long time. You have to hand it to him for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruelases: Dan Goossen said he has tentatively set a July
date for the comeback fights of former world champions Gabriel and
Rafael Ruelas, who are expected to appear on the same card.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, who has been with the Sylmar products their entire
careers, said he supports their decisions to fight again _ to a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel ... they deserve the opportunity to show that they
still have the ability to become a champion again,'' he said.
``That's the only agreement we have. Then we'll make an evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they show they're correct, if they still have the ability
to win a world title, we're all behind them. If they show
deterioration, if they show a skill level that would make it
virtually impossible to reach a championship, we've agreed to sit
down and speak man to man, honestly about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he wouldn't feel right if someone else promoted the
Ruelases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they're going to fight,'' he said. ``I'd
rather be in a position to watch over them rather than someone use
them for their names.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales defense: Erik Morales will defend his WBC super
bantamweight title against Juan Carlos Ramirez _ a replacement for
Wayne McCullough _ on Saturday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, one of the top young fighters in the world, needs a
meaningful challenge if he's going to take the next step in his
career, something neither McCullough nor Ramirez are capable of
giving him.
</P>
<P>
   Who could? There are many fighters in and around his weight
class who would make for an interesting fight: Naseem Hamed,
Luisito Espinosa, Marco Antonio Barrera, Tim Austin and Johnny
Tapia, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Forum update: Juan Manuel Marquez, the mandatory challenger for
Hamed's WBO featherweight title since 1997, is scheduled to face
former contender Wilfredo Vargas next Monday at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed, who is more hype than substance, has refused to fight
Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamed claims he will fight anyone, any place,'' said John
Jackson, Forum Boxing vice president. ``It's time for him to put
his fists where his mouth is and fight the man he's supposed to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez has won 28 straight fights since losing in his pro
debut. He has 22 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight fight: Former IBF cruiserweight champion Al Cole is
scheduled to face Willie Williams in a 10-round heavyweight bout
Thursday in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be televised on USSB.

CHARISMATIC WILL LEAD FIELD OF CONTENDERS INTO PREAKNESS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Ten of the 19 horses who ran in the Kentucky
Derby were booked Sunday into the Preakness, the second race in the
Triple Crown, including the top four finishers led by Charismatic,
the 31-1 long shot who won the Derby in the final strides.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, who was a forgotten claimer in the barn of D. Wayne
Lukas last winter, not only scored a dramatic upset in the Derby
but also restored Lukas to the highest rank of Triple Crown
trainers by outrunning all three horses entered by Bob Baffert and
preventing Baffert from winning his third straight Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The colt now will try to become something of an iron horse: two
weeks ago, he won the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. Then, the
Kentucky Derby before a crowd of 151,051 at Churchill Downs. Next,
in two weeks, he will try the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has won the Derby four times _ three times in the
past five years _ strongly discounted any suggestion that his
victory might have been diminished by the wide open race down to
the finish. And at the finish, Charismatic was separated from
Menifee only by the length of his neck and from Cat Thief by less
than a length, and only 10 lengths separated the top 15 horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put together the field,'' Lukas said Sunday morning.
``You only beat the ones that show up. You go over in the 125th
year, and you beat the ones that show up. The race had 19 horses in
it, and we beat everybody that showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the horses who showed up apparently were victimized
by the size of the field and by the rough traffic jams that
resulted. Baffert reported that his star colt General Challenge,
the race time favorite with his entry mate, the filly Excellent
Meeting, had felt the stings and arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Challenge's eyes were full of dirt and stuff,''
Baffert said. ``The poor guy, he probably took the worst of it of
all of them. He's all right today, but he looked like he was
dragging his hind leg a little bit yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me to get into the Derby this year because of
the 20 horses,'' Baffert said, meaning the 20-horse limit. ``It
becomes a crap shoot. You still need a good horse, but you need so
much luck. I couldn't get the trip with any of them yesterday.
Excellent Meeting ran unbelievable. She was dead last and she came
10-wide, and she only gets beat about two and a half or three
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Timber was pretty tired after the race,'' Baffert said.
``He had a little bit of a rough trip, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert salvaged one prize from the weekend: his star filly
Silverbulletday won the Kentucky Oaks the day before the Derby for
her 10th victory in 11 starts. The trainer said he might enter her
in both the Black-Eyed Susan and the Preakness the following day.
But he said that he had no regrets about his decision to run her in
the Oaks instead of the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to run her in a 20-horse field,'' he said.
``She could have been in there getting knocked around. That's when
they get hurt and get clobbered. The Oaks was like a nice breeze
for her. It didn't knock her out.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he would go to the Preakness with Prime Timber, who
ran fourth in the Derby, but not with Excellent Meeting (fifth) or
General Challenge (11th).
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't run in the Preakness,'' he said. ``I don't know
what we'll do with them. We'll just freshen them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rough Derby trip was suffered by Three Ring, the other
filly in the race, who finished 19th and last (Ajabr was
scratched). She was bumped repeatedly and her trainer, Eddie Plesa,
said: ``If I could have waved a magic wand the first time she went
by, I would have pulled her out.''
</P>
<P>
   John Velazquez, who rode Three Ring, said that he had another
problem: The saddle slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all the problems,'' Velazquez said. ``The saddle went
over her neck. I was like riding on her head.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who nearly caught Charismatic at the wire with an
electrifying dash in the late homestretch, will go on to the
Preakness. But his stablemate, Ecton Park, will not.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains both colts, said that ``Ecton Park
hasn't run that well two races in a row.'' But he was philosophical
about Menifee, who ran second just as his star Victory Gallop did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a beautiful race,'' Walden said. ``At least, we were in
the position to have that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Derby field of 19, these were the horses reported most
likely to start in the 1 3-16-mile Preakness, which will be run on
May 15 at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore : Charismatic, Menifee,
Cat Thief, Prime Timber, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, Lemon
Drop Kid, Stephen Got Even, Adonis and Vicar. Listed as possible
starters: K One King, who ran eighth, and Forty One Carats;
Millions and Talk's Cheap who did not run in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, the ``mystery horse'' from Dubai, who challenged
for the lead in the stretch but then faded to seventh, will stay at
Churchill Downs for a few days before his Preakness trip is
confirmed. But he gave a strong performance after traveling halfway
round the world on an experimental training regimen with no prep
races.
</P>
<P>
   Would a prep race have helped?
</P>
<P>
   His rider, Jerry Bailey, said with unassailable logic: ``We'll
never know.''

COLOMBIA'S CONCESSION TO REBELS PROVES FUTILE SO FAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ Nearly six months ago, the
Colombian government ceded control of a Switzerland-sized area to
the country's main Marxist guerrilla group, a good-faith gesture
intended to jump-start peace talks here. But with a deadline for
the government's withdrawal from the zone less than a week away,
the rebels appear reluctant to budge _ either from their jungle
stronghold here or from a sweeping list of demands that stalled the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an agreement is reached by May 7 to begin formal
negotiations, President Andres Pastrana has warned, the rebel
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, will have to
withdraw its troops from the area the rebels control.
</P>
<P>
   A make-or-break meeting is scheduled for Monday, and any
breakdown of peace negotiations would probably lead to new and more
intense violence in the protracted internal conflict that has
killed more than 35,000 Colombians in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla leaders shut down the discussions days after they
started in January, demanding that Pastrana curb the activities of
right-wing paramilitary groups, which the rebels say are merely an
extension of the Colombian Armed Forces. The preliminary
discussions resumed two weeks ago, and though few details have been
revealed, Victor G. Ricardo, the government's chief peace
negotiator, said progress is being made, albeit slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no book that teaches you how to deal with the
guerrillas,'' he said in an interview last week in Bogota. ``You
can't ask Colombia to achieve a peace agreement overnight just from
a series of work sessions. This is a process that requires time,
but the important thing is that we are near to having a common
agenda that would permit us to move on to the next phase, that of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular perception, however, is that the government is on
the defensive, scrambling to meet the guerrillas' every demand,
beginning with the unusual cession of sovereignty over a swath of
territory and getting nothing in return. The writer Plinio Apuleyo
Mendoza wrote scornfully in his column in the newspaper ``El
Espectador'' last week of ``Victor G. in his Gucci belt, giving
everything away.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for the peace talks that was palpable when the
formal contacts with the rebels began now has largely dissipated.
In a recent poll, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said that
they doubt the guerrillas are negotiating in good faith and
expressed pessimism about the outcome of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently as a result of the government's willingness to be
accommodating, the rebels have increased the number of talking
points from 10 to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders, who finance many of their arms purchases with a
tax on drug traffickers, have asked to be given control of an
additional zone where an experimental program to substitute other
crops for coca can be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of Defense Rodrigo Lloreda dryly replies to that
demand, ``They can do that where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marxist rebels began their insurgency in 1964. They are
seeking land for peasants and other elements of a classic Communist
program.
</P>
<P>
   The forced retirement last month of two generals said to have
links to paramilitary groups has been praised by foreign
governments and human rights groups as a significant advance in
creating a climate for real negotiations. In Colombia, however,
that action has been criticized as a humiliating capitulation to
pressures by the rebels and the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fire the generals at the request of the guerrillas is to
hand over to the insurgents a presidential prerogative,'' Alvaro
Uribe, a former governor of the war-torn province of Antioquia and
a prominent opposition leader, said during a ceremony in support of
the generals in Bogota on Thursday. ``It is counterproductive to
make concessions to the insurgency without a single act of
reciprocity in favor of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's effort at even-handedness has backfired in
another way. Resentful that the largest rebel group has been the
focus of attention, the country's second-largest guerrilla group,
the National Liberation Army, is insisting that it also be granted
authority over an area of the country. Last month, it hijacked a
passenger plane to press that demand, which the government has
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They argue that they cannot be treated in a manner inferior''
to the larger group, Ricardo said. ``But there are a lot of
differences in their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for a breakdown of the talks, the Colombian Self-Defense
Union, the main right-wing paramilitary organization, says it has
sent 2,000 of its combatants to an area adjoining the
rebel-controlled zone, adding to tensions. Lloreda said the
government has ``zero tolerance'' for the paramilitaries, but he
also expressed a willingness to confront the guerrillas if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country wants peace and is doing its best to achieve it,
but you need two sides for a peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for any reason some of these groups are not yet ready for
this, people understand very clearly that there has to be some type
of pressure so that they will understand negotiations are their
best bet and they are not going anywhere through military
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Colombian Army suffers from morale and operational
problems, making negotiations the most attractive option for the
government too. Though the army, like the guerrillas, has used the
six-month lull, which was never a formal cease-fire and did not
stop fighting outside the zone, to strengthen communications,
intelligence and training procedures, military analysts say it is
still not prepared to resume full-scale conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But even if both sides agree to take the next step, ``there is
going to be gunfire, and plenty of it,'' predicted Dario Fajardo,
co-author of ``Colombia: Violence and Democracy'' and a professor
at National University here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiations are being envisioned without a cease-fire
being declared. You need both sides to agree to that, and the
guerrillas are not going to accept a truce'' that strips them of
their only way to pressure the state.

 A GREAT DEFENDER OF THE OLD SOCIAL SECURITY BATTLES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The conventional wisdom these days is that any
major change to Social Security is unlikely before next year's
elections, but Robert M. Ball remains ever vigilant. In the
unending debate over the nation's pension system, Ball stands as
the great defender of traditional Social Security, the genius of
its basic principles, the soundness of its basic approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I feel good about our position,'' he said in a lull in
the struggle on a lazy spring afternoon, ``people who think like I
do better be very careful, and we better have good proposals and we
better be alert. Or something may happen that we don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball comes by his passion honestly, having been at the Social
Security wars for a very long time. He went to work for Social
Security in 1939, ran the program as commissioner from 1962 to
1973, and has since played a principal role on some of the
important advisory commissions. He is a regular source of advice
for leading congressional Democrats, has sent a series of
memorandums on the issue to the White House over the last few years
and is a Social Security beneficiary himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ball, who is 85, said he had no complaints about life on the
other end of the Social Security check. ``They do a good job,'' he
said, happily settled for the moment like any other cardigan-clad
retiree in the living room of his ranch house in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   For many Democrats engaged in the issue, Ball is an
irreplaceable link with 60 years of history. ``There's a reason why
the program is what it is,'' said Rep. Earl Pomeroy of North
Dakota, a Democratic point man on Social Security in the House.
``And Bob Ball can explain it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Ball's consuming cause has been beating
back the forces of privatization: the notion that at least part of
Social Security should be replaced with individual accounts that
workers could invest as they see fit. He sees privatization as a
``slippery slope,'' a dangerous step away from the guaranteed
benefits of Social Security. He contends that the system can be
shored up for the next century by far less radical measures, like
raising the maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ball acknowledges that his views are shaped by a very different
world than that of the young privatizers. One of three children of
a Methodist minister, he grew up in northern New Jersey and
graduated from Wesleyan University with a master's degree in
economics during the Depression. There were no jobs. For help, he
turned to his thesis adviser, who happened to have a friend
involved in the new Social Security program. ``He said, `Well, this
program is just starting up. It's going to be a big program. It's
an attractive program and an important social program, and it would
be a good thing if you got in on it in the beginning.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Ball took the Civil Service exam during his honeymoon (he
spent the rest of the time on a camping trip with his wife, Doris)
and began work as a field representative in the Newark, N.J.,
office of Social Security for $1,620 a year. He spent his early
years visiting employers, trying to straighten out wage records
and, along the way, proselytizing for a program that seemed quite
revolutionary at the time. On the wall of his office at home, he
has a picture of that Newark field staff, earnest young foot
soldiers of the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   There are other pictures on that wall: President Lyndon B.
Johnson signing the law creating Medicare, which Ball helped put
into effect. The presidential commission, signed by John F.
Kennedy, that named Ball head of Social Security. (Ball noted that
it mentioned more than once that he served at the pleasure of the
president.) A picture of the Balls with President Richard M. Nixon
in 1973, when Ball was leaving office. The newspapers at the time
said he was ``pushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball says: ``I was perfectly happy to go, but I couldn't have
stayed if I wanted to. I lasted for the first term.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Balls brought up two children: their son is a
psychotherapist; their daughter, an art therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ball acknowledges that his retirement has been less than
restful. He does do a lot of reading, and not just on social
insurance issues, he said a trifle defensively. Mostly novels and
Romantic poetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the care and tending of Social Security keeps pulling him
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when I felt a lot of pressure on the basis
that there wasn't anybody else really working on it very much,'' he
said. ``Now there's a whole group. They'll carry on whether I die
tomorrow and do as good or better job.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the idea behind the National Academy of Social
Insurance, a nonprofit organization that does research on social
insurance and tries to ``enhance public understanding'' of the
issues; Ball was one of its founders 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not at all clear that Ball is ready to pass the
torch and enter the land of retirement he helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I had dinner with him and Doris two nights ago,''
said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ``I
don't know of any other 85-year-old who's wrestling with what he's
going to do, new. But Bob is wrestling with that. I think he sees
the health care issue emerging anew.''

FRENCH ANTI-TERRORIST OFFICERS SUSPECTED IN EXPLOSION IN CORSICA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bombs and fires have long been common tools for
Corsica's separatists, but a recent explosion at a beach restaurant
on the Mediterranean island has come with an unusual twist:
Evidence has appeared that the blast may have been the work of the
very crack police squad that was created to stem the guerrilla
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the elite anti-terrorist squad, including the
chief of the national police on the island, were placed under
investigation and imprisoned in Paris last week on charges of
``voluntary destruction'' caused ``by an organized gang.'' Among
the burned-out remains of chez Francis, which was bombed on April
20, local residents found a ski mask as well as a police-issued
walkie-talkie and combat knife.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassed government in Paris quickly ordered
investigations and pledged to disclose the truth about the police
actions while the prime minister and the minister of interior faced
a storm of questions in Parliament. Corsican nationalist groups
declared that Paris was trying to destabilize the island and had
ordered the fire to pin the blame on the separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The four police officers, all of them members of the national
police force known as gendarmes, have denied setting the fire at
the beach restaurant, just south of the Corsican capital of
Ajaccio. They said that three of the men had been at the scene as
part of a routine patrol, but no explanation has been offered for
why one of the men suffered burns.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the restaurant and politicians in Paris have
demanded to know whose orders the squad were following when they
appeared at the restaurant during the night in a small boat.
Francois Leotard, the former minister of defense, said, ``In all my
life, I have never seen a gendarme acting on his own, and certainly
not in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians and newspapers have seized on the
incident to embarrass the Socialist government of Lionel Jospin.
While Corsica has seen its portion of political bombs and fires for
the past two decades, this particular bomb threatens to turn into
the first serious scandal affecting the Jospin government.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it undermines the government's campaign to restore
order on the volatile island in the Mediterranean. Separatist
guerrillas have targeted public buildings and tourist sites for
more than two decades in their campaign to gain more autonomy from
Paris. Rivals regularly shoot each other. But the most audacious
strike came last year when gunmen killed the highest official on
the island, Prefect Claude Erignac. His killing, like many on the
island, has not been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Following the prefect's death, France sent an elite squad to the
island to stem not only the political violence but also to crack
down on the notorious corruption in the Corsican administration.
</P>
<P>
   The group's investigations have annoyed many Corsicans because
it has interfered in cozy local habits from tax dodging to illegal
construction permits.
</P>
<P>
   The three men implicated in the restaurant fire belong to this
group, a body of 85 men, known as the Security Squad. Politicians
in Ajaccio have demanded that the squad be disbanded and sent back
to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that these events are a blow to the policy of
re-establishing a state of law'' in Corsica, the minister of
interior, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, told the Senate. ``At this
stage, no hypothesis can be or should be excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative newspaper Le Figaro, in a front-page editorial,
mocked the ``pitiful adventure'' of the police and called it a
stunt worthy of Inspector Clouseau in ``The Pink Panther.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that this action had wiped out the government's
law-and-order efforts in Corsica of the past year.

OLIVER REED, DIVERSE ACTOR FOR FILM AND TV, DIES AT 61 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Reed, whose red-faced exuberance brought earthiness to
film appearances as varied as a swashbuckling musketeer, a brutal
Dickensian burglar and his best-known role as a coal mine owner's
son in Ken Russell's version of ``Women in Love,'' died on Sunday
while filming a movie in Malta. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   In what would have been his 100th film or television role, Reed
was appearing in ``The Gladiator,'' a movie directed by Ridley
Scott and produced by Steven Spielberg. He was playing Proximo, a
gladiator trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Press reported that Reed fell ill in a bar in
Valetta, Malta, accompanied by his wife, Josephine, and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death for Reed, who was pronounced dead before he
reached the hospital, was not immediately known and an autopsy is
scheduled for early this week. Funeral arrangements were not
announced.
</P>
<P>
   A glowering, stocky man renowned for telling stories about his
fondness for pubs and fisticuffs, Reed gained his widest prominence
as the boorish Gerald Crich, who falls in love with a
schoolteacher, played by Glenda Jackson, in Russell's 1969 film
adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel ``Women in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The film also attracted attention for the then-shocking nude
wrestling scene between Reed and the character played by Alan
Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Reed became a favorite of Russell's, starring or appearing in
such films as ``The Devils'' (1971), ``Lisztomania'' (1975) and
``Tommy'' (1975).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson, who won an Academy Award for her role opposite Reed
in ``Women in Love,'' told SKY News in London on Sunday that Reed
was ``immaculately professional.'' She added, ``I am very sorry he
has gone, but I think he probably went the way he would have
wished.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was also memorable as the brutal Bill Sikes in ``Oliver!,''
the 1968 movie-musical version of Dickens' ``Oliver Twist.'' It was
directed by his uncle, Sir Carol Reed, who also directed the 1949
classic ``The Third Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's powerful physique gave an unusual mystique to Athos in
Richard Lester's 1973 film version of ``The Three Musketeers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was born on Feb. 13, 1938, in south London. He held various
jobs, according to Agence France-Press, including a bouncer for a
strip club, sparring partner for boxers, and a factory worker.

KRAFT SAYS PATRIOTS WILL REMAIN IN MASSACHUSETTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two days after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft
terminated his record-breaking stadium agreement with Connecticut,
team officials Sunday did something they have not done since the
tug-of-war between the Nutmeg State and Massachusetts began: Say
the Patriots will stay in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to a long future in Massachusetts,'' Patriots
spokesman Stacey James said Sunday, adding: ``The New England
Patriots are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement marks the first time since negotiations with
Connecticut began last year that the Patriots have publicly stated
they want to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   Following Kraft's decision Friday to walk away from
Connecticut's stadium package, which sports financing experts
estimated could be worth up to $1 billion over 30 years, angry
Connecticut officials publicly speculated that Kraft was planning
to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kraft declined to comment immediately on a counteroffer
by Massachusetts when he terminated his agreement with Connecticut
on Friday, some Bay State fans also worried he was weighing
publicly funded stadium proposals from other states.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Kraft intends to keep the team in Massachusetts
comes as Beacon Hill lawmakers are drafting a bill that would
provide $70 million in state funds for infrastructure at a new
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who has quarterbacked
efforts to keep the team in Massachusetts, said Senate lawyers are
currently drafting the bill, and he was confident it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some thought was a Hail Mary Pass was completed for a
touchdown,'' Birmingham said Sunday night. ``I expect the Senate
will adopt it soon because we passed a virtually identical bill
last year. And since we all negotiated in good faith, I expect we
will all keep our word.''
</P>
<P>
   Both House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Governor Paul Cellucci
said last week that they expect the bill will become law before the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Birmingham, Cellucci, and Finneran agreed on a plan
to try to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts. Under the plan, the
state will provide $70 million in improvements to roads, sewers,
walkways, and lighting. Local business leaders and officials of the
National Football League have hailed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's deal was far richer. It gave Kraft a $374 million
stadium package and included other valuable perks such as luxury
and club seat guarantees, making it the most lucrative stadium deal
offered to an owner in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Massachusetts deal requires Kraft to pay up to
$250 million to build a new stadium on land he owns in Foxborough.
He will also pay the state up to $1 million a year to help repay
infrastrucure costs.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Connecticut were stunned by Kraft's decision to pull out
of his deal there. Not only did the Nutmeg State have far more cash
on the table, but the plan had already been adopted by the
Connecticut Legislature, and Governor John Rowland had signed the
contract with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston deal is still an agreement in principle that has not
been turned into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford stadium site was polluted and there were many
delays in preparing it. After consultants hired by the Patriots
told Kraft it was unlikely the state would be able to deliver a new
stadium for the 2002 season, Kraft called Rowland and terminated
his agreement, orally and via fax, on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots' decision to pull out of Connecticut, Rowland
threatened that Connecticut would sue both the Krafts and the NFL.
However the governor has since acknowledged Kraft had the right to
cancel the contract without penalty if, in the team's ``sole and
absolute discretion,'' it believed the 2002 deadline could not be
met.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut's case against the NFL is different. As
previously reported, the state is exploring a case based on the
claim that the NFL wrongly interfered by promoting an alternative
offer in Massachusetts. On Friday, NFL officials denied the charge,
noting the decision to leave Connecticut was Kraft's and not the
league's.
</P>
<P>
   Working with members of the Massachusetts business community,
NFL officials helped develop the Bay State's counteroffer last
week. The NFL is also assisting with the marketing of luxury suites
and club seats at a new Foxboro Stadium. To encourage Kraft to stay
in Foxborough, business leaders last week pledged to sell up to $15
million in premium seats over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials are concerned about the downsizing of the league
as teams move from large media markets to smaller cities that offer
more lucrative stadium deals to owners. Since national broadcast
revenues are the lifeblood of the NFL, the league was loth to
exchange Boston's media market, the sixth-largest in the nation,
for Hartford's 27th-largest.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' public statement Sunday appears to undercut a
story in Sunday's Hartford Courant, which quoted an unamed
``Patriots official'' criticizing the Massachusetts deal and saying
the team's management did not know what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots Sunday adamantly denied that team officials made
the disparaging remarks about the Massachusetts plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the tough talks between Rowland and Kraft
Thursday night suggested the critical remarks might have come from
the Patriots' Connecticut lobbyist, Jay Malcynsky, who has close
ties with Rowland. Malcynsky could not be reached for comment.

FRENCH ANTI-TERRORIST OFFICERS SUSPECTED IN EXPLOSION IN CORSICA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS _ Bombs and fires have long been common tools for
Corsica's separatists, but a recent explosion at a beach restaurant
on the Mediterranean island has come with an unusual twist:
Evidence has appeared that the blast may have been the work of the
very crack police squad that was created to stem the guerrilla
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the elite anti-terrorist squad, including the
chief of the national police on the island, were placed under
investigation and imprisoned in Paris last week on charges of
``voluntary destruction'' caused ``by an organized gang.'' Among
the burned-out remains of chez Francis, which was bombed on April
20, residents found a ski mask and a police-issued walkie-talkie
and combat knife.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassed government in Paris quickly ordered
investigations. Corsican nationalist groups declared that Paris was
trying to destabilize the island and had ordered the fire to pin
the blame on the separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The four police officers, all of them members of the national
police force known as gendarmes, have denied setting the fire at
the beach restaurant, just south of the Corsican capital of
Ajaccio. They said that three of the men had been at the scene as
part of a routine patrol, but no explanation has been offered for
why one of the men suffered burns.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the restaurant and politicians in Paris have
demanded to know whose orders the squad were following. Francois
Leotard, the former minister of defense, said, ``In all my life, I
have never seen a gendarme acting on his own, and certainly not in
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb could turn into the first serious scandal affecting the
Jospin Socialist government of Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   It undermines the government's campaign to restore order on the
volatile Mediterranean island. Last year, France sent an elite
squad to the island to stem political violence and to crack down on
corruption in the Corsican administration.
</P>
<P>
   The three men implicated in the restaurant fire belong to this
group, a body of 85 men, known as the Security Squad.

MAN WHO WASN'T THERE DOMINATES GOP FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-REPUBLICANS-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The Republican Party gathered here
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night to kick off its quest to win back the White House,
but the main attraction was 2,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, the the reputed front-runner for
the Republican nomination, was the talk of the gathering of party
activists, Republican National Committee members and presidential
candidates. The fund-raising event, which cost $150 per person,
included a cocktail party, dinner and seven-minute speeches by each
of the eight candidates present. (Arizona Senator John McCain and
columnist Patrick J. Buchanan also were absent.)
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
tried without success to dismiss all talk of a front-runner. ``The
front-runner is probably a matter of interpretation,'' he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many of the candidates took their whacks at Bush,
both for his absence and for his refusal to leave Texas while the
Legislature is in session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry Texas is in such bad shape that the Legislature
needs to meet on Sunday night,'' said Lamar Alexander, the former
Tennessee governor. Alexander scored a coup with the endorsement
Sunday of Bill Zeliff, the former New Hampshire congressman, who
many thought would support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Bauer, the former domestic policy adviser to Ronald
Reagan, was similarly caustic. ``It's an unusual phenomenon when
your front-runner avoids these very important events that allow
Republicans to see all of us,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle warned the 1,200 dinner guests not to get caught up
in the polls or the pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard the self-anointed in Washington say the primary
is over. It's not over,'' Quayle said. ``Go with your hearts, not
with the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who refused to take a potshot at Bush was John R.
Kasich, the Ohio congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would I get off giving him lessons as well as he's
done?'' asked Kasich. ``He's going to get here at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush is scheduled to visit Iowa and New Hampshire in
mid-June. And his supporters set up a table with his name in
lights, a popcorn machine and the words ``Coming Attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, Bush's majordomo in the state, dismissed all
the carping and shrugged off the Zeliff endorsement of Alexander.
``There are people all over the place in this campaign,'' Gregg
said. ``We've got people supporting George W. and he hasn't even
been here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real purpose of the event, beside raising money for the
state party, was to allow candidates to show what they have to
offer the voters in 2000. Many of the candidates, both directly and
indirectly, addressed the violence that shook Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former director of the American Red Cross
said Americans must help the police fight crime. She said people do
not need an AK-47 to defend their family; ``cop-killer'' bullets
that pierce body armor should be outlawed; and guns should have
safety locks to protect children. She also said she favors full
funding to provide instant background checks on gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person seeking a gun if they're a convicted felon gets no
gun at all,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said the nation needs a return to values to prevent
future tragedies like the one that took so many lives in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a child that loves God, respects his parents and
honors his neighbors, that child will never kill anyone,'' said
Quayle, the former vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, the former ambassador and radio talk show host, was
even more emphatic on the need for religion and values.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Monday's world, you want to stand where God stands and that
also means `thou shalt not kill,' especially innocent children,''
Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also said he would not keep quiet on the subject of
abortion, differing with Dole and McCain's comments that discussion
of the subject will divide the party.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates did not forget to take aim at Vice President Al
Gore, declaring themselves prepared to fight his push for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander joked that he has been working overtime to make sure
Americans don't elect the wrong Tennessean. ``I've got news for Mr.
Gore, if he hasn't already seen it in his polls: America is tired
of the problems of the Clinton-Gore administration. America is
tired of Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the business publisher, praised the Republican
field for its depth and breadth. ``The other party has two
candidates, each striving to say less than the other side,'' he
said. ``We must not adopt a platform of Clinton-Gore lite. We are
the party of Lincoln, of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final remarks of the evening, New Hampshire Senator Bob
Smith spoke in favor of gun owners' rights, against the war in
Kosovo, and boasted that he had voted for the impeachment of
President Clinton.

DAVID DUKE FAILS TO MAKE GOP RUNOFF FOR HOUSE SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Two figures from the Republican establishment,
former Governor David Treen and state Representative David Vitter,
will face each other in a May 29 runoff after leading a fractious
field of nine candidates jousting for a congressional seat
abandoned by the House speaker-designate, Bob Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   A strong third-place finish by David Duke in Saturday's open
primary also demonstrated that the former Ku Klux Klan leader may
continue to play an active role in Louisiana politics. Although the
48-year-old Duke said earlier that this would be his last race if
he lost, he seemed to reverse himself over the weekend after
claiming nearly 20 percent of the vote. ``I didn't say I wouldn't
run for the rest of my life,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Preelection surveys put Duke, a Republican, in single digits,
but he again drew on the support of followers unwilling to openly
declare their preference for the champion of ``white civil
rights,'' just as he had in races for senator and governor. A
former state representative, Duke has run for office six times in
10 years and mounted a feeble campaign for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Treen, who is 70 and served nearly four terms in Congress before
his election as a one-term governor in 1979, led all contenders
with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Vitter won 22 percent of the turnout to secure a
place in the run-off. He has represented a suburban district in the
state legislature for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Monica, a Republican ophthalmologist who spent $1 million
of her money to fuel an insurgent campaign, finished fourth with 16
percent. Her ads against liberals _ who are virtually nonexistent
in the district _ made her unusual name known throughout the area,
but her attacks on Vitter, who renounced his belief in term limits,
injected a negative note into the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Though Treen led in Saturday's voting, he is not necessarily the
favorite in the run-off, according to John Maginnis, one of the
state's leading political analysts. ``I think Vitter has momentum,
and the people may want to go with a younger guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was ``helped by the negative tone of the race,'' Maginnis
said, which undercut other candidates and apparently turned
disgruntled voters to Duke. He may seek the seat again, the analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Treen and Vitter vowed to conduct dignified campaigns over
the next four weeks. ``I'm going to run a campaign like I did
before: positive,'' Treen told supporters at a rally Saturday
night. ``David Vitter is a gentleman and I'm pleased to have that
kind of person to run off with.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitter also pledged to run ``a strong, positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The two finalists live in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Congressional District is composed of a couple of white
neighborhoods in New Orleans, suburban Jefferson Parish, and three
predominantly rural parishes across Lake Pontchartrain from the
city. The district has relatively few black residents and holds a
reputation for staunch conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Duke carried one of the rural parishes, Tangipahoa, and came
within 100 votes of winning Washington, another parish along the
Mississippi border.
</P>
<P>
   The only well-known Democrat in the race, state Representative
Bill Strain from the town of Abita Springs, ran as a supporter of
the right to bear arms. He finished fifth with 11 percent, followed
by Rob Couhig, the owner of New Orleans' Triple-A baseball
franchise, the Zephyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Landry, a self-proclaimed 33-year-old virgin, won 324 of
the 146,000 votes cast. All candidates run in the one open primary,
regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sex was a subtext of the election after Livingston resigned
following disclosures that he had carried on extramarital affairs.
As the lion of the Louisiana congressional delegation, Livingston
had spent years loading the district with government contracts. His
announcement, days before Christmas, that he would give up his seat
and his prospective post as House speaker in the midst of the
impeachment crisis stunned his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Treen offered to step into the breach with the endorsement of
many prominent Republicans and a promise from House Speaker Dennis
Hastert that he would restore seven years of Treen's seniority if
he won back his old seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Vitter and the candidates eliminated Saturday night were
unwilling to let Treen win the job without a challenge, and the
special election turned into a costly, rancorous struggle.

KRAFT SAYS PATRIOTS WILL REMAIN IN MASSACHUSETTS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two days after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft
terminated his record-breaking stadium agreement with Connecticut,
team officials Sunday did something they have not done since the
tug-of-war between the Nutmeg State and Massachusetts began: Say
the Patriots will stay in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to a long future in Massachusetts,'' Patriots
spokesman Stacey James said Sunday, adding: ``The New England
Patriots are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement marks the first time since negotiations with
Connecticut began last year that the Patriots have publicly stated
they want to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   Following Kraft's decision Friday to walk away from
Connecticut's stadium package, which sports financing experts
estimated could be worth up to $1 billion over 30 years, angry
Connecticut officials publicly speculated that Kraft was planning
to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kraft declined to comment immediately on a counteroffer
by Massachusetts when he terminated his agreement with Connecticut
on Friday, some Bay State fans also worried he was weighing
publicly funded stadium proposals from other states.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Kraft intends to keep the team in Massachusetts
comes as Beacon Hill lawmakers are drafting a bill that would
provide $70 million in state funds for infrastructure at a new
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who has quarterbacked
efforts to keep the team in Massachusetts, said Senate lawyers are
currently drafting the bill, and he was confident it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What some thought was a Hail Mary Pass was completed for a
touchdown,'' Birmingham said Sunday night. ``I expect the Senate
will adopt it soon because we passed a virtually identical bill
last year. And since we all negotiated in good faith, I expect we
will all keep our word.''
</P>
<P>
   Both House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Governor Paul Cellucci
said last week that they expect the bill will become law before the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Birmingham, Cellucci, and Finneran agreed on a plan
to try to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts. Under the plan, the
state will provide $70 million in improvements to roads, sewers,
walkways, and lighting. Local business leaders and officials of the
National Football League have hailed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's deal was far richer. It gave Kraft a $374 million
stadium package and included other valuable perks such as luxury
and club seat guarantees, making it the most lucrative stadium deal
offered to an owner in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Massachusetts deal requires Kraft to pay up to
$250 million to build a new stadium on land he owns in Foxborough.
He will also pay the state up to $1 million a year to help repay
infrastrucure costs.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Connecticut were stunned by Kraft's decision to pull out
of his deal there. Not only did the Nutmeg State have far more cash
on the table, but the plan had already been adopted by the
Connecticut Legislature, and Governor John Rowland had signed the
contract with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston deal is still an agreement in principle that has not
been turned into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford stadium site was polluted and there were many
delays in preparing it. After consultants hired by the Patriots
told Kraft it was unlikely the state would be able to deliver a new
stadium for the 2002 season, Kraft called Rowland and terminated
his agreement, orally and via fax, on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots' decision to pull out of Connecticut, Rowland
threatened that Connecticut would sue both the Krafts and the NFL.
However the governor has since acknowledged Kraft had the right to
cancel the contract without penalty if, in the team's ``sole and
absolute discretion,'' it believed the 2002 deadline could not be
met.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut's case against the NFL is different. As
previously reported, the state is exploring a case based on the
claim that the NFL wrongly interfered by promoting an alternative
offer in Massachusetts. On Friday, NFL officials denied the charge,
noting the decision to leave Connecticut was Kraft's and not the
league's.
</P>
<P>
   Working with members of the Massachusetts business community,
NFL officials helped develop the Bay State's counteroffer last
week. The NFL is also assisting with the marketing of luxury suites
and club seats at a new Foxboro Stadium. To encourage Kraft to stay
in Foxborough, business leaders last week pledged to sell up to $15
million in premium seats over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials are concerned about the downsizing of the league
as teams move from large media markets to smaller cities that offer
more lucrative stadium deals to owners. Since national broadcast
revenues are the lifeblood of the NFL, the league was loth to
exchange Boston's media market, the sixth-largest in the nation,
for Hartford's 27th-largest.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' public statement Sunday appears to undercut a
story in Sunday's Hartford Courant, which quoted an unamed
``Patriots official'' criticizing the Massachusetts deal and saying
the team's management did not know what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots Sunday adamantly denied that team officials made
the disparaging remarks about the Massachusetts plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the tough talks between Rowland and Kraft
Thursday night suggested the critical remarks might have come from
the Patriots' Connecticut lobbyist, Jay Malcynsky, who has close
ties with Rowland. Malcynsky could not be reached for comment.

UCLA STAYS ON A ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It would take a miracle for the UCLA baseball team
to win the Pacific-10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA playoffs? That is now a possibility. The unranked
Bruins beat rival USC for the second day in a row Sunday, 8-5 in
front of a season-high 1,605 fans at Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   With seven games left in the regular season, UCLA is 26-26, 10-8
in the Pac-10. No. 15 USC dropped to 30-22 and 15-7 in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could make an argument for an at-large bid to the
field of 64 with a strong finish, especially with a three-game
series at home against No.5 Stanford on May 14-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal, to get to the playoffs,'' said UCLA catcher
Jason Green, who went 3 for 4 with three RBI. ``We have to win them
all, basically. Our backs are against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won four of six against the Trojans this year. USC lost
despite the return of All-America catcher Eric Munson, who has been
out of action since breaking a bone in his right hand on March 27.
Munson went 0 for 2 with a sacrifice fly as the designated hitter.
He was cleared to play an hour before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have (Munson) in the lineup, we got a little boost,'' USC
shortstop Seth Davidson said. ``But it takes more than one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans needed more than Munson to keep up with the Bruins'
firepower. The middle of UCLA's lineup _ which had been ineffective
the first two games of the series _ came alive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Scott, Garrett Atkins and Jason Green combined for eight
hits and five RBI against four USC pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the former Alemany High slugger, hit his team-leading
19th home run in the first inning against USC starter Steve Immel.
</P>
<P>
   When the Trojans rallied with three runs in the fourth to tie
the game at four, Green came back in the fifth with an RBI single
that gave UCLA a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, with the Bruins leading 6-5, Green hit a
bases-empty homer off reliever Steve Smyth over the right-field
fence, his fifth of the season. Atkins had a run-scoring double in
the ninth that completed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Green was a triple shy of hitting for the cycle for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first two years here, you would have never thought (Green)
could play college baseball,'' UCLA head coach Gary Adams said.
``He has made himself into a great player. He is the glue to this
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and shortstop Jack Santora are the only seniors on the
roster. Scott and Atkins, who went 3 for 5 with an RBI and two runs
scored, are both sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Roe, a 6-foot-5 left-hander who went eight innings for
UCLA to improve to 3-3, is also a sophomore. As is Chad Cislak, who
came out of the bullpen in the ninth when Roe left the game with
numbness in his pitching hand. He retired the side in order for his
fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bruins) have grown up,'' USC head coach Mike Gillespie
said. ``They were a young team with a great future and the future
seems to have arrived.''

MINOR FIGURE IN TANGENTIAL MATTER GOES ON TRIAL TODAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth W. Starr's office Monday will begin its
first trial in a matter related to the Monica Lewinsky
investigation. But rather than put any administration official on
trial, the independent counsel is going after a minor figure, Julie
Hiatt Steele, in a tangential matter.
</P>
<P>
   The charge: Steele lied when she cast doubt on Kathleen Willey's
assertion that President Clinton had made an unwelcome sexual
advance. Now, even some of Starr's supporters have said the case
against such a marginal player as Steele is shaky, and they wonder
why it has been brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think indicting Steele was a big mistake,'' said Stephen
Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University. ``It
is simply abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was acquitted by the Senate of impeachment charges,
and an Arkansas jury cleared presidential friend Susan McDougal on
obstruction of justice charges. Thus, the Steele case remains as
one of the last traces of Starr's $40 million inquiry into
Clinton's role in the failed Whitewater land deal and his White
House misbehavior. Starr also is pursuing a fraud case against
former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, but a judge
delayed that trial last week from June to August.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2 1/2 months since Clinton's impeachment trial ended,
Starr's office has become a shell of itself. Three of his top
aides, including Jackie Bennett, the deputy who was a driving force
behind the Lewinsky investigation, have resigned. Three aides
already working in the office were promoted as replacements. Starr
appeared recently on CNN's ``Larry King Show'' and sounded as if he
longed to leave town. When asked how often he feels sorry that he
did not accept a 1997 offer to become a dean at Pepperdine
University, Starr responded: ``Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Starr testified before Congress that the independent
counsel law, under which he was appointed, should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   While all of this indicates that Starr is winding down his
efforts, the prosecutor still has some fight left, to the apparent
consternation of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may have been emboldened after US District Judge Susan
Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., recently found Clinton in
contempt of court for lying in his deposition about his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and ordered him to pay additional court
and lawyer costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Steele trial, expected to last a week in US District
Court in Alexandria, Va., prosecutors probably will ask Willey to
testify about her allegations against Clinton. There may also be
testimony from a Newsweek reporter who interviewed Steele and
Willey, a judge ruled last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hubbell case, prosecutors might seek testimony from
Hillary Rodham Clinton about her Whitewater dealings, which could
prove troublesome as she decides whether to run for the Senate in
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But given that the Willey and the Whitewater allegations already
are well known, it is far from clear whether the trials will prove
more embarrassing for the Clintons or for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The McDougal case demonstrates the problem for the prosecutor.
McDougal's strategy was to put Starr on trial, asserting that she
refused to testify before the grand juries only because Starr
wanted her to lie about her dealings with Clinton. On April 12, an
Arkansas jury acquitted McDougal, a former partner with Clinton in
the Whitewater land deal, on the charge that she obstructed
justice. The jury deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt
related to her refusal to testify before two grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then sought court permission to talk to the jurors to
determine whether it would be worth retrying the criminal contempt
case. But a judge ruled Wednesday that Starr could not examine the
jurors. Starr has two months to decide whether to retry the case.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, in her trial, is expected to follow McDougal's strategy,
attempting to make Starr the issue, but her lawyers declined to be
interviewed. The case is an outgrowth of the Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After allegations surfaced that Clinton had made an unwelcome
sexual advance to Willey in 1993, Willey asked Steele to back up
her story. So Steele, in what she now says was a lie, told a
Newsweek reporter in 1997 that Willey had told her the story of
Clinton's advance shortly after it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Steele later signed an affidavit saying that Willey had asked
her to lie to the reporter. Steele repeated her explanation to a
grand jury. Starr believed Willey's version of events and charged
Steele with obstruction of justice and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Steele has said she faces more than $500,000 in legal bills and
that her life has been turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's backers, meanwhile, have painted Willey as not telling
the truth and Starr as a zealous prosecutor with a vendetta.
McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, has said Steele passed a lie
detector test, while Willey failed one. But Willey reportedly
passed a later polygraph examination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hubbell faces trial on fraud charges related to
Whitewater dealings. Mrs. Clinton, a former law partner of Hubbell,
is mentioned 36 times in the Hubbell indictment, spurring
speculation that either the prosecution or defense will call her to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Starr himself is under investigation by the Justice Department
for allegedly leaking grand jury material to reporters. The Justice
Department also is investigating whether Starr followed procedure
in expanding the Whitewater investigation to include Lewinsky and
in her initial questioning by Starr's prosecutors at a Virginia
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr put his spokesman, Charles Bakaly, on leave
after an investigation found Bakaly was a source of a story in The
New York Times that said Starr believes he could try to indict a
sitting president. Starr referred the matter to the Justice
Department.

WIDOW OF FORMER PRESIDENT WINS RACE IN PANAMA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)  (rk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Mireya Moscoso, the widow of a Panamanian
president who stepped out on her own politically to become the main
opposition leader here, had a narrow lead over her main opponent
Sunday night in a race that has made her the country's first woman
president.
</P>
<P>
   With just 55 percent of the vote counted, official tallies
showed Ms. Moscoso, 52, with 43 percent. Martin Torrijos, the
35-year-old son of the late Panamanian strongman, Gen. Omar
Torrijos, followed with 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moscoso will lead the administration that acquires the
Panama Canal from the United States at the end of the year under
the 1977 Canal Treaty negotiated by the general with President
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Vallarino, 47, of a third political alliance, trailed
with 17 percent. He conceded shortly after 8 p.m. and wished Ms.
Moscoso ``success in leading this country in one of the periods of
major challenges but also of major opportunities in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Torrijos publicly congratulated the winner
and announced to his supporters that he would seek to become
secretary-general of the Revolutionary Democratic Party, reorganize
the party and prepare to run again in the 2004 elections ``for the
benefit of the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure that we have a future and that time does not
stop at this moment,'' he said to wild cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The president is elected by a simple majority for a five-year
term starting Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians also chose two vice-presidents, 71 legislators for
the unicameral Legislative Assembly and 74 mayors in tranquil
elections that appeared to be the third clean election of recent
years, solidifying a break from the country's history of massive
election fraud and political coups.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among the 1.7 million registered voters was 74 percent,
and in many polling places the mood was relaxed, with little
partisan euphoria evident in or outside the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moscoso, owner of a coffee business inherited from her late
husband, Arnulfo Arias, for whom the Arnulfista Party was named,
ran on a populist platform that promised to end government
corruption and privatization policies that have left Panamanians
grumbling about higher rates for telephone and other services. This
was her second try at the presidency after losing 1994 elections to
the current president, Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This time, Ms. Moscoso had to overcome early polls that showed
her behind, criticism over her lack of college degrees and
government experience, and the ghost of the late general. Memory of
the general still resonates with many voters and his name was
constantly invoked by her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   To retaliate, she often referred to Torrijos, the candidate, by
the diminutive ``Martincito.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos, an economist with degrees from Texas A&AMP;M University
who served as deputy minister of government and justice in the
Perez Balladares administration, did not differ widely with Ms.
Moscoso on policy.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of his campaign was to offer a cleaner, less
arrogant image for the party once led by Gen. Manuel Noriega, who
was ousted in the American invasion of Panama in 1989 and is
serving a prison sentence in the United States on a drug-related
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In her campaign, Ms. Moscoso drew on the memory of another
charismatic politician: her husband. Arias died in exile in Miami
in 1988 after a long career in which he won three elections as
president, but each time was removed from office by opponents, the
last time in 1968 in a military coup that installed the general as
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   While some Panamanians quipped that the campaign was thus a race
between ``two corpses,'' many voters expressed a desire to break
with the past, which Ms. Moscoso said she would offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the selfish leadership in the government has
appropriated the riches and national assets while the great
majorities are increasingly impoverished,'' she said in a fiery
speech at her own campaign closing rally last week. ``I promise you
a different government.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting Sunday morning at a school here, Jose Aparicio, 54, owner
of a business that does electrical work, said he voted for Ms.
Moscoso because he believed in alternating the parties in power.
``It was the Arnulfistas' turn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated winners could think the country is theirs,'' he said.
``She has life experience and a strong character. You don't need
college to make good, logical decisions and think about the
country, not yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   With poverty and unemployment widespread, and a judicial system
in need of serious reform, many Panamanians also hope for a break
with the government corruption and nepotism of the past.

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS KICK OFF CAMPAIGN SEASON IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHSTER, N.H. _ The front-runner was half a continent away in
Texas, but other Republican presidential contenders met for the
first time in Campaign 2000 Sunday night at a kickoff event for the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who has dominated early presidential polls,
didn't make it to Manchester, where about 1,500 Republican
loyalists took an early look at the GOP field in a hotel ballroom.
But eight of the 11 hopefuls who have acknowledged White House
ambitions gathered for the first time in the campaign season _ nine
months before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained a presence without even being there. In a veiled
reference to the front-runner, former Vice President Dan Quayle
urged Republicans to withhold judgment on the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over,'' Quayle said. ``Take a look at us, size us up
and then ask the tough questions. ... Go with your hearts, not with
the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander told the crowd: ``Our
nomination can't be bought, can't be inherited. It has to be
earned.''
</P>
<P>
   The other speakers were former Transportation and Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Rep.
John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, publisher
Steve Forbes of New Jersey and anti-abortion activist Alan Keyes of
Maryland. Sen. John McCain of Arizona and conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan skipped the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who stuck to her habit of roaming into the audience during
her remarks, drew a tepid response by endorsing a handful of
gun-control measures. She said she favors the current bans on
assault weapons and armor-piercing bullets, and would like to see
safety locks for triggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' one man shouted in response.
</P>
<P>
   Although the candidates differed on the details, they were
united in calling for lower taxes. Most also cited the recent
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., as evidence of a moral and
societal decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me begin by asking you a question: Do you believe in
God?'' Bauer ask before recounting the fate of a Colorado student
who was shot after she acknowledged her faith. ``If we do not
remember that America was built on God, that he is the author of
our liberty ... nothing else will matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinner's rule prohibited stand-in speakers, but Bush got
some help from Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who welcomed the
guests to his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not to be any surrogates, so I won't mention my man,
George W. Bush. He's a good man,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters passed out bags of popcorn at a pre-dinner
reception and dined at tables decorated with Texas-style
centerpieces. Small bales of hay were adorned with fake yellow
roses, a small plastic cowboy hat and the Texas flag, alongside the
flags of New Hampshire and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Russell, one of the leaders of Bush's New Hampshire
campaign, said his decision to stay in Texas until the end of the
legislative session has not dampened enthusiasm for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to him coming,'' she said of Bush's
planned visit next month. ``They want to see him and hear him and
touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates did their best to show grass-roots support,
with varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   A group of young Quayle volunteers stood on a street corner
outside the hotel with a large banner touting the former vice
president. Their enthusiasm began to wane after about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the potato joke twice already,'' one said glumly.
``That's pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mistaking the overall mood of Republican
optimisim. A rack of bumper stickers outside the dinner captured
the feeling among Republicans as well as any of the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Miss Barbara Bush,'' one said. Another looked even further
back for a GOP role model: ``Nixon 2000. He's Not As Stiff As Al
Gore.''

SEATTLE-AREA SCHOOLS LOOK AT OWN SECURITY AFTER COLUMBINE RAMPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at Littleton's
Columbine High School has put Puget Sound-area schools on high
alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a
special meeting this week between Seattle police and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts are also reassessing whether lockdown
drills _ which are not required by law _ should become mandatory,
and are offering training to anxious teachers and principals who
feel ill-prepared to respond to armed intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't dreamt it could be this horrific,'' said Brian
Benzel, chief operations officer of the 48,600-student Seattle
School District, referring to the Columbine killings in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just chilling... It seems like we're going to have to
expand our thinking about how to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzel and other district officials are meeting this week with
Seattle police to review emergency strategies and discuss whether
more could be done to prevent an attack like that carried out by
the two heavily armed Columbine seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed very appropriate that we review procedures and
protocol given what happened,'' Benzel said. ``We've had a pretty
good relationship with SPD but we want to look at what could be
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold took the lives of 12 students and one teacher
and injured 20 others on April 20 before turning their weapons on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers,
visiting regularly and getting to know students and school
buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director.
</P>
<P>
   Police SWAT teams have also drilled at Seattle schools, Ferrar
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the worst school slayings in U.S. history,
local secondary schools have beefed up security measures, from
cracking down on even the mildest threat to launching random
weapons sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle's Ballard High School, principal Chuck Chinn followed
the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up
locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal
detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before
the Colorado killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the students on notice,'' Chinn said. ``There were
virtually no complaints because the kids understood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1,120-student Ballard High School, like many schools,
has never done a lockdown drill, and Chinn said he is reviewing
whether that is now necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence erupted at Columbine, many local districts had
already begun revising their emergency manuals to include the
threat of armed attacks because of the string of school shootings
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now districts are moving up timetables for training school
staff, said Pegi McEvoy, the Seattle district's safety coordinator.
She's been inundated with requests for security training from
worried teachers.``We are in a state of hyper-vigilance,'' McEvoy
said. ``Just because you have a plan doesn't mean you know what's
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers want basic information, from how to get a lock
installed on a classroom door to advice for shielding students from
armed intruders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling students to `drop and cover' can be the wrong thing to
do,'' McEvoy said. ``You then become a sitting duck and they can
just come up and shoot you. We saw that in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, running for safety or trying to get out a window could
be a better strategy, she said. A teacher might need to pull the
shades on a window to block an intruder's view, or barricade a
door.
</P>
<P>
   Some security officials say that lawmakers should make lockdown
drills mandatory so that schools are better prepared to protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly is an issue here that the Legislature should
visit about making lockdowns a requirement,'' said Michael Sweeney,
security director for the 21,300-student Federal Way School
district in Washington state. ``It would overcome the
inconsistencies with which schools practice lockdown drills.''
</P>
<P>
   A lockdown is used when a principal determines that there is an
external threat to students and staff, from a violent incident near
a school to an armed intruder within the building.
</P>
<P>
   Every school has a predetermined signal _ such as a specific
number of bells or buzzers _ that alerts staff about a lockdown,
and the PA system is also used to give additional information.
</P>
<P>
   During a lockdown, students are held in their classrooms and all
doors are locked until further instructions are provided about when
and how to clear the building.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25,000-student Kent School District in Kent, Wash.,
security staff are compiling computerized blueprints and aerial
photos of each of the 38 schools, said Jim Shimensky, King County
Sheriff's liaison deputy and Kent security director.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent SWAT team has also trained in schools after hours.
``It's like an insurance policy,'' Shimensky said. ``If something
should happen, they will know the layout and be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kent district has also increased the money it spends
training security officers, including requiring them to attend a
two-week academy annually, and has boosted salaries to ensure
top-quality staff, Shimensky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shimensky believes that a crucial key to preventing school
violence is encouraging students to report threats and weapons to
school staff, police and on anonymous tip lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids know what is going on before the adults do,''
Shimensky said. ``That's how we've found most of the major weapons
in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of installing permanent metal detectors at school
entrances won little support from school officials, who say it
would not only be costly and a logistical nightmare but would be
ineffective because determined students would find a way to smuggle
in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a school district not a prison system,'' said
Ferrar, Seattle's security director. ``Where do we draw the line? I
just don't see a simple solution.''

BY STAYING AWAY, BUSH IS THE TALK OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Maybe he was home washing his hair. Maybe he
was up late with his foreign affairs coaches, refining his position
on Kosovo. Or maybe the governor of Texas was just fixin' to play
possum a little bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons, the only sign of George W. Bush, the early
Republican favorite, at the first formal New Hampshire gathering on
Sunday night of presidential contenders was a booth with bags of
fresh popcorn and a faux marquee that promised: ``Coming
attractions: Governor George W. Bush. Coming this summer to a
neighborhood near you.'' Bush has vowed not to venture far beyond
Austin, Texas, until after the Legislature adjourns on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Like a play that begins with everyone obsessively talking about
a character that has not yet appeared, the cocktail party chatter
under a big tent revolved around the candidate who was not at the
state Republican Party's extravaganza. Instead of peddling their
own positions, Bush's rivals in this state that traditionally holds
the first primary were forced to compete over who could give the
snappiest, or snarkiest, answer about the meaning of the governor's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to hear that Texas is in such difficult shape that
the Legislature has to convene on Sunday night,'' said former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publisher, said, ``If you don't show up for a
baseball game, the other side is not going to shed any tears.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who did not make light of Bush's absence was Gary
Bauer, the social conservative, who said, ``It is sort of an
unusual phenomenon when the front-runner continues to avoid all
these important events.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the big draw, the dinner night marked the first
time that (almost) all the Republican contenders appeared
side-by-side. Others who showed were Elizabeth Dole, the former
president of the American Red Cross; former Vice President Dan
Quayle; Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio; Sen. Robert C. Smith of New
Hampshire, and Alan Keyes, a talk show host and former diplomat.
Two others besides Bush did not appear, citing previous
commitments: Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Patrick J. Buchanan,
the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   In their speeches, rationed to seven minutes each, the
candidates did their best to try to stand out _ and persuade the
audience of 1,200 of the party faithful that they were presidential
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Several spoke about the killings two weeks ago of 14 high school
students and one teacher in Littleton, Colo. Mrs. Dole, wading into
the audience with a microphone, risked offending gun owners _ and
drew scattered boos on Sunday night _ by calling for tougher
regulations in the wake of the deaths. She called for retaining the
ban on assault weapons, something her husband, former Sen. Bob
Dole, opposed in his bid for president in 1996. Mrs. Dole also said
she would favor banning armor-piercing bullets, would support
safety locks on guns and the financing to enforce instant
background checks on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you need an AK-47 to defend your family,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, linking the killings to his crusade for values, asked,
``Who has been fighting for your values and for your families for
over 20 years?'' He went on: ``Littleton, Colo., reminds us once
again that values matter most. You ever feel that perhaps we are
slipping away from being a God-fearing nation to a nation that
fears the next killing at our local school? My friends, this
country needs a spiritual renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   Imploring the audience to look beyond Bush's high poll numbers,
Quayle added, ``Go with your hearts _ not the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander recalled that in his childhood children carried
pocketknives for whittling, not to harm each other. ``We had
parents and other adults deeply involved in our lives as
children,'' he said. ``It's time to put our government and culture
back on the side of parents raising children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer pledged to ``devote every waking hour of my presidency to
make sure that every American child is welcome into the world and
protected by the law.'' Children, he said, ``will never have to die
for their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention given to Littleton, most of the
behind-the-scenes talk on Sunday night was about the man who was
not on stage but who leads his closest rival, Mrs. Dole, by at
least two-to-one in most polls: Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the degree to which Bush was overwhelming the early
field, Jim Nicholson, the national party chairman, said, ``The
front-runner is probably a matter of interpretation.'' But
Nicholson was perhaps the only person here who was not ready to
concede Bush's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, besides an important vehicle for the state party to
raise money at $150 a head (the gross take was roughly $170,000),
was a way for the candidates to draw precious notice from the
press, and therefore persuade donors of their viability.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the ballroom in the Holiday Inn in downtown
Manchester, Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who is not
formally backing any candidate, noted how all candidates were
positioning themselves should Bush falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call this a meeting of the upset caucus,'' Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Murphy conceded that the wisest course _ at least for
now _ was for Bush to sit on his lead as long as he could. ``The
people with something to gain are here,'' Murphy said. ``The person
with something to lose is not.''

METS SHUT OUT GIANTS, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Masato Yoshii glanced down to his black shoes once,
then twice, and only then began his windup. He repeated this
several times on Sunday, a new ritual that yielded tremendous
results.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after Mets Manager Bobby Valentine gave Yoshii
videotape proof that a move toward the first-base side of the
pitching rubber _ a move Valentine had recommended in spring
training _ had caused Yoshii's pitches, especially his sinker, to
move too much, Yoshii inched back to his more natural spot on
Sunday, the one from which he had pitched all of his career.
</P>
<P>
   With the shift back toward third base, Yoshii slid into his
comfort zone, pitching six shutout innings in a taut 2-0 defeat of
the San Francisco Giants that came on two unearned runs in the
eighth. And he gave the Mets a boost in what had been a
deteriorating spot in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, Mets front-office personnel suggested that
Yoshii, who was 1-3 with a 7.52 earned run average, could land in
the minor leagues with a poor start on Sunday. Instead, relying
more on his fastball than usual, Yoshii threw 68 pitches, 43 for
strikes, and allowed just three hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, Dennis Cook (who got the victory to go 5-0) and John
Franco combined for a seven-hit shutout, although Franco injected a
dose of angst by loading the bases in the ninth before picking up
his ninth save with a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoshii was what we were hoping for,'' Valentine said. ``He
made quality pitches, and he pitched in an extremely
pressure-filled situation. He knew exactly what was on the line. A
lot of people were waiting to cut off his head, and I'm extremely
proud of him. His pitches were down in the zone. Rather than
kicking myself because of something I did in the past, we said,
`Let's not worry about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii said, ``The bottom line is I was able to throw the ball
in the lower half of the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yoshii stymied the Giants, San Francisco's starter, Kirk
Rueter, was baffling the Mets; through five innings, they had just
one hit. That forced Valentine to pinch-hit for Yoshii to lead off
the bottom of the sixth. Roger Cedeno led off with a single but was
stranded. The seventh yielded nothing, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Mets came close to wasting Yoshii's effort.
With Cook on the mound, Rich Aurilia hit a ground single into left
center and took second when it was mishandled by Rickey Henderson,
who had earlier dropped a Stan Javier high fly that was caught in
the gusty winds. As Henderson tried to recover, his left foot
slipped and he went down hard on his right knee. Valentine said
later it was just a slight strain of a knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   With Shawn Estes pinch-running for Aurilia, Ramon Martinez
pinch-hit for Rueter. He struck out, and Cook got Marvin Benard to
pop up to end the inning. But Giants Manager Dusty Baker's decision
to replace Aurilia with Martinez at shortstop would haunt him
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Giants reliever John Johnstone, who entered the eighth coming
off 12 straight scoreless innings, had two outs when Matt Franco,
hitting for Cook, singled to left. Henderson, who arrived at the
plate to scattered boos, sent a high fly to short left field. With
the outfield playing deep, Martinez backed up while Javier and
Benard closed in. The wind _ whipping enough to remind the Giants
of their notorious home field _ sent the ball away from Martinez as
he reached for it. It bounced off his glove for an error, and
Franco, running hard, scored from first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball gets above the stadium, it doesn't end up where
it started off,'' Franco said. ``When you see major league players
struggling like that, you know the conditions are rough.''
</P>
<P>
   After Johnstone walked Edgardo Alfonzo on four pitches, he was
replaced by Rich Rodriguez to face John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud got his second hit of the day, a single to left field
that scored Henderson. Mike Piazza then hit with two out and
runners at the corners and provided a momentary thrill with a high,
deep blast. But the wind, blowing straight in toward home plate
most of the day, kept the ball on the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Franco's scare _ he loaded the bases with one out but
got Charlie Hayes to hit into a double play to end the game _ could
not obscure the impressive play of the Mets (16-9) in this series.
With their fifth victory in a row, they swept a team that had come
in with a six-game winning streak and the best record in the
National League even without Barry Bonds. Now, however, the Giants
are 16-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were struggling to get the big hit, but now the bats are
coming around,'' Matt Franco said. ``We got lucky to win, but we'll
take it.''

FEUD ARISES OVER WHO WILL OVERSEE, DISPENSE STATE SALMON FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Wash. _ Just a few hundred yards from the fury of the
swollen Skykomish River, John Sayre waded easily through the quiet
water of a back channel, checking the contents of an
hourglass-shaped fish trap.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, the channel was a weed-choked ditch, cut off
from the Skykomish for 60 years by a man-made dike. Now it teems
with young salmon _ coho, chum, pink. Sayre dipped a net into the
trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the fuss is all about,'' he said, pulling out a
tiny, silver fish no bigger than his smallest finger. ``A wild
chinook.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebirth of this channel, called the Haskell Slough, is the
work of a coalition of community and tribal groups, landowners and
volunteers. By any measure, it seems an undisputed success. But it
is, in fact, at the heart of an intense dispute over the state's
salmon recovery strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is who will control the tens of millions of dollars in
salmon money and where it will be spent. Sayre, director of
Northwest Chinook Recovery, and others active in grassroots efforts
to save the salmon say the administration of Gov. Gary Locke has
pushed them aside, directing money to the natural resources
bureaucracy and away from projects like the Haskell Slough.
</P>
<P>
   County, local and tribal governments have raised concerns that
they, too, may be left out. So have lawmakers. Sen. Ken Jacobsen,
chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, says too much
power is concentrated in executive agencies _ and ultimately Locke
_ and too many decisions are made in closed Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor wants us to be a rubber stamp for his plans,''
said Jacobsen, a Democrat from Seattle. ``We need to get something
so people can say, `We're part of the deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   What that deal might be remains unclear. But unless the governor
and lawmakers can reach agreement on who will oversee $112 million
for restoring salmon habitat, the entire grant program could be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on whether to leave funding decisions in the
hands of natural resources and transportation officials, known as
the Interagency Review Team, or give that authority to an
independent citizens board. Locke and the House favor the agencies;
the Senate wants an independent board.
</P>
<P>
   The issue wasn't resolved before the Legislature adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem:
</P>
<P>
   - The Legislature failed to pass authorizing legislation
establishing an independent board to oversee salmon restoration
projects.
</P>
<P>
   - The capital budget, however, includes a section creating a
salmon recovery fund and an independent board to manage it.
</P>
<P>
   - Locke says he will veto the independent board provision.
</P>
<P>
   - If he vetoes that section, he also would kill the salmon
fund's $112 million appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk, Locke plans to go through with the veto in the
hope of finding a compromise during next week's special legislative
session, said Sandi Snell, spokeswoman for the Governor's Salmon
Recovery Office. One proposal would keep decision-making in an
interagency review team, but create an advisory board to represent
the many interests at stake in salmon recovery policy.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, Snell said, believes the agencies have the statewide
perspective and technical support needed to make sure money goes
where it can do the most good. Science, not clout, population or
connections, should determine spending, Snell said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, in a recent session with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's
editorial board, said he worries that an independent board would be
insufficiently accountable, and too susceptible to political
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got concerns,'' Locke said. ``I've never believed in pork
barrel politics. I've never believed we should distribute the
dollars based on per capita, or based on the number of miles of
streams.''
</P>
<P>
   But many question whether agency officials can be honest
brokers. More often than not, critics say, state agencies will
choose to put money into state programs and staff, instead of
local, tribal or volunteer efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An independent board would be accountable in ways bureaucratic
decision-makers are not, Jacobsen said. Its members would be
subject to Senate confirmation, and its proceedings subject to the
state's open meeting law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of (an independent) board,'' said Bill Clarke, a
lobbyist for the Washington Association of Realtors, ``is you have
a neutral party to look at where the money is being spent, and
whether it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer and community groups are particularly concerned. They
have, at times, had adversarial relations with state agencies. And
they worry they'll have difficulty competing for salmon money,
regardless of who makes the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cities, counties or state agencies, the groups have
neither the money nor staff to complete complex, technical
applications, said Robert Anderson, chairman of the Citizens
Advisory Board for Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups. Volunteer
groups have called _ so far unsuccessfully _ for more money and a
bigger role for the state's 12 Regional Fisheries Enhancement
Groups, which coordinate community-based salmon restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me five days notice, and I can put 200 people on the
ground any place in the state,'' Anderson said. ``But large, highly
staffed entities are going to be much better able to put together
applications. How can little, community-based programs compete with
King County?''
</P>
<P>
   Snell, the Locke spokeswoman, said the agency review process has
been fair, open and based on science. Rep. Debbie Regala, co-chair
of the House Natural Resources Committee, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have criteria about what type of projects should be funded,
and they have been nominated at the local level,'' said Regala,
D-Tacoma, cautioning against making big changes in the process.
``We need to take a deep breath, and really think how we want to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The process delivered about $200,000 in state money to the
Haskell Slough project in Monroe. But the key, said Sayre, of
Northwest Chinook Recovery, was the community groups' ability to
mobilize volunteers and persuade landowners to go along with the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The channel stretches some three-and-a-half miles, meandering
along country road and pasture, through a series of ponds and
properties, including Dale Reiner's 300-acre cattle ranch. Reiner,
whose great-grandfather settled the homestead, recalled crossing
the channel recently, when the sun hit the water just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big school of fish, as big as the hood of (a
pickup) truck,'' Reiner said, his voice rising with enthusiasm.
``It's exciting to have these fish in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayre listened to Reiner with special satisfaction. Sayre has
spent the past 13 years working to save the salmon, measuring
success in the contents of fish traps, and the reactions of people
like Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   He thought a moment about the debate in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' he said, ``no matter what the
process, you have to end up with a bucket-full of fish.''

YANKEES GET RELIEF FROM UNLIKELY SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Don Zimmer is an equal opportunity manager. If you
do the job, he's going to use you, and it doesn't matter if you
have a multiyear contract or you are established with the Yankees,
or, like reliever Jason Grimsley, you are a journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley went to spring training nearly three years removed from
his last appearance in the major leagues, guessing he would open
the season in the minors. Because he has pitched well, and Jeff
Nelson and Mike Stanton have struggled, however, Zimmer is relying
on Grimsley more. He pitched two scoreless and pivotal innings on
Sunday in the Yankees' 9-8 victory over Kansas City, a crazy game
nearly given away by Hideki Irabu in the early innings and taken
back when Bernie Williams smashed a two-run home run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' said Zimmer, acknowledging the ragged play in
a contest that lasted 3 hours 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The path that has led Grimsley to the Yankees has zigged and
zagged: When he was 12, he lost the big toe of his left foot while
running a motorcycle over a stump, and because of a broken wrist
and a sore shoulder, he was unable to play baseball in his last two
years of high school. He impressed the Philadelphia Phillies in a
tryout camp and signed his first professional contract _ as a
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   But Grimsley became a pitcher, and as a hard thrower he
repeatedly got chances to establish himself as a starter for the
Phillies and then the Cleveland Indians and California Angels, and
repeatedly, his control failed him. He walked 74 batters in 1301/3
innings with California in 1996 and did not pitch in the majors
again until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley spent the '97 and '98 seasons in the minors, developing
his skills as a reliever; maybe, he suggested on Sunday, it just
took him a long time to find his niche, in the bullpen. He could
enter a game and stalk hitters with his hard, sinking fastball,
rather than refining three or four pitches. Grimsley had a 3.76
earned run average last year for Class AAA Buffalo, and one day,
Billy Connors _ the Yankees' director of player personnel _ saw him
pitch and was impressed with his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So Grimsley signed with the Yankees in January, with a subtle
strategy: He figured the Yankees' bullpen was so good and so
established that he would be sent to Class AAA out of spring
training and would get an extended opportunity to prove himself in
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' bullpen has been unstable: Darren Holmes,
unreliable in pressure situations last season, was traded at the
end of spring training, and Grimsley made the team. Now Nelson (11
walks in 101/3 innings) and Stanton (12 base runners in five and
one-third innings) are struggling. So Zimmer has turned to
Grimsley: For example, the right-hander assumed an 8-4 lead in the
eighth Saturday and pitched one and two-thirds scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Irabu was horrible, giving up six runs in four and
one-third innings, and he was relieved by Dan Naulty with the
Yankees losing, 6-2. But as is their habit, the Yankees roared
back, scoring five runs in the sixth to take a 7-6 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took over in the bottom half of that inning, walking two
with two out, and he escaped with the lead only when Chuck
Knoblauch charged a ground ball hit near second and, using only his
glove, flipped the ball to shortstop Derek Jeter for an
inning-ending force. ``Just instincts, really,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer jumped up off the bench on his two bad knees to
congratulate Knoblauch coming off the field. Nelson, however,
descended into further trouble in the seventh, walking the leadoff
hitter Mike Sweeney and giving up a single to Larry Sutton. First
and third and nobody out, and Zimmer turned to Grimsley, hoping for
a ground ball and a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, firing hard sinkers inside, got the first out on a
foul pop _ he has retired the first hitter he has faced in all
seven of his appearances _ and then struck out Chad Kreuter. He
jammed Carlos Febles with a fastball, but Febles managed to roll
the ball through the left side of the infield, a game-tying single.
Zimmer shrugged while recalling the hit later: unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley shut out the Royals in the eighth inning, however, and
in the ninth, Paul O'Neill beat out an infield hit. Williams was
next, fighting an odd slump. He is getting his share of hits, but
because his swing is out of sorts _ he has been rushing at the ball
and pulling out his front shoulder too soon _ he has not been
hitting with any power. He had hit only one home run.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Williams stayed back and waited. Jose Santiago threw
a high fastball, and Williams whacked it to dead center field, the
ball carrying far and landing on the grassy bank beyond the fence,
sinking into the hillside like a golf ball buried in a sand trap.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Williams had slid headlong into first base
and hit the bag with his midsection, and it was all he could do to
stand and smile at his distress. But the lingering pain went away
as soon as the ball carried over the wall in the ninth inning, and
Williams pranced around the bases on his toes, joyfully.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley was the winning pitcher to move to 2-0, and he will get
more chances, Zimmer said. ``You get a guy hot in the bullpen,''
Zimmer said, ``and that's who you go to.''

BELCHER TRIES TO BE PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After 12 seasons and more than 2,300 innings
pitched, Tim Belcher's perspective is a little better than his
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to tell him he has pitched terribly in his first
season with the Anaheim Angels, especially last Tuesday when he
blew a 10-0 lead against Toronto. His ERA is 9.13
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago (with Kansas City), I was 0-3 in April and wound up
winning 14 games for a last-place team,'' said Belcher, who is
making his sixth start today against the Chicago White Sox. ``The
only difference is I was throwing well last year when I didn't win
until May 10. I am not throwing well now and believe me, no one
knows it better than me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unless you've been a pitcher, you have no idea what it is
like to stand out on that mound and get your brains beat in. That's
a lonely place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of panicking, Belcher, 37, is confident he will come
around. Instead of throwing between starts in the bullpen, Belcher
played long toss in the outfield during the week. Pitching coach
Dick Pole hasn't tried to tinker with his mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start thinking too much, try to change everything,''
Belcher said. ``I've been making bad pitches, but I've done that
before and pulled out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said the team has viewed tapes of
Belcher from years past and remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He no longer has the overpowering fastball so he isn't going
to be blowing guys away,'' Collins said. ``That means the margin of
error is going to be less. But we signed him to a two-year deal
because we think he can do the job and we still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who had his best seasons with the Dodgers a decade ago,
is now more of a finesse pitcher. He won 42 games in three seasons
with the lowly Kansas City Royals and said that production did not
disappear over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back of the baseball card doesn't lie,'' he said of his
statistics. ``Judge me at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   First steps: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, sidelined since early
March with a broken left forearm, took ground balls for the first
time before Saturday's game. DiSarcina, not expected back until
after the All-Star break, was encouraged but has no immediate plans
to take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My range of motion was pretty good, better than I figured it
would be,'' DiSarcina said. ``But the strength is something I have
to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina said the strangest thing was putting a glove on his
left hand. He suffered the fracture during batting practice when he
was struck by a stray fungo off the bat of coach George Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt the urge to put a bat in my hands,'' he said.''

CLINTON TO MEET WITH RUSSIAN ENVOY ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to make 2nd sentence of 2nd graf more accurate.)  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Sunday that President Clinton
planned to meet Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy for the
Balkans, on Monday to discuss possible solutions to the war in
Kosovo. Administration officials said it was unclear whether the
Russian was bringing any new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The visit follows Chernomyrdin's meeting with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Friday, and a series of
diplomatic moves by Milosevic, including the abrupt release of
three American prisoners of war. The moves were apparently aimed at
improving Milosevic's image in the West even as his forces were
expelling some 20,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo's second-largest
town, Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to see Chernomyrdin after Russian President Boris
Yeltsin telephoned the president Sunday morning and asked him to
see the envoy, the White House said. Clinton and Yeltsin did not
discuss the substance of what Chernomyrdin wanted to talk about,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, administration officials _ who have watched as
Milosevic tried to seize the diplomatic initiative in the last
three days _ remained resolute in their determination to continue
the bombing of Yugoslavia and to stick with NATO's demands for
ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said. ``Today we
reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they too can return with
security and self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott dismissed as a ``PR
stunt'' a letter from the Yugoslav leader to Clinton, which
contained a suggestion of a meeting between the American and
Yugoslav leaders, according to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who left
Belgrade Sunday with the three freed American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott insisted that NATO was bombing Milosevic's government,
not negotiating with it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium,
that Milosevic could not expect a reward for the release of the
captured soldiers. Indeed, the ferocity of the air war seemed
unabated, as Belgrade and much of Yugoslavia were blacked out after
NATO struck a major power plant on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they did not know what else in the
form of specific proposals was in the letter that Jackson was
bringing from Milosevic. They expected to learn its contents when
Clinton meets with Jackson late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration officials said they considered
Chernomyrdin's visit more important than the aftermath of Jackson's
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic interpretation of Chernomyrdin's visit was
that it showed that Milosevic was beginning to feel the pressure
from the stepped-up NATO air assaults and was putting out feelers
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see if there is anything real or it's all for
show,'' a senior administration official said. ``We want to hear
Chernomyrdin out and hear his sense of the lay of the land. It's a
tough time to say no to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's visit was potentially the first in a series of
diplomatic efforts this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels on
Wednesday, en route to visiting with U.S. troops based in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His NATO visit was planned before Chernomyrdin's trip to
Washington was scheduled. But diplomats said it was possible that
Clinton would discuss the Russian efforts with the North Atlantic
Council, NATO's chief decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow announced that Chernomyrdin would also go to New York to
brief U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. From there, he will go to
London and Paris, Moscow said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's travels suggested that he was assuming the mantle
of ``shuttle diplomat'' on Kosovo, a position the Russians coveted,
a senior administration official said. But there were mixed
opinions among Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers about
Chernomyrdin's taking on this role at this point, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has encouraged the Russians to play an active
role in trying to mediate the Kosovo war, in part because of
concern that the air assaults cannot go on indefinitely without
losing American public support. There is also concern about how
long European members of NATO can remain united in their support of
the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   And, not least, the administration has been keen to hand Russia
a major role as a way of positioning Moscow within the
anti-Milosevic fold and isolating the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Milosevic's moves in the last three days _ the
release of the three American prisoners, an interview in which he
outlined his ideas for a settlement, and a nine-hour discussion
with Chernomyrdin on Friday _ were an effort to show that he can be
reasoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Yugoslav leader has shown no flexibility on
NATO's key demand: an international security force in Kosovo, with
NATO at its core. A strong military force is essential, NATO has
said, to insure the return of more than 600,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees and to protect them once they are home.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with United Press International, Milosevic said
he would agree to a ``United Nations mission'' composed of European
countries that did not belong to NATO, as well as Russia. Members
of this mission could be lightly armed with defensive weapons, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader also suggested that he would start to draw
down his troops in Kosovo if NATO withdrew its forces in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials immediately rejected Milosevic's proposals. Under
his conditions, they said, the refugees would refuse to go back to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, NATO has modified its language on what
would constitute an international security force, shifting from a
force led by NATO to a force with NATO at its core, and finally to
a force that NATO was ``ready'' to lead.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said it was crucial in the talks with
Chernomyrdin not to waver on the issue of the force. If the
alliance showed any lack of firmness on this issue, the official
said, Milosevic would sit back and wait for further weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had been discouraged by the White House from going
to Belgrade to try to secure the release of the prisoners, appeared
to have grasped some initiative from the administration through his
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Journeying with the three released soldiers first to Croatia,
and then to Germany, Jackson said in repeated interviews that the
administration should stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said that Clinton told Jackson in a
telephone call after the release of the soldiers that NATO would
continue with its airstrikes. The spokesman added that Clinton did
thank Jackson for securing the release of the three, and would meet
with him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said that by releasing the
prisoners and sending a letter to Clinton, Milosevic was intent on
putting ``us in a sticky position.'' By making his various offers,
the Yugoslav leader was clearly hoping to split the NATO alliance,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In Milosevic's mind, he said, the idea that a U.N. mission in
Kosovo could be lightly armed was probably a concession. In
December, the Yugoslav leader rejected an appeal from the American
head of the international monitoring mission, William Walker, that
the monitors be allowed to carry side arms.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-member bipartisan delegation from Congress, after meeting
in Vienna, Austria, for two days with a group of Russian lawmakers
and a representative of Milosevic, put forth their own ideas for a
peace framework, but NATO said it was not interested. Their
statement called for ``a parallel solution'' involving an end to
NATO's bombing, withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, and a
halt to armed resistance by the Kosovo Liberation Army's
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The American lawmakers were led by Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and
Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said efforts like
this were worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, that as Jesse Jackson would say, give peace a chance
here,'' he said on the CNN program ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be some momentum,'' he said. ``There seems to
be an opportunity _ we should seize this moment. As a matter of
fact, you know, I had doubts about the bombing campaign from the
beginning. I didn't think we had done enough in the diplomatic
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said there was ``wiggle room'' in negotiations over the
composition and military power of any international force that
would move into Kosovo to enforce a peace agreement. ``I don't, for
instance, see why the United States has to have troops involved,''
he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: JAGR `SMELLED A CHANCE' FOR THE WINNING GOAL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Two weeks ago, Wayne Gretzky passed the torch to
Jaromir Jagr, and Sunday Jagr burned the Devils with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by a pulled groin muscle, Jagr had missed the past four
games of this opening round Stanley Cup playoff, but with the
Penguins one defeat from elimination, he returned for Sunday's
sixth game. And with the Devils leading, 2-1, the Penguins were
less than three minutes from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jagr scored the tying goal, then in the overtime he
scored the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we think we've run out of things that he's done that are
pretty incredible,'' said Kevin Constantine, the Penguins' coach,
``he does something incredible again.''
</P>
<P>
   But in any sport, that's what great players do. That's why they
are great players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys, he can be out and come back and play
great,'' defenseman Bobby Dollas was saying now in the Penguins
dressing room. ``I've played with Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne, Steve
Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov, but he's the best player in the league.
Hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils agree. So does just about everybody else in the NHL.
With 127 points, including 44 goals, the 6-foot-2-inch Jagr led the
league in scoring during the recent season, and he is expected to
be voted the Hart trophy as its most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Gretzky passed him the torch.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Jaromir Jagr did Sunday what other great hockey
players such as Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard, Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr,
Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Mario Lemieux often did in the
playoffs _ score a theatrical goal (or two) when their teams needed
that goal (or two).
</P>
<P>
   And with those two goals, the 27-year-old right wing from the
Czech Republic created Tuesday night's decisive seventh game at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tying goal,'' Jagr, in a Penguins warm-up suit, was saying
now, ``German Titov made a good play and beat the guy outside, then
he threw it to the net and I just hit the puck, and it was kind of
a lucky goal that just went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, Jagr had seemed to be skating carefully,
tenderly so as not to aggravate his groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `I cannot skate very well up and down,''' he
said. ``I asked my teammates to just dump it in and try to play it
in the corners. That's where I can play and it doesn't hurt me at
all. But if I go long strides, it kind of hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 29 minutes 35 seconds on the ice, had he skated full
speed at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the last play,'' Jagr replied, smiling, ``because I
smelled a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He drilled a point-blank shot past goaltender Martin Brodeur for
the third overtime playoff goal of his career. Two weeks earlier,
he had scored the overtime goal in the season finale against the
Rangers that momentarily silenced Gretzky's great goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a lot of games during the season in overtime,'' Jagr
said, alluding to a Penguins-record seven overtime victories.
``That's what we said in the room before the overtime. Play a smart
game and skate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, however, couldn't skate with the sudden bursts of speed
that have terrified goaltenders throughout his career. He was
wearing what he called ``new pants to hold my leg a little
tighter.'' And when he was asked to evaluate his skating ability on
a scale of 100 percent, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the corners 90, skating back and forth 60,'' he said. ``But
there are days when 60 is better than 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those days in what, if the Devils win Sunday
night, could have been the Penguins' last game in Civic Arena for
this bankrupt franchise. Lemieux is hoping to obtain the franchise,
but a bankruptcy court judge will make that decision. If Lemieux's
bid fails, the franchise may be dissolved or go elsewhere, perhaps
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this game is going to save the team,'' Jagr
said, ``but the city and the people owe Mario a lot. He was the guy
that made hockey here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of Sunday's game being the last for the
Penguins in what is known here as the Igloo contributed to Jagr's
decision to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I wanted to play the game,'' he said. ``I wanted to
hear the fans. I knew they would be crazy like they always are. I
wanted to hear them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for the last time. And if it was the last time, all those
Penguins fans will always remember how Jaromir Jagr's torch burned
the Devils.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH, Pa. _ On the brink of capturing their opening round
Stanley Cup playoff series, the New Jersey Devils were victimized
by the Pittsburgh Penguins' star Jaromir Jagr Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Making an electrifying return from a groin injury that had kept
him out of four previous games, Jagr tied the score with a goal
late in the third period and sent the Devils to a 3-2 defeat with
another goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr took advantage of the Devils' conservative play after they
had a one-goal lead and enabled the Penguins to force a seventh and
deciding game in New Jersey Tuesday night. The loss was the sixth
overtime setback in a row in playoff action for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little stunned and shocked,'' Devils defenseman Brad
Bombardir said, ``but this is playoff hockey and things like this
happen when you have the best player in the league playing. We can
take the blame, though, because we became a little conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik and Brian Rolston were the severest critics of the
Devils' strategy after they took a 2-1 lead at 4 minutes 34 seconds
of the third period on Scott Niedermayer's first goal in the
playoffs. The Devils kept banging the puck out of their defensive
zone instead maintaining control through the neutral zone. As a
result, most of the action took place near goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the lead,'' Holik said, ``we didn't keep playing
the way we gained the lead. This team is not good when it sits back
like this. Our game is to control the puck and forecheck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, we held back too early,'' Rolston said. ``Now
we're in a do-or-die situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils paid tribute to Jagr, the NHL's leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the league, and you have to respect
him,'' Holik said.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's presence lifted the Penguins and the crowd at Civic
Arena, which was rocking when it learned that Jagr had not been
scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr tied the game with 2:12 left in regulation when he pounced
on a loose puck from a shot by German Titov and jammed it into the
net from Brodeur's left doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely my responsibility to not let that guy beat me
to the net,'' said Niedermayer, who slipped on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's winner came at 8:49 of overtime, from near the bottom of
the right circle, when he one-timed Martin Straka's pass from the
other side after Straka got around Niedermayer, who had fallen
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just unbelievable,'' his teammate Brad Werenka said of
Jagr's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr was hobbled so badly that he could barely stand up on
skates before the Devils' 4-3 victory Friday in Game 5. He talked
pessimistically Saturday of playing in Sunday's game, but became
more encouraged after being fitted with some scuba-diver's pants
that provided more support and partly eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good,'' Jagr said. ``The new pants held my leg a
little tighter and I felt much better when I skated. That's when I
decided to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin opened the scoring at 12:04 of the first period,
scoring on a backhander from the lower slot off Holik's one-handed
pass from behind the net. But Straka tied it for Pittsburgh when he
was left alone at the side of the net and directed Alexei Kovalev's
pass by Brodeur at 6:44 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer broke the tie when Jason Arnott's shot hit him in
the right leg and bounced in past Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur faced 28 shots, four in the overtime, and could not be
blamed for Jagr's goals. Brodeur's best moments came in the third
period while the Devils were protecting their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Robbie Ftorek said that he was pleased with
Brodeur's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with emotion,'' Ftorek said, ``but we also iced the
puck an awful lot. We like to control the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, admitted that his team did
not always get the matchup it wanted against Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them the opportunities to make plays,'' Stevens said.
``I think we started too early in the third to sit back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, Ftorek and the rest of the Devils, said that they were
not surprised that Jagr made his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were facing elimination,'' Rolston said. ``I think he had
to play. Every time he plays against us, he does well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we didn't take advantage of our chance,''
Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ``Jagr came up with some big
plays for them, but I like the fact that we play the last game at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's Game 7,'' Ftorek said of Tuesday's
deciding game. ``It's now Game 1.'' &QL;

PACERS GIVE KNICKS A RUDE AWAKENING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The New York Knicks spent the past week flirting
with everyone, winking and smiling and crooking their finger. But
after all the attention Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell had
attracted for their recent flash of style, after all the Knicks had
done to pitch themselves as a fun night out, they were exposed by
the Indiana Pacers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As undisciplined as toddlers, the Knicks thumbed their nose at
their coach's strategy, ignored their assignments and reverted to
the kind of lazy defense that left Indiana's Chris Mullin drifting
alone in 3-point territory.
</P>
<P>
   This carelessness when they were trying to seal a playoff spot
was as surprising as the ease with which the Pacers overwhelmed
them in a 94-71 loss at Market Square Arena. The Knicks (25-23) did
move closer to clinching the final Eastern Conference playoff spot,
but only because the Charlotte Hornets lost later Sunday night in
Miami. The Knicks, who hold the tie breaker against the Hornets,
lead them by one game with two games to play and can clinch the
playoff spot with a victory against Boston on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continually forget who we are as a team,'' Coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ``When we play well, we're a defensive team first. And
we pass as the first option and not as a last option. We were
trying to hit home runs by ourselves. And we were making it up
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a departure from the kind of unselfish offense and
buttoned-down defense they had played to win four of their previous
five games. Throwing away their map, the Knicks lost Mullin while
he made three 3-pointers in the third quarter. When Charlie Ward
was slow to find him twice, Mullin hit back-to-back 3-pointers to
help turn the Pacers' 14-point halftime lead into a gaudy 22-point
lead just three minutes into the third quarter. A timeout was
called by a furious Van Gundy, but he made no substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than take out all five of them, which you could do,''
Van Gundy said, then paused. ``You can't just pinpoint one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, an assortment of Knicks, from Larry Johnson to
Sprewell, had left the Pacers open to hit 8 of 16 3-pointers. Amid
the flurry, Mullin hit all four of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Mullin is a great shooter, and we left him open,'' Van
Gundy said. ``It was like target practice for him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin aimed and scored a game-high 20 points, so Reggie Miller
did not have to. The pinstripe-thin Miller is usually the one who
wiggles free and dashes the Knicks' hopes, but he scored just 6
points on 2-for-8 shooting. His sluggish counterpart, Houston,
could not take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   The pixie dust on the duo of Houston and Sprewell _ who had
seemed to get over their awkward partnership and synchronize
themselves this past week _ was brushed off by a more physical
Pacers defense. After finding each other over the last week and
setting off the kind of ball movement that leads to open shots,
Sprewell finished Sunday's game with two assists and Houston had
one for a team that had just 11 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was an example of how fragile and unpredictable the Knicks'
success this season has been. One glitch in the system, and the
Knicks ended the game shooting 33.7 percent while the Pacers shot
50 percent. Those crazy, unorthodox runners by Sprewell were not
falling over the windmill arms of Derrick McKey, and Houston's
drives were going nowhere with Dale Davis and Rik Smits patrolling
the paint. There was no one to bail Houston and Sprewell out while
they combined to make just 11 of 34 shots from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never found a rhythm as a whole,'' Houston said. ``When
we're moving and passing, we shoot well. We didn't today. I don't
know if that has anything to do with Patrick being there or not.''
</P>
<P>
   As a futile fourth quarter unfolded, Patrick Ewing had cut off
the thick ankle tape around his left Achilles' tendon and was
sitting on the bench in his socks. He had been lifted by Van Gundy
with the Knicks trailing by 22 points eight minutes into the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he took me out,'' Ewing said. ``But that's
part of the game, I guess. I didn't say anything. You have to wait
until your number is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was best to save Ewing for the Knicks' increasingly
important game against Boston on Monday night at Madison Square
Garden. Maybe it was best to save him from himself. Although he
unearthed enough jumpers to score 15 points on 6-of-14 shooting
from the field, he was practically helpless on defense. Twice in
the first half, the lumbering Smits drove right by an immobile
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he seemed like a ball and chain for the kind of
fast-paced style Sprewell and company had been able to show of late
in his absence. Not knowing when and if Ewing will be able to play
from game to game is also something that toys with the team's
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing's 24 minutes of floor time was hardly the reason for
the Knicks' inexplicable lack of discipline in a game in which they
needed to focus more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why this happened,'' Sprewell said. ``No one can
put a finger on it. We didn't execute as well as we should have. I
thought we tried to stick to what was drawn up, but we missed
coverages and blew assignments. It was disappointing, not
surprising, but more disappointing. We needed this game, and we
couldn't get it.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE KNICKS' PROBLEM WILL NOT JUST GO AWAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ No less a legend than Larry Bird knows how it
feels to be Patrick Ewing. Bird has been there, the center of
attention who is accomplished but aging, injured and anxious,
determined yet tentative.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his own brilliant career, Bird was exactly where
Ewing is now, day to day, in and out, the sometimes star. As
painful as this was for the Boston Celtics, Bird said it was worse
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're off for a week, without really practicing,
everything feels different,'' Bird said Sunday after his Indiana
Pacers toyed with Ewing and the Knicks, 94-71, at Market Square
Arena. ``You're fighting the game instead of it being fluid. Your
legs aren't there. You're hands aren't there. The lighting feels
brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   When the arena lights blind your star, the result can be a messy
crash and a multiplayer pileup. After Ewing informed his coach,
Jeff Van Gundy, that he was ready to go on his aching left
Achilles' tendon, the Knicks went out and collectively looked very
much like the eighth-seeded playoff team they still have an
excellent chance of being. They shot 33 percent from the field.
They had 11 assists to the Pacers' 24. The Pacers, never
threatened, needed not a single jump shot from Reggie Miller, their
own leading man.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to blame this on Ewing, but beyond this
particular game it would also be naive to ignore the crimp that his
uncertain availability puts into the most modest of the Knicks'
post-season plans. With the `A' game they brought Sunday, the
Pacers are better than the Knicks, but with Ewing back as an
offensive hub, as their leading scorer, the Knicks were simply not
the best team they can be.
</P>
<P>
   After 80 points in three games, Latrell Sprewell cooled off.
Allan Houston missed 12 of 17 shots. Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley
did little defensive intimidating with their reduced minutes. The
power forward, Kurt Thomas, shot 1 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had a statistically rewarding first half, including 13 of
his 15 points. The Knicks also finished the half with the grand
total of 32, discombobulated and down by 14. Late in the half, on
successive possessions, Rik Smits blew by an immobile Ewing for
dunks _ first from the right baseline, then straight out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to settle for the jump shot, but I saw him coming out
at me,'' Smits said. ``I've been in the same boat as him with bad
feet, and I know how tough it is to run out at a guy and recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the acting team president, should be terrified
to know that the typically glacial Smits added that Ewing looked
``a little slow.'' Ewing was benched after he missed his first four
shots of the third quarter as the Knicks fell behind by 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1990s, Bird's status was more closely
scrutinized than the Celtics' daily price on the New York Stock
Exchange. He had aching feet, a cranky back and Michael Jordan
coming fast to take over the sport. Bird desperately hung on for
``one more'' and played when he could. Psychologically, young
players like Dee Brown and Reggie Lewis had no choice but to share
his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, 'cause you know Patrick wants to do his best,''
Bird said. ``The other guys have got to make the adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   This is easy for Bird to say. For one thing, not a soul in
Boston, where he had won three championships, would dare to
question him slipping in and out of his rightful role. For another,
Bird, a visionary passer, made everyone better by just showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when Sprewell first entered the game Sunday, Chris
Mullin was guarding him, a flagrant mismatch. Good teams invariably
seize such chances to punish a coach for trying to get away with
even one possession. Ewing, catching the ball on the left side,
turned and faced Smits, offered a series of head and shoulder
fakes, drove the lane and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, itching to get active after almost eight minutes on
the bench, shook his head and ran downcourt.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would have lost Sunday no matter how they played it,
but the Ewing Watch is wearing on them. Van Gundy, the most
passionate of Ewing loyalists, had to admit as much. Before the
game, he started to call the situation ``disruptive,'' stopped
himself at ``disrupt'' and changed it to ``a little disruptive.''
Then he talked about how much Ewing's lack of practice, as much as
his injury, has an impact on his play and affects potential
matchups and players' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more for them to think about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a touchy subject, Ewing as the go-to player who may not go,
more so than last season, with the explosive Sprewell around. It is
a minefield the organization has never made much effort to defuse.
At this point, still believing he is in position to make the calls,
even on who coaches, it is unlikely that Ewing is going to take a
more realistic look at himself.
</P>
<P>
   This problem does not go away if the Knicks make the playoffs. &QL;

BASEBALL COLUMN: CASTRO TAKES BREAK FROM DAY JOB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Cubans were not in the building at the time they
were originally advertised to be there, so the most compelling
issue of the day was moot. The Cuban national baseball team was
delayed in arriving here, so the evening workout that was to be
closed to everyone else was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The burning question had been whether the Cubans' leader and
chief strategist would be at Camden Yards, overseeing the secret
workout.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, who apparently has harbored a long latent,
deep-seated desire to be the Latin George Steinbrenner, was
instrumental in preparing the Cubans for their game against the
Baltimore Orioles Monday night. A report out of Cuba last week said
that Castro had been attending the Cubans' daily workouts and had
been involved in ``all aspects of the team's tactical and
logistical preparations'' for the second game of the two-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first game, in Havana on March 28, Castro had limited
himself to a pregame visit to the team's dugout, where all the
players gathered around and heard his words of encouragement. They
were not quite enough, however, because as well as they played, the
Cubans lost to the Orioles, 3-2, in 11 innings. Castro obviously
decided more of his input was needed to gain a split of the
controversial series.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, however, might have overplayed his hand. When the
Orioles played in Havana, they had not yet begun the season and
were an unknown quantity apart from the fact that they were one of
the highest-paid teams in the major leagues. They completed their
fourth week of the season Sunday and boy, are they known now. They
have by far the worst record in the American League, making them,
for now, the worst overpaid team in baseball history. If this is
capitalism, the Cubans really don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Havana game was a bad omen for the Orioles (Scott
Erickson was the starting pitcher in that game and hasn't won yet
in five decisions) and laid the groundwork for their disastrous
start that apparently has the general manager, Frank Wren, as well
as the manager, Ray Miller, in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Angelos, the owner, said recently that Miller wasn't going
to be fired, though how much time and how many games that position
will cover Angelos didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening cannot be attributed to his lack of
managerial competence,'' is what Angelos did say. Because Angelos
handpicked Miller to replace Davy Johnson, who was forced out after
the 1997 season, the owner's wrath may settle on Wren, the team's
first-year general manager, whom Angelos can blame for putting this
mess together. An executive of another team said Sunday that word
was circulating along the baseball grapevine that Wren might soon
be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Castro did not fire his manager for losing the game in Havana.
Alfonso Urquiola will be in Cuba's dugout again Monday night.
However, nine of the players he had for the first game will not be
there with him. Neither will German Mesa, who is arguably the best
shortstop in Cuban history.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's absence from the 25-man roster is not surprising. When he
was reinstated this past Cuban league season from suspension, which
he shared with the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez, it was said that he
would not be allowed to play games in other countries. That status
either was extended punishment for the thoughts of defecting that
he was suspected of harboring or a guarantee against his defection
now.
</P>
<P>
   Defection has been a hot topic of speculation. Some of the
players who have defected in the past few years, such as Rey
Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop, escaped the grasp of the Castro
regime when the national team was playing in practice games or
international tournaments in the United States or other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the Orioles and the Clinton administration
would be in an embarrassing position if any players were to defect
because the Orioles worked hard to get the game here and
administration officials helped facilitate it.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable additions to the Cuban roster are first baseman
Orestes Kindelan and second baseman Antonio Pacheco, who missed the
Havana game because their team was playing in the championship
round of the Cuban league playoffs. Kindelan is the career leading
home run hitter in Cuban history, but his production has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Omar Linares, one of the greatest players Cuba has
had, is on the roster again. His two-out single in the eighth
inning tied the first game, 2-2, but when he had a chance to win it
in the 10th, he popped up for the third out with runners at first
and second.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Contreras is on the roster again, too. The Orioles may not
want to see him. He relieved Jose Ibar, the starter, in the third
inning and baffled the Orioles for the next eight innings, allowing
two hits and striking out 10. He fanned Albert Belle twice and
induced him to ground into an inning-ending double play after
walking Will Clark intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans have not said whether Contreras will start. They may
have to await last-minute word from their chief strategist.
Contreras or Ibar, Irabu or Mendoza. Same thing.

<P>
   Sang Lan, the Chinese gymnast who was paralyzed in a warm-up
vault at the Goodwill Games last summer, and her mother, Chen
Xiufeng, were looking at an anatomy chart recently at the Burke
Rehabilitation Institute in White Plains, N.Y. The mother ran her
hand along the chart's gray-colored regions, where her daughter
will probably never regain feeling, and the two spoke in Mandarin
for a few seconds before retreating into a familiar silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult adjustment Sang will have to make
upon her return to China on June 2 is sharing a life with a mother
she hardly knows. It will be a relationship more intertwined than
either could have imagined, since Sang requires constant care.
</P>
<P>
   Sang's mother has been living with her for months in the Armonk,
N.Y., home of K.S. Liu, and his wife, Gina, who are Sang's
guardians here. While Chen has performed most of the intimate
caregiving tasks, the Lius have provided a welcome buffer between
mother and daughter, who spent 11 years apart while Sang trained to
become a champion. That buffer will come down now that Sang's visa
is about to expire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she and her mother will be able to bridge their
long separation, Sang answered through Gina Liu's translation,
``It's difficult to tell.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sang's mother, also through Liu, said, ``We're together every
day and our feelings will be closer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sang and Chen plan to settle in a Beijing apartment near the
China Rehabilitation and Research Center, the nation's best
neurological hospital. Sang's father, a housing official, will
remain in the family's hometown of Ningbo, south of Shanghai. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there's difficulty for the family, but I will face
it,'' Chen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If any major surgery needs to be done, Sang will return to the
United States, where she is insured for up to $10 million in
medical expenses. Everyday life in China, however, will test a bond
that turned awkward through the years. On a recent Monday afternoon
at the Lius' home, an outgoing Sang chatted with Gina Liu and a
Chinese television crew while the reserved Chen receded into the
background. Their lack of communication was normal, the Lius said,
because they have nothing to talk about. Chen said she had to get
used to Sang's constant talking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the Chinese government, Sang left home against her
mother's wish at age 6 to attend a gymnastics academy in Beijing.
She eventually became the Chinese national champion in the vault
and an Olympic hopeful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last July 21, during a routine practice vault at Nassau Coliseum
in Uniondale, N.Y., Sang's momentum carried her an extra revolution
on a flip. Unable to complete the flip, she landed headfirst onto
the mat, the impact causing a frightening crack. Sang had crushed
her spine, leaving her paralyzed from the chest down. She has some
movement in her shoulders and wrists, but cannot flex her fingers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that I won't be able to walk again,'' Sang said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sang has improved her motor skills to the point that she can
feed herself with a spoon that is attached to her left wrist with
Velcro. Her therapists said she is the model patient, pushing
through 20 repetitions of an exercise when asked to do 10. &QL;

<P>
   ``I was a gymnast,'' Sang said. ``I used to do a very difficult
action, but now I can't do anything myself, even a simple thing
like getting water. That has made me upset, discouraged, because
there's not much progress.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sang, usually smiling and babbling, grimaced into a picture of
concentration when she tried to squirm from a table into her
wheelchair. No sensation in her triceps makes applying leverage
difficult. Chen rarely took her eyes off Sang during the 90 minutes
of upper-body drills, stretching done by the therapists, and light
weight lifting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chen said she is prepared to devote her life to her daughter,
although still angry at Sang for leaving home. ``If we stay more
time together, that will be forgotten,'' Chen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sang, who turns 18 on June 11, has assured her mother privately
that she will someday be self-sufficient, and has asked her not to
cry so much. Gina Liu said that Chen has put up a positive front to
mask her devastation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's admiration for her daughter is genuine. Chen recalled
a spoiled little girl who cried when she did not get her way. Now
she is getting to know a courageous young woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine she could deal with this,'' Chen said. &QL;

BRONCOS MARVEL AT ELWAY'S TALENTS

<P>
   DENVER, _ For Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe, quarterback John
Elway was like Halley's comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only comes along every 77 years,'' Sharpe said, ``and I got
an opportunity to play with him. That's what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who had delayed his retirement announcement for more than
a week out of respect for the victims of the shooting at Columbine
High School in nearby Littleton and their families, made it
official Sunday at a news conference. It was a scene filled with
laughter, tears and memories of Elway's illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 members of the media, family, friends, coaches,
teammates and the Broncos owner' crammed into a hotel conference
room as Elway stepped away from the mike on several occasions to
regain his composure.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Elway's wife, Janet, rushed to the podium with a
box of tissues and a glass of water from the front row, where she
sat with their four children. Elway gasped and apologized, then he
kept trying to insert humor into the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's time to retire,'' Elway said, ``because I'm
getting to the point where people are asking me to trace over old
autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   One surprise attendee Sunday was the former Broncos owner Edgar
Kaiser, who clandestinely engineered a trade for Elway with the
Baltimore Colts. Kaiser said that he hadn't even informed his
coach, Dan Reeves, of the trade on May 2, 1983, until Elway, the
No. 1 pick in the NF L draft, was a Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember flying up to the Northwest to pick John up and
riding down on the airplane together,'' Kaiser said. ``John and I
were both nervous. John was really nervous as a kid. So we got him
in the jump seat in the cockpit so he could relax a little bit. And
I said, `John, you're not going to believe this, but there's going
to be quite a scrum at the Bronco headquarters.' And indeed there
was.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elway created another scene Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day for him,'' Sharpe said, ``walking away from
football after nearly 30 years of playing the game. I knew it would
be. But if it had been me, I'd have still been crying. I have to
admit it was tough for me to watch. He's so big, so strong _ it's
almost enough to make you break down. I had to hold back a couple
of times.''
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years, it's going to be tough on Denver sports fans to
not see their greatest sports legend in his No. 7 jersey. And what
will Elway miss most?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss the huddle, and telling Sharpe to be quiet,'' Elway
said, drawing the biggest laugh of the day at the expense of the
tight end. ``I know you're open, I know you're open, I know you're
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those there to pay respects was Elway's close friend and
coach Gary Kubiak, who backed up Elway for more than a decade and
returned under Mike Shanahan as quarterback coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest improviser ever to play the game,'' Kubiak
said. ``As a coach, you draw up all these plays that look good on
paper, but in all honesty, 5 or 10 of them never go the way they're
planned. At that time, an athlete takes over. And when it was time
to take over, he was the greatest ever to do that.''

GORDON BACK ON TRACK WITH HELP FROM CREW
</HEADLINE>

By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ So much for the demise of Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion, who had suffered
through several racing misfortunes in recent weeks, proved he still
has a dominating team Sunday by easily winning the third California
500 before an estimated 117,000 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt like we've been out of contention,'' said
Gordon. ``We've always known what we're made of. I've been saying
all year long that our team is better then they've ever been. I
think (Sunday) certainly proved it. (Crew chief Ray Evernham) and
the guys set up the race car just perfect. The horsepower
underneath the hood was just incredible, and we had great pit
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gordon credited the latter with being the difference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last pit stop was the key,'' said Gordon, who went from a
two-second lead to a four-second advantage following a pit on lap
208. ``When it comes to crunch time, when the pressure is on and
it's time to make a great pit stop, that's what these guys do. I
got to the pits as fast as I could, got to pit road and they did
the rest of the work and got me out really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, though, said the driver deserves some credit as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make up seconds in the pits anymore,'' he said. ``A
lot of that is how fast you get to pit road. Jeff did a good job
keeping the car clean and getting it to pit road. He actually made
up more for us there than the guys had in the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stop, Gordon increased his advantage to 7.3 seconds
before Jeff Burton made a futile charge over the final 30 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that (Gordon) was running as hard as he could,''
said Burton, who trimmed the deficit to as little as 3.01 seconds
before losing by 4.492. I suspect that he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Gordon, who saw his lead shrink by nearly two
seconds between Laps 230 and 234.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off real hard on new tires,'' Gordon said. ``I couldn't
give up too much time on new tires. I was running real, real hard,
trying to pull away and get through traffic as quick as I could. I
think I sort of used up the right rear tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Burton) was coming on strong, and I felt like I used it up a
little bit. When he started closing in, I was definitely trying to
make sure I hit all my marks just right and not make any
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the race was Gordon's or Burton's to lose. They traded
leads several times and held as much as a 20-car length advantage
at one point during the first half of the 250-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We swapped leads quite a few times,'' Gordon said. ``If I got
the lead and he got behind me it would loosen me up and I would
have to give him that position. It's very hard to lead here if
you've got somebody right behind you. I really wanted to ride
behind him and tighten the car up and wait for the (tire) pressures
to build up and then try to get the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Gordon slipped by Burton on lap 127, then took
advantage of that famous Gordon luck that he has converted into
three points titles.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Gordon pitted from the lead on lap 131, giving the
edge to Mark Martin. Veteran Rick Rudd then blew his engine and
struck the outside wall between turns 3 and 4, bringing out the
caution. Gordon was able to exit the pits before the pace car
brought the field around, allowing him to continue on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw what was happening, I kept my eyes on the
leader,'' Evernham said. ``You always try to pick a pit stall past
the start-finish line. That's one of the reasons we do that. We had
a fairly big lead (on Martin) when we pitted. The (crew) once again
had a good pit stop. I knew that once Jeff got off the jack and
rolling, Mark just then crossed the start-finish line, so we
weren't a lap down. The anxious moments came after we realized
weren't a lap down and realized we could have been.''

GORDON, PIT CREW TEAM UP FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Cancel those thoughts about Jeff Gordon having
used up all his luck in NASCAR Winston Cup competition. The rainbow
that appeared over the California Speedway on Friday must have been
an omen for Sunday as Gordon and his Rainbow Warriors pit crew put
together a dominating effort to win the NAPA California 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory was his second in the pair of Winston Cup races
run at the Fontana track. ``This was really special,'' said Gordon,
who beat Jeff Burton's Ford to the finish line by 4.492 seconds
after 250 laps before an estimated 117,000. Bobby Labonte and Joe
Gibbs' Pontiac teammate Tony Stewart, a rookie, were next, followed
by another Ford driver, Dale Jarrett. Ward Burton, Jeremy Mayfield,
Wally Dallenbach and Terry Labonte also finished on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the race, Gordon had crashed in three of the last four
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put Texas and Talladega behind us,'' said Gordon,
who failed to finish both races after being involved in crashes and
prompted talk about his bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending Winston Cup champion was last in a 43-car
field at Fort Worth and 38th last week in Alabama. But there was
none of that on Sunday. Gordon's crew, led by Ray Evernham, turned
in two pit stops that were more than luck. One allowed the DuPont
Chevrolet driver to remain on the lead lap and the last one
solidified the run to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit stop (on lap 208) is what did it,'' said Gordon, the
lone driver to score top-five finishes in all three races at the
two-mile, D-shaped speedway. ``When it comes to crunch time, when
the pressure is on and it's time to make a great pit stop, that's
what these guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who was leading by 2.5 seconds when he came in,
surrendered the lead to Stewart. However, Gordon, who re-entered
the fray just 4.5 seconds behind the leader, regained the point on
the next lap and was never seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make up seconds in the pits any more,'' said
Evernham. ``It's how fast you get to pit row. Jeff did a good job
of keeping the car clean and getting to pit row. He can actually
make up more time for us there than the guys in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things when the choreography is
perfect, and you hit all the lug nuts perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't be said for Burton, who increased his points lead
to 55 over Jarrett. He was caught in the pits when one of five
caution laps came out, putting him nearly a lap down. But Burton
battled back and attempted to challenge Gordon, who led 151 laps,
including the final 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the thing that hurt us the most, obviously getting a
lap down hurt us a great deal, was when we made our lap up, on the
next-to-last set of tires I asked to take two rounds of bite out
and make a change to make it looser,'' said Burton, who sat on the
pole by virtue of his points lead when qualifying was rained out
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it too loose; the 24 (Gordon) and the 18 (Bobby Labonte)
drove away from us because I got it too loose.'' said Burton. ``The
24 drove away from us, and we never had a caution again to move us
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the yellow flags slowed the average speed to 150.890 mph,
nearly 5 mph slower than Gordon's race record in the inaugural 1997
race, it did create close racing. There were 28 lead changes among
13 drivers. Jeff Burton led 57 laps while Labonte was in front 10
times. Defending champion Mark Martin led 10 laps and was
competitive until his Roush Racing Ford engine blew on lap 196.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we dropped a valve,'' said Martin, who dropped two
places to sixth in the points race after a 38th place finish. ``We
were starting to get up there pretty good, but that last set of
tires we got weren't competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner was also in the hunt but dropped back in the last 100
miles of the race that took 3:19.38 to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to the car,'' Skinner said of his
Lowe's Chevrolet that led once for a single lap. ``At one point, we
thought we could win it. Then it went from the best car on the race
track to the worst car in one pit stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a similar story for Terry Labonte, whose run of top-five
finishes at Fontana in the Kellogg's Chevrolet ended. He led once
for three laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car fell off quite a bit in the second half of the race,''
said the older Labonte brother and Gordon's Rick Hendrick
Motorsports teammate. ``I wished we hadn't passed on taking tires
on one pit stop (lap 205). In hindsight, I think we would have been
better off coming in and taking on four tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Labonte were joined in the top 10 by teammate Wally
Dallenbach. In addition to his pit crew, Gordon covered the field
with a car that ran best while in front, with little traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get out there in clean air and that made a
difference,'' said the 27-year-old driver, who earned $155,890 for
the win. ``The car was handling great all day long if we got clean
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be leading and that's the key when you're out in
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the five Roush entries, only Jeff Burton finished in the lead
lap. Kevin Lepage was 18th and Chad Little, who gained five bonus
points for leading the race was 22nd. Joining Martin in the lower
portion was Johnny Benson, who crashed on the third lap. It was
nearly a crash-free race. In addition to Benson, only Ricky Rudd
and Joe Nemechek managed contact with the walls. But there was no
managing any kind of contact with Gordon, winner of 45 Winston Cup
races in 199 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never felt like we were out of contention (for the
championship). We knew what we were made up,'' said the Vallejo,
Calif., native. ``Anytime you win the Daytona 500, you're not
having a bad year. Then you put Atlanta and California in on it, I
don't see how we can have a bad year from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to be a factor in the championship when it comes
down to the end of the season.''

   SHARES TO BE OFFERED
</P>
<P>
   In what would apparently be the first initial public offering of
stock in a company that focuses exclusively on transmitting phone
calls using Internet technology, RSL Communications plans to
announce Monday that it intends to sell stock in its Delta 3
subsidiary. Delta 3 is a leader in the still-developing field known
as Internet telephony _ a technique for carrying phone calls using
Internet systems that is more cost effective than traditional
telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK SALES DROP 3 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   A Study shows book sales declined almost 3 percent last year, to
1.04 billion books. It is the first drop in seven years, indicating
that the widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed
so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction,
according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade group that
tracks consumer reading habits. That conclusion may defy the
conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who were gathered
in Southern California at the Los Angeles Convention Center for
Book Expo America, the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion
of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   BAN PROPOSED ON CYBERSQUATTING
</P>
<P>
   Speculating in the registration and resale of potentially
valuable Internet addresses, known as cybersquatting, would
effectively be outlawed under new rules proposed by the United
Nations' intellectual property body. The proposal would also give
companies and people with claims to famous words or trademarks
first rights to certain addresses.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING THE WEB INTO A BALLOT BOX
</P>
<P>
   Though no states allow voting over the Internet _ few are even
in the earliest stages of contemplating it _ a handful of companies
are building systems to enable voters to cast ballots online. The
companies plan initially to sell to nongovernmental users like
universities, unions and professional associations.
</P>
<P>
   LIMITS LIKELY FOR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUG
</P>
<P>
   People who are looking forward to slimming down with the help of
Xenical, the newly approved weight-loss drug, may have to pay for
it themselves. Several managed care companies are pigeonholing
Xenical as a lifestyle product that they will cover only in
exceptional cases _ for overweight people at risk for
cardiovascular problems, or those with diabetes, breathing problems
or brittle bones.

   COLORADO SHOOTING TRANSFIXES TV NETWORKS
</P>
<P>
   When the first frightening images flashed onto TV screens from
Littleton, Colo., it was clearly an important event, one the cable
news networks would cover around the clock. But soon the three main
broadcast networks were covering it almost the same way, devoting
far more time to this massacre, on their evening and morning news
programs and prime-time news magazines, than they had ever
allocated to any similar shooting.

13TH VICTIM FOUND IN SINKING OF BOAT IN ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``20 passengers'' to ``21 people on board'' in 18th
graf, beginning: Although there were ...) (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Returning to the bottom of the serene lake
where a tourist boat slipped below the surface on Saturday, a team
of divers found a 13th victim Sunday but failed to shed light on
what caused the boat to sink so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was identified by local authorities as Jim
Patton, 48, of Russellville, Ark., who had been missed by divers
when they recovered the bodies of the other victims on Saturday
afternoon. Sheriff Larry Selig of Garland County said the man's
15-year-old son, James Jr., who survived the accident, realized on
Saturday night that his father was not accounted for. Divers found
the body about 30 yards from the sunken boat.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Patton's wife, Floy, had died after
spending the night on life support, the sheriff said. The couple's
daughter, Jennifer, 20, also died on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims included a brother and sister, both under 5 years
old, and their father, all from Keithville, La.; and a 3-year-old
boy and his mother from Dyersburg, Tenn. Many of the victims were
trapped under a canopy when the amphibious boat began taking on
water several minutes into the aquatic leg of its journey.
</P>
<P>
   The accident seemed to startle but not benumb this leisurely
tourist region an hour southwest of Little Rock. Pleasure craft
sped blithely around a small buoy marking the site Sunday
afternoon, 300 feet from the shore of Lake Hamilton, and fishermen
returned to the surrounding docks.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had a few theories Sunday for how the boat could
have taken on water, but said they would have no definite answers
until after the boat could be raised, possibly on Monday. The
vessel, which had passed Coast Guard inspection on Feb. 23,
officials said, is submerged in 51 feet of water. Its owner, Land
and Lake Tours, is to return it to the surface using flotation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the victims were from out of town, the sinking
struck at the heart of the city's major industry. For four decades
the ungainly amphibious vehicles known as ``ducks'' have been a
familiar if curious sight around town, picking up passengers in
downtown Hot Springs, rolling on rubber tires down Highway 7 to
Lake Hamilton, and then slicing into the water for a $9 sightseeing
tour of the man-made lake and the old resort area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this where that duck went down?'' asked Webb Crouse, a
local fisherman who, like many residents, stopped by the lakeshore
Sunday, searching the calm waters in vain for the site of the
accident. ``It just doesn't make sense that one of those big old
things would just disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as they looked, the fleet of World War II surplus army
vessels had an exemplary safety record, never before suffering a
fatality. With their yellow and white hulls and candy-striped
canopies, the boats are a popular staple of the local tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ride on the amphibious duck is an unforgettable
experience,'' promises brochures that were still prominently
displayed Sunday in every hotel lobby. A cartoon-like map showed a
drawing of a boat making a big splash in precisely the spot of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Safety Board stood scratching their heads at the
shore like everyone else, baffled at the sinking. Many of the eight
survivors had said on Saturday that the boat took only 30 seconds
to go down in sunny, windy weather after taking on water in the
stern, descending to the bottom stern-first. But no one reported
how the water had entered the hull, made of quarter-inch steel and
built to handle 5,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Bowen, chief of the Coast Guard's merchant vessel
safety division, said it was conceivable that water had come in
around the propeller or rudder shafts. Or the hull could have
suffered some kind of structural failure. But he said the boat had
easily passed its inspection in February, just as have all the
other ducks in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the transportation safety board, John Hammerschmidt,
said Sunday that investigators had interviewed the operator of the
boat, Beth Hambrick, who told them that she had recently taken it
in for a repair to the rubber boot that surrounds the drive shaft
and prevents water from leaking in. The boot had been leaking, she
told board investigators, but had been repaired; Saturday's voyage
was the first since the boat returned from the repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard ordered that the dozen or so ducks operated by
two companies on Lake Hamilton cease operation until the cause of
Saturday's accident is determined, Bowen said. The Coast Guard is
weighing whether to impose a similar order on other amphibious
boats that operate elsewhere in the country, including Branson,
Mo., Galveston, Texas, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The 31-foot
boats, each weighing 7.5 tons, are part of a group of 21,000 built
by General Motors in 1943 as landing craft for allied troops
invading Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Land and Lake, Q. Bryum Hurst Jr., said on Saturday
that Ms. Hambrick, the boat's operator, had all the credentials
required by the Coast Guard to be captain of the vessel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The boat went down so suddenly that there was little for
survivors and witnesses to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' said Gary Ledin,
a survivor from Oakdale, Calif., who told The Hot Springs
Sentinel-Record on Saturday that he and his wife had less than 30
seconds to swim away from the boat and up to the surface. His wife,
Diane, managed to push her way through one of the windows, but many
other passengers were trapped beneath the red-and-white canopy.
Bowen said nine of the 13 victims were found beneath the canopy on
the boat; the survivors seemed to have been sitting in front of and
behind the canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were 38 life jackets on the boat, which seats 30,
none of the 21 people on board _ including the five children under
15 who died _ was wearing one. Federal and state laws require that
the jackets be on the boat, but not that passengers wear them.
Arkansas law requires children under 12 to wear a life jacket on
recreational vessels, but the sheriff said it was not clear whether
the law applied to a commercial boat operating on a waterway under
Coast Guard jurisdiction, like Lake Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Selig added that even if everyone had worn a jacket, it would
not necessarily have saved any lives. By making each person
bulkier, the jackets might have prevented people from escaping the
canopy and swimming away from the sinking boat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the survivors were rescued by other boaters and nearby
residents, but the job of lifesaving requires training. Danny
Harris, 16, said he was staying with friends at a nearby
condominium complex when he heard people screaming in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all ran down there,'' he said. ``I jumped in the water,
grabbed one of the guys who was trying to float, but he was
drowning me. So I had to swim back.'' He did not know if the man
whom he tried to rescue was later saved.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, who included sheriff's employees and local
enthusiasts, described visibility at the bottom as essentially
zero, and said they found the bodies mostly by touch, about 40
minutes after the boat sank. When ambulances ran out of space,
divers had to place the bodies on nearby docks, and the sight
stunned nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop looking after a while,'' said Rhett Smith, a
computer operator living nearby.

ON SEATTLE VISIT, PAT BUCHANAN BLASTS CHINA'S WTO BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ China is ``not remotely qualified'' to become a member
of the World Trade Organization and the United States should not
yield to ``bribes'' such as those offered by Premier Zhu Rongji on
his recent visit to the United States, Republican presidential
candidate Patrick Buchanan said Sunday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Describing U.S. trade negotiators as ``too weak and wimpish,''
Buchanan pledged that if elected president, he would ``demand
complete access to Chinese markets'' as the trade-off for China's
continuing to sell its products here.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan will appear at Port of Seattle docks on Monday as a way
of dramatizing the United States' $58 billion trade deficit with
China, and what he said is a decline of U.S. exports and lack of
vigor in dealing with U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is making his case in a corner of the United States
that has been a bastion of support for U.S.-China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Jiang Zemin once dramatized the importance of his
country to Boeing jet sales by visiting a Boeing worker's home in
Marysville, Wash. A key inducement to WTO membership, recently
offered by Zhu, was a lifting of China's ban on imports of wheat
from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said Sunday that as a Republican president, he
would not hesitate to challenge the GOP's traditional corporate
allies.
</P>
<P>
   He even personalized the argument with a reference to Boeing
Chairman Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transnational corporations, which are entirely correct
calling themselves that, have a right to make their case and defend
their interests,'' Buchanan argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they shut down factories, lay off American employees,
kill jobs _ and make their parts in China _ it is the duty of the
American president to look after American workers, not Mr. Condit
and his executives.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a television commentator and former aide to Presidents
Nixon and Reagan, is making his third try for the White House. Both
Reagan and Bob Dole captured the GOP nominations on their third
attempt. But despite his surprise early victories in 1996 _
including upsetting Dole in the New Hampshire primary _ Buchanan is
still considered a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, what Reagan once called a ``conviction
politician,'' a robust conservative at the onset of a political
season in which some fellow Republican presidential candidates are
proposing to soft-pedal positions on which the party has been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Buchanan also:
</P>
<P>
   - Decried the loss of 350,000 American manufacturing jobs last
year and warned that the country's status as a superpower is in
jeopardy if its ability to make things continues to decline;
</P>
<P>
   - Claimed President Clinton is ``scapegoating gun owners and
sportsmen'' for the Littleton, Colo., school massacre. Clinton has
proposed reinstatement of the Brady Bill's three-day wait on
handgun purchases, to require trigger locks on gun purchases and to
ban ownership of handguns by those under 21.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of expanding gun control, Clinton should focus on ``the
cultural polluters of the entertainment industry who put these
ideas in children's heads,'' Buchanan argued. He acidly noted that
some of the alleged polluters have been among Clinton's most
generous contributors.
</P>
<P>
   - Warned that the Republican Party would ``lose its soul'' as
well as its most dedicated volunteers if it ``turns a deaf ear on
the silent screams of the unborn.'' Any abandonment of the GOP's
opposition to abortion would simply be designed ``to appease people
who never voted for us in the beginning,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also warned that the GOP cannot count on the pro-life
movement to stay in the fold if its cause is soft-pedaled. If
opposition to abortion is modified or abandoned, ``the Republican
Party will demean itself and call into being a new party,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   - Buchanan also declared himself opposed to any dismantling of
the Northwest's hydroelectric system to save or restore salmon
runs. He was asked about proposals to breach four dams on the lower
Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, salmon are important, but people come first,'' he
added. ``I adhere to the biblical idea that good things were put
here by the Lord for the wise use of mankind, which is required to
be a good steward of what has been bestowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think the good steward needs hydroelectricity more
than a few more salmon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a candidate who does not hesitate to tell you which
side he is on. For instance, he decried what he called ``the
demeaning, mocking and demonizing'' of traditional American values
in popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional Catholics and fundamentalist Christians, in
particular, are targets of these outrages,'' he added. ``It is time
for decent people to fight back with boycotts, and by using the
political process. The president of the United States has a bully
pulpit. It should be deployed on the side of decent people.''

ELWAY JUST ABOUT LETTER-PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From Z to A, it's all Elway:
</P>
<P>
   Z is for ``Zen and the Art of the Two-Minute Offense,'' a title
we submit for John Elway's memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Y is for the Yankees, for whom Elway was a .318-batting right
fielder with a team-leading 24 RBI in single-A Oneonta (N.Y.) in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   X is for XXXII and XXXIII, the two Super Bowls that didn't get
away.
</P>
<P>
   W is for Walker, Herschel, the running back from Georgia who
beat out Elway for the 1982 Heisman Trophy. Elway, whose Stanford
squad finished 5-6, was second in the voting, just ahead of SMU
running back (and onetime L.A. Ram) Eric Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   V is for Elway's 105 victories in 139 starts at Mile High
Stadium, a superlative 75.5 percent winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   U is for the ubiquity of Elway's celebrity, which once prompted
him to say, ``Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to be somebody
who wasn't noticed.... I don't like to stick out.''
</P>
<P>
   T is for ``The Drive'', a 98-yard classic that Elway conjured up
out of the frigid air (minus-5 with wind chill) in the January 1987
AFC Championship Game in Cleveland. He scrambled for 11 yards on
one down, 9 yards on another and completed passes of 22, 12, 20 and
14 yards before knotting the game at 20 with 37 seconds left on a
5-yard pass to Mark Jackson and an extra point by Rich Karlis, who
kicked the game-winning field goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   S is for Simms, Phil, the winning quarterback and MVP in Elway's
first Super Bowl appearance, in Pasadena in January 1987. Elway
passed for 304 yards, but the Giants, behind Simms' 22 of 25
passing (for 268 yards) scored 24 unanswered points in the third
quarter to obliterate Denver's 10-9 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   R is for running backs. Elway knew a few before finally hooking
up with The One. Before Terrell Davis there was Sammy Winder,
Gerald Willhite, Tony Dorsett, Bobby Humphrey, Gaston Green, Rod
Bernstine and Leonard Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Q is for Queen City of the Plains, which is what Denver was
called before John Elway came and conquered it. Or delivered it, if
you believe Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, who was quoted as
saying, ``When you think of Denver you think John Elway.... John
Elway is Denver's Moses. He has led Denver out of obscurity and
into the land of milk and honey.''
</P>
<P>
   P is for Pittsburgh, site of Elway's NFL regular-season debut in
the Broncos' 1983 season opener. ``Welcome to the NFL, now go back
to baseball'' seemed to be the message hand-delivered by the
Steelers defense, which sacked Elway four times. He completed just
1 of 8 passes in a 14-10 loss.
</P>
<P>
   O is for the Ohio State-Stanford game in 1982, which provided a
hint of what was to come. The Cardinal trailed 20-16 with 1:32 to
play when Elway drove his team 80 yards for the winning score, the
decisive touchdown coming on a pinpoint pass from a scrambling
Elway to Emile Harry.
</P>
<P>
   N is for the No.1 pick in the NFL draft. Elway was it in 1983,
going against his stated wishes to the Baltimore Colts. Elway
didn't want to be owned by Robert Irsay or ordered around by coach
Frank Kush and in the end he got his way; on May 2, 1983, he was
traded to Denver for quarterback Mark Hermann, offensive tackle
Chris Hinton and a first-round draft pick that turned out to be Ron
Solt. After the Broncos' win in Super Bowl XXXII in San Diego,
somebody heard Sharpe scream, ``I'd like to thank the Colts for
making that stupid trade!''
</P>
<P>
   M is for Most Valuable Player, the award Elway took home after
becoming the oldest person in Super Bowl history to score a
touchdown, in Denver's 34-19 win over Atlanta in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   L is for Elway's left knee, which has given him fits since his
senior year at Granada Hills High in 1978, when he underwent
surgery for torn cartilage. He has played without an anterior
cruciate ligament in the joint ever since.
</P>
<P>
   K is for the Kansas City Royals, who drafted Elway out of high
school, after he had signed a letter-of-intent to attend Stanford
to play football and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   J is for Jana, Elway's twin sister, who was born a few minutes
after John on June 28, 1960.
</P>
<P>
   I is for the improvisation that was Elway's signature on the
gridiron. He was the Jerry Seinfeld of football, always ready with
a quick comeback. Who else could score a go-ahead touchdown on a
4-yard scramble late in a game against rival Kansas City with only
10 Broncos on the field?
</P>
<P>
   H is for history. Elway is the first quarterback to appear as a
starter in five Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   G is for Granada Hills High, where Elway completed 60 percent of
his passes for 5,711 yards and 49 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   F is for fourth-quarter comebacks, 47 in all (nine alone against
Kansas City). The Broncos were a patient the doctor, who looked
like he could have been lifted straight from the set of ``General
Hospital,'' was forever having to revive, especially in the Dan
Reeves years. Good thing Elway's specialty was miracles.
</P>
<P>
   E is for eyes wide open, the expression Elway wore when a
first-down marker or goal line was in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   D is for DeBerg, Steve, whom Elway replaced as a starter in the
first regular-season game of Elway's rookie year and who fittingly
graced the roster of rival Atlanta in Elway's final game, Super
Bowl XXXIII in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   C is for charity. For Elway, it truly does begin at home. With
the help of wife Janet he started a foundation that has raised more
than $1 million for the prevention and treatment of child abuse.
Then there are all the $1,000 fines he gladly paid for the game
balls he tossed to fans in the stands at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   B is for Bradshaw, Terry, a former Pittsburgh quarterback who
blistered Elway for refusing to play for Baltimore and blasted him
after his performance in Super Bowl XXIV (San Francisco 55, Denver
10) and then heaped praise upon him in large shovelfuls in a
network interview after Elway was named MVP in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A is for antacids. The Broncos cornered the market on them for
much of Elway's career and we're not just talking about the fans.
Elway's insides would churn so before games, he'd be seeing pink.
Thus, the joke from a Broncos trainer that Elway ought to be called
the ``Pepto-Bismol King.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hoped Elway will be able to retire all those bottles now
that he is finished. It wouldn't be a joke to call him, simply, the
King.

BERT REMSEN, 74, ACTOR ON STAGE AND SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bert Remsen, a stage, screen and television actor for some 50
years, died on April 22 at his home in California's San Fernando
Valley. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Remsen, who was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., began his career at the
Neighborhood Playhouse, where he studied with Sanford Meisner. He
went on to act in summer stock and on Broadway, where he appeared
in such shows as ``Diamond Lil'' with Mae West and ``The
Rainmaker'' with Geraldine Page.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Hollywood, Remsen soon became a familiar face on
television, appearing in dozens of shows including ``Rawhide,''
``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' and ``Dr. Kildare.'' His career was
interrupted by an accident in 1964, when he was struck by part of a
falling crane while filming an episode of ``No Time for
Sergeants.''
</P>
<P>
   After recovering, he decided to become a casting director, which
he pursued until 1970 when a friend, the director Robert Altman,
persuaded him to take a role in the film ``Brewster McCloud.'' He
went on to appear in seven more Altman films, including ``Thieves
Like Us.'' He also acted in the films ``Lookin' to Get Out,''
``Maverick,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Independence Day.'' He
recently completed work in two HBO specials, ``Lansky'' and ``Crime
of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Ann Manners
and Kerry Remsen, both of the San Fernando Valley; a brother, Guy,
and two grandchildren.

<P>
   THE WOODLANDS _ They make movies about stuff like this. One was
called Angels in the Outfield.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing Hollywood could pump out can compare to the Angel in
the Fairway who was riding shotgun with Stuart Appleby on Sunday at
the Tournament Players Course.
</P>
<P>
   With the memory of his wife, Renay, giving him inner strength
and his timely putter doing the rest of the work, Appleby overcame
a two-stroke deficit in the final three holes to edge Hal Sutton
and John Cook and win the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Australian's first PGA Tour win since Renay died in
London last July when a taxi backed up and pinned her against
another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me the strength,'' Appleby said. ``I felt strong.
She's going to be with me forever, no doubt, in anything I do. And
she'll be there to help.''
</P>
<P>
   In a big way, Renay's memory drove Appleby to victory Sunday. He
started the day three strokes behind Sutton. He shot a final-round
71. Only one player on the leader board, Cook, had a better round
during a tough, windy afternoon of golf. Appleby's 72-hole total of
9-under 279 was the highest winning score at the TPC since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's 12-foot birdie at the par-4 17th, which Sutton would
bogey minutes later, was the decisive hole. It was the culmination
of a lot of mental teamwork Appleby said he did with thoughts of
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, What do you have to do to play well?'' Appleby
said. ``And to do that, I needed to stay calm and stay positive and
believe that everything I do is going to pay off. You'd better
stick to your guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Renay was always telling me to do. She was always
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to try to be Renay and talk to myself about what I had
to do to win. And she knew what it was, and I knew what it was. The
answer was to get your act together, stay positive on the course,
believe in yourself and believe that it's all going to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to do when you lose someone you love so much.
But you've got to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby began turning it around when he won the Coolum Classic
in Australia in December, although he admitted the level of
competition wasn't nearly as strong in that tournament as it was at
the SHO.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby also said he has tried to get past the mindset of
winning for his wife since then. But it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, that victory was a historic event for Renay and
I,'' he said. ``It was an event that I played for her. It was our
tournament. We went there because she always had a great time. I
didn't go there because I wanted to play and win so much. I went
there because she had a good time there. It was a week off for her,
and she could do whatever she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go back there felt a little funny. I didn't really want to
go back. It was a little emotional for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this tournament, I was a bit hungrier. This was work, real
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's third PGA Tour win was nothing if not a hard-earned
piece of work. He weathered two front-nine bogeys that left him at
7-under for the tournament and as much as three strokes behind
Sutton. Cook had mounted a nice charge with birdies at Nos. 16 and
17 to get to the clubhouse at 8-under 280.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was coasting along with a two-stroke lead over several
players when he stepped up to the 16th tee. The par-3 was playing
175 yards into the wind, and Sutton's tee shot came up short on the
left fringe. His first putt stopped three feet short, and he then
pushed the par effort enough to ring off of the right lip.

   At the same time, Appleby was stabbing a 12-foot birdie putt on
the 17th, drawing into a tie with Sutton. Appleby had missed three
putts inside six feet that could have given him breathing room
earlier in the round. But he had a premonition about the one at the
17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I was going to make that putt,'' Appleby said. ``I
just knew it would drop. I told myself that this is what it's all
about. This is something you should just eat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton then had an 8-iron approach shot knocked down by the wind
and end up just a foot over the lake guarding the 17th green. His
chip ran 12 feet by the hole, and he missed the comebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, playing two groups ahead of Sutton, parred the 18th,
then waited for Sutton to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton knew as he looked at his second shot on the finishing
hole that he needed a birdie to force a playoff. His shot came to
rest about 25 feet left of the hole, which was tucked on the right
edge of the green with water just five yards in front and to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton hit a good putt, but it slid by on the left edge of the
cup, giving the win to Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody had to beat me, I was happy it was Stuart,''
Sutton said. ``He has been through a lot. And I can certainly
understand how much meaning this has to him. I'm sure there's
somebody smiling on him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby knew as he waited for Sutton to finish play that he had
done all he could by getting to 9 under par. Nos. 17 and 18 were
the two hardest holes on the TPC on Sunday, with only four birdies
on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par is your friend on 18, definitely,'' Appleby said. ``Hal
obviously struggled down the stretch with the nerves and the
condition. I knew I had to make that putt on 17 because 18 wasn't
yielding any birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's win was worth $450,000 and means that he now has a win
in each of the last three years on tour. And it was another step
forward in the rest of his life, a life that, like golf, is getting
easier for Appleby nearly a year after his wife's death. ``Time
goes on,'' he said. ``I've learned that trying to win a golf
tournament is nothing to be scared of. But, obviously, not having
Renay here makes it a different feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling at the start of the day I was going to win
this tournament. I'm very excited that I won. It was a great week
for me. I stayed strong mentally and just did the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   After his victory, Appleby ran an endless gauntlet of autograph
promotions for the Houston Golf Association, then he finally was
ready to exhale and seek a quiet moment when he could have a
private audience with his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   And with that angel who will never stray from his heart.
