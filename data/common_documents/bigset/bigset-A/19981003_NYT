STARR MATERIAL ON LEWINSKY, TRIPP LESS THAN FLATTERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Analysis) 
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It hardly seems possible, but the 4,610 pages of
additional material released Friday from Kenneth Starr's
investigation actually makes the principal characters appear even
less likable and more troubled than before.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom
President Clinton has acknowledged an ``inappropriate''
relationship, comes off in the materials as even more spoiled,
gossipy and harassing than she seemed previously.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations with
Lewinsky and turned them over to the independent counsel, is
depicted not only as scheming but manipulative as well, seemingly
not above leading her ``friend'' into deepening waters.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes were made available
Friday for the first time. All of the documents, including more
grand jury testimony, were made public by the House of
Representatives. The House is preparing to vote next week on
whether to launch an impeachment inquiry based on Clinton's alleged
attempts to cover up the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are like air pollutants: The more that accumulate,
the darker the whole drama seems to become.
</P>
<P>
   There were details Friday alleging that Lewinsky virtually
stalked a former boyfriend in Oregon in 1993-94, threatened to
reveal their affair to his wife and tried to ingratiate herself
with his relatives. After the boyfriend, Andy Bleiler, broke off
the affair, Lewinsky told a friend that she continued to dream
about him months afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Tripp she was similarly troubled when Clinton
ended their relationship at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that I'm supposed to gain? I don't feel any better
about myself,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Tripp, ``the you-know-what of the you-know-what
(President of the United States) found you awfully attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky replied that was no compliment because Clinton would
have a certain kind of sex with ``anybody'' if he had the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The more you learn about Lewinsky's raging insecurities and
penchant for revealing her personal life, the more you have to
question how Clinton ever thought their relationship could remain
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky confided details of the affair to her mother and to
friends and, according to Friday's documents, would occasionally
announce to office workers at her Pentagon job that Clinton was
wearing a tie she had given him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a grand jury Aug. 17 that he knew Lewinsky
ultimately would reveal their affair because ``it was a part of her
psyche.'' The president did not say how or when that realization
came to him.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton ended their relationship, Lewinsky, now 25, sought
help in obtaining a new job _ but not just any job. She wrote
presidential secretary Betty Currie that she was appreciative of
the administration's assistance but that a possible opening at the
United Nations was ``YUCK!'' In another document, she says she
wants to make $65,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new material certainly won't boost the image of Tripp,
either. She already appears in public-opinion polls to be the most
despised character in the political soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp acts as if she were Lewinsky's confidante and protector.
At the same time, she seems to be leading Lewinsky toward trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tripp encourages Lewinsky in a telephone
conversation to get help in finding a job not only from Clinton
friend Vernon Jordan, but also from inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   House members say they want to know whether Clinton dispatched
Jordan or anyone else to find Lewinsky a lucrative job to ensure
her silence. Clinton's lawyers don't deny that the president
indirectly aided in her job search, but they maintain it was
Lewinsky who initiated the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In one conversation made public Friday, Tripp tells Lewinsky
that White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles has ``more
connections in industry and every other thing than you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky says that she doesn't want job help from somebody
working inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp replies that she doesn't see a problem. ``Are you
telling me that you think Erskine doesn't place people every day of
the week? I mean, come on. That's how networking works.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky holds steadfast, saying, ``Somebody could construe or
say, `Well, they gave her a job to shut her up. They made her
happy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's reply: ``Hmpf.'' &QL;

A BASHFUL LARRY BIRD JOINS HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ A crowd of more than 200 was waiting across
the street, but he decided not to attend the unveiling of his
bronze statue. He also escaped most of the crowds in the hotel
lobby _ the kids who skipped school, standing next to their fathers
wearing faded No. 33 Celvics jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird was not being reclusive; he was merely trying to do
what he always does when he returns to Massachusetts: outrun his
legend. On the day he was enshrined into the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame, he never looked slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go people ask me about my playing days,'' he
said. ``It seems like it's gevting worse, not better. Once this is
over, I think I can close the book on my career and look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But for at least one more night, he had to give in to his
legions by looking back at his remarkable 13-year Celtics career.
Before a sold-out gathering at the Springfield Civic Center, Bird
was enshrined along with Lenny Wilkens, Marques Haynes (the first
Harlem Globetrotter to be inducted), the former Rochester Royal and
Boston Celtic star Arnie Risen and three other coaches: longtime
NBA mentor Alex Hannum, University of Texas women's coach Jody
Conradt and Yugoslavian coach Aleksandar Nikolic.
</P>
<P>
   Any other year, Wilkens, the only person other than John Wooden
to be inducted as a player and coach, would be a big draw here, but
even the man with more victories than any other coach in NBA
history understood the magnitude of Bird's induction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it is an honor to be here to attend Larry's party,''
Wilkens said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Resembling a bashful kid who did not want his name called in
class, Bird spoke about growing up poor in rural Indiana. ``One
thing nice about growing up in a small town,'' he said. ``If
someone stole the nets from the court, you knew who did it and you
could always get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke about his ascension to a three-time most valuable
player in the NBA and about his crowning moments: the three
championships he led the Celtics to in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   His deadpan humor was as dead on as his 3-point shot. He was
asked about a spectacular shot he made during the 1981 finals
against Houston _ a shot in which, in one motion, Bird rebounded
his missed jumper from the perimeter and banked the ball in
left-handed as he was falling out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm the only one in the building that knew I missed the
shot so bad that I knew where it was going,'' he said. ``So I
chased it down, got it and laid it in. I can remember the play like
it was yesterday. I don't know if it was the greatest shot ever,
but in a playoff situation it sure was nice to chase down your own
miss and save a little bit of face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird had a way of gauging cities that did not include their
cuisine or their culture. When asked what he thought of Hartford,
where the Celtics sometimes played, he replied: ``Nice place. They
had good rims.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nikolic graciously thanked the committee for his induction
and apologized for his halting English, Bird rose to the podium and
said: ``That's OK, Aleksandar. I've been living in this country for
41 years, and I still have trouble with the language.''
</P>
<P>
   The room broke up laughing. Everyone, it seemed, had his
favorite Bird tale, usually about how Bird had won a game or
responded to the challenge of opposing fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest worker I ever saw, period,'' said Bill Walton, his
presenter at the enshrinement. ``Larry Bird was the epitome of what
it means to love this game and play it with passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain put it this way: ``If I had to have a forward
to start a team, I would take Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although at times he has been the most celebrated sports figure
in Massachusetts, Bird could not please everyone Friday. Between
the news conference and the induction ceremony, he was shuffled
around to different corporate engagements all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When the statue of Bird was unveiled on the third floor of the
Hall of Fame this afternoon, the sculptor asked the audience if
they had any questions. ``Where's Larry?'' someone yelled, spurring
on the impatient masses.
</P>
<P>
   Where else? Off being a legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I can put some closure on my career by being inducted
into the Hall of Fame,'' he said before stepping down from the
podium. ``They said there'll never be another kid from French Lick
that makes it to the NBA. I said there probably will be, one of
these days. Chances are slim, but if someone dedicates themself
they'll have a good opportunity to do it.''

EVIDENCE IS SEIZED FROM HOME OF MOM PRESUMED MURDERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM WALSH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police detectives seized five garbage containers behind the home
of a missing and presumed murdered Tempe woman as they tried to
shore up their case against the woman's two teenage children.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would only say that they found evidence ``of
value'' inside the containers, as well as inside Cookie Jacobson's
home, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But one crucial piece of evidence still eluded them Friday:
Jacobson's body.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they remain convinced that Aaron Jacobson, 16,
killed his mother and had help from his sister, Laura, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives arrested the siblings Thursday but released them
hours later to the custody of their father after the Maricopa
County Attorney's Office determined that there was insufficient
evidence to hold the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Police accused Aaron of second-degree murder and Laura of
facilitation to commit second-degree murder. Their arrests stunned
residents near McClintock Drive and Southern Avenue, many of whom
had showered the Jacobson kids with sympathy and encouragement and
passed out fliers _ at times accompanied by Aaron or Laura _ around
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The two teens repeatedly expressed concern for their mother's
safety, which police now say was all an act.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation shifts to finding Cookie Jacobson's body,
authorities drew parallels to a 1995 murder case in which a
13-year-old boy was killed and stuffed into a garbage container.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's body was never found, but authorities secured a
conviction against his killer anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe police expressed optimism Friday that prosecution against
Aaron and Laura Jacobson will not be derailed by the lack of a
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it, but obviously it would help,'' said Sgt.
Dave Lind, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie Jacobson disappeared Sept. 21 and was reported missing by
her husband, Bill. Police originally said she was last seen alive
at 9:30 a.m., when Aaron and Laura left for school.
</P>
<P>
   The children told police that their adoptive mother had scolded
them for being late.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources have said Aaron had a history of threatening his
mother. A friend of Aaron's said Thursday that Aaron told a mutual
friend about a previous attempt to poison his mother.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation continues, the Jacobson family's
minister pleaded with the public to avoid premature judgments about
the children's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems to be very irresponsible to jump to
conclusions,'' said Dr. Bert Lewis, pastor of Dayspring United
Methodist Church. A vigil for Cookie Jacobsonscheduled at the
church for Thursday night was canceled at the family's request
after the children's arrests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Jacobson has been active in the church's youth group,
Lewis said. This summer, Aaron and other teenagers helped build
houses on an Indian reservation in northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron is very likable,'' Lewis said. ``There would be nothing
in his background and character to suggest he would do something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, as well as Aaron's classmates at McClintock High School
and the boy's boss at a Tempe hardware store, remained in disbelief
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet and really, really sweet,'' said Indigo Stein, a
McClintock student. ``He was never mean to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Rogers agreed, saying, ``You would never guess that he
would do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls and other students defended Aaron against the police
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it. It's bull,'' David Young said. ``I don't
believe he would do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said Aaron has been more quiet than usual since his
mother's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wilson, manager of Ace Hardware at Baseline Road and
McClintock Drive in Tempe, said Aaron has worked as a cashier at
the store for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron has proven himself a good employee on his first job,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was honest and very reliable and very responsible,'' the
store manager said. ``As far as we're concerned, he still works
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he recently cut back on Aaron's work hours, at the
Jacobsons' request, because Aaron's schoolwork had suffered
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' Wilson said, ``it's not true.'' &QL;

HERNANDEZ DEFENDS TITLE AGAINST MAYWEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it too soon for Floyd Mayweather or too late for Genaro
Hernandez?
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out tonight, when Hernandez, the skillful but
often-overlooked WBC super featherweight champion, defends his
title against the unbeaten 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in Las
Vegas. The fight will be televised on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who grew up and trains in Los Angeles, is one of the
most-skilled boxers in the world and has never lost at this weight
class, 130 pounds. His only setback came at 135 pounds in 1995
against Oscar De La Hoya when he had to quit because of a shattered
nose.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hernandez is 32 and has rarely faced a fighter of
Mayweather's natural ability, which might explain this: As of
Friday, Mayweather was an 8-5 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mayweather, the first 1996 Olympian to get a title
shot, has !ital!never!off! faced a fighter with the ability and
experience _ not to mention height _ of the 6-foot Hernandez. Not
even close. Hernandez has been in the ring with the likes of De La
Hoya and Azumah Nelson, fighters far more fearsome at this stage
than Mayweather.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some believe Mayweather, all of 21, is taking on too
much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of negotiations, Hernandez was among the
skeptical. He was irked by the audacity of the young fighter to
think he could knock off so early in his career a champion who has
held world titles for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he tempered his comments but explained this isn't the
first time he's been in this position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayweather is a real good fighter,'' said Hernandez (38-1-1,
17 knockouts). ``I just think I've had some other hard fights in my
career, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Hernandez, Genaro's brother and trainer, said the champion
will determine the outcome of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   If he's passive, as he has been on occasion, Mayweather's talent
and phenomenal speed could be the difference. If he's aggressive,
Rudy Hernandez said, the challenger could be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of times in training the last few weeks that
I've thought, `There's no way Mayweather can win this fight.' My
gut feeling? Genaro is going to kick his butt,'' Rudy Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather (17-0, 13 KOs) is as confident about his own chances.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses Hernandez's edge in experience, saying his
extensive amateur career is experience enough. And as far as the
champion's skill level goes, no one is going to convince Mayweather
that even a seasoned champion is any more talented than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he's the best 130-pounder. I think I'm the best
130-pounder. That's why I'm fighting him,'' said Mayweather, the
son of former contender Floyd Sr. (now his trainer) and nephew of
former champion Roger Mayweather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a stepping stone for me. This'll really get my
career going. This is the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could defend against dangerous Angel Manfredy in
December, also on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   For Mayweather, who will make $150,000 for the fight, victories
over Hernandez and Manfredy could catapult him into an elite _ and
wealthy _ group of fighters. For Hernandez, whose payday is a
relatively paltry $600,000, these two fights could get him some of
the money and recognition that has eluded him.

<P>
   Following are excerpts of a conversation between Linda Tripp and
Monica Lewinsky on Jan. 13, when Mrs. Tripp wore a body wire so
that federal agents working for Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, could listen in. This conversation occurred after both had
been subpoenaed as witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit, and just a few days before Mrs. Tripp lured Ms. Lewinsky
to a meeting where Starr's prosecutors tried to get her to
cooperate in an investigation into the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So what's going on with the job?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: (Sigh)

</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Right.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, of course.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY:
</P>
<P>
   So, finally _ _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You mean, you haven't been in touch?

<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No.

<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, It's _ It's sort of like, you know _ _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So, when do you get your present?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I don't know. I don't know.

<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Have you asked him when you're going to get your__
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No. Because you know what? I _ can I tell you
something? You know what? My mom doesn't even hardly believe it. I
am so _ I am so like pulled. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I _ so what do you mean, your mom doesn't _ _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'so _ (sigh). I'm sure I'll get over it. I don't
want to talk to him. I don't want him _ I don't want to look at
him. I can't look at him on TV, can't anything.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're kidding.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, I just _ I think it's _

   MS. LEWINSKY: I _ it's just everything. And you know what? You
know, it sort of started to kind of _ kept coming back and I had
pushed it away. And just a lot of things when you _ (sigh). That
whole Eleanor Mondale thing, I _ (inaudible). You know, I started
to think about it, you know? . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You mean because she was in there.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Not because she was in there. OK Not because she
was in there, because two months _ he hasn't even had contact with
me in two months, and I was going through all of this because of
him for two months. For two months.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP

   Yeah, because, let's face it, it had been__

<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY

   Well, had she _ but was this, ``Well, there's no time, no time
to see you tomorrow, no time to see you.'' Just everything. I don't
_ you know what? I'm just depressed. Just really _ ...
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So I talked to her this week and I said to her, I
said, ``Look, I'm supposed to sign something,'' and I said, ``I'm
supposed to sign something, and I'm not not signing it until I have
a job.''
</P>
<P>
   . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're you bound and determined to do what you plan
to do?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You _ are you _ are you positive in your heart that
you want to do that? I mean _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I'm only saying _ I'm only saying that in case you
should change your mind.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No. I _ I _ I _ first of all, for fear of my life
_
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: _ I would not. For fear of my life. I would not _
I would not cross these _ these people for fear of my life, number
one.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: That's a terrible thing.
</P>
<P>
   ....
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Here _ here's my _ my biggest fear where you're
concerned. Then I'll tell you my fear where I'm concerned. Vernon
Jordan does not have your best interest at heart, and you know it.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He has his buddy's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: The day that he told you, or took you, or whatever
the hell to his attorney to represent you, that already is very
scary to me. Like if you had said you had gotten your own attorney
on your own, don't you think that that would make all of us feel
better, that you could tell _ whatever you decide to do under oath
_
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know what? You know what, Linda?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: At last you're telling the _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, that's not true, though. A lawyer, Linda, your
lawyer _ if you tell _ that _ that's not the case. That's what I
thought, too, If you tell your lawyer the truth _ let's just say
whatever, let's just say you stole a handbag.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: And you do not tell your lawyer that you stole the
handbag because the lawyer then can't represent you.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: What?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: A lawyer can't represent you _ if you think _ they
can represent you, but they can't represent you that you didn't
steal the handbag.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: What? You're serious?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I think so. That's my understanding.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So every convict that goes in for everything _ or
every _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Look at O.J. You think O.J. Simpson said to them,
``I did it. Get me off''? ``I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I
didn't do it'' This is _ this is _ this is how I feel. I could not
live with myself if I caused trouble. I _ that is just _ that is
jot my nature. I am a good person.
</P>
<P>
   I think no matter what _ no matter how he has wronged me, no
matter how many girlfriends he had, no matter how many people he
abused, no matter how many, it _ it was my choice.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I know that. ....
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I _ I know what you're saying. I do understand what
you're saying. But what I'm saying is when you do it under oath,
the scary thing is that that is your _ your sworn testimony. What
if _ I don't know. I don't know. Let's just say what if someone _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: But there _ there isn't _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: No one could have looked in the study window?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So what? IF someone looked in the study window,
it's not me. I _ I _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know what? Do you see what I'm mean? Look, I
don't know who they saw, but it wasn't me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: See, but Monica, there are records at that place.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So what? There are no records of me going back
there. There are no records of me going back there. There is _ I
have thought about this. I have stayed up nights thinking about
this.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Did they agree that a signed, sworn _ whatever it
says?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: They have not agreed, no. There is no agreement,
because _ but what my lawyer has said is that what signing this
will do is, it will show them _ OK. They have on rumor and innuendo
I have (inaudible). Well, here I am, under oath _ no, no, no.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He asked you?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Of course. (Inaudible) enough. So (inaudible),
waiting for me to go sign it.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I think Vernon did a wink-wink with him.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I mean, he's not a stupid man. Sorry. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: OK. So what if _ what if it doesn't work, and you
have to go _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Fine.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: _ and then do you have to produce things?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah. So I have produced the most, you know. I got
rid of everything else. I have produced the most _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You got rid of the one thing?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: What? Oh, I _ like everything is just _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Away.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I _ I put it _ I gave it to my mom, and I said,
``You can throw it away, you can burn it, you can do whatever you
want with it.'' I said, ``Because I don't want to have anything to
do with it.'' And I didn't ask her what she did with it. I think
she _ she is more petrified than I am, so I would imagine she threw
it away.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: _ If that's true, then I don't have to lie under
oath, and they'll just say it's one word against the other. But the
real problem here, of course, is that you told.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I _ I don't even _ I mean, I just _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Because if it's just a question of your word against
mine _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I mean, it'll become a huge _ I mean, I _ I _ I _
Linda, it's hard for me to understand _ I have to be honest with
you.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Sighing.)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: It is hard for me to understand how _ how _ how
you could want to do that to me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I mean, you are hurting one person. You will hurt
one person. You will help Paula Jones and you will hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I'm not here to help Paula Jones. You know that.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: But that's what _ that's what you'll do, though.
That's what you'll do.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: How would that help her?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Huh, huh.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I mean _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Because they'll have _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: No. You just got through saying it's your word
against mine.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: But it will become _ you think that they'll drop
it? You think that if I say _ go up there, I sign the thing. I say
no. They ask me questions and I say no. You go there and you say,
``Yes, Monica Lewinsky had a thing with him, and da, da, da, da,
da.'' You think they're gonna go, ``Oh, OK It's your word against
her word. Hmm. Who should we believe?'' No. Then they're gonna pull
me back in there, they're gonna pull him back in there _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: And say what?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: And then _ then _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: But if you continue _ You're telling me you're gonna
continue to [word deleted) deny anyway, so how _ how does that _
make me understand this, Monica. How does that __
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I mean, what if they could get you in trouble _ if
there is no way to prove that what I'm saying is wrong?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, I know it could get me in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know? I mean, telling the truth could get you
in trouble. I don't know why you'd want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Sighing.)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I _ and _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Believe me.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Especially when _ I think _ I think that you're
thinking this is a bigger _ this is a bigger.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I'm thinking it's huge.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: It _ and it's not. It's not a huge thing.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I just wish I had a Vernon Jordan. I'm not kidding.
I feel very lost. I feel like I'm sitting out there in suburbia, I
have two kids in college _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: _ I'm a working stiff _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: OK What is it you want?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I don't have anybody protecting me.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky explained to Ms. Tripp what part of her affidavit
in the Jones case would say:
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, no. It's like ten paragraphs. Then there's a
statement about, oh, ``Have you ever had sex with the president?''
And ``Have you ever _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: _ ``witnessed him being inappropriate,'' da, da,
da.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Then there's something about _ then the paragraph
( inaudible) and then comes the meaty paragraph that I never had a
sexual relationship, you know, nor _ like nor do I know of anybody
who has _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're going to sign that?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm. Hey, look, for me, I never had sex with
him. That's a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: What is _ what is the definition of sex?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh. Well, yeah. Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I never had intercourse. I did not have a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay. So all right. So that's _ that's that
paragraph. What else?
</P>
<P>
   On Ms.Lewinsky's conversations with Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Did he say anything about _ and, now, this is _ this
is touchy and you don't have to answer it.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Right.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: But did he address the perjury issue at all? Because
that is perjury.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. He _ yeah. He said that _ he said, ``You're'
not gonna go to jail. You're not gonna go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're not gonna go to jail, but did he _ did he _
did he assess what could happen? I mean, assuming _ let's say worst
case, they come up to me or to you and say, ``you on this date and
this date and this date said something completely wrong to us. It's
obviously a falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
   And let's just say it's perjury or can be construed as perjury.
Did he _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I would say it's not. What I said it true. It did
not happen. She is _ I did not say that. She must have
misunderstood. Maybe _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I mean, you're not hearing what I'm saying. I
understand all that.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I _ I _ I've gotten that.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: See, no. No. I understand what you're saying. What
I'm trying to show you is that what he has showed me is there's no
way to get caught in perjury in a situation like this.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Really?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: In a situation like this _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He's sure?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: There's no way.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He's sure.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: That's _ look, that's what he's told me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: When he presented it to you, did he seem sure?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: yes.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Like _ but you don't seem to be concerned about that
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'm not because _ because of all those reasons.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I know. But did you express concern at all?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yes, I did. Of course, I did.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You said _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I was crying.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You were?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay. So you knew _ he knew that you were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yes. Oh, yes.

JOURNEYMAN HRKAC FINDS PLACE WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Tony Hrkac heard the news that the Stars would
protect him in Monday's waiver draft, his face lit up as if he had
scored a game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, he had.
</P>
<P>
   Hrkac, the 32-year-old center who typifies the word
``journeyman,'' has scored possibly the biggest goal of his career:
a home with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's with us, he's an NHL player,'' Stars director of player
personnel Craig Button said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is quite amazing to Hrkac (rhymes with circus). In a
career that has taken him from the University of North Dakota
through six NHL teams and five minor-league teams, Hrkac is back to
being a legitimate NHL player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great; it's something I've really worked hard for,'' he
said. ``It's great news.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrkac had an assist in a 5-2 Stars victory against the Phoenix
Coyotes in preseason play last night at Reunion Arena, and expects
to add plenty more during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't so clear to him two days ago. The waiver draft on
Monday seemed a sure ticket out of town for Hrkac. He said he did
not expect to be one of the 18 skaters the Stars protected and he
thus could have been chosen by another team _ likely Edmonton, with
whom he played last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my situation, I knew it was going to be a tense day,''
Hrkac said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with getting taken by Edmonton _ or any other team _
was Hrkac would have to establish his place in another lineup, move
his family and then not be sure what his next move was. Last
season, the Stars signed Hrkac as a free agent with the thought he
would play for the minor-league Michigan K-Wings. But injuries to
Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk opened up a space in the Stars'
lineup and Hrkac responded with five goals and three assists for
eight points in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars tried to send Hrkac back to Michigan, Edmonton
picked him up on waivers and he finished out the season with the
Oilers, scoring eight goals and 11 assists in 36 games. But the
Oilers packaged him in a trade to Pittsburgh in June, he was taken
by the Nashville Predators in the expansion draft and then traded
back to the Stars in July for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   After that frantic summer, all Hrkac needed was another game of
musical teams. Now, he has the security he likely will stay on the
Stars' roster for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A talented playmaker who won the 1987 Hobey Baker Award as top
U.S. collegiate player, Hrkac is expected to take Nieuwendyk's
place as center on the second line until Nieuwendyk returns from
off-season knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When Nieuwendyk returns, Hrkac is expected to see time on the
third and fourth lines, spelling veterans Guy Carbonneau and Brian
Skrudland. The bottom line, though, is he has earned a spot on one
of the deepest rosters in the NHL. Not bad for a guy who spent
almost four consecutive seasons in the minors before last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in at the beginning of last season and he played like
a minor-leaguer, he had a minor-league attitude,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``But after getting a break and proving he can play
in the NHL, he now has the mentality of an NHL player. His body
language says he can play in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that, Hrkac said, he can thank the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, they showed faith in me, they believed in me after
I had been in the minors forever,'' he said. ``If I had a choice of
playing anywhere, it would be here.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Friday released
the final mass of evidence in its consideration of impeachment
charges against President Clinton, offering a pungent store of
furtive tapes and grand jury delvings into Clinton's intimate
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the 4,600 pages of heavily redacted testimony and
transcripts featured Linda Tripp's 20 hours of secret voice
recordings of the intern, Monica Lewinsky _ the seedbed tapes of
the extraordinary criminal investigation into the presidential
misbehavior with Ms. Lewinsky that Clinton denied before the nation
for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, braced for an all-out impeachment struggle with
the Republican-controlled Congress, immediately denounced this
third release of evidence by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, as ``the clearest indication that this is a partisan
process designed for partisan gain'' and one far afield from the
constitutional requirement for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To make that point, the president's lawyers submitted an
argument for the House's consideration that reached back 200 years
into the history of sex and politics and cited as precedent the
Congress' early refusal to impeach Secretary of the Treasury
Alexander Hamilton after he paid off a blackmailer who threatened
to disclose Hamilton's sexual peccadilloes. The 105th Congress
should be no less tolerant in the case of Clinton's behavior, the
30-page brief argued.
</P>
<P>
   The document release ranged from the tiniest details _ even
their sighs _ in the Tripp-Lewinsky confidences, to hard bouts of
lawyerly combat in the grand jury room between prosecutors and the
dozens of Clinton supporters subpoenaed as the president found
himself targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the grand jury all the conversations you had with the
president of the United States about Monica Lewinsky since January,
12, 1998. How's that?'' one prosecutor demanded testily of Bruce
Lindsay, deputy White House counsel. Lindsay, the president's
closest, most tight-lipped confidante, stolidly refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   While devoid of major new disclosures, the new material details
the wide net thrown by the Whitewater independent counsel, Starr,
in trying to make the case to Congress that the president should be
impeached because he allegedly committed perjury and tampered with
witnesses in his attempt to keep the Lewinsky affair private.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a fund-raising visit to Cleveland, observed that
everyone has to live with the consequences of mistakes in life.
``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public
way,'' he said as donors laughed in amusement and the new
disclosures flooded the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The densely packed three-volume release, including the testimony
of dozens of the president's staff and political associates, was
laced with second-hand accountings of the president's personal life
and glimpses of the White House's extensive attempts to foil Starr
in his mission. The material was the prelude to the committee's
public meeting next Monday, when the Republican majority is widely
expected to recommend a formal House impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence hardly settled the impeachment question as
Clinton's critics and defenders each claimed material supporting
their contentions. But the voluminous material confirmed the White
House scandal as a heated farrago of personal, legal and political
clashes that has put Clinton's incumbency at risk. The welter of
documentation includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The repeated attempts of Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile
friend, to use her mentoring role to coach the younger woman _ even
using the collective `we'' in strategizing at some points. ``I
think you should say, `Well, I really need to speak to the big
creep,' '' Mrs. Tripp advised in one taped exchange, referring to
the Ms. Lewinsky's nickname for the president.
</P>
<P>
   _ The possibility of gleaning the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes for
exculpatory material as much as indicting comments. In the one
tape-recording Mrs. Tripp made secretly for Starr last January, she
asked Ms. Lewinsky a key question in the prosecutors' attempt to
discover evidence of presidential perjury: ``What is the definition
of sex?'' On the tape, Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``Intercourse.'' She
added, echoing Clinton's later defense to the grand jury and the
nation, ``I never had intercourse. I did not have a sexual
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The repeated grand jury questionings in which the
recollections of Betty Currie, the president's secretary who
facilitated Ms. Lewinsky's Oval Office visits, grew less and less
distinct. ``My memory is a little better _ but not much,'' she told
the jury after a consultation with her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urgent dawning in the White House last Jan. 17, after the
president was deposed in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct
civil suit, that Starr was hotly pursuing Ms. Lewinsky as a witness
in some larger criminal inquiry directed against the president.
``Do you think you can reach Monica, see what's happening?''
Clinton asked Mrs. Currie after his deposition. Upon tracking down
Ms. Lewinsky, the secretary said the normally loquacious intern
hung up the phone after declaring, ``I can't talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The combativeness of the president's loyalists in the face of
Starr prosecutors. ``I'm just not going to answer that,'' Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., the president's close friend snapped when asked whether
he was misled by the president's distinctions about sexual conduct.
``You seem to have the problem with oral sex,'' he told the
prosecutor. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Already split along partisans lines even before voting on its
own inquiry, the committee now has a wealth of submissions from
Starr, including Ms. Lewinsky's testimony admitting to oral sex
with the president, and Clinton's own four hours of grand jury
testimony broadcast to the nation last month. In that, he
criticized Starr's inquiry as little more than a politically driven
``parsing of the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton maintains that because his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky
involved oral sex and not full intercourse, he did not commit
perjury in his Jones lawsuit deposition last January when he denied
a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. After confirming a
relationship before the grand jury, the president also finally told
the nation on Aug. 17, contending his earlier denials were legally
accurate though generally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The document release revealed the grand jury testimony of a
panoply of witnesses, from some of the highest presidential
counsels to Secret Service agents who guard the president's life.
There were exceptions, notably the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a
White House volunteer who charged that the president once sexually
groped her. Starr has previously said his office was continuing to
look into possible obstruction of justice in the reaction to her
charge by unnamed Clinton defenders.

</P>
<P>
   Armies of lawyers and media personnel gleaned the latest
disclosures into the weekend, setting the stage for the Judiciary
Committee's opening hearing Monday. In particular, they studied the
president's initial handling of the crisis as it broke last
January, the Democrats' insistence that the evidence is more
exculpatory than indicting, and, above all, the interplay between
Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky _ with the intern remaining clueless
until the end about her friend's duplicity. ``You are a wise, savvy
woman, and I truly value your opinions,'' she told Mrs. Tripp in a
birthday note last November.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the president's golfing buddy who helped look for a job
for Ms. Lewinsky when she was being subpoenaed in the Jones
lawsuit, testified that two days after his deposition Clinton was
in an ``incredulous state'' about the internet-circulated Drudge
Report _ the cyber gossip's first public hint of Starr's
lightning-quick entry into Clinton's personal affairs as he pursued
evidence of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' the president declared, according to Jordan,
who said he once more observed that the president should have
settled the Jones suit earlier. With the new threat emerging,
Jordan had lunch with Lindsay. ``It was clear that there was a
problem, and what to do about the problem we did not get into,''
Jordan testified.
</P>
<P>
   The president, meanwhile, had already been talking to Mrs.
Currie soon after his return from the deposition and asking a
series of questions that prosecutors consider witness-coaching but
that the president insists was innocent. Before that point, even as
the president was being deposed on Jan. 17, John Podesta, the
president's deputy chief of staff, had heard the first rumors of
Starr's possible entry into the affair _ ``linking for the first
time, in my mind, Monica Lewinsky to the Paula Jones matter,''
Podestatestified.
</P>
<P>
   As the sense of crisis grew, Jordan pursued Ms. Lewinsky, whom
he got to know while helping her with job-hunting. Summarizing the
young woman for the grand jury, Jordan recalled, ``I was listening
to a bobby-soxer who was mesmerized by Frank Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   The president telephoned Jordan in the early morning of January
21, when the first newspaper disclosures were breaking about
Starr's new branch of inquiry. ``There's a story out,'' the
president said, according to Jordan. ``I'm concerned about it. And
the story is about Monica Lewinsky and myself.'' Clinton ``just
sort of emoted about his circumstances,'' Jordan said. In turn, he
testified, he advised the president: ``Not to worry about it. Tell
the first lady. Deal with it later in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said the latest release of documents
bolster their charges that Starr twisted the evidence he gained in
his investigation to build an impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the special counsel to the president, said a
close reading of the thousands of fresh pages show that Starr
engaged in ``a pattern of evidentiary manipulation and
misdirection'' in his report to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who was recently added to the White House staff to direct
Clinton's response to the impeachment inquiry, said that Starr
purposely failed to discuss evidence favorable to the president
``and intentionally omitted direct exculpatory testimony,
paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure their plain meaning,
and systematically resolved conflicting testimony in its favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal evidence of that, Craig said, was Starr's initial
``narrative'' _ a list of detailed charges presented to Congress _
did not contain some of the information that was finally released
Friday, well after the initial sensation over Starr's impeachment
recommendation last month. The president's lawyers cited Currie's
testimony that it was she and not Clinton who was responsible for
trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House once more underlined Ms. Lewinsky's own
testimony in contradiction of the suborning perjury argument: ``No
one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.'`
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers sent a letter today to Rep. Henry Hyde,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining their objections and
arguing as well that neither private sexual conduct nor the perjury
alleged by the president's critics met the constitutional test of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's various protests and references to the new
material pointed once more toward building a defense that Linda
Tripp acted as an agent provocateur for the president's political
opponents in her conversations and tapings of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The release of the text, but not the sound, of the taped
conversations, presents considerable excerpts from the long and
winding feat of eavesdropping carried out by Mrs. Tripp on Ms.
Lewinsky as she railed about her affair with Clinton. ``I don't
think there's a detail she left out,'' Mrs. Tripp testified to the
grand jury, as if from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes present Mrs. Tripp's behavior ranging the gamut. ``I
hate what he has done to you,'' she said in denouncing the
president at one point. But at another moment, her mission in
endlessly hearing about Ms. Lewinsky's version of her life and
times clearly exasperated Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message last Oct. 27, she complained to Ms.
Lewinsky about her constant ``ranting and raving'' over the affair.
``Share this sick situation with one of your friends, because,
frankly, I'm past nauseated about the whole thing,'' Mrs. Tripp
snapped. (She obviously reconsidered, for she taped on into the New
Year, and finally for Starr.)
</P>
<P>
   To the rebuff, Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``That's fine,'' while
urging that none of their confidences ever be broken.
</P>
<P>
   In her own grand jury testimony, Mrs. Tripp denied playing
secret agent for Starr and other Republican critics of the
president. ``My idea was never to manufacture evidence,'' she
declared. ``In fact, I had never even thought about the independent
counsel in my wildest dreams. My idea was I'm going to arm myself
with records so when I'm in a position to speak under oath I can do
so truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp testified that in July of 1997 ``it was completely
frightening to me to learn that Monica had had a topic of
discussion solely about me with the president of the United
States.'' She feared the president's fabled political attack
specialists. ``I knew I had to arm myself with records,'' she
testified, ``Because no one would believe it. And I still didn't
make the decision to arm myself with records until October.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the interchanges of the two women echo
Pirandello's play within the play when Ms. Lewinsky was creating
her own taped holiday greeting for the president last December and
Ms. Lewinsky taped the taping. It was a playful message beginning,
``Hi, Handsome,'' and proposing she once again meet personally with
the president. ``You can't refuse me, because I'm too cute and
adorable,'' said Ms. Lewinsky whose talk on the tapes ranges from
old salt vulgarity to pajama party girlishness.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is heard, on her own secret recording of Ms.
Lewinsky's tape-making, speaking in praise of the former intern for
ever thinking of a tape as a gift. ``You know me with tapes,'' said
Mrs. Tripp, her microphone hidden. ``I'm thinking (sighing), `The
voice is always more believable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lewinsky often sounds self-absorbed and
frustrated. ``I think people call me the stalker.'' she lamented.
``I think that's what they say. Oh my God, that gets me so mad. I
hate that,'' she said, as Mrs. Tripp quietly taped the tale of the
president and the intern.

JUDGE SOTOMAYOR FINALLY APPROVED BY SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a delay of more than a year, the Senate
Friday voted to elevate Judge Sonia Sotomayor of U.S. District
Court in New York City to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotomayor's nomination had become embroiled in the sometimes
tortured judicial politics of the Senate. Some Republicans did not
want to consider the nomination because, they said, putting her on
the appeals court would enhance her prospects for elevation to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Those lawmakers said they believed President Clinton was eager
to place a Hispanic person, like Ms. Sotomayor, on the Supreme
Court, and they held up consideration of her nomination for months,
even though there was no evidence the Clinton administration had
planned to try to put her on the court if a vacancy arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``At long last, this day has finally arrived,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, just before the Senate voted in Ms. Sotomayor's favor,
68-28.
</P>
<P>
   All Democrats present voted for Ms. Sotomayor, as did several
Republicans, including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, who had blocked consideration of the nomination by
the full Senate, voted against Ms. Sotomayor.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said that the delay in voting on the nomination had been
especially troubling because the 2nd Circuit, which is based in New
York, has great backlogs and its chief judge, Ralph Winter, had
declared a judicial emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in considering the Sotomayor nomination also
occasioned heavy lobbying by Hispanic bar groups and the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus. After that, the Republican
leadership relented and allowed her name to go forward. Ms.
Sotomayor will be the second Hispanic judge on the 2nd Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Her confirmation seemed like a trouble-free choice when
President Clinton nominated her more than a year ago. She brought
the kind of personal story usually greeted warmly by the Senate: a
child from the Bronx housing projects who went on to graduate summa
cum laude from Princeton and become editor of the Yale Law Journal
and then a federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a trial judge since 1992, when she was named to the
bench by President George Bush, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., told the Senate Friday
that in more than five years on the bench, Ms. Sotomayor ``presided
over cases of enormous complexity with skill and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sotomayor's nomination was approved overwhelmingly by the
Senate Judiciary Committee more than a year ago. Of the judicial
nominees who have cleared the committee in this Congress, she had
waited the longest for a final vote on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her confirmation leaves 17 judicial nominees still pending in
the Senate, a spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee said Friday.

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Here's one you won't see often: a rainout
at the horse track.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie have to compete
last night with the nearby baseball playoff game on the opening of
its fall quarter horse meeting, it had to contend with the wrath of
nature as well.
</P>
<P>
   The last five races were canceled at 10:40 p.m. after a
90-minute delay because of a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The same torrential rain, winds and lightning that struck The
Ballpark at Arlington _ only a few exits down Interstate 30 _
swamped the track shortly before 9 p.m. as jockeys were in the
paddock preparing to mount their horses for the seventh race.
</P>
<P>
   Horses remained in the paddock and in the receiving barn
awaiting a break in the monsoon, but it never came. When weather
forecasters told Lone Star officials more storms were on the way,
the plug was pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have run, except for the lightning,'' Lone Star
general manager Corey Johnsen said. ``We're not going to do that
here. Safety should always come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightning is more dangerous in horse racing than other outdoor
sports _ with the possible exception of golf _ because the starting
gate is metal.
</P>
<P>
   Trash cans and debris were blown around the premises, but no
significant damage other than lost betting revenue was reported.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-night feature, the $20,000 B.F. Phillips Jr.
Handicap, was among the races canceled, postponing 6-year-old mare
Kool Kue Baby's chance to win her 21st lifetime stakes race and
move within one of the all-time record. The race will be
rescheduled for a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was only 6,785, compared to 8,102 on the opening
night of last year's quarter horse stand. On-track betting on Lone
Star races was $195,124 for six races, with comparisons to 1997's
$477,139 total rendered meaningless because of the abbreviated
card.
</P>
<P>
   After such an ominous beginning to the new season, they'll try
again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The first Saturday-night card in track history starts at 6:35
p.m., including the $15,000 Rheudasil Handicap for fillies and
mares.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Chuck Knoblauch, the New York Yankees' second
baseman, expected that his father, Ray Knoblauch, would attend
Friday night's playoff game. Ray Knoblauch, a well-known high
school baseball coach in the Houston area, was stricken by
Alzheimer's last year, but he came here to watch the Yankees'

</P>
<P>
   The son believes that his father is aware of the significance of
the game. ``He still talks about baseball,'' Chuck Knoblauch said.
``He's kind of aware of what's going on.''
</P>

   An adjustment in treatment has improved his father's ability to

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth
inning in Game 1 and in Game 2 entered with two outs in the eighth
and notched his second save of the series, blowing away Will Clark
with a high fastball to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Rivera made a point of developing other
pitches _ a cut fastball that runs in on left-handed batters, a
two-seam fastball that sinks low and inside, and a slider. But in
the postseason he has reverted to his signature pitch, a very hard
four-seam fastball.

TYSON'S EVALUATION MAY BE MADE PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing a battle in a Nevada courtroom Thursday evening,
Mike Tyson will have to allow members of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission to publicly investigate the details of a psychological
evaluation he underwent last week at Massachusetts General Hospital
if he has any chance of getting his license reinstated by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation was not immediately released to the commission.
Marc Ratner, director of the commission, said there was no time
limit set on when the report had to be turned over, but if Tyson
wanted his hearing to take place on Oct. 19, he would have to
release the evaluation to the commission soon.
</P>
<P>
   The commission revoked Tyson's license on July 9, 1997, after he
bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a heavyweight championship bout
11 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's attorneys, and the doctors at Massachusetts General who
conducted the evaluations, argued against the public release of the
evaluation on the grounds of privacy. But the Nevada state attorney
general's office argued that based on the state's open records law,
the results had to be released publicly. District Judge Gene Porter
agreed and ordered the results released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do what is needed to do to satisfy the
commission, but I don't understand why the entire evaluation has to
be released,'' Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing adviser, said Friday.
``We are opposed to the public seeing the report, but we want the
commission to be comfortable with the decision it makes. At the
same time we don't want Mike to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission ordered Tyson to undergo psychological testing by
an independent psychiatrist after a hearing on Sept. 19. The
commissioners expressed concerned over Tyson's mental fitness to
return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   HERNANDEZ TO FIGHT MAYWEATHER FRIDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Genaro Hernandez (38-1-1) will defend his World Boxing Council
superflyweight championship against Floyd Mayweather Jr. (17-0)
Friday night in Las Vegas. The fight will be televised by HBO and
will be followed by a taped broadcast of the Oscar De La Hoya-Julio
Cesar Chavez welterweight championship bout, which took place on
Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather is the first of the 1996 U.S. Olympic boxing team
members to fight for a world championship. He won a bronze medal in
the 1996 Atlanta Games. The only loss in his career was to De La
Hoya, in a welterweight bout in 1995.

</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird was the obvious centerpiece of all that transpired

resist several final chants of ``Larry, Larry,'' even as the other
inductees tried to speak. The other six inductees are destined to
be remembered as ``those who went in with Larry,'' as two-time
enshrinee Lenny Wilkens noted from the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor,'' he said, ``to attend Larry's party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was the final of the seven to be introduced, both at the
start of the ceremony and as the last speaker. On each occasion, he
was given a standing ovation of more than two minutes as he smiled
sheepishly and tried, without success, to quiet the crowd. Upon
being inducted, he told a few stories and then said he was proud of
his basketball accomplishments in high school and college, adding,
``and I'm very proud to say I spent 13 years playing for the Boston
Celtics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was the 25th individual with a Celtic tie to make the Hall
of Fame. (Several ex-Celtics were pres-ent, but conspicuous in
their absences were John Havlicek, Bob Cousy, and Dave Cowens.) One
of his fellow inductees Friday night _ former center Arnie Risen _
was the 24th. Risen came to the Celtics at the end of his career
after making a name for himself, and winning a title, in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   The other honorees were Alex Hannum, the man who coached the
only two teams to defeat Bill Russell in an NBA playoff; Texas
women's coach Jody Conradt; Wilkens, who previously had been
inducted as a player; former Harlem Globetrotter Marques Haynes;
and Aleksandar Nikolic, regarded as the father of Yugoslavian
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Center usually hosts the ceremony, but for the first
time, seats were sold and 7,000 green-clad partisans gladly paid
for one more look at Bird. He was escorted by former teammate Bill
Walton, a 1993 enshrinee; his first pro coach, Bill Fitch; his
wife, Dinah; and children Conner and Mariah. Bird said his main
regret was that his late mother, Georgia, could not be there.
</P>
<P>
   Each inductee must have a Hall of Famer as an escort. Conradt
selected Sam Jones, who was inducted in 1993, while Wilkens
selected Red Auerbach, a 1968 inductee. Conradt accepted her award
on behalf of women's basketball, adding, ``there was a time when if
you had a car, you made the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannum, who coached ABA and NBA champions, was escorted by Wilt
Chamberlain, who was making his first visit to the Hall of Fame
since he was enshrined in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes delivered the longest acceptance speech, which basically
was an extended thank you. After signing off, fans were treated to
a brief reunion of the Globetrotters, including Meadowlark Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Risen had considered asking Russell to escort him, which would
have been an event in and of itself given that Russell didn't even
attend his own enshrinement ceremony in 1974. But Risen decided
instead that he would have a former Rochester teammate, Bobby
Wanzer, because his best pro years were with the Royals. Risen
spent the last three years of his 13-year career with the Celtics
(1955-1958).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too great a guy not to be associated with the Hall,''
Risen said of Russell. ``He was a close friend and I would have
been proud to have him represent me. Down deep, I think he would
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton had no such hesitation about escorting Bird. The two were
teammates for two years in Boston _ only one of which was Walton a
real player _ but they have remained close and share the basic,
fundamentalist view of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been 6-11 since I was a senior in high school,'' said
Walton, who is more like 7-2 but never has owned up to it. ``But
when I got the call from Larry, I almost made it to seven feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton was always one who felt that Bird would excel as a coach,
but he said he fully understood, and endorsed, his former
teammate's decision to start anew in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird gave his life to the Boston Celtics,'' Walton said.
``When he left, there was nothing more. He has two 18-inch rods in
his back and all those surgeries. There was nothing more he could
do. It was better for Larry to go to Indiana.''

FANS WON'T LET LEGEND GOT QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ All day long it seemed like the only goal
he had was to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's your mind-set when your elevation into the Hall of
Fame has all the suspense of a 1957 Soviet election. After all, a
Basketball Hall of Fame without Larry Bird would be like a culinary
shrine without Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on,'' he announced Friday morning. ``I can
finally bring a close to my career. I'm glad that my playing days
are behind me and I can move on with my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps Larry thought it was time to move on, but that
wasn't the attitude of the 7,000 representatives of the basketball
vox pop-uli who assembled at the Civic Center Friday night to see
Larry become the 25th person with Celtic blood to be inducted into
the Basketball Hall of Fame. It was ``Lar-Ree! La-Ree!'' all over
again. The oft-unruly Bird watchers practically shouted down master
of ceremonies Ahmad Rashad when he stepped to the podium, so much
so that it looked at the outset that it was going to be a long and
disrespectful evening for the other six inductees.
</P>
<P>
   They did settle down enough to permit an orderly program to
unfold, but there was never any doubt that the star of the evening
was Number 33. The organizers saved him for last, of course, and he
had a highlight video that was twice as long as anyone else's. When
he was introduced they kept cheering for well over a minute as
Larry gave out a half-dozen ``thank you''s before he could begin
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Get it over with? These people wanted him to restart the career.
Larry was looking for closure, but the fact is that the memory of
who he was and what he accomplished on the basketball court is so
far superior to anything they will ever see again that rehashing
and reliving the Legend of Larry Bird was a mandatory act.
</P>
<P>
   Larry just doesn't understand. Never has. Probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think like a fan,'' he admitted a few hours
before officially becoming a Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   What seems logical to us is decidedly illogical to him. You can
bet he wasn't camped in front of the TV set during the Classic
Sports ``Larry Bird Marathon'' last weekend. As he would say,
``Hell, I did it. Why do I have to watch it all over again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He appreciates the honor,'' assured his friend and assistant
coach Rick Carlisle. ``He cares more than he let on.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said he didn't care, or that getting into the Hall
of Fame meant nothing to him. Larry appreciates being in the
company of great players. From his earliest days as a Celtic, he
paid proper homage to those who came before, even if he never saw
them. He once asked a couple of writers why there was any debate
about who the best player ever had been. He had been looking in the
record book and it looked like ``The Wilt Chamberlain Story.''
Larry figured it was an easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   He never laid any claim to inventing the sport, and he went out
of his way to reject any notion that he and Magic Johnson deserve
credit for reviving the NBA. ``Two guys did not turn the league
around,'' he said firmly. ``There were a lot of great players
before us and after us.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't understand why anyone would not understand his
desire to stop talking about his playing career. ``It's just time
to get it over with,'' he explained. ``I really feel that way.
Yeah, I was a great player, but I don't want to keep talking about
it. I've got a new career going. I'm a coach now. I'd like people
to talk about my team a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Lar. Nice try. This is Boston. They're still talking
about Cousy. They're still talking about Russell. They're still
talking about Heinsohn. They're still talking about Havlicek.
They're still talking about Cowens. Somebody probably is still
talking about Fat Freddy Scolari. And you think that with the
massive video tape trail you left behind they will ever stop
talking about you?
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Larry had a similar blase attitude toward ``Larry Bird Night'' 5
1/2 years ago, and now he says it was one of the greatest nights in
his life. ``That was very special,'' he said. ``It is still amazing
to me that people came into the building on a night when there was
no game. I can still remember the feeling I got looking at all the
seats filled in the Garden, and I'm very proud we raised a lot of
money for charity that night. To look around and see the seats
filled was amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a second night to ponder. Surely on that trip back to
Indianapolis Friday night he had to be feeling more awe and wonder
about what he accomplished during those 13 years in Boston. Because
of Larry Bird, the Hall of Fame officials had to accommodate triple
the amount of media than they had for the previous grand attraction
(Dr. J, 1993). Because of Larry Bird, the Green People came out of
their six-year hibernation from as far away as California and
Seattle to seek autographs and Bird sightings. Because of Larry
Bird, the atmosphere at the Hall of Fame induction was transformed
into something akin to a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   And when Larry Bird came out on the stage to be greeted by a
raucous standing ovation, his face broke into a smile. Surely now
he has to know.
</P>
<P>
   It may be over for him. But it's never going to be over for the
rest of us. Larry Bird gave us the best moments of our
basketball-loving lives. And we're supposed to forget?

CHREBET IS LEAVING IT UP TO PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Wayne Chrebet of the New York Jets has been
spending six hours a day trying to make his sprained left ankle
healthy enough to carry him against the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The wide receiver was asked Friday if he would be starting on
Sunday at Giants Stadium. ``Bill is the only one in the whole
entire world who knows,'' he said, referring to the head coach,
Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that Chrebet would play, but perhaps not start,
against a defense that has held opposing quarterbacks to fewer than
50 percent completions.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Chrebet must have told Parcells he wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' replied the sure-handed, acrobatic receiver. ``But I
don't think it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Chrebet has emerged as a receiver with big numbers
this season. He is averaging 16.1 yards a catch, compared with his
career mark of 11.7. But he remains one of those players whose
success belies computers, scouting reports and all the other
football verities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Football League drafted 31 receivers.
Chrebet, from Hofstra, was not among them. He showed up on the Jets
as a free agent. Yet, of all those players drafted that year _
including the first-rounders Joey Galloway of Seattle, J.J. Stokes
of San Francisco and Michael Westbrook of Washington _ Chrebet is
the leader in receptions with 223. He amassed 2,675 yards and 12
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet hurt his ankle two Sundays ago against the Colts. ``Most
of the swelling is down,'' he said. ``But you can still see purple.
I'm going to feel it until I lay off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dedric Ward will start if Chrebet does not.
</P>
<P>
   Running Behind Marino
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino's accomplishments take up 46 pages in the Dolphins'
media guide. And why not? No quarterback in history has tossed more
touchdowns than Marino's 388.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of passing, even over 15 years, and part of the
reason was necessity. Only one Dolphin has rushed for 1,000 yards
in a season in that time. That was Karim Abdul-Jabbar two years
ago. Now, Abdul-Jabbar is on his way to another such campaign with
291 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Marino came into the season averaging 34.6 passes a game. This
year he has had to throw only 24 times a game. Don't be fooled by
that number, though. Bill Parcells isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll try to be successful with what they've done,''
said Parcells, talking about Miami's running game. ``But they
haven't been behind, and if they are, I expect to see the other
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino has more touchdowns against the Jets, 67, than any
quarterback has thrown against another team. One factor is that the
Jets hardly pressure him. He has had 10 games against them without
being sacked. In his last seven appearances, the Jets got to him no
more than once. This year's Jets, meanwhile, do not have a sack
from the defensive line, the only NFL team with such a negative
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Foley Concerned for Mother
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Glenn Foley said Friday that he was ready to give up
his career by donating a kidney to his mother, Sue, who is waiting
for a kidney transplant. Foley was expecting to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother didn't want any of her children to give up a
kidney,'' he said. ``She wouldn't let any of her sons be tested to
see if they matched. She has four boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her sisters and brothers were tested along with Foley's
father, Ed, who has a compatible kidney. Tests are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Red-Zone Tough
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense has permitted only three touchdowns in the
nine times opposing teams have got inside the 20-yard line. Only
two other clubs, the Broncos and the Jaguars, have a better
percentage in preventing touchdowns in the area referred to as the
red zone. ... The Jets' offense is doing a good job on first down:
5.47 yards an attempt, third best in the American Conference. But
the Jets have been burned on defense, with opposing teams averaging
more than 7 yards on first down, the worst in the league.

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S LAWYERS' LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a letter dated Friday
from President Clinton's lawyers and the White House counsel to the
chairman and the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee
demanding a definition of an impeachable offense before the
committee moves forward and contending that nothing alleged against
Clinton rises to that standard:
</P>
<P>
   Early next week the members of the Judiciary Committee will cast
their first votes as participants in a ``grand inquest'' charged
with responsibility for the most grave of constitutional
proceedings. They will do so in circumstances unlike those in any
proceeding that they have experienced in their professional
careers. They will be asked to judge whether the evidence before
them (untested by the usual adversarial process) provides any
reason to believe that the President has violated a standard of
conduct that they have made no effort to define.
</P>
<P>
   No member ever has ventured, or seen others venture, into any
legal process without some understanding of the standards to be
applied. Before a prosecutor would even open a grand jury
investigation, he would test the information he had against the
criminal code to determine whether there was any possibility that a
crime actually had been committed. Before a plaintiff's lawyer
would file a complaint, she would test the facts her client gave
her against the law to determine whether there was a valid claim.
Yet, the members of the committee are being asked to vote on
whether there is any basis for believing that the President has
committed impeachable offenses _ but are being told that nothing
will be done to define those offenses until after they have voted.
</P>
<P>
   We submit that no lawyer would follow such a course in dealing
with any other matter. We submit, as well, that nothing in this
unique proceeding _ even acknowledging its special political nature
_ should lead the members of this distinguished body, who should
serve as models for other lawyers to emulate, to abandon the
principles of fairness and due process that lie at the heart of
their profession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That said, we are convinced that, if the committee does adopt a
definition of impeachable offenses consistent with the clear
historical precedents and equally clear intent of the framers
underlying Section 4 of Article II, as well as the standards
applied during the Nixon proceedings 24 years ago, it will conclude
that nothing in the Starr referral is remotely sufficient to
warrant an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a declaration of war, the most solemn and important
responsibility Congress bears is to wield the power of impeachment
wisely. The significance of this process can scarcely be
overstated. As Prof. Charles Black has noted: ``The Presidency is a
prime symbol of our national unity. The election of the President
(with his alternate, the Vice President) is the only political act
that we perform together as a nation; voting in the Presidential
election is certainly the political choice most significant to the
American people, and most closely attended to by them.'' It is
therefore critical that the process of impeachment, through which
535 people may undo a national decision, both be fair and be
perceived to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental fairness requires that the House Committee on the
Judiciary clarify and define the standard of impeachability that
will be applicable to this case before voting to proceed with an
inquiry. We respectfully submit that the Starr referral, salacious
and prejudicial as it may be, cannot meet any standard that is
defined in conformity with precedent, constitutional tradition, and
the express intent of the framers. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Committee on the Judiciary should first determine what
constitutes an ``impeachable offense'' before it votes on whether
to authorize an impeachment inquiry. As we will demonstrate, the
framers of the Constitution did not intend for the definition of
``Treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors'' to be
open-ended. Even if the standard chosen by the committee is
somewhat abstract, it is important that it be agreed upon in
advance of voting whether to go forward with an impeachment
inquiry. The committee has a responsibility to measure the
allegations and weigh the evidence against an established standard.
If the committee instead seeks to shape the standard to fit the
allegations, the public will surely see it as a partisan effort to
drive the President from office. ...
</P>
<P>
   The need for a working definition of the term ``impeachable
offense'' is underlined by the inflammatory and one-sided
presentation of ``facts'' in the Starr referral. While that
document states that ``It is not the role of this office to
determine whether the President's actions warrant impeachment by
the House and removal by the Senate,'' Ref. 5, the O.I.C.,
purporting to act under his statutory mandate to submit substantial
and credible information that ``may constitute grounds for an
impeachment,'' 28 U.S.C. 595(c), has in fact submitted a ``brief.''
The document is one-sided, tendentious, and loaded with unnecessary
and prejudicial graphic detail. Independent Counsel Starr finds
room for hundreds of salacious details but could not find space to
quote Ms. Lewinsky's closing comment to the grand jury (elicited by
a grand juror, not by the prosecutors): ``I would just like to say
that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for
my silence.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, it is critical that the Committee on the
Judiciary define the standard of impeachable conduct. Otherwise, a
vote to proceed with a full-scale impeachment inquiry will have all
the intelligibility of the Roman emperor's thumb in the
gladiatorial arena. The vote will signal no agreement, bipartisan
or otherwise, on whether the national trauma of impeachment
hearings is justified on other than purely partisan grounds.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Framers included specific provisions for impeachment in the
Constitution because they understood that only the most serious
forms of public wrongdoing warranted the most severe political
remedy. Impeachment is a basic constitutional safeguard, designed
both to correct harms to the system of government itself and to
protect the people from serious malfeasance in the carrying out of
public functions. Nothing less than the gravest executive
wrongdoing can justify impeachment. The Constitution leaves lesser
wrongs to the political process and to public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The English precedents illustrate that impeachment was
understood to apply only to fundamental offenses against the system
of government. In English practice, the term ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' had been applied to offenses, the common elements of
which were their severity and the fact that the wrongdoing was
directed against the state. The English cases included
misappropriation of public funds, interfering in elections,
accepting bribes, and various forms of corruption. These offenses
all affected the discharge of public duties by public officials. In
short, under the English practice, ``the critical element of injury
in an impeachable offense was injury to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The notion that ``injury to the state'' was the distinctive mark
of the impeachable offense was also shared by the staff of the
impeachment inquiry when it researched the issue in connection with
the investigation of President Nixon in 1974. In early English
impeachments, the staff concluded, ``the thrust of the charge was
damage to the state. ... Characteristically, impeachment was used
in individual cases to reach offenses, as perceived by Parliament,
against the system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional and ratification debates confirm that
impeachment was limited to only the gravest political wrongs. The
Framers plainly intended the impeachment standard to be a high one.
They rejected a proposal that the President be impeachable for
``maladministration,'' for, as James Madison pointed out, such a
standard would ``be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of
the Senate.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The specific harms the Framers sought to redress by impeachment
are far more serious than those presented here. During the
ratification debates, a number of the Framers addressed the
Constitution's impeachment provisions. The following is a list of
wrongs they believed the impeachment power was intended to address:
</P>
<P>
   _ receipt of emoluments from a foreign power in violation of
Article I, section 9
</P>
<P>
   _ using the pardon power to pardon the President's own crimes or
crimes he advised
</P>
<P>
   _ summoning the representatives of only a few states to ratify a
treaty
</P>
<P>
   _ concealing information from or giving false information to the
Senate so as to cause it to take measures they otherwise would not
have taken injurious to the country
</P>
<P>
   _ general failure to perform the duties of the Executive. ...
</P>
<P>
   The ink on the Constitution was barely dry when Congress was
forced to investigate wrongdoing by one of the Framers. In 1792-93,
Congress investigated the then-Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander
Hamilton, for alleged financial misdealings with James Reynolds, a
convicted securities swindler. Hamilton was interviewed by members
of Congress, including the House Speaker and James Monroe, the
future President.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton admitted to making secret payments to Reynolds, whose
release from prison the Treasury Department had authorized.
Hamilton acknowledged that he had made the payments but explained
that he had committed adultery with Reynolds's wife; that he had
made payments to Reynolds to cover it up; that he had had Mrs.
Reynolds burn incriminating correspondence, and that he had
promised to pay the Reynolds's travel costs if they would leave
town.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress who heard Hamilton's confession
concluded that the matter was private, not public; that as a result
no impeachable offense had occurred; and that the entire matter
should remain secret. Although President Washington, Vice President
Adams, Secretary of State Jefferson and House Minority leader James
Madison (two of whom had signed the Constitution) all eventually
became aware of the affair, they too maintained their silence. And
even after the whole matter became public knowledge some years
later, Hamilton was appointed to the second highest position in the
United States Army and was speedily confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent from the Hamilton case that the Framers did not
regard private sexual misconduct as creating an impeachable
offense. It is also apparent that efforts to cover up such private
behavior, including even paying hush money to induce someone to
destroy documents, did not meet the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachable acts need not be criminal acts. As Professor Black
has noted, it would probably be an impeachable act for a President
to move to Saudi Arabia so he could have four wives while proposing
to conduct the Presidency by mail and wireless from there; or to
announce and adhere to a policy of appointing no Roman Catholics to
public office; or to announce a policy of granting full pardons, in
advance of indictment or trial, to Federal agents or police who
killed anyone in the line of duty in the District of Columbia. None
of these acts would be crimes, but all would be impeachable. This,
because they are all ``serious assaults on the integrity of
government.'' And all of these acts are public acts having public
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the reverse is not true: criminal acts are not necessarily
impeachable. Holders of public office should not be impeached for
conduct (even criminal conduct) that is essentially private. That
is why scholars and other disinterested observers have consistently
framed the test of impeachable offenses in terms of some
fundamental attack on our system of government.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations concerning private sexual conduct and efforts to
conceal that private conduct simply do not implicate high crimes or
misdemeanors. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is poised to vote on a resolution
calling for the formal commencement of impeachment proceedings
without having offered any benchmark (or indeed any approximation)
for impeachable offenses. To proceed in this way is to subordinate
the constitutional objective of addressing impeachable wrongs to
the partisan political objective of embarking on an open-ended,
undefined roving inquiry of the President. As Justice Jackson noted
in an analogous setting, it is a question of picking the man and
then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to
pin some offense on him.
</P>
<P>
   Such a procedure would be unfair in a prosecutor and here it
would be deeply unfair and destructive of our constitutional
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Three conclusions follow from a failure to set out the standard
of impeachable offenses before voting to initiate an impeachment
inquiry:
</P>
<P>
   First, that failure portends a dangerous, standardless inquiry,
a kind of roving commission by the majority to inflict partisan
injury on the minority. The majority would thereby signal its
willingness to damage the President, distract government from its
proper business, and waste enormous time and resources, with
absolutely no off-setting benefit to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in view of our history's repeated lesson that the
standard for impeachable offenses is a very high one, the failure
to articulate such a standard necessarily bespeaks an awareness
that the material presented in the Starr referral does not approach
that high threshold. Even assuming that every allegation in the
one-sided referral were true, there is simply nothing there that
approaches any great offense against the Constitution. The decision
to proceed without acknowledging this standard confirms this
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the failure reflects a process that is politically
irresponsible because it ducks any effective oversight by the
public (at the polls or otherwise) of the reasons those who vote to
launch such an unjustifiable inquiry have done so. Unable to
justify its actions under the Constitution, the majority will
instead choose to launch its own Starr-like, open-ended, expensive,
intrusive and wasteful inquiry for no stated reason at all.
</P>
<P>
   As then-Representative and later President Gerald Ford once
expressed the issue, a President can only be removed for crimes of
the magnitude of treason and bribery. The referral alleges no
wrongs of that magnitude. The committee should decline to proceed
further.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees were 10 outs from
clinching their American League division series against the Rangers
Friday night when a Texas-sized rainstorm blew through the Dallas
area and left both teams sitting and waiting to play the final few
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 4-0, with two outs in the sixth inning of Game
3 of the three-of-five-game playoffs, when the storm hit and sent
both teams and the fans scurrying for cover, at 10:08 p.m. Eastern
daylight time. Two hours later, the rains dissipated and the
grounds crew began to remove the tarpaulin _ but then the rains
resumed and the tarp went back on the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Yankees, who won the first two games of the
series, the Rangers and the American League met and determined that
every attempt would be made to finish the game early Saturday
morning. There was a chance the game would be suspended, with the
score 4-0 and two outs in the bottom of the sixth, to be resumed
Saturday at 1:07 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   In the event it is necessary to resume the game Saturday and the
Yankees blow their lead and lose _ forcing a Game 4 _ American
League officials plan to clear the ballpark of all fans with
tickets for Game 3 and play Game 4 a half-hour later. Fans with
Game 4 tickets would then be allowed into the ballpark. There has
never been a suspended game in the baseball postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's downpour follows one of the driest summers on
record in the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer had added to his growing legend and David Cone was
working on a two-hit shutout when the rains stopped the game.
Accompanied by wind and rain, Spencer's home run in the top of the
sixth inning seemed to be right out of the movie ``The Natural.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sixth inning started with the game scoreless, the flags
on the top rim of the Ballpark at Arlington turned and stiffened,
under attack from a northeast wind that signaled the onset of a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill waited on a curveball from Aaron Sele and smashed
it over the wall in left-center field, scattering the members of
the Yankees' bullpen, for a 1-0 lead. Bernie Williams struck out,
the second out of the inning, with the wind blowing harder.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez chopped a single into the hole between short and
third before Tim Raines reached out and slapped a line drive toward
the left-field corner. When the Rangers' Rusty Greer cut off the
ball and kept it from bouncing against the wall, Martinez was
forced to stop at third base. Dick Bosman, the Texas pitching
coach, went to the mound to speak with Sele, and rain began falling
during their conversation. Many fans rushed from their seats to
find cover.
</P>
<P>
   In Spencer's first at-bat of the game, Sele had thrown him a
curveball, and Spencer had taken a great swing _ but managed only
to lift a high fly to center field. Spencer grimaced in frustration
after returning to the dugout, feeling he had missed a chance to
drive the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer probably walked to the plate thinking about that pitch.
With his first offering to Spencer, Sele spun a breaking ball.
Spencer waited for the ball to curve downward, then dropped the
head of his bat on the ball, blasting it to left field. Greer
turned around and watched it disappear into the first rows of the
stands for a three-run homer. Spencer circled the bases with a
small grin on his face, as the storm descended on the ballpark with
thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's mother says that when her son played for Class AAA
Columbus, he would never volunteer his successes, shyly avoiding
the subject until she asked directly. But there's no hiding his
current binge: The whole baseball world now knows about Shane
Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs into the bottom of the sixth inning, the full force of
the storm hammered the ballpark, virtually emptying the seats that
aren't under cover. Cone walked off the mound in disgust, probably
realizing there would be a long delay and that he probably wouldn't
return to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   During the 162-game regular season, umpires probably would have
waited until the completion of the sixth inning before stopping the
action, and then would have called off the rest of the game and the
Yankees would have been 4-0 victors. During the postseason,
however, the leagues make every possible effort to complete
nine-inning games, particularly when one team has built a lead, as
the Yankees did Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius turned his ankle in the fifth inning Friday night
while trying to return to first base on a pickoff throw from Texas
catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Brosius was tagged out and stumbled,
rolling over his left ankle. After being treated on the field and
between innings, he remained in the game, although his mobility was
clearly affected. ... When Juan Gonzalez was asked whether the 1998
Yankees are better than the 1996 team that dispatched the Rangers
in four games and went on to capture the World Series title, the
Texas outfielder said it was no contest. ``It's a better team now,
much better,'' he said. When Gonzalez was asked in which areas, he
said: ``Completely. Starters. Relief. Closer. Defense. Speed.
Everything. They won 114 games.'' Interestingly, by saying the
Yankees have a better closer, Gonzalez is saying that Mariano
Rivera is better than John Wetteland, the former Yankee who is now
Gonzalez's teammate. ... Cleveland pitcher Dwight Gooden, a former
teammate of Darryl Strawberry's with the Mets and Yankees, released
a statement saying, ``We have been through a lot together over the
years, and I will do whatever I have to for him to help him through
this.''

GENE AUTRY, SINGING COWBOY AND MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN, DIES AT 91
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY and HOLLY J. ANDRES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gene Autry, the famed singing cowboy of Saturday
matinee movies, radio and television who built a business empire
that included the Anaheim Angels, died Friday of cancer at his home
in suburban Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   He was 91. His wife, Jacqueline, was at his side, an associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great man and humanitarian has just ridden off into the
sunset,'' said entertainer and comedian Bob Hope. ``Gene Autry was
a giant among the men of the 20th century -- a man of many talents,
a man of many interests, a generous man whose heart and wallet
touched millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry, a Renaissance man who traversed the worlds of radio, TV
and the silver screen, made 635 recordings, 94 films, earned five
stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, owned Melody Ranch in suburban
Newhall, and served as a role model to generations of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Autry celebrated his 91st birthday Tuesday. He had battled
lymphoma for several years, said Joanne Hale, the president, chief
executive officer, founder and director of the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage in Griffith Park, near downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said Autry had been bedridden for ``quite a few weeks'' but
was scheduled to attend the museum's annual gala Oct. 16. Instead,
the event will be a tribute to the western star's life and
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Born Orvon Autry on Sept. 29, 1907, on a farm near Tioga, Texas,
he was the first of four children born to Delbert and Elnora Autry.
His father's livelihood, livestock trading, influenced his lifelong
love of western Americana. His mother encouraged his musical
talents. His grandfather, a Baptist minister, had Autry singing in
his church choir at age 5.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny town was split by train tracks, and Autry grew up
fascinated by the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   At an early age, he began working as all-around station
handyman, train dispatcher and apprentice telegraph operator. He
used some of his earnings to buy his first guitar at age 11 for $11
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the depot strumming the instrument one evening several
years later when a man walked in to send a telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pretty good, son, although you do have a lot to learn.
I would suggest you take your guitar and head for the nearest big
radio station,'' Autry recalled the man as saying.
</P>
<P>
   He finished transcribing the telegram, and was startled to learn
the sender's identity -- famed humorist and entertainer Will
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Autry took Rogers' advice, but the Big Apple radio stations
weren't interested in the tenor from Texas. Keeping his day job,
Autry landed his first radio gig at a station in Tulsa and was
billed as ``Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry eventually moved to Chicago, where he earned a four-week
tryout at radio station WLS, which had the most powerful signal in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks stretched into four years. The legend of the singing
cowboy was born.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's first record, ``That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' sold
more than 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to make 635 recordings, including more than 200 songs
written or co-written by him. His records sold more than 100
million copies, and he earned more than a dozen gold and platinum
records, including the first record ever certified gold.
</P>
<P>
   He had five million-selling songs, including ``Here Comes Santa
Claus,'' ``Peter Cottontail,'' ``Frosty the Snowman'' and ``Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' the second-biggest single of all time and
Autry's biggest hit.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Melody Ranch'' weekly radio show aired for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   His singing reputation secure, Autry set out to conquer the
silver screen. In time, he would rank among the top 10 box-office
draws, the first western actor to be included in the company of
stars such as Mickey Rooney, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in 94 films, always playing himself. When the Legion
of Decency cracked down on the motion-picture industry in 1934,
Hollywood's answer was a series of musical westerns, made to order
for Autry's clean image.
</P>
<P>
   His first starring film was ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,'' which came
out in 1935. Autry's westerns de-emphasized violence; used comedic
touches with a sidekick, usually played by Smiley Burnette;
emphasized his singing; featured independent-minded female
characters; and tackled social issues relevant to the time.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, he never drew his gun first, never hit a smaller man.
Only once in all his films did he share a kiss, with actress Ann
Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's appearances at New York's Madison Square Garden were
always sellouts, as were his rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his popularity, it was suggested that his
constant cross-county traveling was wearing him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If show business was easy, everybody would be in it,'' Autry
replied.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   He earned an unsurpassed five stars on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, and became the first movie star to have a town named after
him _ Berwyn, Okla., became Gene Autry, Okla., in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he enlisted in the Air Force as a pilot and
flew transport supply planes over China, Burma and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he resumed his successful recording career as
well as his half-hour radio show. He started Gene Autry Productions
for films that were distributed by Columbia Pictures, and had his
own record label, Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Autry soon began to amass ownership interests in a wide range of
entities, prompting Forbes magazine to list him among the nation's
400 wealthiest men in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among his holdings were a 20,000-acre ranch in Colorado, hotels
on L.A.'s Sunset Strip and in Palm Springs, and television and
radio stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Tucson,
Seattle and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   He also had an interest in three publishing houses, a flying
school, two newspapers, oil wells and a manufacturing firm licensed
to produce Gene Autry merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Autry bought Rancho Placeritos, in Placerita Canyon
near Newhall, and renamed it Melody Ranch. The ranch, which also
had been known as Monogram Ranch, was a place where other western
movie stars including Tom Mix, William S. Hart, John Wayne and Roy
Rogers had made films.
</P>
<P>
   A brush fire at Melody Ranch in 1962 destroyed historical film
sites, including 54 structures, the western street set and antique
autos and stagecoaches that Autry had collected. After his horse,
Champion, died at the age of 41 in 1990, the last 10 acres of the
ranch were put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's entry into the ranks of baseball owners was set in
motion by the man who would become his cross-town rival, Dodgers
owner Walter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley aired Dodger games over the former KMPC-AM (710), one
of the radio stations Autry owned. But when O'Malley bought a
summer home in Arrowhead, he switched stations, complaining that he
could not get good reception on KMPC during the team's road games.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Hall of Fame outfielder Hank Greenberg and Bill
Veeck Jr., whose father owned the Chicago White Sox, came to Los
Angeles to scout a broadcast outlet for the expansion team they
were considering buying. When the two changed their minds about
acquiring the California Angels franchise, Autry called American
League President Joe Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   Autry telephoned Cronin on a Friday. By Monday, he and his
partner, ex-Stanford football star Bob Reynolds, were in business
after posting a $1.5million letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Autry once said that that first victory would go down as his
sweetest baseball memory, ``until we win a pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry recently sold some of his shares in the team, now the
Anaheim Angels, to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Autry married banker Jacqueline Ellam after the death
of his first wife. Autry met Ellam while doing business with a bank
in Cathedral City, near Palm Springs, where she was an officer.
</P>
<P>
   His best men at the wedding were his lifelong sidekicks _
Hollywood's honorary mayor, Johnny Grant, and actor Pat Buttram of
``Green Acres'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Autry took an active role in her husband's business
dealings, particularly in the operation of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's pride and joy was the Gene Autry Museum of
Western Heritage, which opened in October 1988 on 13 acres in
Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband felt this city had been so kind to him that he
wanted to say thanks in some small way,'' Jackie Autry told the
Daily News several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The museum chronicles the history of the cowboy, from the 16th
century to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene had always believed the cowboy and the West were the
backbone of American history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his widow, Autry is survived by a sister, Veda
Coppola of suburban Sherman Oaks, as well as several nieces and
nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood
Hills will be private. However, a public memorial is planned in
four to six weeks at the museum, a spokeswoman there said.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that donations be
made to the museum, 4700 Western Heritage Way, Griffith Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gene Autry was as big a hero in real life as he
was on the big screen, say those who knew ``America's favorite
singing cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very simple person, with a terrific sense of humor,''
said Alex Gordon, director of licensing for Gene Autry
Entertainment, which oversees the singer's four music companies,
films, TV shows and videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved jokes and stories. He didn't care for any fancy
trappings, either in real life or on the big screen. He never had
any airs about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was among scores of friends, fans and celebrities who
mourned Autry's death Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Jeffries, jazz and country music legend, said he will miss
Autry's humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at his accomplishments and life, we'll see a man
who looked at human beings as one race -- the human race,'' said
Jeffries, who made a special trip to the Autry Museum of Western
Heritage in Griffith Park, near downtown L.A., to say goodbye to
his friend. ``He will always be a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the charismatic Army general who led U.S. troops
during Operation Desert Storm in 1990, entertainer Bob Hope called
Autry the ``Norman Schwarzkopf of the Old West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He accomplished nearly every man's dream -- to own a baseball
team,'' Hope said. ``With his song `Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer,' he'll always have an exclusive franchise on Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt
Disney Co., recalled Autry's long association with the
entertainment giant's founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt and Gene were close, and they shared a vision of Southern
California as a major entertainment center -- and they both made
that happen,'' Eisner said, noting that Disney sat on the original
board of directors for the Angels baseball team Autry owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene had a great commitment to the country's youth, and his
examples of kindness and good will are countless,'' he added. ``We
have lost a great entertainer and a great American.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Maltin, ``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic and editor
of the annual ``Movie &AMP; Video Guide,'' recalled Autry's long,
successful career, which spanned generations and included radio, TV
and the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty incredible career,'' Maltin said. ``Today we
measure success in short spurts. Then you look at his decades of
success in every conceivable facet of show business, from personal
appearances to records to movies to TV to sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people forget he had a weekly radio show for 17 years. He
even got an Oscar nomination for co-writing a song (``Be Honest
With Me,'' from the film ``Ridin' on a Rainbow,'' in 1941).
</P>
<P>
   Fans who grew up watching the gentleman cowboy on the silver
screen visited the museum Friday to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Leigh, 53, recalled meeting the singing legend in 1995 at
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thrill of a lifetime,'' the suburban Studio City
resident said. ``It was like meeting one of your heroes who is
larger than life. And even though he's not here anymore, he'll
always be bigger than life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ginsberg, 81, said Autry served as a role model for
children of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked me over with a feather,'' said Ginsberg of his
reaction to Autry's death. ``I liked his whole moral fiber. To me,
Gene was the kind of role model we need -- not the kind we got in
Washington right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said America still has Autry, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has left a legacy of recordings, music, videos and this
museum,'' Gordon said. ``He's alive for another generation of
kids.''

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ The House Judiciary Committee on
Friday released the final mass of evidence in its consideration of
impeachment charges against President Clinton, offering a pungent
store of furtive tapes and grand jury delvings into Clinton's
intimate relationship with a White House intern. By Francis X.
Clines. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MONICA-LINDA (Washington) _ They talked on and on, about
haircuts, diets, sex and more sex. But the tapes of the phone chats
between Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp show less a real friendship
than a temporary alliance between two women obsessed by Bill
Clinton who often don't even seem to like each other very much. By
Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BETTY (Washington) _ Appearing last January as the first
witness before the grand jury investigating President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, the president's private secretary,
conceded that her memory about important events ``was getting worse
by the minute.'' In fact, as the months wore on and Mrs. Currie was
recalled repeatedly to the grand jury, her testimony grew
increasingly forgetful and confused. By Stephen Labaton. (With

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN (Durham, N.C.) _ In other election years, Reps.
David Price and Julia Carson would have had little in common other
than that they were Democrats with relatively safe seats. But party
officials who opened this election year with high hopes of
recapturing the House are beginning to worry that Democratic
incumbents like Price and Mrs. Carson share something else:
greater-than-expected peril on Election Day. By Richard L. Berke.

   CALIF-BILINGUAL (Los Angeles) _ Bilingual education in
California was supposed to be in a grave by now, essentially killed
when residents voted last spring to end it. But more than a month
into the current school term, bilingual education is clearly still
breathing. The reasons are a subject of hot debate. By Don Terry.

<P>
   NY-PENSION-POLITICS (New York) _ While pension funds for public
employees in nearly every other state are run by boards of public
officials and employees representatives, the New York state
comptroller by law single-handedly controls New York's pension
fund. That gives Carl McCall and his aides the power to hire
investment firms, real estate advisers, lawyers and others to help
invest the holdings of the fund, the second largest of its kind in
the nation, after the California Public Employees Retirement
System. By Clifford Levy.

   METHADONE-HEROIN (New York) _ Methadone, which blocks heroin
craving, is the preferred treatment for heroin addiction, though
the notion of fighting one drug with another is still being
debated. But as the White House drug policy director, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, spoke this week of making methadone more available, New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continued to insist that abstinence,
not methadone, is the only solution for heroin addicts. By
Christopher S. Wren. (With photo.)

   INTERACTIVE-TOWNHALL (Austin, Texas) _ In that dark epoch

   CLINTON-ECON (Washington) _ President Clinton on Friday proposed
changing the International Monetary Fund's procedures so that it
can act earlier to help countries ward off economic crises, rather
than waiting until disaster strikes and bailouts are more
expensive. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   AFGHAN-IRAN (Mirbacakot, Afghanistan) _ Just as a final Taliban
victory seems near in this country left impoverished and
demoralized by 20 years of war, so does the possibility of a savage
new chapter in one of the world's bloodiest histories. Some 200,000
Iranian troops are staging military exercises on Afghanistan's
western border. By Barry Bearak. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POSTOFFICE (Moscow) _ In a season of crashing banks,
plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing crops and rotating
governments, maybe it is not the ultimate insult. But the nation
that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov and still regards a well-written
letter as a labor of love is buckling a little this week, because
it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. The Post
Office is broke. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-U.S.-INDIA-PAKISTAN (United Nations) _ While Congress
debates a temporary waiver of sanctions imposed on India and
Pakistan because of their nuclear tests in May, the Clinton
administration is getting ready to release a long list of companies
and government institutions in those countries that Americans will
be barred from doing business with if the sanctions stay in place.
By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-SALINAS (Mexico City) _ Even in Mexico, where people are
used to hearing that politicians have fat bank accounts, Swiss
police caused a stir when they announced three years ago that Raul
Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former president, had about
$100 million in secret Swiss bank accounts. Now Mexican
investigators say that his fortune is even heftier. By Julia
Preston.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO (Dobrovode, Yugoslavia) _ For the second day, the thud of
artillery and columns of smoke from burning villages were largely
absent from much of Kosovo Province, leading Western officials to
conclude that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had
ordered his troops to halt obvious operations against separatist
rebels. By Jane Perlez. (With graphic.)

   SAFRICA-LESOTHO (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Nine days after

   OBIT-AUTRY _ Gene Autry, America's first movie singing cowboy
and a multimillionaire businessman, died Friday at the age of 91.
Using his familiar theme song of ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' and
riding his famous chestnut stallion Champion, Autry began his climb
to fame in the mid-1930s. Although he later owned hotels,
broadcasting stations, oil wells and a baseball team, he did not
give up performing in films, on radio and television and in his own
rodeo until 1964. By Albin Krebs. (With photos.)

HAITIAN IMMIGRANT HOSPITALIZED AFTER HE IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police said Friday night that they were
investigating the case of a Haitian immigrant who went into a coma
shortly after being taken into police custody in Brooklyn last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Jean Ulrick Charles, 53, is in critical condition and
remains in a coma at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was
admitted on Sept. 24, a hospital spokeswoman said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Charles had apparently suffered a stroke.
``We do not feel that his condition has any connection to his being
in our custody,'' Marilyn Mode, the department's Deputy
Commissioner for Public Information, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But relatives of Charles said they had many questions about his
condition and the reason for his arrest. His son, Jean Robert
Charles, 26, also said at a news conference at the hospital Friday
night that there were welts on his father's face.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Charles was accompanied by Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant who has accused officers at the 70th Precinct of brutally
torturing him last year, and by Samuel Nicolas, Louima's cousin and
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we have is how this man went to a police precinct
and wound up in a coma,'' Nicolas said. ``No one will answer our
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said in a written statement that Charles turned
himself in to the Brooklyn South Task Force on Coney Island Avenue
at about 9 a.m. on Sept. 24 in response to a bench warrant, though
the statement did not say why the warrant had been issued. At about
9:40 a.m., Charles was taken to Brooklyn Criminal Court, where he
suffered a seizure, the statement said. He was then taken to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' doctor told investigators that he had severely high
blood pressure and suffered a stroke when a blood clot formed in
his brain, the statement said. He had surgery to relieve pressure
on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Because Charles was hospitalized while in the custody of the
police, the department's Internal Affairs Bureau investigated the
incident, the statement said.

ONLY AN EXORCISM CAN END MISADVENTURES OF RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It's witch doctor time in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Forget courting Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind improving the starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Put re-signing Royce Clayton to play shortstop on hold.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers need more than anything else right now is an
exorcist.
</P>
<P>
   The Curse of Roger Moret _ what else can it be? _ hangs heavy
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain it? They've become the team that can't
win for losing. Even when they do something right, it turns out
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Take last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing series of misadventures, the Rangers were swept
out of the divisional playoffs by the Yankees, who rode spectacular
rookie Shane Spencer's three-run, sixth-inning homer to a 4-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Make that washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Noah was in the process of throwing a two-hitter for the Yanks
when he realized he'd forgotten his umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it was really David Cone on the mound for the New
Yorkers. But I'll lay 10-to-1 that had to be old Noah, taking a
break from building the ark, who came skidding and sliding across
the tarp disguised as a drunken fan during a 3-hour, 16-minute rain
delay in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say rain delay? That hardly does the flooding of The
Ballpark last night justice. That wasn't rain, that was a torrent.
Three batters after Spencer's home run broke the Rangers' hearts,
the heavens opened up like even God was crying.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise was that when Spencer's shot disappeared into
the left field seats, the lights didn't explode in a shower of
sparks, just like in ``The Natural''.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I forgot. There had already been a pregame power failure
that knocked the lights out for an hour or more, just one more
piece of evidence that something malevolent hovers over this team.
</P>
<P>
   This is the franchise that let a guaranteed spot in the 1981
playoffs slip through its fingers when the Rangers blew a lead in
Milwaukee and lost on the night before the players' strike.
Everyone in first place at the strike got a free ride into a
postseason tier of games.
</P>
<P>
   The same Texas franchise led the terrible West Division by a
game on Aug. 11, 1994. The next day, the owners locked down the
game and the postseason was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they ended a 25-year wait and won their first division
championship in 1996, it came awkwardly and with little fanfare.
While the Rangers were in the midst of a 15-inning loss to the A's,
the Mariners lost to the Angels to clinch it for Texas. It was well
after 1 a.m. before the Rangers finally broke into the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for this season. Again the Rangers ``clinched'' when
second-place Anaheim lost at Oakland. The Rangers went on to lose
in Seattle before kicking off their champagne party at around 2
a.m. Texas time. Most of their fans had already gone to bed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even mentioned the Sammy Sosa trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can't even get their butts kicked in the playoffs
without messing it up.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd on hand after one of the hottest and driest
summers in Texas history, it rains like the proverbial cow
straddling the flat rock. Only this time the flat rock is The
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Until the rain finally stopped and the game resumed at 12:24
this morning, the Rangers were contemplating being part of the
first suspended game in baseball postseason history.
</P>
<P>
   Some accomplishment, huh?
</P>
<P>
   And pity poor manager Johnny Oates. He states the obvious _ that
the Rangers' chances of winning this best-of-five series with the
Yankees depended on starting pitching _ and the baseball gods throw
it back in his face like acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers get the starting pitching Oates had prayed for, but
their offense, which was second only to the Yankees in scoring runs
this season, suffers a complete blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' best hitters _ Juan Gonzalez, Rusty Greer, Will Clark,
Pudge Rodriguez _ the heart of his lineup, turn to mud pies, going
a combined 4-for-44 (.091) with 1 RBI in 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   One is a very lonely number when it's your team's only run in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for desperate measures; time for Rangers' ownership to
put out an all points bulletin and find the witch doctor or priest
who can lift the voodoo Curse of Roger Moret. Moret is the Rangers'
left-hander who went into a catatonic trance in the clubhouse in
1978, waved a shower shoe at his teammates and put a curse on the
franchise that still bites them at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody or some thing has been doing a rain dance on the
Rangers' heads for 27 years now. The next sprinkles that hit The
Ballpark in Arlington had better be holy water.

CONE COMES THROUGH WITH INSPIRED OUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ David Cone was concerned about his friend,
Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the Yankees outfielder had colon cancer hit all
his teammates hard, but none more so than Cone. The pitcher and the
outfielder have known each other since 1987, when both played for
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very close for a long time, and we've had our ups
and downs in New York,'' Cone said. ``When it strikes this close to
home it shakes you up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought that Cone might be too shaken to pitch
Game 3 of the American League Division Series against the Rangers,
but the pitcher rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl would want me to go out there and pitch,'' he said. ``I
am going to be ready to pitch, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than letting his good friend's ailment negatively affect
him, Cone seemed to use it as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   He shut out the Rangers for 5 2/3 innings last night, and had a
4-0 lead when the rains came. He did not return to the game after a
delay of more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Strong pitching was nothing new for the Yankees. David Wells was
virtually untouchable in Game 1. The Yankees left-hander pitched
eight shutout innings, allowing five hits and striking out nine, to
beat the Rangers, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte was almost as good in Game 2. He allowed one run
on three hits in seven innings as the Yankees won again, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expected it to be different last night for Game 3.
After all, they did hit .304 and averaged 6.02 runs per game at The
Ballpark during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, though, made this game look like a clone of the first two.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Yankees right-hander was even better than Wells
and Pettitte. Cone allowed two hits, and walked one batter. He
struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious early that Cone, a 20-game winner in the regular
season, had his best stuff. He struck out Tom Goodwin to open the
game, and got Mark McLemore on a routine grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a little weakness by walking Rusty Greer on four
pitches, bringing Juan Gonzalez to the plate, but Cone got the
Rangers' RBI machine to pop up to short.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' first hit came in the third inning when Royce
Clayton led off with a single and Goodwin bunted him to second to
put the potential go-ahead run in scoring position in a scoreless
game. Cone, though, didn't fold. He struck out McLemore and got
Greer on a grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had to work hard to preserve the shutout in the fifth. Todd
Zeile singled with one out, and Clayton battled through a 10-pitch
at-bat. Cone finally struck him out, and Zeile, going with every
3-2 pitch, was thrown out.

STORYBOOK SEASON FOR SPENCER SPELLS MIDNIGHT FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Whether he is a rising star or a flash in the
pinstriped pan does not matter for the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   By the dim light of next April, Shane Spencer may turn out to be
another Kevin Maas.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he is Roy Hobbs.
</P>
<P>
   Need a replacement for Darryl Strawberry? There is Shane
Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Need a fairy-tale answer to their left-field prayers? There is
Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Need a home run in the sixth inning that loomed last night as
the fatal blow to the Rangers? Here comes Spencer again.
</P>
<P>
   His name sounds like that of a soap-opera star, but what Spencer
has done is too farfetched for the movies. Even in Hollywood, the
heroes don't always hit home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer seems to.
</P>
<P>
   His three-run smash off the Rangers' Aaron Sele last night
turned a taut pitchers duel into a vigil for the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In 27 Yankees games this season, as the rookie bobbed up and
down from the minor leagues, Spencer hit 10 home runs _ one for
every 6.7 times at bat. In his first postseason trip to the plate
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, Spencer homered again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane-Saw Massacre,'' the headline in the New York tabloid
read.
</P>
<P>
   Like the mythical Hobbs in the movie ``The Natural,'' whatever
the situation calls for, Spencer seems to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys keep saying it's a dream, then I guess it's a
dream,'' Spencer told the media before Game 3 of the American
League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Reeking of Cinderella innocence, he said he was happy just to
get in the game. He said he hoped he got a chance to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, pinch him. Make his clock chime midnight. Tell Spencer
that he's a career minor-leaguer who, toiling this season for
Triple-A Columbus, hit only 18 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, of course, did not need a Shane Spencer. They had
114 victories. They had capable left-field hands in Chad Curtis and
Tim Raines. They had David Cone, David Wells and the legend of the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they also didn't need the motivation/distraction
caused by the sobering diagnosis of Strawberry. The next time you
chant, ``Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl,'' please attach a prayer at the end of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the saga in New York keeps adding more chapters, lending
more and more credence to the notion that this Yankees team, of all
Yankees teams, has been kissed by fate. You'll probably get no
arguments from the Rangers, who clearly were blinded by the New
York marquee lights in this series.
</P>
<P>
   From the first pitch Tuesday to Spencer's soaring home run last
night, it was no contest. The scores were close, but the poker
hands were not.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you give a team that has everything?
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' Spencer said between games 2 and 3. ``I
guess I'm surprised it's all happening at once. I only thought that
if I had the chance, I could probably do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's chances had come in sporadic doses. As various Yankees
lapsed on and off the disabled list, Spencer became the team's
outfield Kelly Girl. On April 7, he was called up from Columbus to
take the place of Chili Davis. Three weeks later, he was sent back
down.
</P>
<P>
   Three more times, the Yankees yo-yoed Spencer to and from
Columbus. He returned for keeps on Aug. 31, and in the month that
followed, Spencer batted .421 with eight home runs, including three
grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   (Cue theme from ``The Natural'' here.)
</P>
<P>
   For nine seasons, Spencer punched his clock in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, everybody gets discouraged in the minor leagues,'' he
said. ``But if you see some of your friends make it on other teams,
that's what keeps you going.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't be for real, or can he? Yankees fans remember another
candle in the wind, outfielder Maas. He joined the Yankees during
the 1990 season and promptly exploded for 21 home runs in 79 games.
He was dubbed the next young Yankee hero.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, Maas' average dipped to .220. By the '93 season,
his last in the major leagues, Maas' output was down to nine home
runs and he was batting .205.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not just a one-month thing,'' Spencer said of his
own meteoric arrival. ``I think if you were to ask anyone who has
played with me, they would say that I'm for real. I hope to just
carry on to next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, of course, does not matter. For now, the Yankees are
rolling and Shane Spencer is playing like a Hollywood creation come
to life.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, pinch him. Pinch the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's midnight.

   But then again, who cares if the skies opened up and it poured a

The Ballpark in Grand Prairie after it floated a few miles down
I-30?
</P>
<P>
   Heavy flooding and high water might have signified an end to the
longest, hottest and driest drought in years, but who's talking
about the weather anyway?
</P>
<P>
   One drought, the one that has brought dust-bowl, postseason
misery to the Texas Rangers, showed no signs of breaking. Right up
until the storm hit in the sixth inning Friday night, the Rangers'
bats continued to suck the playoff life out of this team.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the Yankees' David Cone in Game 3. Before Cone,
of course, it had been David Wells and Andy Pettitte. All are
capable of dominating any batting order at any time. But to do it
back-to-back-to-back suggests maybe other circumstances are
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Has the Yankees pitching been this great, or have the Rangers
hitters simply choked in the postseason spotlight?
</P>
<P>
   And if the choke theory has any validity, which it does, then it
wouldn't be the first time. Two years ago in a division series
against the same Yankees, Juan Gonzalez became a one-man RBI
machine (five homers, nine RBI in four games). But Juan alone kept
the Rangers alive for those four games. The remainder of the
batting order disappeared into the October pressure-cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this time even Gonzalez is missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Through two outs in the sixth inning Friday night, the Rangers
had been shut out on two hits by Cone. And while Aaron Sele pitched
impressively through five shutout innings, the Yankees pounced on
him in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In that inning, Paul O'Neill drilled a 408-foot solo shot into
the Yankees bullpen. That was probably enough to beat the Rangers.
But with two outs and the bases clear, Sele came apart after an
infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Already over the 100-pitch mark, Sele received a mound visit
from pitching coach Dick Bosman, who must have seen something from
the dugout he didn't like. The Yankees, however, would suddenly see
plenty of hittable pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Raines drilled a double to left, and with two runners on, Babe
Ruth's rookie ghost, Shane Spencer, cashed in again.
</P>
<P>
   Sele started Spencer with a hanging curveball that was
immediately jacked into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Down 4-0, the Rangers were waiting for the sweep of the broom.
Here's a team that had scored once in 23 innings on the Yankees,
and then had two quick outs to start the bottom of the sixth.
That's when the skies opened and the flood came.
</P>
<P>
   Choking bats or great pitching? It is a worthy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates is a manager who strongly backed his hitters after
the first two games at Yankee Stadium. And in pregame interviews
Friday night, he was again vocal in saying this was a case where
New York pitching should receive full credit.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a concession by Oates to either New York pitching or
his gagging batting order, Oates backed his words with game
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   When shortstop Royce Clayton led off the third with a single,
Oates had Tom Goodwin bunting. Goodwin got it down, moving up
Clayton, only to have Mark McLemore take a called third strike and
a hopeless Rusty Greer roll out weakly on a check swing.
</P>
<P>
   But the second-highest scoring team in the league (to the
Yankees) was bunting in the third inning of a scoreless game _
highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it was, however, label the bunt as the right move
even if it didn't produce a run. Oates has been stuck with a
dreaded ``small-ball'' team in this series.
</P>
<P>
   And late Friday night, as the long delay continued, it was
unlikely even the rainstorm from hell could postpone the Rangers
quick and scoreless exit from the postseason.

PUNCHLESS RANGERS GO MEEKLY INTO THE NIGHT, 4-0, SWEPT AWAY BY
YANKEES

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Perhaps God, too, grew disgusted by the sight
of the Rangers' futile at-bats throughout this American League
Division Series. Maybe that explains why the heavens unleashed
intense rains, intimidating thunder and bolts of lightning upon The
Ballpark in Arlington after second baseman Mark McLemore took a
called third strike during the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, though, only prolonged the inevitable, with the New
York Yankees eventually defeating Texas, 4-0, after a rain delay of
3 hours, 16 minutes, to sweep the best-of-five series. The game
resumed at 12:24 a.m. today and ended shortly before 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The punchless Rangers generated only three hits, totaled only 13
in the series, and scored only one run in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Shane Spencer, the Yankees' rookie cult hero, broke
open the game with one sixth-inning swing that yielded more
offensive production than the Rangers managed in the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, whose eight home runs and 21 runs batted in during
September led the Yankees, crushed a first-pitch curveball thrown
by right-hander Aaron Sele and deposited it into the left-field
seats. The 371-foot, three-run homer placed the Rangers' dormant
lineup at an insurmountable, 4-0 disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander David Cone became the third member of the Yankees'
vaunted rotation to dominate the Rangers. Cone allowed only two
hits. He did not return after the rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who surrendered only four hits and one walk through five
innings, found the home run his undoing. Right fielder Paul O'Neill
plated the Yankees' first run with his one-out, opposite-field home
run, and consecutive, two-out base hits by first baseman Tino
Martinez and designated hitter Tim Raines brought Spencer to the
plate for the game's definitive at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who surrendered only 0.59 home runs per nine innings this
season, avoided that particular torment as well as any AL pitcher
this season. The right-hander surrendered only 14 through 212 2/3
innings. That ranked second only to Blue Jays right-hander Roger
Clemens, who surrendered 0.37 home runs per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Those two home runs, though, did not cost the Rangers this
series.
</P>
<P>
   Their stagnant lineup did.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton's third-inning single to center field
marked only the fourth time this series that the Rangers' leadoff
hitter in an inning reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates acknowledged the Rangers' offensive woes
when he chose to sacrifice during the third inning of a scoreless
game. Clayton advanced 90 feet on the ensuing bunt by center
fielder Tom Goodwin, but Cone retired McLemore on strikes and
induced a weak, inning-ending ground ball from left fielder Rusty
Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton also became involved in another offensive threat
short-circuited by a lack of execution. Third baseman Todd Zeile
reached on a one-out single, and Clayton found himself embroiled in
a 10-pitch at-bat with Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton fouled three consecutive 3-2 pitches before swinging
through what appeared to be ball four, and Zeile _ who ran with the
pitch _ was caught stealing.

   Could it be that the latest images of slaughtered ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo _ slashed abdomens, spilled brains, slit
throats, severed limbs _ comfort the West in a deeply held notion
of incorrigible Balkan violence even as they spur renewed talk of
NATO air strikes against the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   The question is a terrible one. But after a decade of killing
set in motion by the rise to power in 1987 of the Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic, it seems it must be posed. The cycle of
butchery, professed Western outrage, threats, subsequent
obfuscation and disaster has been too repetitive to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In the jumbled images of pointed Ottoman staves topped with
Christian heads, ax-wielding executioners of Fascist-era Croatia,
bearded Serbian ``Chetniks'' with murderous grins and other
ghoulish images of ``ancient Balkan tribal rivalries,'' the West
has often found justification for its stance.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bloody century in the Balkans. Only a fool would
deny that. From 1912 until today, five wars have been fought, if
the ongoing wars of Yugoslavia's destruction are regarded as a
single conflict (otherwise, including Kosovo, the wars number
eight). More than two million people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps lazy thinking about the consistency of Milosevic's
destructive policies, twisted memories, contorted history and
Western cynicism have contributed more decisively to the bloodshed
than any fabled Balkan predisposition to kill and to mutilate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unforgettable gestures of the latest Balkan
conflicts was the nonchalant wave of the hand of Gen. Sir Michael
Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia in 1994,
that always accompanied his dismissive mantra: ``This is the
Balkans, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, a new rendering of Otto von Bismarck's laconic ``The
Balkans are not worth the healthy bones of a Pomeranian
grenadier,'' amounted to a form of renunciation. In it was captured
a widespread, often subliminal, view that if the people in the
Balkans are really intent on killing each other, there is not much
to be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, adopting the well-honed genre, Michael McCurry, the
White House spokesman, responded to the mutilation in Kosovo by
saying, ``These atrocities are part and parcel of the horror that
has been under way in the Balkans for years.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not try to quantify the years. But in June 1995, speaking
of the Bosnian war, Bill Clinton did. ``Their enmities,'' he said,
``go back 500 years, some would say almost a thousand years.''
Quick arithmetic yielded the astonishing fact that, for the
president, there had been an uninterrupted stream of Balkan
bloodshed since 995.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was not the case. But a violence so constant
would be a fact of life so entrenched that no reasonable person
would attempt to put an end to it. Therein lay the essence of the
president's message.
</P>
<P>
   Another message was not lost on the people of Sarajevo. While
disguised as history, the premise of such comments was an
ineluctable ``Balkan savagery.'' Savagery, as we all know, is the
work of savages.
</P>
<P>
   But the entirely predictable course of the Balkan conflict _
from the Kosovo of the late 1980s where Milosevic whipped the Serbs
into a delirium of nationalist indignation to the latest deadly
spasms of that delirium in Kosovo today _ raises an important
question. If cool analysis, rather than what has often looked like
unspoken prejudice, had guided Western policy, might not many lives
have been saved?
</P>
<P>
   For Kosovo, whose population is more than 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, always held the key to the decade-long violence that has
now come full circle in the Balkans, and the key to Milosevic's
destructive psyche. There was nothing ancient about the start of
Yugoslavia's violent unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Serbian Memorandum, the nationalist diatribe that
was the basis of Milosevic's rise to power, spoke of the
``neo-Fascist aggression'' of the Kosovo Albanians, their ``reign
of terror,'' their attack on ``the cradle of the Serbs' historical
existence,'' and their ``physical, political, legal and cultural
genocide of the Serbian population in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, through the 1980s, no more than a handful of Serbs died
in violent incidents in Kosovo. There was nothing that could
justify this incendiary language. Its thrust, however, served
Milosevic's unwavering purpose: to couch an aggressive Serbian
project in defensive terms. For imagined war, imagined genocide
that the majority of a nation becomes convinced is real may in time
come to inspire real war, real genocide. So it proved in Bosnia,
during the Serb rampage of 1992, and so it seems today in
devastated Kosovo villages like Donji Obrinje.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, throughout the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction,
``genocide'' has been the most overused word in the Serbian
vocabulary, a free pass allowing the eternal Serb victim to kill
with an obstinate blindness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, responding to international trade sanctions on Serbia,
Milosevic asked with what right Western countries had ``turned 12
million inhabitants of Europe into a test site for the application
of what is, I hope, the last genocide of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, Biljana Plavsic, the deputy leader of the
Bosnian Serbs and later a most unlikely standard-bearer of the
Dayton peace agreement, accused Bosnia's Muslims a of pursuing a
form of ``sexual terror'' against the Serbs that was ``genocidal in
character.'' This phrase (Ms. Plavsic justified it by referring to
the Islamic practice of polygamy and to the ``right to the first
night'' she said was enjoyed by Muslim notables with Christian
women under the Ottoman Turks) recalled the accusations of
``demographic genocide'' long leveled in Belgrade against the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of such language was always clear enough: to use the
high birth rate of the Kosovo Albanians and, to a lesser extent,
the Bosnian Muslims to summon forth every stereotype of the lusting
Turk.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, if with more justification, Milosevic's
propaganda machine relentlessly used images from the real Croatian
genocide against the Serbs during World War II to portray every
contemporary Croat as a latter-day Fascist ready to throw Serbs
into a concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has had a consistent purpose: to use the darkest
Balkan ghosts to inspire the fear (and fear's other face, crazed
violence) on which he has thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments have seemed ready to play a similar game as
reason for throwing up their hands. As Clinton said in 1994, ``In
this case, the truth is, people there keep killing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there is a particular intensity to slaughter in
the Balkans, as the mutilated bodies in Kosovo underscore. The
desire to eliminate all trace of ``the other'' in a land of
long-shifting borders, the fratricidal aspect of much of the
killing among the south Slavs, the frenzied attempts to draw ethnic
lines through a reality of miscegenation, the old reflexes of a
crusade against the infidel, the Ottoman habits of ostentatious
execution to discourage new offenses, the intensifying cycles of
myth and revenge as the Balkan gyre turns _ all this, no doubt,
plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing inevitable about what is happening in the
Balkans. It has its causes. They lie not in some faraway history,
nor in some genetic readiness to kill.
</P>
<P>
   The issue today, as a decade ago, is the way Milosevic has
cynically used the tragic 73-year history of Yugoslavia _
particularly the wave upon wave of intra-Yugoslav killing during
World War II _ to revive terror and consolidate his power while
unleashing new waves of destruction. He has been abetted, notably
by President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, but his responsibility
appears clear.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than confront this fact, with its uncomfortable corollary
that peace in the Balkans depends on Milosevic being defeated, the
West has repeatedly blurred responsibility: It invited Milosevic to
the London peace conference of 1992 after the archipelago of Serb
concentration camps in Bosnia had been uncovered; it opted for his
extraordinary de facto rehabilitation in order to conclude the
Dayton agreement in 1995, and finally it engaged him as an
interlocutor on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1992, Lawrence Eagleburger, then secretary of state,
talked of the ``political and command responsibility'' for crimes
in Bosnia, and named Milosevic as a potential war criminal. There
was no follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, in Kosovo, the readiness of Milosevic to resort to
an extraordinarily heartless violence seems clear. Many in Western
chancelleries would still be inclined to respond, ``This is the
Balkans, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact remains that, through a decade of Balkan
violence, the one Western act that demonstrably contributed to
peace _ albeit the deeply flawed peace in Bosnia _ was the
concerted NATO bombing of Serb positions in Bosnia in August and
September 1995.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is beginning to climb the impeachment
tree. Each time the limbs divide, the politicians must decide, this
way or that. Each decision will take them closer to one of the
outermost branches: impeachment, resignation or some form of
Congressional sanction.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the binary choices will be made this week when the
House of Representatives votes on whether to launch a formal
impeachment inquiry. No one doubts that an inquiry will be
approved. But exactly what the House Judiciary Committee will
investigate is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Watergate investigations began, serious doubts existed
about President Nixon's culpability. ``What did the president know,
and when did he know it?'' Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. kept asking.
It took more than a year and required testimony from the
president's top aides (though not the president himself) and
Nixon's own tape-recorded comments in the Oval Office to answer
that basic question.
</P>
<P>
   In the current scandal, the important facts are known, down to
the shabbiest details. The testimony of the main witnesses,
including President Clinton, is on the public record, having been
taken by a grand jury and published by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Judiciary Committee hold public hearings? If so, who
will be summoned to testify who can add to what is already clear?
It is hard to imagine that the panel can have hearings without
calling the principal witness, Monica Lewinsky. And it is even
harder to imagine how Ms. Lewinsky could testify without
frightfully embarrassing her questioners, the rest of Congress and
much of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will also have to decide whether to expand its
investigations into other areas like the Whitewater real estate
deal, campaign finance abuses and misuse of personnel records in
the White House (with or without new information from the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr). The problem here for the
Republicans is that other congressional committees have thoroughly
plumbed those issues without striking pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than re-gather the facts, the Judiciary Committee may
confine itself to interpreting them. Here, there are two essential
questions, one easy to answer and the other much harder.
</P>
<P>
   The easy question is whether Clinton lied under oath when he
denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Few if any
lawmakers will take Clinton's side and say that what he did was not
sex. They would risk being laughed out of office by their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The much more difficult question is whether this warrants
impeachment. Obviously, it is not in the same category as treason,
bribery or rampant government corruption. On the other hand,
perjury, even on private matters, is not an inconsequential breach
of the American system.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Judiciary Committee answers may depend on who is
sitting on the panel after the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the committee, Charles Schumer of New York, a
Democrat, and Bob Inglis of South Carolina, a Republican, are
running for the Senate and will not be in the House next year.
Others may be defeated in the election or may seek assignment on
committees with more overall authority, like Ways and Means or
Appropriations. The ratio of Republicans to Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee, now 21 to 16, is based loosely on the ratio in
the whole House, and gains by one party or the other in the
elections could alter the partisan balance. In any event, party
leaders will probably have the chance to fill several slots, and
the committee's vote to recommend impeachment or not could turn on
whether the leaders pick firebrands or conciliators.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee does recommend impeachment, the matter will
then go before the full House of Representatives, to be decided by
the vote of a simple majority. Here too, the November elections
could be the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican edge now is only 21 seats, the smallest margin
for the majority party in more than 40 years. If, as a result of
the elections, the Republican margin is, say, doubled, the
prospects of impeachment will be greater. If the Republicans cannot
expand their majority, impeachment is much less likely. In 1974,
the year of the Nixon impeachment inquiry, Democrats held a 50-seat
majority in the House. President Nixon resigned before the full
House could vote on the impeachment articles approved by the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the House does vote to impeach Clinton, he would stand trial
in the Senate. Conviction would require a two-thirds majority. If
the vote in the House is essentially along party lines, conviction
in the Senate seems out of the question, since Democratic senators
would likely not break ranks. Republicans now hold 55 Senate seats.
They could gain strength in the elections. But no one expects 67
Republicans in the next Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But if a sizable number of Democrats join in the House vote to
impeach, the outcome in the Senate would become less predictable.
Democratic senators would feel freer to vote to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Clinton would sit in the well of the Senate. Members
of the House would serve as prosecutors. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist would preside. No one can quite fathom what it would be
like. There is no modern precedent. The only other time a president
has been tried on impeachment charges was in 1868, when the Senate
fell one vote shy of convicting Andrew Johnson, who boycotted the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at each juncture, lawmakers could choose not to move
on to the next branch toward impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that Clinton will resign, though that seems
unlikely as long as his approval rating in the polls remains so
high. Many political scholars, even some who would like to see
Clinton impeached, believe resignation would be a serious mistake.
It would leave unanswered the question of whether a president
should be removed from office for an offense that did not involve a
matter of state. And since it would bypass the Constitutional
procedures for removing the president from office, it would, some
say, disenfranchise the voters who had no illusions that he led the
personal life of a saint when they elected him twice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The other possibility is that Congress will allow the president
to stay in office but vote to censure or otherwise sanction him.
This is the course the White House is pursuing, realizing that
Clinton has no chance of getting off scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   But a public rebuke with no further consequences seems
insufficient to many lawmakers, including some who would like
Clinton to remain in office. And many authorities believe that
under the Constitution, Congress cannot fine the president or
sanction him in any other way that would bite short of removing him
from office (although the president could presumably agree to a
fine or some other punishment in what would amount to a plea
bargain).
</P>
<P>
   And there is another problem with a censure. If Democrats
regained control of Congress, they could always reverse the
sanction. That happened once before. In 1834, the Senate voted to
censure President Andrew Jackson. Three years later, politics had
changed, and the censure was rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it seems likely to take a while. Many
Americans, the opinion polls show, are sick of this scandal and
would like it just to go away. But Congress is already out on a
limb.
</P>
<P>
   As unpleasant as the choices may seem, just going away is not an
alternative.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 4, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Could it be that the latest images of
slaughtered ethnic Albanians from Kosovo _ slashed abdomens,
spilled brains, slit throats, severed limbs _ comfort the West in a
deeply-held notion of incorrigible Balkan violence even as they
spur renewed talk of NATO air strikes against the Serbs? &QL; 
The question is a terrible one. But after a decade of killing set
in motion by the rise to power in 1987 of the Serbian leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, it seems it must be posed. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACHMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is beginning to climb
the impeachment tree. Each time the limbs divide, the politicians
must decide, this way or that way. Each decision will take them
closer to one of the outermost branches: impeachment, resignation
or some form of Congressional sanction. By david E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   AIR-RAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Newspapers and television stations
around the world have featured scores of accounts of what appears
to be an alarming increase in angry passengers who punch, kick,
scratch, bite and head-butt airline workers or one another. By
Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   SHAME-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shaming people in public has always
been a tantalizing idea to Americans _ punishing wrongdoers by
making them hang their heads before their community. President
Clinton's opera of embarrassment has brought public shaming to a
new high. More than ever, it appears, people are in the mood for
good old red-faced humiliation. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Different reports, different eras, same
subject: race. Issued 30 years apart, the famous 1968 Kerner
Commission study on race and the newly issued report of President
Clinton's advisory board on race are a study in contrasts. By
Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-REVIEW (Undated) _ When it comes to predicting the
intensity of the storm when it makes landfall, forecasters admit
they have far less skill. And they have almost none in forecasting
how large an area the hurricane will affect when it comes ashore.
``We're back in the dark ages relative to that; I'm not sure anyone
knows where to begin to attack that problem,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. So what do
the forecasters do? By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Gen. Henry H. Shelton is a good
soldier. But smart salutes and muddy boots don't always take the
hill, especially when it's Capitol Hill. Last week, General Shelton
and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff unexpectedly caught heavy fire
from Senate Republicans, who berated the military's top brass for
the sin of not speaking up sooner and louder about problems the
officers say are eroding the Pentagon's ability to fight and win
wars. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   PROZAC-REVIEW (Undated) _ For millions of people, Prozac and
similar drugs have fulfilled the promise of freedom from
depression. But for some patients, adjusting to a life without
misery turns out to be far more difficult than they imagined.
Doctors and patients are discovering that recovery from depression
can bring a new array of personal problems, from social uneasiness
and crises of identity to professional and marital strains. By
Margolit Fox.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ Thirty years ago, soldiers and
policemen crushed Mexico's first major pro-democracy movement with
a public massacre of demonstrators that is often likened here to
the Tiananmen Square massacre in China. Each year since, in the
face of that official line, relatives of the victims would
commemorate the Oct. 2, 1968 event by holding candles at Tlatelolco
Plaza, the massacre site, and mourning their loved ones in timid
silence, almost furtively. In every year, that is, but this one. By
Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ALIENS-REVIEW (Undated) _ I F you wanted to send a message to a
bunch of aliens in outer space, how could you be sure they would
understand it? Would you make the message rich in the opaque
minutia of modern science and write it in code? Would you assume
that beings from other planets are more intelligent _ much more
intelligent? By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   ARMENIA-REVIEW (Yerevan) _ Armenia never forgets. Maybe it
should. By Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>

   YEREVAN, Armenia _ Few peoples in the world have had as
turbulent a past, or are as passionately attached to it, as the
Armenians. Many of them believe they are alive today only because
of their ancestors' near-fanatical insistence on preserving the
ideas of the Armenian nation, church and language.
</P>
<P>
   History lends credence to this view. Armenians are from a region
that has been successively dominated by great empires, among them
the Mongol, Persian, Russian and Ottoman. They fiercely resisted
assimilation, and were repeatedly called upon to defend themselves
and their traditions. Often they were defeated at terrible cost.
</P>
<P>
   The great dream of generations of Armenians came true in 1991
when their land emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union as an
independent state. As they savor their triumph, however, modern
Armenians face a deep psychological challenge, one perhaps no less
difficult than those posed by past enemies. The same ethnocentric
nationalism that has allowed their nation to survive so long and
triumph against such powerful odds is now out of fashion in the
world. By clinging to it, the Armenians set themselves apart from
the Europe they so much want to join.
</P>
<P>
   Memory of past outrages, especially the massacres perpetrated by
Ottoman troops in 1915 as they chased Armenians out of ancestral
homelands in eastern Anatolia, forms a prism through which many
Armenians view the modern world. It makes them, like the Israelis,
defiantly unwilling to compromise on issues they consider vital to
their survival.
</P>
<P>
   One such issue is the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the
world recognizes as part of neighboring Azerbaijan but which has
been in the hands of its ethnic Armenian residents since 1994.
Foreign diplomats assigned to help resolve the conflict want the
enclave back under Azerbaijani control with as much autonomy as
possible. But when President Levon Ter-Petrosian seemed ready to
consider that formula earlier this year, he was promptly deposed in
what amounted to a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   To give back even an inch of ``liberated'' land, many Armenians
believe, would be tantamount to inviting a new slaughter. Their
reading of history has taught them that the promises of outsiders
are unreliable, that no one will rescue them in their hour of need,
and that only they themselves can judge what their security
requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnic homeland,'' said Karen Mirzoyan,
who heads the enclave's office in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
``It is quite unrealistic to think that we would subject ourselves
to rule by Azerbaijan.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries that dream of joining the European Union are supposed
to renounce the idea of ethnic homelands and forego claims on land
where their brethren live. Hungary's painful decision to renounce
all claims on ethnically Hungarian regions of nearby countries, for
example, paved the way for its invitation to join the Union. Here
in Armenia, however, not even the prospect of membership would sway
most people away from the patriotic fervor that has sustained them
over millennia.
</P>
<P>
   In some European countries, it is considered highly insulting to
accuse a politician of ``national thinking.'' This is linked with
patterns of thought that have plunged the continent into countless
wars. But in Armenia, national thinking is the dominant and almost
all-inclusive ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political leaders here are very careful to use the word
`national,' said Mikael Danielyan, a human rights advocate. ``The
Armenian mentality does not accept any ideas that it considers
anti-national.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are nearly 50 political parties in Armenia, none
challenges the prevailing nationalist dogma. To do so, many
Armenians believe, would be to expose their nation to mortal
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of those dangers is on vivid display at the Genocide
Museum here in the Armenian capital. Walls of the museum, which
commemorates those who were killed in 1915, are covered with
gruesome photographs that show starving, executed and beheaded
Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they live here or abroad, many Armenians feel fated to
carry one of history's heaviest burdens. Only a few groan under its
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem for Armenia is that we are very much
concentrated on our past,'' said Michael Hambazdzumyan, 22, a
recent university graduate who is working to build a network of
young people in the Caucasus that will press for regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to an Armenian about Armenia, and you'll hear about the
past,'' Hambazdzumyan said. ``We were the first nation to accept
Christianity, we had an empire that touched three seas, we had
monarchs who were related to Egyptian monarchs and European
monarchs, we were the first nation to translate the Bible. Always
`we were,' `we had.' The Armenian cares very much for the past and
what we had, but not so much about what we have and want to have,
and how we can reach that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history is presented to us as war, pain, killing,
robbery,'' he added. ``We have only had 500 or 700 years of peace
in 4,500 years of history. We learn this in school. We learn 2,500
dates of struggles, killings and betrayals. Maybe 10 or 20 or 30 of
them speak about something positive. It is very heavy. It oppresses
your psyche and mentality.''

   If you wanted to send a message to a bunch of aliens in outer
space, how could you be sure they would understand it? Would you
make the message rich in the opaque minutia of modern science and
write it in code? Would you assume that beings from other planets
are more intelligent _ much more intelligent?
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Frank Drake composed such a missive in binary code and,
unsure of its readability, bounced it off just one earthling. But
the clever subject was no ordinary mortal. He was Carl Sagan, the
astronomer and science popularizer who died two years ago. He took
the test in 1974 over lunch at the Cornell University faculty club,
and he passed with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give him an A,'' Drake, now a professor emeritus of
astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California at Santa
Cruz, said last week. ``He got all the message very quickly except
for one group of characters. And once I helped him with that, he
got the rest right away. I think if he had taken it home or back to
his office, he would have gotten the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drake acknowledges that most ordinary earthlings would be
baffled by the message. And whether extraterrestrials would get it
is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the Sagan quiz, Drake had the message beamed
from the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico toward M13, a dense
cluster of hundreds of thousands of old stars orbiting the fringes
of the Milky Way. The federal government pulled the plug on the
search for alien life in 1993, but scientists financed with private
donations returned to Arecibo last month to renew their search.
There has been no answer to the long-ago message.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan, a pioneer in trying to communicate with aliens, had his
own ideas about space talk that relied heavily on drawings. With
Drake's help, Sagan designed the messages that went on the Pioneer
10 and Pioneer 11 space probes, which were destined to zoom out of
the solar system, perhaps eventually to the farthest reaches of the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan's drawings, etched on a small plaque, were easy to
understand _ if you happened to have human-like eyeballs. The
pictures showed a naked man and woman standing in front of the
Pioneer spacecraft. Nearby was a diagram of the solar system and
the probe zooming away from the third planet. Harder to get were a
galactic map showing the Sun's location and a picture of a hydrogen
atom, whose radiating wavelength (8.3 inches) was the key to map
distances.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Drake's missive was blasted through space on a
simple beam of radio waves. His binary format, the simplest of
codes, made the message as intelligible as possible. In theory,
radio waves would spread far more broadly through space than
Sagan's plaque would travel, and have a better chance of reaching
an audience. Assuming, of course, that human bias and hubris had
not rendered the whole enterprise futile from the start.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when Drake was director of Arecibo, the world's largest
radiotelescope, 250 guests and speakers who had assembled in the
damp heat of the Puerto Rican jungle heard the binary message over
a loudspeaker as the radio waves sped upwards. For slightly more
than three minutes, the sound filled the air, trilling back and
forth between the two tones of the binary code. To some
participants it seemed a sad song full of yearning, even if its
underlying message was indecipherable.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that hot afternoon in the tropics, I saw women in
sleeveless dresses rub chills from their arms,'' Drake recalled.
``I saw the eyes of sober scientists fill with tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the cipher is still zooming outward. At the speed of
light, it will reach M13 in about 21,000 years. A reply from any
aliens who happen to be listening in as the signal passes will
presumably take a similarly long time.
</P>
<P>
   Decoding the message, Drake conceded, would take ``all the great
minds'' of an alien race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is not all deciphered, they'd get the message,'' he
said. ``It's the same with any message we receive. Just the
existence of such a message would be a bombshell'' because it would
prove the existence of extraterrestrials.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thirty years ago, soldiers and policemen crushed
Mexico's first major pro-democracy movement with a massacre of
demonstrators that is often likened here to the Tiananmen Square
massacre in China. Ever since, successive authoritarian governments
have stuck to an official history that blames the middle-class
demonstrators who were its main victims for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Each year since, in the face of that official line, relatives of
the victims would commemorate the events of Oct. 2, 1968, by
holding candles at Tlatelolco Plaza, the massacre site, and
mourning their loved ones in timid silence, almost furtively.
</P>
<P>
   But this year was different, because the student demonstrators
of 1968 are now in their 50s, and a number of them last year helped
wrest control of the Congress and city government from the
authoritarian party that has governed for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, the anniversary was declared an official day of
mourning, with the demonstrators who died honored as revolutionary
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a triumph of free expression over authoritarianism, of
the Mexican people's version of history over the government's
version,''` said Carlos Monsivais, a prominent intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most dramatic example of a historical revisionism
that can be expected to accompany the effective collapse of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, as Mexico's single
effective party.
</P>
<P>
   Countries all across Latin America, passing from dictatorship to
democracy, have seen similar quests for historical truth about
abuses under previous regimes. Argentina and Chile, notably, have
set up ``truth commissions'' to help victims come to terms with
their suffering, even though their fragile democracies cannot bring
to justice the generals and others who ordered the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is a bit different, because abuses like Tlatelolco
occurred under a constitutional regime, however authoritarian,
rather than a dictatorship. And the search for truth has begun
while the transition to full democracy is still incomplete;
Mexico's executive branch remains in PRI hands.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the opposition finally wins the presidency, the
clamor will doubtless increase to expose other secrets, about other
massacres or election fraud, for example. Still, enough has emerged
to give a clear hint of how different Mexican history may one day
appear to Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 movement, which began among students,had spread to the
middle class when, on Oct. 2, thousands of demonstrators were
surrounded by security forces who opened fire from tanks and
helicopters. Rivers of blood soon ran in the plaza, and 2,000
demonstrators were beaten and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent revelations show that President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz
orchestrated the bloodshed because he feared embarrassment by
protests when Mexico City hosted the Olympics that month, and that
his government went to great lengths to conceal his part.
</P>
<P>
   The official story also said that students, supposedly inflamed
by foreign agitators, fired on the army.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomatic cables at the time, American embassy officials
estimated that at least 200 people had been killed. Mexico's
government said only 27 died.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six books on Tlatelolco are scheduled for publication this
year; in one, the author, Sergio Aguayo, details how successive
governments pressured opinion makers and public servants to repeat
the official line. The police, for example, closed one magazine
that defied the government in 1968, and several Mexican diplomats
were fired for voicing doubts in private about the official story.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the only serious alternative version of events came
from a collection of interviews with survivors, ``The Night of
Tlatelolco,'' (Ediciones Era), which the author, Elena Poniatowska,
could not get published until Daz left office in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, university researchers and investigative
reporters were able to sift through government archives, and found
a 1968 letter that demonstrates how some publishers parroted the
government line voluntarily. In it, the obsequious publisher of a
Mexico City daily, El Heraldo, writes to Diaz: ``No one has ever
been able to say that I have not acted with open partiality toward
your government.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries cooperated too. Washington never publicly
expressed concern. And recently declassified American documents
collected by the private, Washington-based National Security
Archives included an FBI report arguing that a Trotskyist ``shock
group'' had fired on troops at Tlatelolco. That was an absurd
claim; the ``shock group'' was a plainclothes army unit.
</P>
<P>
   The research here became possible after opposition leaders
forced the declassification of thousands of documents. But the
government is still stonewalling on defense ministry records and
footage of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complete truth is still out of reach, because the powers
of the opposition are limited,'' said Gustavo Espinosa Plata, who
in 1968 witnessed the atrocities and now presides over a
congressional investigating committee. ``We'll wait until we take
control of the entire government. Then we'll really lay bare the
system.''

   WASHINGTON _ Different reports, different eras, same subject:
race.
</P>
<P>
   Issued 30 years apart, the famous 1968 Kerner Commission study
on race and the newly issued report of President Clinton's advisory
board on race are a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerner report, named for its chairman, Otto Kerner, former
governor of Illinois, was replete with dire warnings. It said the
country was becoming ``two societies, one black, one white _
separate and unequal.'' And it called for urgent government action
_ including hefty spending and, if necessary, tax increases _ to
address the problems of America's ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   The other, issued last month by a seven-member panel led by the
historian John Hope Franklin, is by many accounts a pallid
monograph. Its major recommendation is for a presidential council
on racial disparities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials say comparisons are unfair: The Kerner
Commission was an independent body, while the Clinton board was
little more than an extension of the White House, charged mainly
with taking the country's racial temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Probably a more telling explanation lies in the eras the two
bodies conducted their work. The Kerner Commission began its work
in 1967, a time of catastrophic race riots in Newark, Detroit and
scores of other cities. A sense of urgency, if not national panic,
reigned.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Franklin's panel worked during a time of relative
racial peace, marked by dramatic improvements in the status of
blacks (some the result of policies advocated by the Kerner
Commission) and public skepticism of government programs and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting reports _ excerpted below (with subheadings
added for emphasis) _ can be seen as bookends for an era of
activism followed by confusion over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Attack the Problem
</P>
<P>
   The only genuine, long-range solution from what has happened
lies in attack _mounted at every level _ upon the conditions that
breed despair and violence. All of us know what those conditions
are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough
jobs. We should attack these conditions _ not because we are
frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience. _
 &UR; Opening statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson, July 27, 1967 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: Let's Keep Working On It
</P>
<P>
   Today, I ask the American people to join me in a great national
effort to perfect the promise of America for this new time as we
seek to build our more perfect union ... That is the unfinished

   Throughout the year, the Board heard stories and shared

however, racial differences and discrimination obstruct our ability
to move beyond race and color to recognize our common values.

</P>
<P>
   The Board struggled with the fact that there currently does not

benefits that accrue to all students and society.

<P>
   By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to
both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems
America faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media
report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world. The
ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's
burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed. _ &UR; Kerner

</P>
<P>
   In our view the dimension of the need calls for an unprecedented
national effort. We believe that the nation's housing programs must

<P>
   Many poor minority residents live in segregated, isolated and
stigmatized neighborhoods. Racial segregation, limited job
opportunities, and discrimination continue to serve as a basis for
persistent minority poverty. As a result, efforts to remove these
barriers to prosperity are important, although not easy, and will
require commitment from government, business, the nonprofit

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, British Airways began issuing printed warnings to
abusive passengers, giving notice that continued misbehavior could
result in hefty fines and even jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The handouts, which British reporters immediately dubbed
``yellow cards'' after the warnings soccer players receive from
referees prior to being ejected from a game, are the latest
development in a two-year campaign by the airline industry to clamp
down on passengers who assault gate agents, flight attendants and
even pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television stations around the world have
featured scores of accounts of what appears to be an alarming
increase in angry passengers who punch, kick, scratch, bite and
head-butt airline workers or one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an American Airlines flight from New York to Los
Angeles made an unscheduled landing in Denver to unload a passenger
who had become violent after a bodyguard asked him to stop
bothering members of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, a young British woman was sentenced to 15
months in prison for attacking three flight attendants on a British
Airways flight from New York to London in June. The woman had just
been denied entry into the United States and appeared to be drunk.
When the crew declined to serve her, she became violent, biting a
female flight attendant and crushing her leg with a food cart.
After being placed in handcuffs, she head-butted two other flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic examples of air rage have become modern
legends. Perhaps the most famous case was that of a 58-year-old
business executive from Greenwich, Conn., who got drunk on a United
Airlines flight from Buenos Aires to New York in 1995 and defecated
on a food cart.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the less-celebrated cases are even more disturbing, with
assaulted flight crews requiring stitches and extensive counseling.
``Getting beat up is not like in the Westerns,'' said Capt. Ed
Soliday, vice president of safety and security at United Airlines.
``People have a lot of mental trauma about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as deplorable as these incidents are, the question remains:
Are airline passengers really getting more unruly?
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines and unions representing pilots and flight
attendants are convinced they are. At their urging, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Justice Department and the FBI have
stepped up efforts to prosecute aggressive passengers, resulting in
heavier fines and some lengthy prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection the rise in air rage appears to be a
lot like the famous crime wave in turn-of-century New York City
started by the journalists Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis, who
created a furor simply by reporting robberies and burglaries that
their newspapers had previously ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Because the number of airline passengers is growing each year,
it may not be surprising that the number of violent incidents is
also rising. But by any standard they are still relatively rare.
Airlines in the United States alone carried 600 million passengers
last year. The FAA reported a total of 196 incidents in which
passengers interfered with flight crews, which is a federal crime.
That's one incident for every three million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is quick to say its records are incomplete. They
include only incidents that result in fines and other civil
penalties, not those referred to the authorities for criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring air rage is further complicated by the fact that each
airline has its own definition of what constitutes abusive
behavior. But the total number of reported incidents is still
small.
</P>
<P>
   United, the country's largest airline with 84 million passengers
last year, says it had 40 violent incidents from January through
August, down from 62 during the comparable period last year.
American, on the other hand, the second-largest carrier, said it
had 921 incidents last year, a 200 percent increase from 1994. But
unlike United, American includes verbal as well as physical
assaults in its statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Some widely accepted statistics are dubious. British Airways,
for example, said its new policy was prompted by a 400 percent
increase in air rage incidents around the world over the least
three years. Iain Jack, the carrier's head of security, said the
figure came from a presentation by an executive of Cathay Pacific
Airways at a seminar in Malaysia in May. It was ultimately traced
to an informal survey of a dozen airlines by an official of the
International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question whether the airlines' concerted
crackdown on passenger violence in the last two years has led to an
increase in reported incidents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their stepped-up campaigns, many airlines now
encourage employees to report incidents, offering them legal advice
and paid leave to testify in court. Before, staff were discouraged
from filing complaints because the airlines were wary of offending
customers. But many airlines changed their policies as a result of
pressure from the unions and the companies' impression that the
problem was growing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FAA and the Justice Department have pushed for
more arrests by the FBI and other federal agents. For example, 40
airport security personnel have been deputized as federal marshals
in Detroit to enable them to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest of the news media has also helped attract
the attention of prosecutors and, as in the days of Steffens and
Riis, perhaps makes the problem appear more severe than it really
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new by any means,'' said John Mazor, a spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association. ``But it is only in the last
two years that we have been able to attract the media attention and
the attention of judges and prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for the alleged rise in air rage vary as widely as
the numbers. Some say it is due to excessive on-board drinking;
others say incidents occur when passengers are denied alcohol. The
flight attendants' unions point to overcrowding and the unrealistic
expectations of a stress-free experience raised by airline
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines point to the ``democratization'' of air travel, a
euphemism for the rising number of poorer passengers drawn to air
travel by bargain fares. But others say the inflated
self-importance of well-heeled passengers is to blame for most of
the violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Jack said 70 percent of the reported incidents on British
Airways were related to the airline's ban on smoking. But he
acknowledged that the airline really doesn't know why some
passengers become violent. It recently commissioned a psychology
professor to study the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics aside, union officials and airline executives insist
that the anecdotal evidence of increased passenger misbehavior is
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Stephen Luckey, a pilot at Northwest Airlines who is also
head of the Air Line Pilots Association's security committee,
recalled a case last year in which a passenger walked down the
aisle of a jumbo jet with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``if you would have told me about
something like that, I never would have believed it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am ashamed,'' wrote Fanny Burney, the English novelist, in
1778, ``of confessing that I have nothing to confess.''
</P>
<P>
   If she were alive today, she might have put her talents to use
as a speech writer or maybe a deposition coach for President
Clinton, so perfect was her grasp of the convoluting concept of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Shaming people in public has always been a tantalizing idea to
Americans _ punishing wrongdoers by making them hang their heads
before their community. But a few years ago, there was a new burst
of interest in shaming.
</P>
<P>
   Judges began to order thieves to wear sandwich boards and walk
outside the stores they had stolen from. And the courts ordered
people convicted of assault or child molestation to put signs in
their yards announcing their transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton's opera of embarrassment has brought public shaming
to a new high. More than ever, it appears, people are in the mood
for good old red-faced humiliation. These days, you can get shamed
on television, on the World Wide Web, on the bumper sticker of your
car.
</P>
<P>
   In June, ``Forgive or Forget,'' a nationally syndicated TV show,
premiered, featuring people wringing out their guilt and begging
for forgiveness. A woman is ashamed that she let her boyfriend
think he was the father of her baby. A man is sorry he lost touch
with his daughter for years. A woman blames herself for getting her
sister addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They apologize, they confess, they grovel. And then, at the
prompting of the host, a woman named Mother Love, they stand before
a door on stage and nervously open it. If their victim is on the
other side, they kiss and make up. If no one is there, the guilty
one is left to dissolve in tearful desperation before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Scarlet Letter ethic. This summer, a judge in
Massachusetts said chronic drunk drivers could be ordered to put
bright orange bumper stickers on their cars announcing their
problem and urging other drivers to report ``erratic driving'' to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, the police department has organized ``shaming
details,'' in which people arrested for soliciting prostitution and
other street crimes are hauled in front of community members
waiting at the precinct house. As the accused stand before them
handcuffed, the citizens let loose with a kind of verbal stoning.
</P>
<P>
   They scold, saying things like, ``You're the reason our children
aren't safe in this neighborhood,'' said Lt. Marie Przynski, who
started the shaming program in the police precinct she commands.
Afterward, the accused are released, but the arrests stay on their
records and their names and license plate numbers are given to
neighborhood leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community loves it,'' Lieutenant Przynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kansas City, Mo., started ``John TV,'' in which the
names, mug shots, birth dates and hometowns of men arrested for
trying to buy sex, and women arrested for trying to sell, it are
broadcast on the municipal cable channel. Mug shots of such
dignitaries as a fire department captain and a former federal
prosecutor have been shown, said Teresa Loar, the city councilwoman
who sponsored the legislation that created ``John TV.'' Thanks to
popular demand, she said, the show is now run four times each
Wednesday, up from once when it started.
</P>
<P>
   Its popularity has inspired another show, ``Slumlord of the
Month.'' The slumlord theme is big from Syracuse, which last year
began posting ``Slum Property'' signs in front of decrepit
buildings, to Des Moines, where officials recently decided to
publish the names of the owners of the city's worst properties.
</P>
<P>
   With all this energy invested in humiliation, does it work?
Nobody really knows yet, experts say. In Kansas City, Sgt. Jim
Connelly, supervisor of the police department's vice unit, said the
success of ``John TV'' was hard to measure. The recidivism rate has
not changed, he said, but some men seem to be more cautious about
whom they pick up, fearing that the women may be undercover
officers. ``It's not a cure-all,'' he said. ``I wish it was.''
</P>
<P>
   And was the decision of a woman in Eau Claire, Wis., a positive
result or a negative one? Convicted of welfare fraud, she chose to
go to jail instead of suffer the embarrassment of wearing a sign
that said, ``I stole food from poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kahan, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School,
thinks shaming is generally a good idea because it provides an
inexpensive and morally satisfying alternative to imprisonment.
``Fines and community service don't strike people as appropriate,''
he said. ``They don't seem to be serious enough to fit the crime,
and community service seems uplifting rather than downgrading.''
Some critics object to shaming because it can also humiliate
innocent family members who live in the house with the sign outside
or drive the car with the bumper sticker on it.
</P>
<P>
   June Tangney, a professor of psychology at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., says shaming may make society feel
good, but it is unlikely to succeed at changing the behavior of the
person being humiliated, especially since those people are used to
flouting society's rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings of shame can actually have some pretty unintended
negative consequences,'' said Tangney, who has studied shame among
people who have made non-criminal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people feel shamed or humiliated, they're likely to want
to hide and likely to avoid taking responsibility,'' she said. ``If
we are holding the person up to public humiliation, the offender's
focus then is on themselves and how they're being badly treated,
rather than a focus on the behavior and the consequences of the
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers may have had the best advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live in such a way,'' he said, ``that you would not be ashamed
to sell your parrot to the town gossip.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days before Hurricane Georges struck the Gulf Coast last
week, storm forecasters faced one of their most trying
responsibilities: predicting the inherently uncertain behavior of a
hurricane in time to move people out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is that even though experts have improved
their ability to forecast the track of a hurricane by 30 or 40
percent in the last decade or so, the predictions are still off, on
average, by about 200 miles 72 hours before the storm's expected
landfall. In extreme cases, it takes 72 hours to carry out a mass
evacuation. Even 12 hours ahead, the error is still 40 to 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to predicting the intensity of a storm when it
reaches land, forecasters admit they have even less skill. And they
have almost none in forecasting how large an area the hurricane
will affect once it comes ashore. ``We're back in the dark ages
relative to that,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the director of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``I'm not sure anyone knows
where to begin to attack that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do forecasters do?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal rule is that you can't afford to get people
killed because you're underprepared,'' Jarrell said as the center
began to wind down from its encounter with Georges late last week.
``So you have to overprepare. It's just that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   That means erring on the side of caution and issuing hurricane
watches for areas where the odds of the storm striking may be low.
But this carries a risk of its own. ``If you overprepare too
much,'' said Jarrell, ``you're going to have a public that doesn't
believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Georges ripped through the Caribbean, killing more than
300 people and leaving more than 150,000 homeless, it forced 30,000
to flee the Florida Keys and prompted the authorities to urge or
order some 1.5 million people to evacuate Louisiana alone.
Thousands more were told to leave coastal areas of Mississippi,
Alabama and the Florida panhandle. But clearly not everyone fled.
In fact, more people stayed in the Keys than left.
</P>
<P>
   The use and misuse of predictions in many fields is a topic only
now receiving attention from scientists, and uncertainty haunts
almost all attempts to predict natural phenomena. The atmosphere
presents a particularly tough problem because its fluid behavior is
so chaotic and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   With hurricanes, ``There is always error in the forecast, and
always will be'' said Dr. Jerry Mahlman, director of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory at Princeton University. ``The trick is to pound the
error down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahlman's laboratory has played a major role in reducing the
margin of error. Its global computer model of hurricane behavior,
in operation since 1995, is largely responsible for the recent
improvement in forecasting hurricane tracks. It is now the official
lead prediction model _ first among a group of models _ used both
by the National Hurricane Center and the Navy. Thirty-six hours
before Georges hit land, the center correctly predicted that the
storm would curl to the northeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   As coastal development along the Gulf and the Atlantic has
blossomed in the last few decades, expanding populations have made
evacuation an increasingly time-consuming and disruptive exercise.
But it isn't simply a matter of inconvenience. Estimates have put
the cost of evacuating a hurricane-prone stretch of built-up
coastline at hundreds of thousands of dollars a mile or more.
</P>
<P>
   A false alarm, then, is not to be shrugged off, nor is the
burden it puts on forecasters. ``These folks in the hurricane
center are under incredible pressures and I think they do
marvelously well in the face of those pressures,'' Mahlman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane Center errs on the side of safety in two ways when
it issues hurricane warnings, Jarrell said. First, it expands the
area that it expects will actually experience hurricane-force
winds. ``We know we're overwarning probably by a factor of two,''
he said. This, he said, is an attempt to issue an honest forecast
while at the same time ``telling people how to allow for error.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way of building in a margin of safety, he said, is to
encourage local officials and other disaster managers to make their
preparations as if the hurricane will be one category stronger than
the forecast specifies. Hurricane intensity is rated in categories
from 1 to 5, with 5 the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Jarrell acknowledged, the caution does seem to be
excessive in retrospect. He also acknowledged the risk that if this
happens too much, people will not accept the forecasts in the
future. But the exercise is a tradeoff between that risk and the
need for people to respond to the threat of immediate danger. ``I
guess you hope their memory's not that long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jarrell said, the greatest value of improved
hurricane forecasts may be that bigger stretches of coastline can
now be eliminated from concern when warnings are issued. ``We are
expanding the number of people who don't have to worry,'' he said.

<P>
   For millions of people, Prozac and similar drugs have fulfilled
the promise of freedom from depression. But for some patients,
adjusting to a life without misery turns out to be far more
difficult than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and patients are discovering that recovery from
depression can bring a new array of personal problems, from social
uneasiness and crises of identity to professional and marital
strains. In short, feeling happy after years of being depressed can
be surprisingly unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel incredibly liberated,'' said John Oldham,
director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ``Others have
a rockier time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of Prozac in 1988, a spate of written accounts,
most notably Peter Kramer's best-selling book, ``Listening to
Prozac'' (Viking, 1993), have documented the dramatic, and joyous,
rebirth the new antidepressants can bring. Far less well known is
the fact that the very patients who are helped by these drugs may
also undergo a turbulent period of adjustment in which they grapple
with unfamiliar identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental aspect of yourself has been ripped
away,'' said Lauren Slater, a writer and clinical psychologist in
Boston who started taking Prozac 10 years ago for a crippling
depression that began in childhood. The depression lifted, but she
was left with a lingering sense of bewilderment and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about two years for me to stop feeling like such a
stranger to myself,'' Ms. Slater, who was one of the first patients
to take Prozac, recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has no name, has never been studied clinically
and has barely been described in popular or professional
literature. But clinicians who treat depression know it well.
``I've had more than a few patients who have read books like
`Prozac Nation' and `Listening to Prozac' who have come in and
said, `You know, I'm glad for some people it was this easy, but
this really doesn't tell my story,''' said Michael Thase, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The unease that can accompany relief from depression _ call it
uplift anxiety _ manifests itself in a variety of ways. Besides
grieving for their former selves, the newly undepressed can
experience pressure to make up for lost time or feel ashamed of
needing to take medication. For many, emerging from depression
means having to negotiate the world in unaccustomed ways, as they
learn to assert themselves, take social risks and express anger _
things depressed people typically have trouble doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being plunked down in an entirely new culture,''
said Ms. Slater, 35, who chronicled her experience in ``Prozac
Diary,'' a memoir recently published by Random House. ``You have no
clue how to speak the language, how to get around. You're a person
without a map.''
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, uplift anxiety echoes the problems that can
accompany other radical changes of self, like those documented by
the neurologist Oliver Sacks. In his 1973 book ``Awakenings,'' for
example, Sacks chronicled what happened when patients ``frozen''
for decades by encephalitis lethargica were given the drug L-dopa.
The patients were restored to life, but had to learn to function in
a world that had long since passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   More than 65 million prescriptions for antidepressants were
dispensed in the United States in 1997, according to IMS Health, an
industry consulting concern. But the number of patients who
experience uplift anxiety is not known. ``It's not a rare
occurrence, and it's not a very frequent occurrence,'' said
Maurizio Fava, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School. ``I think it's something in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to have problems feeling good, clinicians say,
are people who suffer from chronic depression, which affects
roughly 3 to 4 percent of American adults. ``If all you can
remember is depression, then there's no baseline to get back to,''
said John Markowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry
at Cornell Medical Center. ``There's at least been a familiarity to
living in misery for 30 years or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   People undoubtedly encountered this problem with older
antidepressants, clinicians say. But the huge popularity of newer
medications like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the
class of drugs that includes Prozac, has thrown the issue into
sharper relief. ``I don't think it was never seen in the past,''
said Kramer, the author and a clinical professor of psychiatry at
Brown University. ``What creates a social phenomenon is just how
widespread the prescribing of antidepressants is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and clinicians interviewed about the adjustment to
well-being describe a range of reactions. ``Once you leave
depression, you're back in the world where people have problems and
have to make compromises and decisions and have too much to do,''
said one patient, an academic in her 40s at a Northeastern
university who recently emerged from a six-year depression with the
aid of Nardil, an older antidepressant. ``And it's more of a strain
to be in that world for a person who's had depression than it is
for a person who has a normal amount of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient, who requested anonymity, likened her experience to
that of a paroled convict slowly re-learning how to function on the
outside. Once active on the dinner-party circuit, she said, she is
having to teach herself how to entertain again. ``It's an effort,''
she said. ``You have to calculate things and figure out how much
time it takes you. If you're taking antidepressants, you might be
somewhat slowed down, so it might need more planning or more time
to do it or more help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some newly undepressed people feel great pressure to make up for
the years sacrificed to illness. ``I'm haunted by lost time,'' said
Ms. Slater, who underwent five hospitalizations for depression and
was unable to hold a job before she began taking Prozac. ``I've had
to work in some ways four or five times harder to catch up with my
peers. I did my doctoral program in two years, which is insane, but
I needed to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others come out of depression only to discover that they're
stuck in jobs far below their abilities. ``While you're depressed,
you may feel you don't deserve any better,'' said Fava of Harvard.
But once the depression lifts, he said, ``a long track record of
underachievement may be quite upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as the undepressed begin to relate differently to those
around them, family relationships can be compromised. Patients who
emerge from depression, clinicians say, often separate or divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for people to have significant marriage or
partner problems upon recovery,'' Fava said. ``In depression, the
relationship sets itself in a certain way, and the moment you
change the balance, there's some sort of a reaction to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people, uplift anxiety can run its course in a matter
of weeks or months, clinicians say; for others it might take years
_ if it ever abates entirely. Some patients unable to adjust to
life without depression may furtively discontinue their medication,
said Oldham, who stressed the importance of warning patients of the
potential for feeling at sea.
</P>
<P>
   And the right kind of psychotherapy _ traditionally considered
an important adjunct to drug therapy _ can help ease a difficult
transition. ``What they really need to focus on is not what
happened in their childhood, but what do they want to do now,''
said Markowitz, who recommends interpersonal psychotherapy or
cognitive behavior therapy, short-term therapies designed to treat
depression.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Slater, the benefits of Prozac have been indisputable.
In the decade she's been on the drug, she has earned master's and
doctoral degrees, established a career as the director of a
community mental-health center, married happily and purchased a
home. But there remains, she said, a palpable sense of bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel _ I KNOW _ that something has been lost,'' she
said. ``And so the grief goes on, even while you get your bearings.
I think the sense of loss is part of being a Prozac patient.''

 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Henry Shelton is a good soldier. But smart
salutes and muddy boots don't always take the hill, especially when
it's Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shelton and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff
unexpectedly caught heavy fire from Senate Republicans, who berated
the military's top brass for the sin of not speaking up sooner and
louder about problems the officers say are eroding the Pentagon's
ability to fight wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were not candid to this member in the problems and
challenges that we faced,'' snapped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
decorated Navy pilot who spent more than five years as a prisoner
of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the chiefs took a defensive crouch to wait out the
volleys. But when senators still attacked their integrity, the
four-stars hauled out their heavy artillery, and took aim at pet
projects of Congress that the Pentagon doesn't want, and at
unnecessary bases that lawmakers refuse to close.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic disputes that generals and senators usually hash
out in private suddenly got a very public airing. ``I am very
concerned of the implication that the gentlemen at this table
aren't being forthright and truthful,'' said Gen. Michael Ryan, the
Air Force chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-lashing from the Armed Services Committee was even
more startling because Republicans have long been the Pentagon's
most ardent supporters. ``This is a committee that is an advocate
for the United States military, no ifs, ands or buts,'' said Sen.
Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   So what prompted Republicans to turn their guns on trusted
allies?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this is an election year, and Republicans have
sought to portray the Clinton administration as weak on defense,
saying it is burdening the military with too many foreign missions
while shortchanging the Pentagon's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also pointed to troubling signs of pilot
shortages, aging equipment and training cuts for some time now. But
those complaints lacked bite, because the chiefs had said the
situation was tight but manageable. That is, until last week, when
they complained in public before the senators. Taken aback, the
Republicans were angry at the generals for not giving them an
earlier opportunity to beat up on the White House over a juicy
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, conservatives felt the chiefs had violated an
unspoken pact to side with them publicly on crucial issues, even if
it means crossing the president, their commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Gen. Colin Powell, Shelton's most famous
predecessor, who looked like a soldier but was also a black-belt
political infighter. Powell even punched his ticket at the White
House with a brief stint as national security adviser to President
Ronald Reagan. Powell's strong opposition to Clinton's plan in 1993
to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces was music
to Republican ears.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Shelton, a commando with scant experience in the
political minefields of Washington, has irked Republicans on other
fronts. The chiefs have refused to endorse a Republican plan to
build a system to defend the country against long-range missile
strikes as soon as the technology is ready. Shelton says the threat
does not yet warrant constructing such a system.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Republicans and the military have crossed swords
before, only to make up, as most people believe they will this
time. But that doesn't stop many Republicans from pining for the
good old days with Powell.

<P>
   &UR; Schroeder Ousts Kohl in German Election &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, defeated Helmut Kohl to
become Chancellor of Germany, ending an era in Germany and opening
a new one in Europe, where center-left governments now dominate the
continent's politics.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Kohl, the last of the European politicians who
were in office when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, reflects
Europe's new priorities as it grapples with the competitive
pressures of a global economy, overburdened welfare systems and
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   And the vote reflected the profound changes in German society
that have followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. The huge cost of
unification, high unemployment in the formerly Communist part of
the country and a shift eastward, away from the conservative
Rhineland, all contributed to Kohl's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; California Sets Early Primary &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With 54 electoral votes, California has long been the 800-pound
gorilla of American politics, except when it comes to presidential
candidates. In an era of increasingly early primaries, the state's
June date made it an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill that will make California
more important than ever by moving its primary to the first Tuesday
in March, just after New Hampshire and Iowa. It will join New York
and other Eastern states in what may turn out to be a giant
national primary that ends the process almost before it has begun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fed Cuts Interest Rate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, had hinted that the global financial crisis might force
the central bank to put aside its concern about inflation and cut
interest rates. On Tuesday he acted, leading the Fed to cut its key
interest rate by a quarter point, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move should give a small boost to the domestic economy by
reducing borrowing costs a bit for consumers and businesses. But
with concern growing that the global crisis could spread and
endanger the long American expansion, Greenspan mainly wanted to
send a message that he was on the case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greenspan Questioned On Hedge Fund Rescue &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington tells welfare mothers not to count on government
handouts, so why did the Federal Reserve arrange a rescue for an
investment firm run by and for some of the world's richest people?
That was the question posed to Greenspan by the House Banking
Committee as he recounted the central bank's role in averting the
collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a hedge fund gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan answered that allowing the firm to fail would have
risked a meltdown in the markets, potentially derailing the
economy. There are always going to be failures in the marketplace,
he said, and Congress should not overreact by writing more
stringent financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Again, a Hint of Hope For Mideast Talks  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pressed hard for a long-elusive
interim settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. President
Clinton met on Monday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu and, Yasser Arafat, and again Tuesday with Arafat, and
invited them to return to Washington in mid-October to finish the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's just before the Nov. 3 Congressional elections, a time
when Clinton hopes to be seen as taking care of business despite
his other distractions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Blast From Space &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Observing repeating bursts of gamma rays from four distant
places in the galaxy, astronomers came up with an explanation, in
theory. When a star explodes, all that remains is a dense object
known as a neutron star. In rare cases, these objects must generate
extremely powerful magnetic fields. Scientists reported they have
compelling evidence of the existence of such stars, called
magnetars.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, an intense wave of gamma rays penetrated Earth's
upper atmosphere. It posed no health risk, but the radiation
briefly disturbed the quiet night sky with electric conditions
limiting radio transmission. Magnetars, calculations show, produce
the most powerful magnetic fields ever seen in the universe,
billions of times stronger than any on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; After 29 Years, A Budget Surplus  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It had been expected for months, but President Clinton held a
big ceremony anyway to announce that the dog days of the deficit
were over. For the first time in 29 years, the government would end
the fiscal year with a budget surplus, about $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But how long it will last? The president has proposed billions
of dollars in new spending. The Republicans agree with most of
those proposals and want a tax cut to boot.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the turmoil in the international financial
markets may wipe out the surplus before anyone can enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HMOs Shun Medicare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries will have to find new
health insurance next year because they are in health maintenance
organizations that are cutting back their Medicare operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration told HMOs that they would not be
allowed to increase premiums or cut benefits for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Medicare agency,
said HMOs were making ``business decisions'' to withdraw from some
counties after concluding that ``it will no longer be profitable
for them'' to serve Medicare patients there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mizrahi Shutters Design Shop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world braced itself for a duller show season in
Bryant Park tents next month as Isaac Mizrahi, the ebullient
designer thought most likely to inherit the mantle of top designers
like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, announced that he would close
his business. Chanel Inc., his backer since 1992, said it was
pulling out. Paradoxically, sales of Mizrahi's collection,
estimated at $20 million to $30 million, had begun to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grand Central, at 85, Gets a Facelift &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Built in the heyday of train travel as a lustrous palace of
creamy marble walls and chandeliers, the Grand Central Terminal had
deteriorated in recent decades into a grimy symbol of urban
neglect. Now, at the age of 85, it has been restored to its former
Beaux Arts elegance.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal _ cleaned, polished and modernized at a cost of
$197 million over the last two years _ was rededicated in a
dazzling ceremony featuring trapeze artists, lasers and
whistle-blowing Metro-North train conductors providing authentic
sound effects for the debut performance of ``Grand Central!'' _ the
march.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Potholes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good time to be a pothole in New York City. For
starters, it's a lot lonelier than it used to be. Back in 1994,
some 200,000 potholes livened up the city's streets, but mild
winters and diligent repair crews have slashed the number,
officials say, to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the big hazard, if you happen to be a pothole, is all those
politicians fighting over who's going to fill you in. Alfonse
D'Amato, campaigning to retain his Senate seat, clearly revels in
his ``Senator Pothole'' image and could at any moment reach for a
shovel.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato prefers the metaphorical interpretation _
``Potholes,'' he says, ``represent the hopes and aspirations of our
people.'' _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is taking literal aim at these
little pockets of the New York experience.
</P>
<P>
   Guiliani, tireless crusader against such beloved combat sports
as extreme jaywalking and taxi bumper cars, now envisions a
crater-free utopia, vowing, with Operation Pothole Blitz, to fill
every blemish in the city's streets by December.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if some innocent pothole, simply going
about its business of jarring hubcaps loose, is suddenly
surrounded, the mayor's limo on one side, the senator's on the
other, shovels dueling in the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TV Culture &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch celebrating the start of the new TV season, the heads
of the six network programming departments pondered the future of
the television movie and declared that literature, of all things,
may be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have all but announced an end to
ripped-from-the-headlines movies, their old staple. Instead, they
intend to make movies of such works as Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in
Wonderland,'' Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' and Dostoevsky's
``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, all those films will be shown this season on NBC,
which has made the biggest turn toward literary works in recent
seasons, producing successful movies out of such classic literary
material as ``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``Merlin'' and even ``The
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   This season presents more of a challenge. The first literary
entry on NBC's schedule is ``Crime and Punishment,'' to be shown on
Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried about audience response to descriptions of a
dark tale of tortured spiritual redemption, NBC is not selling the
show with its usual high-decibel promotion blitz _ no ``Must-See
Dostoevsky!'' Instead, NBC is going for lots of shots of a scary
guy wielding an axe.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems NBC is also worried about how much Dostoevsky the
press can take. In its publicity package for the movie, the network
included the latest Penguin Classics edition of ``Crime and
Punishment,'' all 630 pages of it.
</P>
<P>
   For added insurance, NBC included Cliff's Notes. Yes, THOSE
Cliff's Notes _ the same little yellow-and-black booklets (``Crime
and Punishment'' in 84 pages!) that high school students hide in
their backpacks.

TURKEY'S TIES TO SYRIA SINK TO WAR IN ALL BUT NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Tension between Turkey and Syria has risen to
the point where the top Turkish military commander says the two
hostile neighbors have reached ``a state of undeclared war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to be patient,'' said the commander, Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu, ``but that has a limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship with
Israel. It also makes territorial claims against Turkey and accuses
Turkey of unfairly diverting water from rivers that flow through
both countries.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Turkey is complaining ever more loudly about
Syria's support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. The insurgents
are said to have bases in Syria, and their leader reportedly lives
in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Syria are moving troops and equipment to border
positions, according to news reports, but no outbreak of fighting
is considered imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intervention is out of the question,'' said Turkish Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin. But he said, ``If they continue to do so
much harm, then naturally diplomacy will finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish generals began issuing public warnings to Syria last
month. About the same time, during a visit to Israel, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz dismissed Syrian contentions that Turkey and
Israel have sealed a ``satanic alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about Syria's reaction,'' Yilmaz said. ``Syria's
hostile attitude is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if military ties between Turkey and Israel are based on
shared hostility toward Syria, the prime minister replied, ``If we
are going to talk about hostility, then we need to look very
closely at Syria's support for separatist terror in Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's military-dominated National Security Council discussed
problems with Syria on Wednesday, and announced afterward that
Turkey was considering imposing ``economic, political and military
sanctions'' against Syria. The next day Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel asserted that Syria ``openly pursues a policy of hostility
against Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has denied supporting Kurdish rebels. Last week the
official Syrian newspaper Al Baath said Turkey's newly assertive
position ``is a result of full coordination between Ankara and Tel
Aviv in accordance with their alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military commanders are frustrated by their inability to
crush Kurdish guerrillas, and have for years been sending units
into northern Iraq to attack their bases. They have never sent
troops into Syria, a step that would be explosive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a sign of military frustration with the civilian
government,'' said a Middle Eastern diplomat posted in Turkey.
``For a while the military was saying they had won the war and that
it was time for the civilians to step in and take over. Apparently
they weren't too happy with what the civilians did or didn't do, so
now they're taking a new tack. They want to raise the issue in
preparation for something. What it will be, they're keeping
vague.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another step in its new diplomatic offensive against Kurdish
nationalism, Turkey has moved to improve its relations with Iraq.
The decision came after a deal brokered by the United States to
bring two Iraqi Kurdish leaders together last month.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted that the deal was not intended to pave
the way for a Kurdish state within a future Iraqi federation. But
Turkish leaders were not convinced. They oppose federations or
other arrangements in which Kurds rule themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has recently suffered a series of setbacks in its
diplomatic campaign to isolate Kurdish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   In August, local authorities in Lausanne, Switzerland, refused
Turkey's request to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the signing
of the Lausanne Treaty, which created modern Turkey, in the hall
where the treaty was signed. Kurdish groups had campaigned against
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, a call from the guerrillas for a cease-fire won
praise in several European capitals, despite Turkey's refusal to
consider it. And last week a group called the Kurdish Parliament in
Exile has been meeting in Rome with the support of politicians from
Italy and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy made a mistake,'' said Korkmaz Haktanir, a senior
foreign ministry official. ``How can a NATO member state host a
terrorist organization that threatens the unity and territorial
integrity of another NATO member state?''

LAW TO TRACK FOREIGNERS ENTERING U.S. IS POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A new law that tightens U.S. borders by tracking every
foreigner who enters the United States has been postponed because
immigration officials say they are not ready to handle the job and
Congress is not sure it really wants the measure enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Congress now has until Oct. 15 to either repeal the law or delay
it long enough for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
develop a system for keeping tabs on the millions of noncitizens
who enter and leave the United States at every airport, border
crossing and seaport in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Border states and the governments of Canada and Mexico strongly
opposed the measure after experts warned that requiring even simple
checks could cause huge lineups at the borders and delays of up to
24 hours that would hurt businesses and cost millions of dollars in
delayed or lost trade.
</P>
<P>
   The measure officially took effect Thursday, but Congress voted
to delay it because the INS made it clear it had not developed
adequate technology to gather the information without causing
delays. The agency also does not have a system to process
information estimated to be so vast that in one year it would
exceed all the data in the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This temporary delay will provide several more days for
Congress to pass a legislative fix and prevent gridlock at our
borders,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who wrote the
stopgap legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already voted twice to repeal the strict border
measure. The House of Representatives, however, had voted to delay
its implementation one year, until Oct. 1, 1999. But because both
houses could not reach a compromise, the measure went into effect
Thursday. And when the immigration service did not enforce it, the
government agency was in the position of technically violating the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Congress early on that the technology and system did
not exist and would not be in place by Oct. 1,'' said Russell
Bergeron, an immigration service spokesman. ``And it's impossible
to project when such a system would be in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian business executives and Mexican officials were relieved
that the delays they feared had not materialized, but they remain
concerned that uncertainty on the border still can cause hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make plans to build cars in Detroit based on parts
made in Canada that might be held up by 10 to 20 hours crossing the
border,'' said Peter Eide, head of labor law policy for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and chairman of Americans for Better Borders,
an organization started by individuals worried about the effect of
the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Mohar, minister of governmental affairs at the Mexican
Embassy in Washington, said Mexico wants the measure repealed.
``Regardless of the technology available,'' Mohar said, ``it
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest border battle started with a measure buried deep in
the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
1996. Section 110 of that act required the immigration service to
develop an automated system to track the entry and exit of all
noncitizens, thus providing a way of identifying immigrants who
stay longer than their visas allow.
</P>
<P>
   While the new law would affect both the Canadian and the Mexican
borders if applied, opposition has been strongest in the north,
where millions of Canadians are accustomed to crossing the border
without being checked.

   BOSNIA-NATO-TROOPS (Camp Dobol) _ By and large, American and
other NATO troops have accomplished what they were sent to do under
the Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's civil war in 1995:
they have separated the warring armies, stockpiled their arms,
opened roads and rebuilt bridges, made it safer for the people of
Bosnia to get on with their lives. What they have not yet done is
find a way out.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-CROATIA (Marija Bistrica, Croatia) _ In Croatia, Pope John
Paul II beatified the World War II archbishop of Zagreb who was
later imprisoned by the Tito regime as a Nazi collaborator. But by
paying so high a hommage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the pope
also stepped into one of the most divisive disputes between
Croatians and Serbs throughout the embattled regions of the former
Yugoslavia. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   IMF-WORLDBANK-MEET (Washington) _ As financial leaders from the
world's largest nations, as well as from many of the most
shell-shocked, gathered on Saturday for talks on stabilizing the
global economy, the Clinton administration faced unusual challenges
from Europe, Japan and emerging-market nations, each of which is
arriving with different and even contradictory strategies.

   WORLD-CORRUPTION-REPORT (United Nations) _ Transparency

   APOCALYPTIC-RAPTURE (Undated) _ In an instant, millions of
people disappear from the face of the Earth, shedding clothing,
shoes, eyeglasses, jewelry. Were they snatched by aliens? Vaporized
by a spontaneous chemical reaction? No, what has occurred is the
Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned to take the genuine Christians
to heaven. So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' a series of four
books of apocalyptic fiction that have now sold nearly 3 million
copies _ as many as a John Grisham novel and have now ascended to
the top four slots on religion best-sellers lists. The ``Left
Behind'' phenomenon is one indication of the public's fixation on
the approaching millenium and the widespread anticipation that the
year 2000 portends some Earth-shattering event.

   COLORADO-MINING (Golden, Colo.) _ A massive, illuminated `M'
burns nightly on a hillside here, a reminder that this town was
founded by gold miners and is home to the Colorado School of Mines.
For tourists, Golden celebrates its mining heritage with a mining
museum and welcoming banners featuring a broad-hatted miner panning
for gold. But, this spring Jeff Keller, president of a Golden
paving company, committed the ultimate faux pas in the faux west.
He asked to open a mine. Throughout the Colorado Rockies, mining
tourism is the booming business. But visitors should not confuse
Western sentimentality over mining history with a love for modern
mining. By James Brooke.

   RUSSIA-SPACESTATION (Undated) _ In a concession born of crisis,
Russia has agreed to sell to the United States most of its allotted
research time aboard the first phase of the international space
station. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-FORECASTER (New Orleans) _ Nash Roberts, a meteorologist
from the old school, is famous for his hurricane predictions. He
struck again with Georges, forecasting, when no one else did, that
the storm would veer away from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MAYANS (Los Angeles) _ About 50,000 Mayans were among
250,000 Central Americans who fled torture, rape and murder in the
1980s during a civil war in their native Guatemala. Now, many are
facing immigration hearings under a new federal law. But many
Mayans speak indigenous Indian languages and know only basic
Spanish, not enough to represent themselves adequately at the
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   KLAN-BLACKLAWYER (Richmond, Va.) _ A black lawyer will defend a
member of the Ku Klux Klan who faces felony charges for burning a
cross at a Klan rally.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-DEMS (Los Angeles) _ In 1992, in a good year for
Democrats, Barbara Boxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48
percent of the vote. In the six years since, she has been a
reliably outspoken liberal from a state that is less so, and never
managed to boost her job approval ratings above 50 percent. In
1998, in what is shaping up as a hard year for Democrats around the
nation, Ms. Boxer has struggled to hold her own in the polls
against a comparative neophyte, the Republican state treasurer,
Matt Fong, despite a prodigious fundraising advantage and the
powers of incumbency. Now their contest has become one of a handful
of closely watched races that will help determine whether the
Republicans can achieve a filibuster-proof 60 seat majority in the
Senate that could shape the congressional landscape for years to
come. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   BAIT-VENDING (Newburgh, N.Y.) _ In the closing years of the
millennium, the ancient art of angling is going through some
changes, none more startling than the advent of vending machines
for live worms, grubs, crayfish, tadpoles, even minnows. The
machines, doling out bait 24 hours a day, are attractive to
fishermen because bait shops are increasingly hard to find and are
often closed at the odd hours when the fish are biting.

SENATE DEMOCRATS VULNERABLE IN TIGHT RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1992, in a good year for Democrats, Barbara
Boxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48 percent of the vote.
In the six years since, she has been a reliably outspoken liberal
from a state that is less so, and has never managed to lift her job
approval ratings above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what is shaping up as a bad year for Democrats, Ms.
Boxer is struggling to hold her own against a comparative neophyte,
the Republican state treasurer, Matt Fong. Their contest has become
one of a handful of closely watched races that will determine
whether the Republicans can win a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority
that could shape the congressional landscape for years.
</P>
<P>
   As the House of Representatives prepares to debate whether to
open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's conduct
in the Monica Lewinsky matter, much attention has focused on the
plight of House Democrats in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   But from California to Wisconsin, from Illinois to Nevada, from
Kentucky to South Carolina, Senate seats now held by Democrats are
also in jeopardy, raising the possibility of the biggest Republican
majority in the Senate since the administration of Warren G.
Harding in 1921-23, when the party held 59 seats in a 96-member
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that the Republicans have more opportunities, and
better opportunities,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a
respected independent political newsletter in Washington. ``The
Democrats are definitely still on the defensive, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's own job approval ratings jumped to near his
highest ever after the release of his videotaped grand jury
testimony last month, that support has generally not carried over
to Democratic incumbents around the country, some of whom, like
Boxer and Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, were vulnerable
long before Clinton's current troubles ever surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate alone, Democrats have lost 11 seats since
Clinton's 1992 victory, and Republicans hold a 55-45 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly, the congressional Democrats defend the president a
bit,'' said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers
University and a leading expert on the Senate. ``But privately,
they're angry and worried and scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of the ship leaving the sinking rats.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior Democratic senator, now in his fourth term, summed up
the situation this way, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``When I came here, there were 64 Democratic senators,'' the
senator said. ``Now we'll be lucky to get 42.''
</P>
<P>
   With its magisterial pace, rarefied folkways and six-year
election cycles, the Senate has always been less subject to the
vicissitudes of voter sentiment than the House, whose entire
membership faces re-election every two years.
</P>
<P>
   But when changes in the Senate do occur, experience has shown
that they can be big changes.
</P>
<P>
   In years like 1980, for example, when the Republicans took a
majority as Ronald Reagan was elected president, or 1986, when the
party lost control of the Senate (and lost more seats there than it
did in the House), or 1994, when the Democrats lost control of both
houses after the failure of Clinton's proposed health care
overhaul, ``all the close races went one way,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans win all the close Senate races where they are now
thought to be in striking distance, experts say they could well
make the net gain of five seats needed to reach 60, the number of
votes needed to cut off floor debate and block a Democratic
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's about a 30 percent chance of that happening,''
said Jennifer E. Duffy, the Senate editor of the Cook Political
Report, another highly regarded nonpartisan newsletter in
Washington. ``A gain of three seats is the worst they'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats up this year, 10 are considered safely
Republican and 9 safely Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio seat being vacated by John Glenn, a Democrat who is
retiring, is considered a likely bet for Gov. George Voinovich, a
Republican, while the Republican seat in Indiana being surrendered
by Dan Coats is likely to be won by former Gov. Evan Bayh, a
Democrat seeking to reclaim the office once held by his father,
Birch.
</P>
<P>
   That means Republicans would have to hold onto all 5 of the
remaining seats the party now holds, from New York, North Carolina,
Missouri, Colorado and Georgia, and pick up 6 of the remaining 8
Democratic-held seats to achieve the net gain of 5 seats needed to
reach 60. Their best bets are Illinois, California, Kentucky,
Nevada, Wisconsin, Washington state and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators are in trouble for a range of reasons, from
changing voter demographics, which have left incumbents like Harry
Reid of Nevada and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina facing
electorates decidedly more Republican than the ones that chose them
to begin with, to the failure of some senators, like Boxer and
Moseley-Braun, to solidify their original base of support.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, like Boxer a member of the 1992 ``Year of the
Woman'' class and the first black woman ever elected to the Senate,
is running 10 points behind her Republican challenger, state Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald, in the latest polls, and national Democratic
officials seem to have all but conceded the seat. In Washington
state, another member of the 1992 class, Patty Murray, holds only a
slight lead over her Republican challenger, Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Russell Feingold, the Democratic co-sponsor of the
campaign finance reform bill that bears his name, is testing that
proposition in his own race, eschewing ``soft-money'' contributions
from his national party. He recently let his opponent, Rep. Mark
Neumann, broadcast a heavy dose of unanswered television
commercials. Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report moved that race into the
toss-up category last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky seat being vacated by Sen. Wendell Ford, a
Democrat, appears to be a tossup between Representative Scotty
Baesler, a Democrat, and Jim Bunning, a Republican, with the most
recent independent poll showing a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's situation is fairly typical, with some problems of her
own making and others exacerbated by Clinton, to whom she is
related by marriage. Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Tony
Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, and the senator took some
heat for her initially low-key comments about the Lewinsky scandal,
especially given her past outspoken opposition to Sen. Bob Packwood
and Judge Clarence Thomas over allegations of sexual harassment
against them.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of an ``inappropriate''
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Boxer eventually condemned his
behavior in strong terms on the Senate floor, but not until well
after her California colleague, Dianne Feinstein, had issued her
own stinging rebuke of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong, who was elected state treasurer just four years ago
and whose inexperience on the stump showed in his first debate with
Boxer this summer, is hardly a powerhouse candidate. Boxer has held
roughly a 2-to-1 fund-raising advantage over him throughout the
year, and he barely eked out a victory in the Republican primary in
June against Darrel Issa, a millionaire businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara Boxer were all that strong politically, she'd be
way ahead of Matt Fong,'' Rothenberg said. ``She would have put him
away long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, recent polls have shown the candidates in either a dead
heat, or Fong slightly ahead among likely voters, though a
Democratic operative not affiliated with either campaign said that
recent private Democratic polls had shown Ms. Boxer opening a
single-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fong began his television advertising campaign last week, with
ads in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish touting his support
for education and aimed at making inroads among minority voters
whom Republicans often overlook, though only the English-language
version stresses the necessity for children to ``read, write and
speak English so they are prepared to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boxer has been on the air for about three weeks,
most recently with a 30-second commercial, narrated by actor Martin
Sheen, that denounces Fong as ``the gun lobby's favorite
candidate'' and touts her support for new bans on assault weapons
and cheap handguns. Unlike Feinstein, Boxer has largely failed to
move beyond her liberal base and establish a strong anti-crime
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Boxer's first ad was perhaps even more
revealing. Broadcast in her home turf of San Francisco and
featuring footage from old family home movies, it was a soft-edged
hymn to her support for children, in the form of after-school
programs to keep them ``out of gangs, and criminal background
checks for child-care workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about her losing a lot of her base from '92 and
having to get it back,'' said Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report. ``This
was for the soccer moms she should already have.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Republican Senatorial Committee is closely watching
California as a promising contest, along with Nevada, Wisconsin and
a handful of others, said a spokesman for the committee, Mike
Russell. He declined to speculate about how much the party might
spend to help Fong make his case, but acknowledged that ``it's
certainly a race where those kinds of resources could make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boxer, you have a candidate who is stuck at 45 percent or
below, and has no real room to grow, since most people in the state
already know her and have fixed opinions of her,'' Russell said.
``Matt is not only a sharp candidate, but as an Asian-American can
chew into her base.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Republicans could win control of 60 seats, that
would be far from the most lopsided margin in Senate history. After
the election of 1936, at the height of the New Deal, the Democrats
held 75 seats, to 17 for the Republicans and the remaining split
among minor parties. And after Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide,
the Democrats had 68 seats to 32 for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Baker of Rutgers noted, maverick Republicans like
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of
Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island so regularly break ranks
that even 60 Republican seats would not be enough to guarantee an
ironclad defense against a Democratic filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an individualistic institution,'' he said. ``It's
such a place of personalities and individuals, and there's a real
aversion on the part of senators to appear to be part of a herd, or
part of an unshakable bloc of votes.''

THE VIEW FROM JUST OUTSIDE CLINTON'S DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House that the American public sees is a
place of grandeur and high purpose, the shrine where presidents
greet foreign leaders and host glittering state dinners, where
leaders brandish the veto pen and solemnly announce the dispatch of
military forces overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But seen from Secret Service post E-6, a small desk outside the
Oval Office, the White House is a place of intrigue, sometimes
juvenile, and of mordant humor about the president's private life,
according to the latest batch of testimony released by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow hallways of the West Wing _ the revered seat of
American power _ are populated with ``rug rats'' and ``hall
surfers,'' young aides with White House passes who hope to catch a
glimpse of the leader of the free world on his way to the bathroom
or to grab a can of Diet Coke. Competition for boxes of M&AMP;M candies
bearing the presidential seal is almost as intense as that for
serious ``face time'' with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Most outsiders would imagine that the president's appointment
book looks like that of an orthodontist, scheduled to the
quarter-hour. In fact, when Clinton is at the White House, he often
has large blocks of uninterrupted time, ordered by Erskine Bowles,
the chief of staff, who wanted the president to have quiet hours to
think, read and make unscripted telephone calls. Clinton's weekends
are also often free for such unscheduled ``office time.''
</P>
<P>
   From the accounts provided by witnesses in the Lewinsky
investigation, Clinton spent some substantial periods of that time
with Monica Lewinsky and, later, consulting with lawyers and aides
trying to contain the potential damage from the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,600 pages of testimony, tapes and interviews compiled by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, provide an
unprecedented upstairs-downstairs view of life in the White House,
a near-contemporaneous account of the daily routine of the West
Wing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton White House, according to grand jury testimony
published Friday, Secret Service officers consult with an Oval
Office steward on how best to dispose of lipstick-stained towels
and glasses. A Secret Service agent challenges Ms. Lewinsky, then a
21-year-old intern, about her business in the West Wing until the
president directly orders him to admit her to the Oval Office and
to close the door behind him.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous White Houses, access to the Oval Office is
tightly controlled by the Secret Service and the president's
watchful secretaries. But one very junior employee, the West Wing
receptionist, is granted virtually unlimited access to the Oval
Office on a par with that of the first lady and the vice president
until the president's longtime secretary, Nancy Hernreich, cuts her
off.
</P>
<P>
   One overwhelming impression from the documents is how little
privacy the president actually has. His movements are traced almost
by the step from his bedroom to his office, as Secret Service
officers broadcast his location second by second through their
secure radio system. Staffers and bodyguards always know who is
with him in the Oval Office, even behind closed doors and drawn
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   And although Secret Service officers are strictly instructed not
to discuss what they see and hear around the West Wing, gossip
spreads like kudzu. Many of the rumors appear in the documents
accompanying Starr's report to Congress. The independent counsel
makes no effort to discern the truth of much of the gossip, and the
House Judiciary Committee released much of the material unedited.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I mean, we're the Secret Service,'' Gary Byrne testified last
summer. ``We're there all the time. I mean, we're sort of like
doorknobs. I know that's kind of a little hard to fathom, but I
mean people have had incredible personal conversations in front of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said he befriended Bayani Nelvis, the Navy steward who
tended the serving pantry adjacent to the Oval Office, just around
the corner from Byrne's post E-6. The Secret Service officer helped
Nelvis to reach dishes and glassware on high shelves; the steward
confided his concerns about the president to Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   One day Nelvis, who was widely known in the West Wing as
``Nel,'' complained to Byrne about some lipstick-stained towels
that the president had left in his study. Nelvis told the officer
that he was tired of cleaning up that stuff, according to Byrne's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne suggested that Nelvis discard the towels rather than
sending them to the laundry. ``My fear was that regardless of whose
_ if there was lipstick on there, regardless of whose it was, that
when the people that did the laundry saw it, you know, I just
didn't want to give anybody any more fuel for any more rumors about
the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Byrne already had his suspicions about Ms. Lewinsky, he
said he thought that the stains had been left by another woman who
worked in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pape, a uniformed officer of the Secret Service assigned
to the southwest gate of the White House complex, told the grand
jury he offered a wager about the president's behavior to a Secret
Service trainee on a Saturday morning in August 1997, when Ms.
Lewinsky showed up at his post, ostensibly to see Betty Currie, the
president's private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted Ms. Lewinsky and then told the trainee, ``This is
probably the president's mistress, so treat her, you know, decent,
but again, don't break the rules for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he bet the new officer that Clinton would leave the White
House residence and head for the Oval Office within 10 minutes to
meet Ms. Lewinsky, even though the president was not customarily in
his office early on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I almost lost the bet,'' Pape told the grand jury in
August. ``It was nine minutes and 40 or 50 seconds before _ before
he came down for that appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape, a seven-year Secret Service veteran, said he was troubled
by another of Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the White House, this one in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had come, it seems like, on days that she would come, one
of them particularly was kind of depressing, because I want to say
it was the president and the first lady's, either their anniversary
or, or something to that effect,'' Pape told the grand jury. ``And
I just made a mental thought of that was not the way to celebrate a
traditional family anniversary, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky visited Clinton in the small study off the Oval
Office on Oct. 11, 1997, a Saturday, for nearly an hour to discuss
efforts to find her a job in New York. The president said that he
had spoken to Bowles about getting her a favorable job
recommendation and said he would enlist the aid of Vernon Jordan, a
Washington power broker and confidant of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that although their sexual relationship
had ended several months earlier, Clinton held her by the arm and
kissed her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The day was the Clintons' 22nd wedding anniversary.

BEST-SELLING THRILLERS OFFER RAPTURE BETWEEN THE PAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an instant, millions of people disappear from the face of the
earth, shedding their clothing, shoes, eyeglasses and jewelry.
While terrified relatives grieve, the speculation begins. Were they
snatched by aliens? Vaporized by a spontaneous chemical reaction?
Kidnapped by terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   No, what has occurred is the Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned
to take the genuine Christians to heaven, fulfilling the biblical
prophecy in the Book of Revelation. The rest of humankind is left
behind to suffer seven years of social chaos, wars, a killer
earthquake and the wrath of the Antichrist, who achieves global
omnipotence as secretary general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' a series of four books of
apocalyptic fiction that have sold nearly 3 million copies, about
as many as the typical John Grisham novel. The series made
publishing history in September when all four of the books ascended
to the top four slots on Publishers Weekly magazine's lists of
religion best sellers in hardcover and paperback.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' phenomenon, scholars say, is one indication
of the public's fixation on the approaching millennium and the
widespread anticipation that the year 2000 portends some
earth-shattering event. While the ``Left Behind'' series,
co-written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, relies on a
controversial interpretation of the Bible embraced by many
evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, publishing analysts say
that the books have crossed over into a broader audience,
attracting even secular readers with prose that reads like a
paperback thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cashing in on the public preoccupation with the year
2000,'' said Paul Boyer, a professor of history at the University
of Wisconsin and author of ``When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy
Belief in Modern American Culture'' (Harvard University Press,
1992). ``The message is that you can't do anything about what's
happening in the world. The larger pattern of prophecy is
unfolding, but you can save yourself, so accept Christ today, and
you will be among those who are Raptured. You will be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are among a proliferation of books on
the final days that are best sellers at Christian bookstores. Among
them are ``Prosperity and the Coming Apocalypse'' by Jim Bakker,
the television evangelist once tainted by scandal, with Ken
Abraham, and ``Final Dawn Over Jerusalem'' by John Hagee, a
religious broadcaster. Both books were published this year by
Thomas Nelson Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Left Behind'' series has managed to cross over from
Christian to secular audience by selling well in commercial outlets
like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, said Phyllis Tickle, contributing
editor in religion at Publishers Weekly. ``This says that indeed
they have pervaded our culture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent book in the series, all published by Tyndale
House Publishers, is ``Soul Harvest.'' It was released in June and
occupies the top spot on the religion hardcover list, while the top
three religion paperback spots are occupied by the series' first
three books: ``Left Behind'' (1995), ``Tribulation Force'' (1996)
and ``Nicolae'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Readers are writing the publisher's Web site, which receives
about 80,000 electronic visits every day, to say that the books
have prompted them, their friends or family members to become
born-again Christians. The books have also generated a companion
children's series, a music CD and hats and T-shirts emblazoned with
the slogan ``Don't Be Left Behind.'' The authors plan to write at
least four more books for the adult series and a movie is in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye is an evangelical Christian minister, a conservative
political commentator and the author of 35 books on family life,
creationism and biblical prophecy. Jenkins is a former journalist
who has written more than 100 books, including marriage and family
advice, biographies of sports figures, and who writes a syndicated
comic strip, ``Gil Thorp.''
</P>
<P>
   Both authors say they believe that the Rapture could take place
at any moment because, they say, every major prophecy that the
Bible says will precede the Rapture has already been fulfilled.
Even though the books make no explicit reference to the year 2000,
they are set in the present or the very near future and make
reference to popular fears of social, economic and political
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye even interprets the year 2000 computer problem, in which
computers that use two digits to indicate the year may interpret
2000 as 1900, as a sign of the coming apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It very well could trigger a financial meltdown,'' LaHaye told
readers on the Web site, ``leading to an international depression,
which would make it possible for the Antichrist or his emissaries
to establish a one-world currency or a one-world economic system,
which will dominate the world commercially until it is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are intended to appeal not only to
committed Christians, but also to half-hearted churchgoers and
skeptical seculars, Jenkins said. The formula combines Tom
Clancy-like suspense with touches of romance, high-tech flash and
biblical references.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to make prophecy clear to people,'' Jenkins said, ``is
to put it in fiction, to say, `If this was you, here's what would
happen, here's how a normal person would react if they were left
behind.' I don't think I'm going to be left behind, but you can
just imagine the horror if that happened to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Robison, a day-care worker in Ozark, Mo., said in an
interview: ``The book puts it in focus for you _ this is what is
going to happen. I think the Antichrist is going to come the way it
does in the book. There's going to be world peace, and one-world
religion, and the currency will turn to one currency. And I
honestly think it's going to come in the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The books are being used as a tool for evangelism, drawing in
non-Christians or those who have left the church. Aaron Williamson,
33, who said he had become ``disillusioned with religion'' and left
the church as a teen-ager, was given a copy of ``Left Behind'' by
his supervisor at a warehouse company in Richmond, Va. Williamson
said he had been apprehensive about starting the book but finally
read one page and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It impacted me more than any book I've ever read before,''
Williamson said. ``I do read a lot of science fiction, but this is
the first one that actually seemed like it could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In their collaboration, LaHaye wrote out chronological charts
explaining his interpretation of the sequence of events in the Book
of Revelation, and Jennings used those as a framework for creating
the characters and plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   Revelation is the New Testament's final book, which has been
interpreted through the ages in myriad ways. Some consider it a
historical allegory about the Roman Empire's oppression of Jesus'
followers, while those who read the Bible literally tend to regard
Revelation as prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes in ``Left Behind'' are Rayford Steele, a 747 airline
pilot whose devout Christian wife and young son have disappeared in
the Rapture, and Buck Williams, a cynical journalist for a weekly
magazine whose assignment is to find out the truth behind the
disappearances. After realizing what has happened to his wife and
son, Steele turns to Christ and gradually convinces his skeptical
daughter, Chloe, and Williams to believe the Rapture has occurred,
confess their sins and accept Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them join the ``Tribulation Force,'' a crew of
committed Christians secretly fighting the evil Antichrist. The
Antichrist appears disguised as a charismatic Romanian politician
named Nicolae Carpathia, who takes over the United Nations and
quickly establishes one-world government, one religion and one
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The plot's suspense relies on the assumption that the people
``left behind'' after the Rapture still have a chance to declare
for Christ and save their souls. But this is an interpretation of
the Book of Revelation that, while defended by LaHaye with
citations from Scripture, many Christians and scholars of the New
Testament find highly unorthodox.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Collins, a professor at the University of Chicago
Divinity School and an editor of the ``Encyclopedia of
Apocalypticism'' (Continuum, 1998), said in an interview: ``What
I've not heard of is an interval for repenters after the first
Rapture. That's news to me. It's an interpretation that is far from
standard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP DOBOL, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The U.S. troops patrolling
Bosnia still run into a roadblock or an angry crowd every now and
then. And even now they uncover illegal caches of weapons, as
Company D, 2nd Battalion, 5th Regiment, did last week when it
searched an aging Serb munitions plant in Bratunac.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a .50-caliber _ Russian,'' said 2nd Lt. Jason Lange, a
lanky, tobacco-chewing weapons expert from the 1st Cavalry Division
at Fort Hood, Texas, pointing out one rifle in a menacing row of
them. ``The way it's fitted makes it an anti-aircraft weapon. That
makes it a concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, though, patrols have become routine. Almost three
years after the Dayton peace accords ended Bosnia's war in 1995,
the U.S. and other NATO-led troops here have done what they were
sent to do. They have separated the warring armies, stockpiled
their arms, opened roads and rebuilt bridges, made it safer for the
people of Bosnia to get on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   What they have not yet done is to figure out how to leave.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's mission in Bosnia, originally scheduled to last only a
year, has no end in sight. No one in the Clinton administration
will say so flatly, for fear of angering an already irritated
Congress, but the evidence is clear.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has broken ground on a new headquarters near Sarajevo. The
United States is spending $34 million to buff up its camps,
extending and resurfacing the runway at the air base that is U.S.
headquarters in Tuzla and replacing sprawling tent cities with wood
and tin buildings _ using a Vietnam-era design that can last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has made no final decisions on the future size or shape of
the force in Bosnia, known as the Stabilization Force, or SFOR. But
the Army has already identified the division that is to take over
the mission next fall: the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum,
N.Y. And the unofficial word already circulating among troops here
is that the Texas National Guard and units from Fort Carson, Colo.,
are supposed to replace THEM.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO contemplates air and missile strikes to stop Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's brutal crackdown in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the experience here underscores this fact: If
the United States and NATO are going to intervene in the Balkans,
they should expect to be there for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bosnia's war ended nearly three years ago, many
central promises of the Dayton accords remain unfulfilled.
Sarajevo's streets bustle with reconstruction and night life, but
most of the country is economically listless. The unified
government institutions envisioned at Dayton barely function _ and
only then under the pressure of foreign envoys. Only a few refugees
driven during the war from areas now dominated by ethnic rivals
have been able, or willing, to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration took heart in national elections
three weeks ago that came and went without significant violence and
in which several moderates won office. But the Bosnian Serbs chose
an ardent nationalist, Nikola Poplasen, as their president,
rejecting the candidate with Western backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not want us here,'' said Sgt. Robert Jones, as he
patrolled Zvornik, a Bosnian-Serb city hard on the Drina River,
where posters of the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leader, Radovan
Karadzic, a suspected war criminal, still hang in shop windows.
``You can tell by the look in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet very few here _ from soldiers to Bosnians themselves _
believe the U.S. and NATO troops can leave any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said that the NATO
forces had completed ``99 percent of the military tasks'' given to
them. Yet he warned that there was ``a very high risk of eventual
outbreak of conflict'' if they dared go home.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Defense Secretary William Cohen, who visited Sarajevo
last weekend, Clark said the international organizations that
saturate this country with an alphabet stew of acronyms now had to
do more to carry out what he insisted are solely civilian or police
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO cannot do the civil implementation tasks for these
international civilian authorities,'' he said in an interview.
``And they can't do them without our presence. That's the
dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others at the Pentagon have steadfastly resisted calls by
the international organizations and some Clinton administration
officials to broaden NATO's mandate, using its resources and power
to do more, like chase suspected war criminals or escort refugees
back to their former homes.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, NATO troops have become Bosnia's protectors, at once
removed from the population and the only bulwark against renewed
fighting. More than 60,000 heavily armed NATO troops poured into
Bosnia just after the Dayton accords were signed in December 1995.
Tensions have subsided since, and the force has dropped by half, to
about 33,000, including 7,500 Americans _ a strong presence
throughout Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern sector controlled by the United States, U.S.
troops roam every day in slow-moving convoys of armored Humvees.
The United States still has tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles
here, but they rarely leave base and only then to keep from getting
rusty.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Dobol, along the line of separation between the Serb and
Muslim-Croat areas of Bosnia, as many as two dozen patrols rumble
past the heavily fortified gates every day.
</P>
<P>
   The patrols have become so routine that the camp's commander,
Lt. Col. Robert Brown of the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood,
said the biggest enemy facing the U.S. troops is complacency. ``You
have to stay ready,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even though the war is long over, every soldier leaves the base
armed and dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet and flak
vest, underscoring the Pentagon's overarching concern about
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa and the
U.S. retaliation against those believed to be behind them, soldiers
have had to wear the gear even on base.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Scott Roberts, who led a recent patrol of Humvees from
Company B, 2nd Battalion, 8th Regiment, said his particular
missions usually had one objective: letting the Serbs know that
NATO was around.
</P>
<P>
   Often the patrols amount to little more than a drive around, but
Captain Roberts' company clambered out of their Humvees in Zvornik
and wandered into the city, which was ethnically mixed before the
Serbs drove out Muslims at the start of the war in 1992. Under
leery, if not hostile, gazes, he stopped at an empty lot, all that
remains of Zvornik's mosque.
</P>
<P>
   From Zvornik, the patrol wound through the Lukovina Valley,
passing ghostly villages where every house was reduced to charred
ruins. At Sutanovici, a formerly Muslim town now utterly deserted,
Roberts stopped to question Serbs collecting wood for the coming
winter. His lieutenant, David Nelson, jotted down their
license-plate numbers. The point, Roberts said, was to learn if
they knew of anyone trying to return to the village, something that
could easily inflame tensions. But the exchange underscored the
limits of NATO's military mission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Serbs, Milos Jerkic, said he used to live in a suburb
of Sarajevo, but had to leave after Dayton awarded that territory
to the Muslim-Croat Federation. What he wants most is to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a store there,'' he said. ``Now I am chopping
wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The captain told him that resettlement is not NATO's job. Others
say NATO can and should do more.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. James Morgan, a marine assigned to the civil-affairs unit
at the U.S. headquarters in Tuzla, said the Americans should shed
combat gear _ the troops, he said, are ``all turtled up'' _ and,
like most of the other NATO troops here, have more contact with the
Bosnians themselves, Serb, Croat or Muslim. He said they should act
more like community police officers back home, walking instead of
patrolling from Humvees. ``We've got too many combat soldiers out
here,'' Morgan said as he drove a Humvee to Olovo, where he met
with local officials. ``If we're ever going to implement the Dayton
accords, we need to get SFOR more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever NATO's exact role, few doubt its necessity. An entire
company from Camp Demi, which the troops like to say was named
after the actress Demi Moore, was dispatched the other day to guard
investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague as they
began excavating a mass grave in mountains south of Srebrenica,
where as many as 7,000 Muslim men and boys are believed to have
been massacred in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who did this are still running around,'' said Steve
Gardner, head of the tribunal's forensics team in Bosnia. When his
team finished its work, a convoy escorted them back through
Serb-held territory, a three-hour journey. Another platoon of 30
soldiers set up camp near the grave site, where they will stay
until the work is done.

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURGH, N.Y. _ At a sleepy rural intersection here in the
Hudson Valley, the quintessential ``going fishing'' scene was
unfolding. A creaky old pickup truck drove by, with grandparents
squeezed into the cab around two boys with eager faces who had the
day off from school.
</P>
<P>
   In the back was the fishing tackle. Nearby was a small lake. All
they needed was bait. That was where the Norman Rockwell qualities
of the morning evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spading up soil or looking for a bait shop, the
family pulled in at Maisie's Deli and parked next to a refrigerated
vending machine. Mike Cerone, 76, and his grandsons, Alex and
Austin Hieronymi, 8 and 6, plunked 10 quarters into the slot. Alex
pushed a button marked ``night crawlers.'' Out plopped a Styrofoam
canister full of wriggling worms.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling broadly, the family drove away, rowed out into the lake,
and began snagging bluegills.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing years of the millennium, the ancient art of
angling is going through some changes, none more startling than the
advent of vending machines for live worms, grubs, crayfish,
tadpoles, even minnows.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, doling out bait 24 hours a day, are attractive to
fishermen because bait shops are increasingly hard to find and are
sometimes closed at the odd hours when the fish are biting.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of the machines have popped up in suburbs and rural areas
around New York City in the last two years, and Daniel Bartholomew,
a Hudson Valley farmer turned worm tycoon has quickly become the
country's second-largest operator of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are manufactured by Vending Consultants Inc., in
Des Moines, Iowa, which devised them two years ago after learning
that some bait shops and mom-and-pop stores had been modifying
refrigerated sandwich vending machines for years to serve up cups
of worms. Those jury-rigged machines were not designed to endure
the elements, however, and so Vending Consultants developed one for
outdoor use.
</P>
<P>
   It sold 15 of the new machines in 1996, 700 last year, and now
has 2,000 dispensing bait in almost every state and in parts of
Canada, said James Chico, vice president for sales. The machines
sell for $3,995, delivered. Negotiations are under way with
companies in Italy and Portugal to export them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew started last year with one machine on his front lawn
in Modena, a few miles north of Newburgh. With its glowing picture
of hungry bass and walleyes and its bright-yellow logo, the machine
quickly attracted attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys in a Mercedes in three-piece suits bought bait and
just looked at it,'' he said. ``They just couldn't believe bait was
coming out of a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   When he found he was typically pulling $900 a month in cash from
the machine, he said, he quickly expanded his business and now has
28, including the one at Maisie's Deli. He plans to have 100
machines by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After his latest customers left the parking lot at Maisie's,
Bartholomew, 37, unlocked the machine and restocked slots inside
with more of the white cups containing four types of worms and
grubs.
</P>
<P>
   The worms can stay alive for as long as 10 days on the mix of
peat moss and powdered newsprint in the cups, he said, adding, ``A
lot of the time they're bigger when you get them than when I put
them in.'' The machines have a thermostat that keeps the bait at 40
to 45 degrees in summer and warmer in winter, for ice fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this great?'' he said. ``If you told me two years ago
that I'd be making a great living selling worms from machines, I'd
have told you you were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, machines that he operates or has sold for a commission to
other entrepreneurs sit at marinas, gas stations, bait shops and
other spots from southern New Jersey to the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Often they are placed next to more conventional machines for
soda and snacks, leading to quizzical stares and questions when
Bartholomew comes by with his blue van full of worms and other
bait.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, he may try to set up machines in New
York City for the growing number of urban anglers. But the city was
a bit intimidating, he said, what with persistent rumors that
organized crime still controlled the vending machine business. For
the time being, he said, there was plenty of room to expand _ for
example, in the Adirondacks, where fishing is popular all year.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are proving popular with owners of small
convenience stores, who benefit from the steady stream of anglers
they attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about convenience,'' said Farshid Hessari, the owner
of a gas station in Fishkill with one of Bartholomew's machines
outside. ``People come in and pick up beer, ice, and bait in one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before making the rounds to collect money and replenish bait
supplies, Bartholomew started the day by entering a home-built
cooler, made from the back of an old refrigerated delivery truck,
which jutted from a converted barn behind his brick ranch house in
Modena. He pulled a Styrofoam tray of dirt from a stack and dumped
it onto a bench.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of six-inch night crawlers, imported from Canada,
slithered in the loam. He plunged his hands into the mass of
squirming worms and dirt, picking out a dozen to drop into each
white canister.
</P>
<P>
   When he started, he said, New York state had no worm
wholesalers, and Massachusetts companies were sending trucks from
Canada to bait stores here. Now Bartholomew has got into that end
of the business as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money to be made in worms,'' he said,
explaining that the wholesale cost is around $25 per thousand in
the spring and up to $80 or more per thousand in the summer. They
can live for many months in the cooler, before he transfers them to
the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he said, he had about 20,000 worms on hand, but he
was preparing to build a small climate-controlled warehouse where
he could stockpile up to 10 million. That way, he said, he can buy
low and sell high.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, he said, he would move some of the machines to
spots along the Hudson River that are frequented by anglers seeking
striped bass. Those machines will be stocked with live eels,
bloodworms, and other delicacies favored by ocean-going fish.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next year or two, Vending Consultants is
planning to introduce machines with a freezer inside that can
handle whole fish, which are popular as bait for deep-sea fishing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, he continued on his rounds, dropping off worms
and picking up money. ``The sky's the limit,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: RED SOX' HAUNTING HERITAGE ALWAYS THERE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the Red Sox, the past is always present. If it's
not Babe Ruth's departure, it's Bucky Dent's home run. If it's not
why Jim Willoughby wasn't pitching, it's why Bobby Sprowl was.
</P>
<P>
   After the Red Sox lost, 4-3, to the Cleveland Indians at Fenway
Park on Friday in the third game of their American League division
series, their 44-year-old reliever, Dennis Eckersley, who has
appeared in more major league games than any other pitcher in
history, was talking about Manny Ramirez's leadoff home run in the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crushed that ball,'' Eckersley said.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed the Red Sox, too. When the Red Sox rallied in the ninth
on Nomar Garciaparra's two-run homer, Ramirez's homer, his second
of the game, turned out to be the winning run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the homer that beat us,'' Eckersley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Reggie Jackson's homer,'' somebody said.
</P>
<P>
   That somebody could have been almost anybody in what is known as
the Red Sox nation. In their haunting heritage, Red Sox fans aren't
just fans, they're historians. They'll never forget Bucky Dent's
homer in the 5-4 loss to the Yankees in their 1978 AL East one-game
playoff, but they also remember that Mr. October's homer off Bob
Stanley in the top of the eighth made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley remembered something else. As a 20-game winner as a
Red Sox starter that year, he had gone back to the clubhouse in the
seventh inning on Oct. 2, 1978, when the Red Sox were winning, 2-0.
``I was watching workmen putting up the television platform for our
celebration,'' Eckersley said. ``Celebrating on television was a
big deal then. But as soon as Bucky hit that three-run homer off
Mike Torrez, the workmen started tearing down that platform.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their rivalry, that 1978 playoff has been the only
Yankee-Red Sox post-season game in a history that has been hallowed
for the Yankees, haunted for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the possibility of a Yankee-Red Sox duel in this
year's AL Championship Series was so compelling. If it developed,
there would be at least four chances and maybe as many as seven for
another Bucky Dent moment for the Yankees or, finally, for a moment
that the Red Sox could cherish.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Red Sox confronted by elimination in Saturday's
fourth game with the Indians, the past again intruded on the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, the Red Sox ace with a 19-7 record and the
winner of the series opener, offered to start on three days' rest
instead of his usual four. Considering Martinez's six-year, $75
million contract, Red Sox historians judged that offer to be the
least he could do.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox manager, Jimy Williams, preferred to start the
left-hander Pete Schourek, who was an erratic 8-9 this season _ 1-3
with the Red Sox after being obtained on Aug.6 from Houston, where
he had gone 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for it and I was denied,'' Martinez said. ``I'm not
hurting. I can throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledged the temptation to use Martinez on three
days' rest, but resisted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temptation, yeah,'' the Red Sox manager said. ``Come to my
senses, no. That's my opinion. I'll live with it. Schourek is a
good pitcher. Regardless of what people think, I believe this is
the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, his players supported the manager's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good decision,'' said Mo Vaughn, the Red Sox slugger.
``If we win, we'll have our ace going Sunday in the decisive fifth
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But every Red Sox historian worth a bowl of New England clam
chowder remembered a somewhat similar situation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth game of that series with the Yankees in
mid-September,'' one of those historians recalled. ``After the
Yankees took the first three games, Luis Tiant asked to pitch the
fourth game on three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, then the Red Sox manager and now Joe Torre's bench
coach on the Yankees, preferred to start Bobby Sprowl, up from
Pawtucket of the International League, who had lost his debut five
days earlier in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sprowl walked four of the first six Yankees, Zimmer
yanked him. The Yankees won, 7-4, and were suddenly tied for first
place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, in the seventh game of the World Series,
the Red Sox manager, Darrell Johnson, made another haunting
decision. In a 3-3 tie, Johnson removed his third pitcher, Jim
Willougby, who had blanked the Cincinnati Reds in the eighth
inning, and had Jim Burton open the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds scored one run, and the Red Sox lost, 4-3. Ever since,
Red Sox historians have wondered, ``Why did he take out
Willoughby?''
</P>
<P>
   And when ESPN suddenly showed a flashback of Bucky Dent's homer
during Friday's game, one of those Red Sox historians reacted with
a growl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anybody got a gun?'' the historian asked.
</P>
<P>
   The historian wasn't laughing. He wasn't even smiling. With the
Red Sox, the past is always present.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE THUNDER ROLLS, AND SO DO THE YANKEES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ What if it turned out that the Yankees are
every bit as good as their 114 victories would indicate? Could they
roll through the post-season the way they rolled through the
regular season?
</P>
<P>
   It's a valid question after the way the Yankees eliminated the
Rangers in three straight games, ending early Saturday with a 4-0
blanking. They did not let themselves be distracted by a brutal
storm that took their pitcher, David Cone, out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were they thrown off by Darryl Strawberry's scheduled cancer
surgery. Before the game, they saw a brief video with Strawberry
pointing his finger at the camera and commanding, ``Do it!'' And do
it they did.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees never let the Rangers into the series, with David
Wells, Andy Pettitte and Cone and the bullpen holding the best
hitting team in their league to one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three gems,'' Bernie Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason to think the Yankees could not do it to,
let's say, Cleveland and Atlanta in the next two rounds? Could they
sweep the post-season? ``This is a very well-balanced team,'' said
Brian Cashman, the 31-year-old general manager who is only nine
years out of Catholic University. ``In the long run, the best team
is going to win, but this is the short run now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had feared a three-of-five-game series, because one
rough pitcher or one quick slump could have sent them out of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we got our legs cut out from us in Cleveland,''
Manager Joe Torre recalled. ``We had a 2-1 lead in that series and
played well. We just had to credit Cleveland for beating us. This
is the scariest series. We're very relieved that it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Torre's inspired patience, the Yankees are currently one
of the most cohesive professional teams you will ever see,
particularly in this time of free agents moving from team to team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells you a lot about this ball club,'' said Williams,
who was without a hit in 10 at-bats in this series. ``I'm not
hitting, but somebody like Shane Spencer picks us up. No one person
in particular is responsible for offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer might not have been playing as much if Strawberry had
not been growing weaker late in the season before discovering he
was ill. Spencer clubbed his second homer of the playoffs, a
three-run shot for the 4-0 lead in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would have wrapped it up literally a day earlier but
for the monster of a thunderstorm that held up play for 3 hours 16
minutes. The flags suddenly reversed course, as the system of
storms and tornadoes approached, and the rains came after Cone had
pitched five and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   The delay could have been a blessing for the Rangers, because it
took Cone out of the game when his side-wheeling curveball was
dropping out of the strike zone, when he still had muscle on his
fastball. The four runs were not official until the Rangers made
one more out in the sixth, so the Yankees knew the game would be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   During the long delay, the players changed into dry clothes and
watched a movie, ``Dumb and Dumber,'' appropriately enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty dumb,'' admitted reliever Jeff Nelson, ``but it
got guys laughing together.''
</P>
<P>
   When the storm ended, Graeme Lloyd, Nelson and Mariano Rivera
took turns replacing Cone. Their innings were as placid as his had
been. These guys are all veterans of the 1996 championship, and
they just won the second highest total of games in baseball
history. Now they are on a roll, despite the loss of a popular
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days have been surreal, incredible,'' Cone said.
``An unbelievable emotional day yesterday. Guys came full circle
today, a lot of guys talked to Darryl, we got a video message from
him, and everyone felt pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   They felt even better when the rain ended and then the bullpen
ended the game. There was some question of whether the Yanks would
stage a Champagne and beer celebration in the clubhouse afterward,
given Strawberry's illness and the high expectations coming from
the 114 victories.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plastic covers were up, to protect the clothing in
the lockers from a Champagne and beer spray. Tim Raines proposed a
toast to Strawberry, and in a relieved spirit the players ran
around with bottles in their hands, spraying each other, sloshing
shaving cream on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it in 1996 when we won the division series,'' Cashman
said. ``Right in this clubhouse. We didn't get out of this series
in 1995 and 1997, so we felt this was an accomplishment, so we
celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   They earned their celebration, and some time off to be with
their families and perhaps visit Strawberry in the hospital. Then
it is back to business Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent was not determined as they ran around spraying each
other, but the question is: just who is going to beat these guys? &QL;

DESPITE ECONOMIC WOES, BRAZIL'S LEADER LIKELY TO WIN ANOTHER TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With their vast country struggling
against economic collapse that could usher high inflation back in,
and with a $30 billion rescue package in the balance, Brazilians
are expected to re-elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Sunday, rejecting the three-time candidate of the left, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva.
</P>
<P>
   But the euphoria of four years ago, when Cardoso rode to victory
on a plan for ending inflation and modernizing the role of the
state, has disappeared. The Real Plan, named for the new currency,
the real, has been crippled by the government's failure to rein in
spending. This time Brazilians are bracing for a morning after
marked by austerity, recession, joblessness and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Jolted by the economic breakdowns in Asia and Russia, the
Brazilian stock market has been stumbling through the year like a
battered giant, crashing and resurging time and again, losing 41
percent of its value since January. About $30 billion in foreign
reserves have fled Brazil for safer havens since Russia's market
collapse in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently a prized market for direct foreign investment,
Brazil is now feared as the country most likely to draw the storms
of Asia to U.S. shores. Foreign investors are watching Brazil
closely, in the expectation that a triumphant President Cardoso
will tackle reforms immediately. A $30 billion International
Monetary Fund plan to salvage Brazil's faltering economy also
depends on a Cardoso victory.
</P>
<P>
   Though congressional seats and state houses in this nation of
160 million people are also at stake, attention is focusing almost
entirely on the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last year has brought a new uncertainty,'' said Antonio
Carlos Alkimin, director of population studies at the Brazilian
Institute for Geography and Statistics. ``People are voting more
against inflation and against a leftist government than with a
sense of optimism over what will happen when Fernando Henrique
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the crisis is like a dark cloud hovering offshore. A
Central Bank doubling of interest rates to stanch the outflow of
dollars braked industrial expansion, and unemployment is the
highest in 15 years. But deeper cuts in government services, public
sector layoffs, tax increases and other drastic measures are on
hold until after the president's presumed re-election, as are the
terms Brazil will have to meet for the IMF bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Polls predict that Cardoso, who won a constitutional amendment
allowing presidents to run for re-election, will become the first
Brazilian president to succeed himself. He is expected to take 47
percent of Sunday's vote, a large enough amount to avoid run-off
elections Oct. 25. His nearest rival, da Silva of the Workers
Party, was projected to win 24 percent. Former Finance Minister
Ciro Gomes is expected to take 9 percent of the vote. And an
excitable surgeon known simply as Eneas, who calls for Brazil to
build an atomic bomb, is expected to get 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the election approaches, the images and slogans of candidates
across the political spectrum have been multiplying, their banners
fluttering from trees and lampposts. In the twice-daily free
television time that has become the centerpiece of political
campaigns, the two leading candidates present visions of themselves
and Brazil that could hardly be more at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's television programs feature a determinedly upbeat
country, with a chorus of smiling teen-agers singing the
president's praises and exhorting voters to turn out for him.
Though Cardoso used part of his air time to rebroadcast a speech he
made warning of postelection fiscal adjustments, his message has
been one of stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our efforts, all of our achievements, cannot end when
we're only halfway there,'' the president said in his final
broadcast on Thursday night. ``In the middle of a world crisis, a
country with so many resources and possibilities, a country with so
much international support, which gains more respect abroad each
day, whose people are serious and hard-working, has no reason to
change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The program for da Silva, who is universally known as Lula,
features black-and-white footage of him marching against the
military dictatorship that ended in 1985 and commiserating with the
poor. A former president of the Metalworkers Union, da Silva left
school to begin working at 15, and lost a finger operating a lathe.
</P>
<P>
   This election, da Silva traded the berets and polo shirts of the
past for suits and measured speech, but his ideas remain far to the
left of Cardoso's. He opposes a deal with the IMF and says Brazil's
priority should be Brazilians' social needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never accepted that a country as rich as ours should have
so much inequality, so much misery,'' said da Silva. ``The banks
and the international speculators can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso has also committed gaffes that have fed into the Workers
Party's image of him as a leader removed from the problems of the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   During his administration's so-far-unsuccessful push to
restructure social security benefits, Cardoso said people who
wanted to retire early were ``bums.'' Although the president later
explained that he meant to attack professionals who retire after 20
or 25 years, millions of Brazilian pensioners who had begun their
working lives as children felt themselves maligned.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, word leaked that the 67-year-old President has
himself been collecting a pension, currently at $4,300 a month,
ever since Brazil's military dictatorship forced him to stop
teaching at the University of Sao Paulo in 1969. Although the
president could have returned to teaching 10 years later, he chose
to keep the pension instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Amaral, the president's spokesman, said Cardoso saw no
reason to give up the pension, since he had been ``retired by an
arbitrary act of the military government, and he continued working
for the country as politician and then President.'' He said Cardoso
gave up a second pension he could have collected for having been a
Senator.
</P>
<P>
   And in an August speech at the Parque Royale slum outside Rio,
the president stunned residents when he said: ``There's no way to
make everybody rich. I don't even know if it's worth the trouble,
because the life of a rich person, in general, is very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   He later explained that as a working man he did not count
himself wealthy, but that only made his misstep worse. Cardoso's
$6,000-a-month base salary, along with his pension, puts him in the
top 2 percent of Brazilians, who make more than $2,100 a month,
according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the bums,'' announced Milton Peixoto, 64, a retired
bus driver, adding that there was no way he would vote for Cardoso.
``Last time I voted for him, but this time, he can go to hell. My
life's only gotten worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Real Plan tamed inflation but has done little to redress
Brazil's startling inequalities. According to the Brazilian
Institute of Applied Economic Research, the country's income
distribution is the most unequal in the world, with the richest 10
percent of the population collecting 50 percent of it. Nearly 70
percent of Brazil's voters have less than a primary school
education, and half of them are considered barely literate.
</P>
<P>
   But many Brazilians see Cardoso as the only candidate capable of
taking the country forward. For example Licinio Franco, a
representative for a check protection service here, confessed pride
at the figure that his President cuts overseas. A consummate
charmer, Cardoso speaks languages including French, English and
Spanish, and sometimes greets foreign visitors by offering their
choice of language.
</P>
<P>
   And Franco said he stood a bit taller upon hearing that a German
counterfeit gang was caught making 10- and 50-real bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they don't want to counterfeit the dollar, it's the
real,'' he said. ``Our money is worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosely de Faria Lemos, 50, who runs an advertising agency, said
she considered da Silva ``full of good intentions'' but
ill-prepared to run Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who's kind of from another era and space,'' she
said, ``who has no experience managing anything. He wasn't even
mayor. How can we give him the country to run? In one way or
another, Fernando Henrique can ease this crisis.''

   BOSNIA-NATO-TROOPS (Camp Dobol) _ By and large, American and
other NATO troops have accomplished what they were sent to do under
the Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's civil war in 1995:
they have separated the warring armies, stockpiled their arms,
opened roads and rebuilt bridges, made it safer for the people of
Bosnia to get on with their lives. What they have not yet done is
find a way out.

   SENATE-DEMS (Los Angeles) _ In 1992, in a good year for
Democrats, Barbara Boxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48
percent of the vote. In the six years since, she has been a
reliably outspoken liberal from a state that is less so, and never
managed to boost her job approval ratings above 50 percent. In
1998, in what is shaping up as a hard year for Democrats around the
nation, Ms. Boxer has struggled to hold her own in the polls
against a comparative neophyte, the Republican state treasurer,
Matt Fong, despite a prodigious fundraising advantage and the
powers of incumbency. Now their contest has become one of a handful
of closely watched races that will help determine whether the
Republicans can achieve a filibuster-proof 60 seat majority in the
Senate that could shape the congressional landscape for years to
come. By Todd S. Purdum.

   APOCALYPTIC-RAPTURE (Undated) _ In an instant, millions of
people disappear from the face of the Earth, shedding clothing,
shoes, eyeglasses, jewelry. Were they snatched by aliens? Vaporized
by a spontaneous chemical reaction? No, what has occurred is the
Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned to take the genuine Christians
to heaven. So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' a series of four
books of apocalyptic fiction that have now sold nearly 3 million
copies _ as many as a John Grisham novel and have now ascended to
the top four slots on religion best-sellers lists. The ``Left
Behind'' phenomenon is one indication of the public's fixation on
the approaching millenium and the widespread anticipation that the
year 2000 portends some Earth-shattering event.

   BAIT-VENDING (Newburgh, N.Y.) _ In the closing years of the
millennium, the ancient art of angling is going through some
changes, none more startling than the advent of vending machines
for live worms, grubs, crayfish, tadpoles, even minnows. The
machines, doling out bait 24 hours a day, are attractive to
fishermen because bait shops are increasingly hard to find and are
often closed at the odd hours when the fish are biting.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE JOYS OF SUMMER ARE THANKFULLY A DIVERSION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been so long since the nation has been grateful to its
pastime that some people are already pressing this past season into
the record books as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   They are falling over themselves thanking Mark McGwire for
acting like a boys' book sports hero and Sammy Sosa for acting like
a cowboy hero's sidekick and even George Steinbrenner for acting
civil. There has been a contagion of niceness; until recently, most
of the fans who risked the disabled list to retrieve a home run
ball in the stands asked nothing more in return for their prize
than a few of the millionaires' used shirts and bats.
</P>
<P>
   I'm grateful, too. Just when we needed it most, twisted with
guilt and self-loathing for wallowing in a sad sex opera, along
came baseball opera, outdoors and clean, big boys swinging big bats
in public. There was a show somewhere in the country almost every
single day and night, and there were even two conflicting operatic
cycles to follow.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Three Tenor Cycle in which McGwire, Sosa and Ken
Griffey Jr. set out to prove that three great performers belting
out crowd-pleasing hits were more compelling than the magnificent,
extravagant game itself, much as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo
and Jose Carreras have been marketed to overshadow the repertory.
(Like Carreras, Griffey slipped out of the mainstream
consciousness).
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Championship Ring Cycle. Especially in New
York, which means the main stage, the Yankees were held up as the
culmination of baseball evolution. Without a single overwhelming
diva, they set records for victories and for models of winning
ensemble performance. This wasn't just a couple of glass-shattering
leads pointing up the weakness of the chorus and the script; this
was the game as it was supposed to be played. This was Wagner,
where you go to lose yourself in the music of the spheres, where
the stories are dark and mythic; Darryl Strawberry's diagnosis of
colon cancer was yet another chapter in what has become his modern
hero's journey along a path of promise, misfortune,
self-destruction, redemption and testing. Siegfried!
</P>
<P>
   We were so needy of distraction this season, we were able to
accept both operatic cycles although they seemed to contradict each
other, especially when McGwire could do little for the Cardinals
and Sosa's Cubs just squeaked into the post-season. That there was
room for both cycles proved that of our so-called major league
sports only baseball (coincidentally, opera is making its own
comeback in America) could have captured our minds in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is blowing it again. It's jazz, always wonderful,
always in trouble. In the '70s after the crossover success of Bill
Bradley and the Knicks, it was touted as the next pastime. But it
smoked and snorted its future away. It came back again in the '90s,
but too much depended on the relentless marketing of Michael
Jordan, who is not so interesting anymore.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen all his public moves. His heir, the hip-hop prince
Allen Iverson, may not be quite so easy to sell, especially in
boardrooms. But then, there's nothing to sell right now; preseason
games have been canceled and a regular-season start on the
scheduled Nov. 3 seems unlikely as millionaires work out their
contractual disputes. Since they were merchandised as entertainers,
there is no urgency to sympathize with them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my only concern is that Bradley may have lost his
exquisite timing and ability to move without the ball. His new
book, ``Values of the Game,'' a kind of handbook of virtue based on
what he learned while dribbling in short pants, seemed designed as
a white paper for his presidential run. With this Bill in the White
House we might not need baseball, at least not for moral
sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The football season got under way on time, but because of
baseball only the rabid noticed. Football seems to have settled
into its niche as socially acceptable pornography, big boys without
big bats slamming into each other, and later into their wives and
girlfriends. Rock-and-roll in all its forms, including punk and
rap.
</P>
<P>
   When the secret files of the NFL are released, we will find out
that the scouting combines were always looking for pathology as
high draft indicators. Exposed, the NFL will defend itself by
saying it wanted to keep those crazies on the field and out of
mainstream life.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about hockey, as have, alas, most Americans. Marching
band music. Which leaves boxing with the power to distract us, the
compelling urgency of a single voice in the night, Ella, Bob Dylan,
Sinatra. Joe Louis, Ali, Mike Tyson. We may yet need Mike again,
canny, crazy Mike, the most disturbed, passionate, interesting,
exploited and dangerous voice on the sporting stage. He must be
licensed to fight again. If there are impeachment proceedings, we
can't be sure that baseball will be in season.

ECONOMIC LEADERS DIFFER IN STRATEGY ON CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As financial leaders from the world's major
economies, as well as from many of the most shell-shocked, gathered
Saturday for talks, the Clinton administration faced unusual
challenges from Europe, Japan and emerging-market nations, which
are all arriving with different and even contradictory strategies
for stabilizing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of approaches, which began to play out as Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin sat down Saturday morning with Japan's
finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, reflects both the extraordinary
tension and the behind-the-scenes power struggles under way as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank open their annual
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bank
failures and bankruptcies around the globe, governments are
searching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach that
can halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be easy, officials concede. As the meetings
opened, Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aid
stricken countries throughout Asia. The program includes government
loans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian nations and guarantees
that private bank loans will be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   While Southeast Asian countries immediately hailed the move, the
Clinton administration's response was lukewarm. Rubin had said on
Friday, even before the announcement, that Japan's action was
``constructive,'' but that getting its own banks in order and its
huge economy restarted was ``by vast multiples more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, a former prime minister who has 40 years of experience
dealing with the United States, shot back Saturday that President
Clinton's proposals for new strategies on how the IMF could choke
off crises before they start ``would not be very convincing unless
the United States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Congress' refusal so far to approve $18
billion in new money for the fund, an issue that Senate and House
conferees will be debating as the meetings go on here this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will take the unusual step of participating
directly on Monday in a critical meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers from 22 nations. And on Tuesday he will speak to
the entire IMF, which represents 182 nations, in his second major
speech on the world economy in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday, when he
declared that the world was on a ``financial precipice.'' But
Clinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become far
more publicly involved in managing the world's financial chaos,
insisted that it was not too late to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of us
that enjoy growth will take the initiative and move now,'' he said
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may come
within days as the IMF, the Treasury Department and Brazil's
finance minister, Pedro Malan, put the final touches on a package
of $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin met with Malan at the Treasury late on Friday, and there
was considerable speculation that the package could be announced as
soon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's presidential
election. The vote is expected to result in the re-election of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they fear that a financial
meltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America with it,
and bring the crisis to the United States' own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that it
will be extraordinarily difficult to get nations facing a varied
array of problems _ deep recession and mass unemployment in
Southeast Asia, political paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, huge
bank failures in Japan, an incipient currency crisis in Brazil, but
continued prosperity in Western Europe and the United States _ to
settle on a common agenda.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for example, is insisting that there be no
backing away from a decade-long move toward freer and more open
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about
``capital controls'' that would reimpose government regulation
preventing investors from moving billions in short-term investments
from one country to another with a few taps on the computer
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of the
committee that oversees the IMF, while Russia is threatening to
default on its loans unless it is quickly given billions that the
fund suspended when President Boris Yeltsin fired his team of
economic reformers and violated the terms of his accord for Western
aid.
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official said last month that Russia's threats are
``a form of blackmail, but the enormous turbulence touched off by
the Russian financial debacle in September gives real teeth to
Russia's threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin are hoping to craft their own strategies to
calm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of the
recession from hitting U.S. shores, where exports and corporate
profits are already badly affected.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate of those strategies would allow the IMF to
launch pre-emptive strikes to bolster the finances of fundamentally
healthy economies where the global economic contagion seems likely
to hit next.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aid
only after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing. But by that
time, the country's currency is already under heavy attack, and
putting together a bailout can cost far more and often involves
austerity measures _ from budget cuts to sky-high interest rates _
that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal will first be debated by the Group
of Seven industrial nations and then, if it gathers much support,
by a larger meeting of 22 nations, including most of the major
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Japanese official noted Saturday that the
president's plan ``seems aimed mostly at Latin America'' and
probably would ``not meet a lot of enthusiasm in Europe and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Europeans are debating how to respond to calls
from Washington for a lowering of interest rates, a step Japan and
the United States have already taken _ though with the most modest
of reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, hinted late in the
week before last that London may follow suit. But Germany,
traditionally far more concerned about inflation, has declined to
follow suit. The German government is playing an unusually small
role here as its incoming chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, prepares
to assemble an economic team.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Asian nations _ which only five years ago were the
subject of a much-discussed World Bank study called ``The East
Asian Miracle'' _ arrived here in shock and confusion about what to
do next. The first nation to be hit by trouble, Thailand, is mired
in difficulties, but looks good in comparison with most of the
region's other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia is suffering economic turmoil, and Indonesia's economy
is plunging so deeply into recession that the IMF is backing away
from many of its demands on its government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country,'' said one Indonesian during a
question-and-answer period at the opening session of the meetings
here, ``IMF means I'm Finished.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Gerald R. Ford broke his silence
on the White House scandal Saturday and suggested that the most
fitting punishment for President Clinton would be a rebuke in the
well of the House, where he would stand and listen while
Republicans and Democrats denounced his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be an important boost for Clinton's search
for a way to short-circuit the impeachment process, Ford's
recommendation is striking not only because he breaks ranks with
Republican leaders who have pressed for impeachment hearings, or
called upon the president to resign, but also because of his own
experience with impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who made the recommendation in an Op-Ed article in
Sunday's New York Times, succeeded to the presidency in 1974, after
President Richard M. Nixon resigned during the impeachment
proceedings over Watergate. Ford later damaged his own political
standing by pardoning his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a president receiving not an ovation from the people's
representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members
of both parties,'' Ford wrote. ``I emphasize: this would be a
rebuke, not a rebuttal by the president. On the contrary, by his
appearance the president would accept full responsibility for his
actions, as well as for his subsequent efforts to delay or impede
the investigation of them. No spinning, no semantics, no
evasiveness or blaming others for his plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the special counsel to the president, Saturday
welcomed Ford's comments, and he did not rule out the possibility
of a rebuke. ``Gerald Ford is a man who has been there, who
understands a situation like this and understands the importance of
deferring to constitutional standards under all circumstances,'' he
said in an interview. ``President Ford is absolutely right: this
kind of conduct simply doesn't rise to the level of an impeachable
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford weighed in at a crucial point in the White House scandal.
Now that the House Judiciary Committee on Friday released the final
trove of evidence in its consideration of impeachment charges, the
scandal has shifted to political grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet Monday, and its Republican
majority is widely expected to recommend a formal House impeachment
inquiry. David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel for House
Republicans, plans to appear before the committee to expand the
current list of 11 possible grounds for impeachment of Clinton to
include counts involving making false statements under oath and
trying to conceal a crime, Republican officials said. They said
Schippers would insist that the case is not about sex.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and political aides said they were devoting
the weekend to scouring the 4,600 pages of newly released testimony
and transcripts, seeking evidence to support their case that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was motivated by partisan gain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three senior White House officials in interviews Saturday
offered scathing remarks about Starr's report to Congress. ``If you
look at what's in all the 10,000 pages that are out, the story is
it's the incredible shrinking Starr referral,'' said Joe Lockhart,
the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In his harshest comments about the Starr report, Craig asserted:
``This was not written for the purpose of informing or educating
the decision makers. It was written to trash the president with the
American people and to inflame the jury, which is the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior political aide to the president, said of
Starr, ``He's got more legal manipulation than he does legal
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Congress moves toward a formal impeachment inquiry,
Democratic lawmakers have been moving aggressively behind the
scenes to explore ways to reach a settlement that could save the
president _ and the Congress _ from a protracted impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Rockefeller of West Virginia and John Breaux of
Louisiana, who are both close to Clinton, approached Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut more than a week ago to begin talks on an
appropriate punishment short of impeachment that could be supported
by the Senate, several people familiar with the discussions said.
These people all spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were described as ongoing and informal, and the
senators have discussed several options _ ones not unlike the
suggestion of former President Ford _ including the possibility
that Clinton be rebuked with something stronger than a formal
censure by Congress but not a full impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling that it's got to be beyond censure,'' said a
Senate official who is close to the talks. ``This is not looking
for ways to defend the president. It is looking for ways to make it
clear that what he did was unacceptable but also listening to what
the American people want: to wrap this thing up and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said the point of the discussions was to see
``whether or not there's a center of gravity in the Senate,'' and,
specifically, whether where was ``an operating majority on a strong
censure.'' This person argued that ``while people do not want to
get in the way of the House of Representatives,'' the position of
the Senate was nevertheless critical because ``Gingrich said he
wouldn't move'' on impeachment ``unless there were enough senators
to get 67 votes.'' He referred to House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment process is now in the hands of the House,
a simple majority would be required to move the process to the
Senate, which would ultimately vote on any impeachment
recommendation. The votes of two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 senators
_ would be required to convict and remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the talks said Rockefeller had become one
of Clinton's staunchest internal defenders and that he and Breaux
reached out to Lieberman because he also has been close to the
president and gained credibility as the first Democratic senator
who rose on the Senate floor to chastise Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The three senators have been informally reaching out to other
Democrats as well as Republicans who could be pivotal to any effort
to short-circuit the impeachment process, Senate officials said.
The Republicans include Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, as well as three moderates: Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, Olympia Snowe of Maine and James Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably some Republicans who believe you could
proceed on this basis,'' said a Democrat close to the
conversations. Explaining that many voters particularly in the
Northeast would not want impeachment, he added, ``This could not be
good politics in states like Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and
New York to be part of having the Senate actually receive an
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig sought to tear apart Starr's case, and he argued
vigorously that the documents made public Friday ``destroy the
theory of obstruction of justice.'' Specifically, he said, there
was no evidence that Vernon Jordan, the president's close friend,
tried to keep Monica Lewinsky quiet about her affair with Clinton
by trying to find her a job. ``The statements to the grand jury
completely eliminate the theory that there was an effort to find
her a job to secure her silence,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Starr contended that Craig's initial
comments about the documents released that day were
``disingenuous.'' He found it significant, he said, that the White
House has not challenged the ``credibility or the factual
underpinnings of none of the 11 grounds for impeachment, including
the president's perjury in his deposition and before the grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike said they did not think the
final release of documents would significantly alter the already
hardened political contours of the struggle over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said what he perceived as
partisanship on the part of Republicans had driven more Democrats
to back Clinton. ``If Washington is being divided into two hostile
camps and the one camp appears to be unfair and highly partisan
that only leaves people to identify with President Clinton,'' he
said. ``And to many that is the most comfortable place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who is close to the House Democratic leadership said
of the document release: ``There was a feeling that this next cache
of documents would provide us with the very best way to at least
stall the momentum of the Republican argument. I tend to doubt
that's going to give us much lift for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   While some prominent Republicans, like former Sen. Bob Dole,
Clinton's rival for the presidency in 1996, have privately been
receptive to the notion of a settlement that stops short of
impeachment, no major figure in the party has gone as far as Ford
in calling for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The 38th president, who is 85, said Clinton had ``broken faith
with those who elected him,'' and ``has since been forced to take
refuge in legalistic evasions.'' Ford explained that while he had
no interest ``in rescuing'' Clinton, he feared the long-term
consequences for the nation of trying to remove Clinton from
office. But, he asserted, ``A simple apology is inadequate, and a
fine would trivialize his conduct by treating it as a mere question
of monetary restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said of his recommendation: ``Anyone who confuses this
scenario with a slap on the wrist, or a censure written in
disappearing ink, underestimates the historical impact of such a
pronouncement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ford's recommendation, and the drive in the Senate to
find an end to the scandal, private deliberations in the House over
a deal with Clinton have halted for now, people who have been
involved in the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who had pressed for a solution said it was clear that
Republicans would not be willing to reach any accommodation before
Election Day, and that there was no consensus even among Democrats
as to how the matter should be settled.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the talks said the political environment was
greatly unsettled, and that many lawmakers are bracing for other
potential turns in the case, like indictments from Starr or the
possibility appointment by the Justice Department of an independent
counsel to examine campaign finance accusations against Clinton.

   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago _ Like other former British
colonies in the Caribbean, this is a country that has always
venerated the rule of law. But the government here is now facing
widespread international condemnation following its withdrawal from
both U.N. and Inter-American human-rights conventions because of
its dissatisfaction with restrictions they impose on use of the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to defy foreign critics in order to speed up
hanging condemned criminals has been greeted with broad popular
support in this twin-island nation of 1.3 million people and with
calls to execute those waiting on death row swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   What underlies the move and the nationalist sentiment it has
sparked are frustration with a judicial system still obeisant to
Britain and with international organizations that are seen as
indifferent to local problems.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of crime and capital punishment has roiled the entire
English-speaking Caribbean since 1994. That was when the Privy
Council in London, the final court of appeal for Trinidad and a
dozen other countries in the region, ruled that prisoners who had
been held for more than five years on death row had been subjected
to cruel and unusual punishment and that their sentences should be
commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidadian officials maintain that as a result of the ruling,
lawyers for inmates sentenced to death here have filed appeals with
the principal purpose of keeping their clients alive past the
five-year deadline. Both the United Nations and the Organization of
American States offer appeal mechanisms for capital cases, and
local defense lawyers have used them once all possibilities in
Trinidad have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   With so many avenues of appeal, and a growing prison population,
``we cannot fit within the time frame of five years,'' Trinidad's
attorney general, Ramesh Maharaj, said in an interview. ``We have
pleaded with these international bodies to set up structures that
hear these cases promptly and allow us to comply with our national
law,'' he said, ``but there are too many delays that are
obstructing the government from implementing the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's inability to hang prisoners convicted by juries
on murder charges in trials in which fairness is not at issue ``is
undermining the public's confidence in the criminal justice
system,'' Maharaj continued. ``And when society becomes unsure that
justice can punish people who commit crimes, then democracy is
threatened and society is put at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the same concerns about crime and punishment, other
Caribbean nations have taken or are contemplating similar actions.
Earlier this year, Jamaica also withdrew from the U.N. accord,
while Guyana said in August that it might soon follow suit;
Barbados, on the other hand, has been studying the possibility of
removing Queen Elizabeth as head of state and becoming a republic
in order not to have to submit to the Privy Council ruling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 prisoners are currently on death row across the
English-speaking Caribbean, according to figures provided by
governments and human-rights groups. Trinidad tops the list, with
107 prisoners convicted of capital crimes and awaiting execution,
followed by Jamaica, with 47, and the Bahamas, with an estimated
40.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the twin-island federation of St. Kitts and Nevis,
whose population of 46,000 makes it the smallest country in the
Western Hemisphere, executed its first prisoner since becoming
independent in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica has ordered its first execution in a decade, that of a
29-year-old hitchhiker convicted of strangling a business executive
who gave him a ride. Though his hanging was postponed in order that
one last appeal of the death writ be heard, the government remains
committed to the principle of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who
ought to hang, ought to hang,'' said the minister of public
security, Keith Knight, whose office faces a murder rate three
times that of New York City. ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``the law will
become a laughingstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's stance is the most assertive, however, and has been
especially criticized by human-rights groups. ``History shows that
governments which try to isolate their citizens by removing
themselves from international scrutiny usually do so because they
have something to hide,'' the British-based human-rights group
Caribbean Lifelines said, while Amnesty International urged the
government of Prime Minister Basdeo Panday to ``reconsider the
retrograde step it has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's decision ``restricts the rights of all victims of
human-rights abuse to access the protections offered by the
Inter-American human-rights system,'' Jose Miguel Vivanco,
executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch,
complained to Panday in a letter in June. ``With this dramatic
step, your government has rescinded all of the convention's broad
civil and political rights protections.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Maharaj rejected that argument, saying that
neither due process nor civil rights have been affected by the
government's withdrawal from the Organization of American States
human-rights convention, which will formally take effect next year.
He said Trinidad intends to reaccede to the U.N. convention ``with
reservations on capital punishment'' and suggested that Trinidad's
critics should direct their energies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is not a human-rights issue,'' he said. ``It
has been made an issue by certain institutions and European
countries that believe the death penalty should not be carried out
under any circumstances and have made opposition to it a part of
their legal culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same groups and countries have made similar
complaints about the United States. But the United States has
ratified neither the Inter-American convention nor the United
Nations' ``optional protocol'' on capital punishment, so American
prisoners cannot appeal death sentences to the international
bodies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The Trinidadian government's position appears to have won the
support not only of the populace, which is alarmed at a rising
crime rate and has long been demanding tougher policies, but also
of opposition parties. ``We say hang them high!'' said the former
Prime Minister Patrick Manning, now leader of the opposition, in
Parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread publicity given to apparently frivolous allegations
of cruel and unusual punishment on which several court appeals are
based has also galvanized public opinion. One prisoner cited a lack
of shampoo as grounds for commutation, Maharaj said, while others
have cited noisy fans or bright lights outside their cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you kill and are found guilty, you should be hung,''
Victoria Joseph, a housekeeper and mother of two children who says
she worries about the crime rate, asserted in an interview here.
``We keep them in jail too long now as it is,'' she said, ``and now
they have come to believe they are not getting enough. No, if they
are going to hang, then let's do it quick time without all this
foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   But some legal experts have suggested that there are ways of
addressing the issue short of withdrawing from the international
protocols. Since the death penalty is mandatory in murder cases
here, one solution, they say, might be to grant more discretion to
judges, prosecutors and juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criminal law in many cases is underdeveloped, based on
statutes in English law that England itself has revised,'' said
Anselm Francis, a lecturer in international law at the Institute of
International Relations at the University of the West Indies campus
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the concept of first- and second-degree murder and
plea bargaining, as in the United States,'' Francis said, ``then
some people might be prepared to say all right'' to something short
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It appears far more likely, however, that Trinidad and its
neighbors will simply move to junk the Privy Council altogether.
Here, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, there is a groundswell of
public impatience with an institution that is seen as antiquated,
the last unnecessary remnant of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law lords don't have a clue to the reality of the
situation here,'' Lyndon Nebat, a deliveryman for a local
supermarket chain, said of the judges in London who have the power
to rule on capital cases. ``They just don't understand our needs,''
he said, ``and so they should simply refrain from judging our cases
and let us do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At a summit meeting this summer of the Caribbean Community, a
political and economic body to which all English-speaking Caribbean
states belong, leaders agreed to replace the Privy Council as the
region's final court of appeal with a new Caribbean Court of
Justice. The new body is to have its headquarters here, and Maharaj
said he expects it to begin operating ``within the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Inter-American court began a hearing on
capital cases from Trinidad on Aug. 28. The government here refused
to participate, citing infringement of its sovereignty, and
reiterated that it plans to follow its own course and ignore the
tribunal's order not to proceed with any executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``International law recognizes and authorizes the death
penalty,'' Maharaj said. ``It is wrong for any country or group of
countries to transplant their legal culture into the Caribbean. We
respect their laws of punishment, and they must respect ours.''

   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishop
of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the communist
system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by paying
such homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned by
the Tito regime as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped into
one of the most divisive Serbo-Croatian disputes in all the
embattled regions of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman Catholic
Croats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. To
Orthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries but
have largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, the
beatification is a political provocation. They have long viewed
Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regime
that killed tens, even hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and
Gypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today's
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,
who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewing
history through a different prism than the peoples he says he wants
to reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-born
John Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviet
totalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted by
the Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But in post-communist Croatia, it has been a long time since
religion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. As
one of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats and
Muslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredient
of the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded on a steep,
damp hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, people expressed
pride in the beatification and defiance of its critics. ``It is
good to have a saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,''
said Kruno Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who arrived in Marija
Bistrica at 2 a.m. to secure a glimpse of the pope. He shrugged off
the complaints of minorities: ``We don't care about their saints.
Why should they care about ours?''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia but has made several
trips to other regions of the former Yugoslavia, always preaching
peace and unity in an area brutally torn by ethnic and religious
differences. In 1994 he made his first visit to Croatia, which is
more than 75 percent Catholic and which lost a third of its
territory to the Serbs after it broke away from Yugoslavia in a
1991 war. Earlier this year, the United Nations returned control of
Eastern Slavonia _ the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia _ to the
Tudjman government. But tensions there remain high.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as the
Catholic Church's complicity in the systematic murder, eviction or
forced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under the
authoritarian leadership of Tudjman, moreover, many Croats are
recasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe as patriots and founding fathers of
the modern Croatian state.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heart
of this revisionism. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Ante
Pavelic led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly
independent Croatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent
anti-communist, initially embraced the Pavelic government as
``God's hand at work.''
</P>
<P>
   But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews and
other minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 he
began denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,
in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested by
Tito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,
imprisoned and released under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XII
later made him cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundreds
of Jewish and Serbian lives, but his critics maintain that by not
speaking out more, he condoned and effectively supported the
Ustashe regime. To Serbs he has long been a symbol of the many
Catholic priests who cooperated with the Ustashe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Paul II, who has canonized more than 270 people and
beatified close to 800, has made more saints than any other pope in
history. The cause of Stepinac is one of the most controversial to
date.
</P>
<P>
   A week before he left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris
asked the Vatican to delay beatification of Stepinac until
historians could give the case further study. The intervention
infuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,
the Jewish community expressed resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''
said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jewish community in Croatia,
which numbers about 2,000. He described the cardinal's record as
mixed. ``He tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he
never condemned the regime as such,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely to
the cardinal's resistance to communism _ was unlikely to prompt
Croats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will not
clarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatian
society has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt with
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope seemed indirectly to address some of the questions that
the beatification has raised. ``Blessed Alojzije Stepinac did not
shed his blood in the strict sense of the word,'' he said, alluding
to the fact that martyrs are usually slain by their persecutors.
``His death was caused by the long suffering he endured.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made a veiled reference to the speed with which the
Croatian church leader had been beatified, a process that in many
cases can take centuries. ``Very little time separates us from the
life and death of Cardinal Stepinac,'' John Paul said, ``barely 38
years. We all know the context of this death: a continual
succession of trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The beatification may also owe its speed to the pope's fear that
a successor may be less sensitive to the East European Church's
struggle against communism, to which he has devoted much of his
life.

SPORTS COLUMN: A PERFORMER WHO WAS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ He was the classic small-town prodigy, with
the creativity of a big-city profiteer. When there was no shot to
take, he invented a new one. When there was no one to pass to, he
reconfigured the play until a teammate was open.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden,
was a luminous exception to the governing rule. That is why, six
years after his retirement from the National Basketball
Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent,
beginning with his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird
watchers at the Civic Center here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Deservedly enshrined as forever exceptional, he again becomes
Bird, the exception, the case study for a contentious and
potentially disastrous labor war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' Bird said, when I asked whether he is
troubled by the likelihood of his legendary name soon representing
a symbol of greed to unsympathetic millions. ``There's always a
player's name attached to these things. I know at the time I was
very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been 1988, when the Celtics wanted to compensate
Bird with a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on
as their savior. Three years later, in a contract arbitration
involving the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would
contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the
salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is
convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's just say it
is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating with one of
its own. The process of unsealing the cap to re-sign a particular
player eventually became known as making use of the Larry Bird
exception. And that is where we stand, as this onetime exception
has become the very expensive rule the owners don't want to play by
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand both sides,'' said Bird, safely in the
middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present
Indiana Pacers' coach. ``Without getting into the exception, I
think it's very important for players to stay in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Important, he meant, for franchise stability and fan
identification. ``You have a son who is 7 years old, he goes from 7
to 17 in the 10 years you've played,'' Bird said. ``A lot of people
in Boston told me that they had followed me, from the time they
were very young to when they were in college.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships, but he
was the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He
and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began
during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread
worldwide, like an infectious smile. They stood for the pass, for
team play, but now their decade of selflessness has given way to
one of selfishness. The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater
heights than anyone imagined it could, but it is a league that now
suffers from a sickness of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not
survive what we're about to go through,'' said Bill Fitch, Bird's
first Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stood with him on the
night that, he said, gave closure to his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, as always, are exaggerating their misery, but this
time, it is much easier to not root for the players. The president
of the union is Ewing, who one day commands players to boycott the
world championships because the NBA's corporate fingerprints are on
them, then the next day helps himself to some television commentary
work for David Stern's women's annex. Ewing leads the fight to
protect the $100 million contracts for 21-year-olds who have
achieved not a single playoff victory, linked to the big payoffs
for agents like his friend Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is waged in the name of a salary cap that makes
exceptions of the unexceptional, rewards everyone as if they were
Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in any field there has to be an allowance for
the truly special ones,'' Walton said. ``But that group is very
small. When I was growing up in this sport, the only players who
got the recognition were the champions, the ones who always made
you feel good about the game, about sports. That's how Larry and
Magic played, always dreaming of the special team. It wasn't about
hype, about money.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite the case, nor should it have been. Bird was a
businessman's ball player from the day he arrived, with his flannel
shirts and blue-collar ethic. He hired the late Bob Woolf, one of
the original heavy-hitting agents, and got himself a record rookie
contract. Then he went out and turned a 29-victory catastrophe into
a 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, an honest exception to the
rule.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an instant, millions of people disappear from the face of the
earth, shedding their clothing, shoes, eyeglasses and jewelry.
While terrified relatives grieve, the speculation begins. Were they
snatched by aliens? Vaporized by a spontaneous chemical reaction?
Kidnapped by terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   No, what has occurred is the Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned
to take the genuine Christians to heaven, fulfilling the biblical
prophecy in the Book of Revelation. The rest of humankind is left
behind to suffer seven years of social chaos, wars, a killer
earthquake and the wrath of the Antichrist, who achieves global
omnipotence as secretary general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' a series of four books of
apocalyptic fiction that have sold nearly 3 million copies, about
as many as the typical John Grisham novel. The series made
publishing history in September when all four of the books ascended
to the top four slots on Publishers Weekly magazine's lists of
religion best sellers in hardcover and paperback.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' phenomenon, scholars say, is one indication
of the public's fixation on the approaching millennium and the
widespread anticipation that the year 2000 portends some
earth-shattering event. While the ``Left Behind'' series,
co-written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, relies on a
controversial interpretation of the Bible embraced by many
evangelical and fundamentalist Christians, publishing analysts say
that the books have crossed over into a broader audience,
attracting even secular readers with prose that reads like a
paperback thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cashing in on the public preoccupation with the year
2000,'' said Paul Boyer, a professor of history at the University
of Wisconsin and author of ``When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy
Belief in Modern American Culture'' (Harvard University Press,
1992). ``The message is that you can't do anything about what's
happening in the world. The larger pattern of prophecy is
unfolding, but you can save yourself, so accept Christ today, and
you will be among those who are Raptured. You will be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are among a proliferation of books on
the final days that are best sellers at Christian bookstores. Among
them are ``Prosperity and the Coming Apocalypse'' by Jim Bakker,
the television evangelist once tainted by scandal, with Ken
Abraham, and ``Final Dawn Over Jerusalem'' by John Hagee, a
religious broadcaster. Both books were published this year by
Thomas Nelson Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Left Behind'' series has managed to cross over from
Christian to secular audience by selling well in commercial outlets
like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, said Phyllis Tickle, contributing
editor in religion at Publishers Weekly. ``This says that indeed
they have pervaded our culture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent book in the series, all published by Tyndale
House Publishers, is ``Soul Harvest.'' It was released in June and
occupies the top spot on the religion hardcover list, while the top
three religion paperback spots are occupied by the series' first
three books: ``Left Behind'' (1995), ``Tribulation Force'' (1996)
and ``Nicolae'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Readers are writing the publisher's Web site, which receives
about 80,000 electronic visits every day, to say that the books
have prompted them, their friends or family members to become
born-again Christians. The books have also generated a companion
children's series, a music CD and hats and T-shirts emblazoned with
the slogan ``Don't Be Left Behind.'' The authors plan to write at
least four more books for the adult series and a movie is in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye is an evangelical Christian minister, a conservative
political commentator and the author of 35 books on family life,
creationism and biblical prophecy. Jenkins is a former journalist
who has written more than 100 books, including marriage and family
advice, biographies of sports figures, and who writes a syndicated
comic strip, ``Gil Thorp.''
</P>
<P>
   Both authors say they believe that the Rapture could take place
at any moment because, they say, every major prophecy that the
Bible says will precede the Rapture has already been fulfilled.
Even though the books make no explicit reference to the year 2000,
they are set in the present or the very near future and make
reference to popular fears of social, economic and political
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye even interprets the year 2000 computer problem, in which
computers that use two digits to indicate the year may interpret
2000 as 1900, as a sign of the coming apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It very well could trigger a financial meltdown,'' LaHaye told
readers on the Web site, ``leading to an international depression,
which would make it possible for the Antichrist or his emissaries
to establish a one-world currency or a one-world economic system,
which will dominate the world commercially until it is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are intended to appeal not only to
committed Christians, but also to half-hearted churchgoers and
skeptical seculars, Jenkins said. The formula combines Tom
Clancy-like suspense with touches of romance, high-tech flash and
biblical references.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to make prophecy clear to people,'' Jenkins said, ``is
to put it in fiction, to say, `If this was you, here's what would
happen, here's how a normal person would react if they were left
behind.' I don't think I'm going to be left behind, but you can
just imagine the horror if that happened to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Robison, a day-care worker in Ozark, Mo., said in an
interview: ``The book puts it in focus for you _ this is what is
going to happen. I think the Antichrist is going to come the way it
does in the book. There's going to be world peace, and one-world
religion, and the currency will turn to one currency. And I
honestly think it's going to come in the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The books are being used as a tool for evangelism, drawing in
non-Christians or those who have left the church. Aaron Williamson,
33, who said he had become ``disillusioned with religion'' and left
the church as a teen-ager, was given a copy of ``Left Behind'' by
his supervisor at a warehouse company in Richmond, Va. Williamson
said he had been apprehensive about starting the book but finally
read one page and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It impacted me more than any book I've ever read before,''
Williamson said. ``I do read a lot of science fiction, but this is
the first one that actually seemed like it could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In their collaboration, LaHaye wrote out chronological charts
explaining his interpretation of the sequence of events in the Book
of Revelation, and Jennings used those as a framework for creating
the characters and plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   Revelation is the New Testament's final book, which has been
interpreted through the ages in myriad ways. Some consider it a
historical allegory about the Roman Empire's oppression of Jesus'
followers, while those who read the Bible literally tend to regard
Revelation as prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes in ``Left Behind'' are Rayford Steele, a 747 airline
pilot whose devout Christian wife and young son have disappeared in
the Rapture, and Buck Williams, a cynical journalist for a weekly
magazine whose assignment is to find out the truth behind the
disappearances. After realizing what has happened to his wife and
son, Steele turns to Christ and gradually convinces his skeptical
daughter, Chloe, and Williams to believe the Rapture has occurred,
confess their sins and accept Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them join the ``Tribulation Force,'' a crew of
committed Christians secretly fighting the evil Antichrist. The
Antichrist appears disguised as a charismatic Romanian politician
named Nicolae Carpathia, who takes over the United Nations and
quickly establishes one-world government, one religion and one
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The plot's suspense relies on the assumption that the people
``left behind'' after the Rapture still have a chance to declare
for Christ and save their souls. But this is an interpretation of
the Book of Revelation that, while defended by LaHaye with
citations from Scripture, many Christians and scholars of the New
Testament find highly unorthodox.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Collins, a professor at the University of Chicago
Divinity School and an editor of the ``Encyclopedia of
Apocalypticism'' (Continuum, 1998), said in an interview: ``What
I've not heard of is an interval for repenters after the first
Rapture. That's news to me. It's an interpretation that is far from
standard.''

WEST CELEBRATES MINING'S PAST, BUT NOT ITS FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. _ A massive, illuminated ``M'' burns nightly on a
hillside here, a reminder that this town was founded by gold miners
and is home to the Colorado School of Mines. For tourists, Golden
celebrates its mining heritage with a geology museum and welcoming
banners featuring a broad-hatted miner panning for gold.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, Jeff Keller, president of a Golden paving
company, committed the ultimate faux pas in the faux West. He asked
to open a mine.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that an 8,789-foot mountain would block virtually all
views of the isolated rock quarry, or that there would be no need
for trucks because the Union Pacific railroad already sends 20
freight trains a day through his property. In the kind of battle
waged routinely in the West today, neighbors from a subdivision two
miles away are mobilizing to oppose the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Keller ignored an emerging truism of the new West: the only good
miner is a dead miner, preferably a quaint one of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Colorado Rockies, mining tourism is a booming
business, fueled by 12 mining museums, 13 tourist mines and about
400 mining-related sites on the state's Register of Historic
Properties. Resort towns feature restaurants with folksy mining
themes: The Gold Pan in Breckenridge, the Ore House in Steamboat
Springs and the Motherlode in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   But visitors should not confuse Western sentimentality over
mining history with a love for modern mining.
</P>
<P>
   In Aspen, historically a mining town, Stefan Albouy, the last
man who tried to mine silver, encountered continual local
opposition until one day four years ago he climbed up to his mining
property and killed himself with a shot to the head.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, protests and a lawsuit erupted this summer when the
Mormon Church asked Salt Lake County officials for permission to
cut rock slabs from the same church-owned quarry that supplied
granite a century ago for the Salt Lake Temple. The granite is for
an enormous church assembly hall across the street from the temple.
A U.S. District Court judge recently upheld the church's right to
take rock from its quarry.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Montanans are to vote on a referendum to ban in
future gold and silver mines the use of cyanide, which is commonly
used in refining the metals.
</P>
<P>
   Battle after battle, the war on mining is taking its toll in the
West, the nation's largest source of metals.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of mine permit applications that drag on for years without
resolution, American mining companies spend 76 percent of their
exploration budgets overseas, up from 40 percent in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 years, the number of American metal miners fell in half,
hitting 51,000 in 1995. With more and more jobs going offshore,
enrollments at the nation's mining schools have plummeted, to 1,040
today, from 3,070 two decades ago. At the mining school here,
Theodore Bickart, the new president, announced last month a goal of
overseas study for all mining students.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the United States became a net importer of
nonfuel minerals for the first time in modern memory. In the 1990s
imports have jumped by one third, to $53 billion in 1996, from $40
billion in 1990. The United States is the most mineral-dependent
society in the world, with each inhabitant consuming 20 tons of new
metals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The impact is clearly seen in Montana, which has as its state
motto ``oro y plata,'' Spanish for ``gold and silver,'' and which
in 1995 produced $2.2 billion in minerals. But mining exploration
investment has dropped to less than $300,000 a year today, from $17
million a year in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the mines that have closed, but I can't
remember any that have opened,'' said Jill Andrews, executive
director of the Montana Mining Association. Noting that Montana
mining salaries average $43,000 a year, double the state industrial
average, she added, ``Everybody I know is going to a third world
country, to Russia, Chile, South Africa, mostly places where they
don't get to take their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mining companies say the major obstacle is a state and federal
regulatory process that can easily drag on for a decade. David
Rovig, a Billings-based miner who is looking for gold in Colombia,
said, ``Exploration used to be the riskiest part of the business _
now it is a distant second to permitting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These obstructionist groups want to shut down each and every
mine,'' Rovig said, referring to environmental groups in Montana.
Speaking on a day when he was negotiating the release of a Canadian
employee taken hostage by Colombian guerrillas, he added: ``At
least down there, you can negotiate with the terrorists. Here you
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, said,
``We have got a culture where kids are brought up to think that
only worms move dirt.'' This Denver-based study group reports that
per-capita income growth in much of the West had not kept pace with
the rest of the nation. Burgess added: ``We have replaced a lot of
high paying jobs, many in mining, with low paying jobs in the
tourism industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists counter their critics by saying that
mechanization is the primary cause for the drop in employment and
by noting that American nonfuel mineral production has actually
increased during the 1990s, rising by 13 percent through 1996. In
the West, they say, a legacy of polluting, abandoned mines has
turned public opinion against new mines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry will say that this is yesterday's problem, but
for many communities in the West, it is today's problem,'' said
Stephen D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a
Washington-based environmental group. He cited cases of mines
abandoned this year because of low gold prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some Westerners argue that the modern value of the Rockies is in
their surface scenery, not in their subterranean mineral wealth.
Cities like Boise and Denver attract highly skilled workers and
executives who are looking for scenery, not smelters. Thomas Power,
a Montana economist, wrote recently, ``The open pit mine or
clear-cut mountain top that once provided economic security for a
community now threatens the influx of future jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Rockies have become the most highly urbanized part of the
nation, much of the countryside has become a gentrified playground
for city dwellers and suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado has a love-hate relationship with mining,'' said
Loretta Pineda, a state employee who recently held a seminar on
mining tourism. ``Everybody is in love with the historical aspect
of mining. But to get a new mining operation going, we run into a
lot of opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came from Keller, who recently inspected his potential
quarry site. After an empty freight train rumbled past, he said:
``The resource is there. The reason settlers came to Golden in the
first place was for mining.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the opposite side of Scar Top Mountain from the proposed
quarry, historical arguments did not move David Waddington, whose
family roots in Colorado go back 140 years. Speaking from the
Crescent Park subdivision, this retired solar engineer worried
about dust, noise, fractured wells and disruption of bear and
cougar habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major rock climbing area below _ a blast could go
off, a rock could hit a climber on the head,'' Waddington said.
``The sounds of the machinery running are going to be distressing
to people who are there for recreation.''  &QL;

COMMENTARY: A WAR ON WOMEN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Leno does not see himself as a political or human rights
activist. And his wife, Mavis, generally has, as she describes it,
``less than no interest'' in drawing public attention to herself.
</P>
<P>
   But they both feel strongly that the world is not paying enough
attention to the catastrophe that has fallen upon the women of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation last week, Leno said, ``I remember
being in the sixth or seventh grade and we were reading about World
War II. And I remember kids asking, `So when they were rounding up
the Jewish people and killing them, why didn't people do
something?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I remember thinking, `I guess people were just different
then. It was a different time. That couldn't happen now.'''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Afghanistan now is nothing short of a war
on women and girls. Most of the country is under the control of the
Taliban, an extremist Islamic movement that has thrown a blanket of
absolute oppression over the lives of all females.
</P>
<P>
   Women are not allowed to work outside the home. Girls are not
allowed to go to school. No female is permitted to leave her home
unless she is accompanied by a close male relative _ a husband,
father, brother or son. Homes and other buildings in which women or
girls might be present must have their windows painted so no female
can be seen from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Women who leave their homes must be completely covered by a
burqa, an all-encompassing garment with a small mesh opening
through which the wearer can see and breathe. Women are not allowed
to wear shoes that make any noise when they walk. Their footsteps
must not be heard. They must come and go in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Violations of any of the Taliban's edicts are treated summarily
and brutally. It is like a reprise of some dark, medieval period.
Women who ventured from their homes unaccompanied or improperly
clad have been whipped, beaten and at times killed. A woman was
dragged from a vehicle and viciously beaten because her arm
accidentally slipped into view. Another woman was stoned to death
when she attempted to leave the country with a man who was not a
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Very few medical facilities are available to women, and women
are so frightened of being flogged or beaten in the streets they
often are reluctant to seek the little help that is available. Even
the most serious illnesses are going untreated.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition against work has had a profound effect. Women
and girls who do not have male relatives to support them have been
left destitute. Not surprisingly, human rights groups are finding
extraordinary levels of anxiety and depression in the women they
see.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority, an
organization that is committed to easing the plight of the women in
Afghanistan. She will help lead the group's effort to bring the
story more fully to public view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person I've spoken to about this is outraged,'' she
said. ``And so many have had the same reaction: `Why don't I know
about this? How can this be going on and I haven't heard about it?'
And that's what I want to remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lenos are contributing $100,000 to assist the Feminist
Majority in its efforts to assist the victims of the Taliban. The
idea is to focus a brighter spotlight on the tragedy. A press
conference will be held next week to formally announce the campaign
to bring more and more information about this overwhelming
injustice to the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leno, in an interview, mentioned that her father had once
been buried for a time in a mining accident. ``He was dug out and
he was fine,'' she said. ``But he told me that while he was buried
the hardest thing was that he had no way of being sure that anybody
was looking for him. They could think that maybe he hadn't gone to
work that day, or that he was someplace else, not buried. Or maybe
they would think, yes, he was buried, but he was dead. Maybe they
wouldn't look for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what came to my mind when I heard about the situation
with the women in Afghanistan. They don't even know if anybody
knows what has happened to them. They don't even know if people are
trying to save them. And that seemed so terrible to me that I felt
I had to be one of the people that was looking for them.''

COMMENTARY: TRUTH AND KETCHUP  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some have questioned the wisdom of Kenneth Starr's
hanging the fate of the Republic on the neurotic girl talk of two
dingbats.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive, 4,600-page, three-tome ``Communication''
released on Friday by the prosecutor will be an eye-opener for his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky have been depicted as epic
quisling and epic minx. But this Niagara of secretly taped small
talk from the government Printing Office reveals them to be so much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past her Valley Girlisms _ ``da, da, da,'' ``blah,
blah, blah,'' ``ugh,'' ``yech,'' ``like, Hel-lo?'' and ``the me
issue'' _ young Monica turns out to be something of a philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon City Ritz-Carlton, over a hamburger, crispy
french fries and coffee with artificial sweetener _ ``I need both
the pink and the blue,'' she informs the waitress _ the 24-year-old
expounds on the meaning of truth. Like her former boyfriend, Monica
is a relativist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``The truth shall set you free. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``But think about the truth _ OK? Think about
truth. Truth is synonymous with good. Truth is supposed to be good
... OK? ... This is how I have looked at it, and this is from my
Christian Scientist, from talking to this woman, and I have talked
to her and I've said, `Well, what about' _ you know, I said, `If
truth is synonymous with good, then truth is good and good is God,
OK? If all those things are synonymous, then the right thing to do
is not hurt someone.' That's true ... So the truth, well, what is
truth? I mean, I'm not trying to have an existential conversation
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few ``Hmpfs,'' Ms. Tripp muses: ``I think everybody has
a moral code of some sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``We do. But to everybody it's different. Do you
see what I mean? OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp catches on: ``But what I understand you saying is ...
that if an issue of any sort arises that if the ultimate good is _
and _ and the truth _ the truth should match the ultimate good and
be both.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Mm-hmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``I see what you're saying. I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``You know?''
</P>
<P>
   Monica later takes another Pilate-like crack at the meaning of
truth, telling Linda that ``The truth is _ the truth is _ what it
should be,'' and explaining: ``God is synonymous with good, truth
and kindness and happiness and all sorts of good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``This is too big to worry about goodness and
kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women have a sophisticated grasp of history.
</P>
<P>
   Monica explains that her mother wants her to lie about the
Presidential affair because she is fearful for her daughter's
safety: ``She keeps saying `Mary Jo Chappaquiddick' or whatever her
name was.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda also reflects on the historical dimension of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``The president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``Which is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``Huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Mm-hmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``Don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``Yeah, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda later says of Vernon Jordan: ``He's like the biggest ...
He is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair are wise in the Byzantine ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``There are three kinds of people in this
administration: peons, peons who know stuff, and FOB's. OK. Maybe
not peons who know stuff. In between. Do you know what I mean? Do
you know what I'm saying now?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp takes up the question of status and fate: ``It's
interesting to me as a low-level peon ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``If you're a low-level peon, what am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``You're a player in this. I'm a low-level peon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky: ``If I'm a player, you're a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp: ``No, I'm no player.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica is patriotic. ``To me,'' she ruminates about her Oval
Office trysts, ``a little bit of _ it's for the country. Every
president we ever had has always had lovers because the pressure of
the job is too much. Too much ... Too much, to always rely on your
wife, with whom you have too much baggage _ which you inevitably
will if you got to that point ... Would you agree with me on that?
... Can we get some ketchup and mustard?''

EUROPE DOMINATES SURVEY'S TOP 10 LEAST-CORRUPT-COUNTRIES LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Transparency International, a small independent
organization that has been tracking for four years how the public
and international businesses view corruption worldwide, has
published its largest survey to date, looking at 85 countries and
ranking only one completely clean: Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Corruption Perception Index, like its predecessors, is
a ``survey of surveys,'' using a combination of studies by risk
analysts, opinion polls and research institutions to rank countries
by how they are perceived. ``No surveying approach is perfect,''
Frank Vogl, vice president of Transparency International and a
former World Bank official, said of the report released in late
September. ``At best we get a good set of impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   The impressions this year are that all but 3 of the top 10
countries in the least-corrupt category are European _ Denmark,
followed by Finland, Sweden, New Zealand, Iceland, Canada,
Singapore, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, from the bottom up, are Cameroon,
Paraguay, Honduras, Tanzania, Nigeria, Indonesia, Colombia,
Venezuela, Ecuador, Russia and Vietnam and Kenya in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   The United States falls behind most European countries and Hong
Kong, tying with Austria at 17th place.
</P>
<P>
   The annual index has provoked criticisms from countries that
rank low on the trust scale, among them Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cameroon government condemns strongly the arrogance of
certain bodies that are in the pay of neo-colonial clusters of
people at work to impede the progress of our countries instead of
supporting efforts and sacrifices made by our people,'' the
government said in an official radio announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Transparency International is not alone in drawing attention
to corruption through its branches in all parts of the world. In
September, the U.N. Development Program and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development joined forces to publish a
study of anticorruption initiatives in 25 countries that serve as
models in the battle against bribery, money laundering and other
impediments to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community's concern with corruption issues
is not a passing phenomenon,'' top officials in the two
organizations wrote in a preface to the report, ``Corruption and
Integrity Improvement Initiatives in Developing Countries.'' It
called for ``concrete measures _ preventive as well as punitive _
that address issues of accountability, transparency and inequity at
various levels of social and economic systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Djibril Diallo, public affairs director of the U.N. Development
Program, said at a news conference that corruption is thought to
siphon billions of dollars out of development each year.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD has been working toward making the payment of bribes
illegal in Europe, where some countries still permit tax deductions
for such payments by businesses. The United States, with its 1977
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, has been a leader in trying to stem
the tide of bribery in international business.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Transparency International say they are now working
on a Bribery Propensity Index to balance its Corruption Perceptions
Index in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 corruption index can be found through the Internet at
www.transparency.de.

<P>
   XIAN, China _ Ma Mingyuan lives on the underside of modern
China. In a country where newfound prosperity has rewarded many
urban residents with computers and cell phones, he has seen his
living standard fall. Today he has neither a job nor health care,
nor even a home, beyond a lean-to fashioned from blankets and a
sheet of tin.
</P>
<P>
   A slight, sinewy 50-year-old with a gap-toothed grin, Ma earns
$2 or $3 day as a sort of free-lance garbage collector, coaxing
people to pay him to haul away their household garbage on his
ancient bike-drawn cart.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago he owned a small house near the South Gate of
Xian's old city center. But in 1993 the city government evicted him
to make way for a redevelopment project. Now his home is his
lean-to, his bed an old couch and his living room two small plastic
stools he hospitably places on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I earn is enough for food, but nothing else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of city dwellers living in poverty is now growing
rapidly in China. A decade ago, this group was virtually
nonexistent. Today, Chinese researchers estimate, anywhere from 12
million to more than 22 million urban residents _ out of an urban
population of 200 million _ live in ``absolute poverty,'' meaning
that they cannot afford basic food, clothing or shelter. These
urban poor are distinct from the large number of poor migrants from
the countryside, who come to cities in search of work but are not
counted as residents.
</P>
<P>
   The urban poor are mostly unskilled workers, the losers in
China's rapid transformation to a market economy; the income gap
between rich and poor in China is probably growing faster than
anywhere else on earth, researchers say. And in response, city
governments are hastily defining poverty lines and devising social
welfare plans, concerned about the plight of the newly poor but
also apprehensive about their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing urban population living in absolute
poverty,'' said Ge Yanfeng, director of the Development Research
Center, an organization associated with China's State Council. ``If
the economy remains flat, then the number of impoverished urban
Chinese is likely to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old planned economy, nearly all Chinese who lived in
cities were assigned to governmental ``work units,'' which
guaranteed them a place to live as well as subsidizing food
staples, medical care, pensions and often schooling for their
children. Under this system, living standards of urban residents
rose steadily, en masse, throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years that system has started to crumble:
many state companies have shut down or downsized, laying off vast
numbers of workers. Many more are so cash poor that they have not
been able to pay promised retirement or health benefits, or have
severely cut back on such commitments for those who still have
jobs. And a number of people now work in jobs that do not come with
housing or health care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Ge said, the only urban residents who were poor were
those who were ``disadvantaged'' in some way, perhaps physically
disabled. ``But today,'' he said, ``probably 90 percent of the
impoverished population are working poor _ who are working or who
used to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness and crime are still, by Western standards,
extremely rare in China. But evidence of growing urban poverty is
readily apparent _ beggars surround department stores, homeless
people sleep on the sidewalks _ even in Beijing, the capital, whose
image is normally carefully protected. While many of the beggars
are transients from rural areas, some are from smaller cities and
others are home-grown.
</P>
<P>
   For two months now, Sun Zhongli, 71, a gaunt man with a bright
red baseball cap, has lived under a bridge near Beijing's central
Changan Avenue, just a 15-minute walk from the Great Hall of the
People. Using piles of old magazines covered with a tarpaulin, he
has defined for himself a private space on this most public of
sidewalks. By day he begs and dons spectacles to read. By night
this is his bed.
</P>
<P>
   After Sun was laid off from a state-owned construction company
about 10 years ago, he worked as a part-time laborer. Then his legs
gave out.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the concession stand near Sun's den says that Sun's
local subdistrict government, on the outskirts of Beijing, really
ought to take care of him. His customers nod, reflecting
paternalistic views of government absorbed during decades of
Communist schooling.
</P>
<P>
   But, today, it does not. He gets no money from his former
employer. Nor does he have any children _ still the fall-back
social security system in China.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that while most urban poor still have a place to
live, they often have other kinds of problems: their children are
poorly nourished or they drop out of school since their parents
cannot afford the fees. But housing is a looming issue, since China
is currently transferring much of what was formerly free or heavily
subsidized government-provided housing onto the private market,
asking tenants to buy or pay higher rents.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it will help the urban poor _ after all most are
the very workers who were the Communist ideal for so many years.
``The Chinese government has been placing a great deal of emphasis
on dealing with the problem of urban poverty,'' Ge said, ``since
this is a problem that touches on social stability.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he added that some city governments were themselves so low
on cash that they set the subsistence line at inadequate levels _
many are under $30 a month _ or cannot come through with payments
they have committed to make. Labor unions and the Ministry of Civil
Affairs chip in, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to the recently released 1997 China Human Development
Report for the United Nations, ``China is quite far from reaching
the goal that the government has proposed for the year 2000 of
establishing a system to insure a minimum living standard of the
urban population in more than 600 cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances that lead to poverty are diverse: a family's
breadwinner loses a job; an elderly parent gets sick, requiring
extensive unreimbursed medical treatment; a state factory stops
paying retirement benefits, or once-free or low-cost housing ends
up in the private market and becomes unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Ma's case falls into the last category. Until 1993 he lived in
an ancient one-room house that he had inherited. But in that year,
the city of Xian decided to bulldoze the primitive dwellings in his
neighborhood to make way for redevelopment, offering free
apartments in the new complex to longtime tenants who were poor.
</P>
<P>
   From the dark recesses of his lean-to, Ma pulled out a
threadbare but carefully folded contract with the city government,
which bears his thumbprint as a signature. It promises him a free
one-bedroom apartment on the ninth floor in the new building if he
moves out of his old home for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But during that 18 months, the city sold development rights to a
construction company, which insisted that if Ma wanted to move into
the new apartment he would have to buy it. So for the last five
years, Ma, who belongs to the Hui Muslim minority, has moved from
place to place, settling six months ago in his lean-to in Xian's
crowded Muslim neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some Xian residents who have lost their free housing have staged
protests against the city and the new developer. Ma made one
fruitless visit to the company, some months back, but has otherwise
not joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a troublemaker,'' he said. And, anyway, he is caught
in the bind of the working poor everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go,'' he said. ``If I don't work for a day, I don't
eat _ it's that simple.''  &QL;

NEW EVIDENCE TIES SUDANESE TO BIN LADEN, U.S. ASSERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has obtained new evidence to link
the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile
strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden,
the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, the officials said last week, shows that Salih
Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, has
had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an
Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there of
President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives
money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his
terror network, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
   This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed
Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the
U.S. embassies, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had
no ties either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. In
a statement provided by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris
said: ``I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic
terrorist organization anywhere in the world. I have never met Mr.
bin Laden, I have never spoken with him, I have never had any
financial or business relationship with him, nor knowingly with
anyone acting as his agent.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have also received new reports of an
increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack.
Officials said they were not certain what the Iraqis were now doing
in Khartoum. But intelligence agents previously obtained evidence
that the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trips to Iraq,
where he visited the head of the chemical weapons program. In
addition, a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely took at the
Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in the
production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over
his decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and
CIA officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was
based on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United
States has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been
closed since 1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. In
addition, more than 100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in
Sudan were withdrawn in January 1996 because they proved to be
fabrications. That year a second informer warned of several
terrorist threats, including one against Anthony Lake, then the
national security adviser, but his reports proved impossible to
confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials say that at the time of the
cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with
bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence
linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. Now they say that
the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their initial
suspicions about Al Shifa.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack, Clinton
administration officials acknowledge, they did not know that Idris
owned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had begun to scrutinize the
plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's ownership was
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we knew about the ownership was that a lot of it couldn't
be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. intelligence
official.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the missile strike, when Idris was publicly
identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate his
possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A Sudanese
expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was
previously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of
Saudi Arabia. He bought the Shifa plant in March.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say U.S. intelligence has received reports that Idris
launders money for international Islamic groups, and that he also
has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 40 percent owned by the
Military Industrial Corporation, a government entity that the
United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial Corp. in
his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production,
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases
against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses with the
Military Industrial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about
the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic
Jihad. But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated
into bin Laden's terrorist campaign.

SOLVING THE LANGUAGE TROUBLES OF MAYAN IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two by two, a procession of boys in heavy
pullovers, or lopils, and girls in embroidered huipil blouses dance
a jaunty dance, their hands clasped behind their backs, to the
tunes of a marimba band. They make their way up the stairs of a
stage at the front of the room, where, finally, a nervous-looking
young girl at the end of the procession ascends in the puffy white
dress that is the traditional clothing of a Mayan bride and is
crowned the year's Queen of San Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion on this recent Saturday night at Our Lady Queen of
Angels Church in the historic center of downtown Los Angeles is the
Fiesta de San Miguel, honoring the patron saint of the Mayan
village of San Miguel Acatan. The 100 families taking part in the
festival immigrated to the United States from San Miguel Acatan but
are afraid to return in the aftermath of Guatemala's civil war, or
simply do not want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   But under a 1997 law, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central
American Relief Act, signed into law by President Clinton in
November of 1997, many of the Mayans here and elsewhere in Southern
California will eventually face interviews that will determine
whether they can stay in the country and apply for permanent
residency or be told to return to their homeland. A little-known
language gap _ most Mayans have a limited command of Spanish _
stands to make that process difficult at best, so the festival
opens with a reminder from a speaker that the interviews are coming
and that a new group of indigenous interpreters is available to
help give those seeking residency a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 Mayans were among 250,000 Central Americans who
fled torture, rape and murder in the 1980s during a civil war in
their native Guatemala, and some 20,000 have settled in the
Pico-Union and South Central neighborhoods of Los Angeles and in
other Southern California communities, working in sewing factories,
picking produce in the fields or lingering on the streets in the
early morning in the hopes of being picked up for a day of manual
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's war formally ended in 1996, but many Mayans are
afraid to return to a country still in turmoil or have come to feel
at home in the United States. Although some people have already
gone through the asylum process, immigrant rights advocates have
been feeling a sense of urgency regarding the others because the
interviews under the 1997 law were to begin this month (they have
been delayed).
</P>
<P>
   To help the Mayans stay here, the advocates must first help them
overcome a language barrier: Mayans speak indigenous Indian
languages and know only basic Spanish, not enough to represent
themselves adequately in immigration hearings. (The INS does not
routinely provide interpretation services outside the world's major
languages.)
</P>
<P>
   The misconception that Mayans speak fluent Spanish is frequently
furthered by Mayans themselves. They often go into the proceedings
without a lawyer or an indigenous interpreter, in part because they
do not know they can request one and in part because they do not
want to attract attention to their indigenous heritage, which can
be a target for condescension from Latino peers who ridicule them
for being ``Indios'' or ``ignorant.'' As a result, advocates say,
Mayans lose the vast majority of their immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know what the judge says, what the
interpreter says, because the interpretation is English to Spanish,
and people don't know what many of the words mean,'' said Victor
Lopez, the director of Maya Various Interpretations Services and
Indigenous Organization Network, or Mayavision, that was recently
formed to provide interpreters for the Mayans.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez came to this country in 1981 from Guatemala and started
out as a flower picker in San Diego County, but began providing
interpretation services for his countrymen 14 years ago. The
network, which is financed by private grants, officially began
operation in August and has about 35 interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the immigrants that the network seeks to help is
Rosario Lucas, the wife of a landscaper in San Diego County, who
crossed the border illegally in 1994 to flee the constant fear of
Guatemalan guerrillas and join her husband, who had fled earlier.
She began working on her asylum application in 1997. Ms. Lucas
struggled through the process in Spanish for a year before finding
an interpreter for her native Q'anjob'al, understanding the general
sense of things but unable to follow the legal complexities of her
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling real happy, because somebody's coming to help me
in my language,'' Ms. Lucas said. ``I can understand him and I can
explain my case to him. If he understands me, and he can tell
everything I'm saying to the judge, I can answer all the questions
the judge is going to ask me.''

   WASHINGTON _ In his report to the House, Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, cited ``substantial and credible information
that President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice'' by
concealing gifts to Monica Lewinsky that could be used as evidence
in Paula Jones' lawsuit against the president and by helping Ms.
Lewinsky obtain a job while she was a potential witness in the
Jones case. Starr's office questioned several witnesses on those
points over months of grand jury proceedings. Here are excerpts
from the testimony of some of the witnesses, made public by the
House Judiciary Committee.

   Before the Grand Jury
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 27, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You told us when we met with you over these last three days
that Ms. Lewinsky gave you a bunch of items.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Mm-hmm. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And explain to us what happened.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Monica said she was getting concerned, and she wanted to
give me the stuff the President had given her _ or give me a box of
stuff. It was a box of stuff. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What did you do with the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I put it under my bed.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did Ms. Lewinsky tell you why she wanted to give you this
box of items?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think she was just getting concerned. I think people were
asking questions about stuff she had gotten.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Do you know who had been asking the questions?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Sir, no, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   May 5, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And did the President tell you to call Monica, and he was
the one that said, ``Monica has something for you to hold, has some
stuff that she wants you to keep for a while?''
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember that.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You're saying it didn't happen, or is it probable that it
happened?
</P>
<P>
   A.: My recollection _ the best I remember is Monica calling me
and asking if I'd hold some gifts for her. I said I would.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And did the President know you were holding these things for
Monica?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't know. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Didn't he say to you that Monica had something for you to
hold?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember that. I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you ever talk to the President and tell him you had this
box from Monica?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember that either.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Do you think it happened, though?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't know. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What exactly did Monica say when _
</P>
<P>
   A.: The best I remember she said that she wanted me to hold
these gifts _ hold this _ she may have said gifts, I'm sure she
said gift, box of gifts _ I don't remember _ because people were
asking questions. And I said, ``Fine.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: So you knew that some of the gifts in the box were from the
President.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I knew that some of them _ yes, she told me that.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: She told you that. What else did she say was in the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't think she said. The box were gifts. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Was it your understanding also that some of the questions
that were being asked were related to the Paula Jones lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The question is, did I think the questions that were being
asked were related to Paula Jones' lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Right.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember what Isikoff _ I don't remember if there
was _
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Where did this exchange take place that she actually gave
you the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Now, the best I remember, that I went to her house _ I drove
to her _ outside of her residence and picked up the box. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you go with anyone to pick up the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: It was after work and I was by myself.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: So it would be fair to say it was pretty important to pick
it up.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I wouldn't say that.
</P>
<P>
   May 6, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did Monica say anything about someone else wanting these
gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: These items?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Are you sure she did not say that?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Sir, to the best that I can remember, I do not remember her
ever saying that.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What about the President's knowledge about Monica turning
over to you the gifts he had given her?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you talk to him about it?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember talking to him about that, about the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: If Monica said you did, would that not be true?
</P>
<P>
   A.: If Monica said I talked to the President about it?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Right.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Then she may remember better than I. I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   July 22, 1998
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: During this conversation with the President, did you
discuss the fact that you had a box of Monica's belongings under
your bed?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I'm sure not. ...
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Mrs. Currie, I wanted to come back for a second to the
box of gifts and how they came to be in your possession. As I
recall your earlier testimony during the other days, you testified
that the President asked you to telephone Monica. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Pardon? The President asked me to telephone Monica?
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: About?
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: About the box of gifts or about a box. I'm trying to
recall and understand exactly how that box of gifts came to be in
your possession.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I do not recall the President asking me to call
about a box of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: How did you come to be in possession of the box of gifts,
then?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: The best I remember is Monica calls me and asks me
if she can give me some gifts, if I'd pick up some gifts from her.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: And did she tell you what kind of gifts they were.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She did not.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: She didn't tell you that they were gifts from the
President.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She did not.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Did she tell you why she wanted you to pick them up?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She wanted me to hold them.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: And did you ever discuss with the President that you had
a box of gifts from Monica?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't remember talking about the gifts at all.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Did you discuss with him that you picked anything up from
Monica?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't _
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: That Monica had given you anything?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't remember talking to him at all about gifts.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Well, never mind _ put aside gifts. About any box of any
material that Monica had given you to hold?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Did you have any understanding of why Monica gave you
this box?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She said to hold them. I don't know if she was
moving and wanted me to _ it would be safer with me. I didn't know
what they were. She just asked me to hold her gifts.
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Did you have any impression yourself that these might
have been gifts from the President? Did you have any suspicion of
that?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't think I thought much more about it. I
picked them up, took them home, put them under the bed and left
them there.
</P>
<P>
   BY MS. IMMERGUT:
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You previously testified you understood that they were gifts
from the President.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Then if I testified to that, then I stand corrected. If
that's what I said.

<P>
   Before the Grand Jury
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 6, 1998
</P>
<P>
   (Describing a telephone conversation and meeting with Mrs.
Currie)
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What did she say?
</P>
<P>
   A.: She said, ``I understand you have something to give me.''
Or, ``The President said you have something to give me.'' Along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: How long after you had left the White House did Betty call
you?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: When she said something along the lines of ``I understand
you have something for me,'' or ``The President says you have
something for me,'' what did you understand her to mean?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The gifts. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K. Let me just ask you some questions. Did you ever
discuss with her the contents of the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't believe so.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did she ever ask about the contents of the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did she ever say anything indicating that she knew from a
prior discussion the contents of the box?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Not _ no, not that I remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Sounds like it was a short conversation.
</P>
<P>
   A.: We talked about her mom a bit and Christmas. I think maybe I
had elaborated on what I got for Christmas from him.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Now, you could have just thrown these items out, rather than
putting them in a box. Why didn't you just throw them out?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Because I _ they meant a lot to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K. You could have given the items to someone else, a
friend of yours, Ashley Raines or to your mother or just hidden
them somewhere. Why didn't you do that?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think _ I've come to sort of see this now. I don't know
that I necessarily saw it then, but I feel now a little bit that me
turning over some of these things was a little bit of an assurance
to the President or reassurance that, you know, that everything was
O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: In your mind, then, were you giving these items not just to
Betty, but really to the President as well, in a manner of
speaking?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think that was even more directly what I thought it was.
Not that they were going to be in his possession, but that he would
understand whatever it was I gave to Betty and that that might make
him feel a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did Betty say where she was going to put the box of gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think she said she was going to keep them in a closet. Or,
you know, she'd keep the box in a closet.

   President Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Before the Grand Jury
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17, 1998
</P>
<P>
   A.: ... I did have a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky at some time
about gifts, the gifts I'd given her. ...
</P>
<P>
   A.: ... My recollection is that Ms. Lewinsky said something to
me like, ``What if they ask me about the gifts you've given me?''
That's the memory I have. That's why I question whether it happened
on the 28th, because she had a subpoena with her, request for
production. And I told her that if they asked her for gifts, she'd
have to give them whatever she had, that that's what the law was.
...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: After you gave her the gifts on Dec. 28th, did you speak
with your secretary, Ms. Currie, and ask her to pick up a box of
gifts that were some compilation of gifts that Ms. Lewinsky would
have? A.: No sir, I didn't do that. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: ... Did you ever have a conversation with Betty Currie about
gifts, or picking something up from Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't believe I did, sir. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You never told her anything to this effect, that Monica has
something to give you?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: That is to say, Betty Currie?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No, sir, I didn't. I don't have any memory of that whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And so you have no knowledge that, or you had no knowledge
at the time, that Betty Currie went and picked up, your secretary
went and picked up from Monica Lewinsky items that were called for
by the Jones subpoena and hid them under her bed? You had no
knowledge that anything remotely like that was going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I did not. I did not know she had those items, I believe,
until that was made public.

DICK GEPHARDT: FRUSTRATED WITH CLINTON, BUT A FIRST LINE OF
DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not only have Dick Gephardt and Bill Clinton never
been close, but sometimes they have acted as if they belonged to
separate political parties.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems strange, and occasionally gives the White House a
bad case of the jitters, that the phlegmatic House minority leader
from Missouri is now the president's first line of defense as the
House prepares to vote this week on whether to open a full
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt can only say of his role, ``I've given up thinking that
anything in politics is weird or ironic, because so much is. It's
kind of like life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is a very contained man, he does not hide his
frustration with Clinton. ``I'm angry at him,'' he said,
emphasizing the word ``angry,'' during a break in his now constant
whirl of meetings with nervous Democrats looking for a way to
survive the Clinton scandal in the coming mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would assume he's angry at himself,'' he added. ``I mean
this was not good. This was bad. At some point I'll talk about it
in greater detail. It was very wrong. It has not helped anything or
anybody. It has been harmful. The question is what do you do about
it?''
</P>
<P>
   He might have let the president twist in the wind, in the same
way that House Democrats feel Clinton treated them by governing,
for a period, with congressional Republicans. After all, the
president's Oval Office fling with a White House intern, and his
deceptions about it, have now probably dashed Democrats' hopes that
they might win back the House this year, a victory that would have
propelled Gephardt forward as speaker to replace Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a high-stakes moment, not just for the president but
for his reeling party. And so Gephardt has taken a firm hands-on
role in leading House Democrats in these dangerous days, through
events that some strategists fear could ruin the party's chances in
2000 and for as much as a decade to come.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may complain about Gingrich playing a part in
impeachment. But the fractious Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee meet regularly and unabashedly with Gephardt and his
senior staff in his jumbled suite of offices off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gephardt who took the lead in selecting the House
Judiciary Committee's Democratic impeachment staff _ from senior
investigator Abbe Lowell, a hard-driving Washington lawyer, to the
aggressive press spokesman James Jordan, who was seasoned by
representing Democrats in the bitterly partisan campaign finance
hearings in the Senate and in House investigations into the
Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   In ceaseless meetings with every faction of the House Democrats,
Gephardt has searched for a party consensus on just how far to go
to protect the president from the impeachment drive. ``He is the
greatest listener in the world,'' said one Democratic strategist of
Gephardt. ``People laugh about Clinton _ you sit down with him and
don't get a word in. Dick Gephardt will listen to individuals for
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has held many one-on-one meetings with House
Democrats. Gephardt answered: ``Ones, fives, tens, 20s, 50s, 100s.
You name it. We've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, White House officials insist they are delighted
with Gephardt, who in August refused to rule out Clinton's
impeachment but now has become a leading voice lambasting the
Republicans and crying out for a ``fair'' inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it should serve as a warning to the president that
when Gephardt is asked precisely whom he represents, he says
emphatically that his first responsibility is to House Democrats.
``They elected me,'' he said. ``They want me to be their leader,
and that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   He also notes that the president's rebound in the polls may not
last. ``I have no idea what's going to happen,'' he said. ``None.
Because it is volatile and I think all of us, I think every
American that's looking at it, has very mixed and complicated
feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has a lot riding on his personal balancing act. He has
been steadily charting a different course from Clinton's on
pocketbook issues like trade policy. He opposed the president on
the balanced budget agreement and on the 1996 welfare overhaul. And
he is considering making his second presidential bid in 2000 as the
liberal standard bearer against Clinton's ideological heir, Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He might yet, watchful Democrats say, emerge from the Clinton
wreckage with greater stature as the not very flashy lawmaker who
helped the country to a sensible resolution to the scandal
engulfing the White House. On the other hand, he could very well
alienate the left wing of the Democratic party which was supposed
to be his base if he chose to make a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unquestionably a very tough situation to be in,'' said
Bill Carrick, a California-based political consultant who was
Gephardt's campaign manager in his failed bid for the 1988
presidential nomination. ``We've got a lot of hard-core Democratic
voters in the country who have a view that what Ken Starr initiated
is a modern-day witch hunt and everything the Republicans say or do
on this is politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a matter of responsible leadership Dick has to take
a step back from that and try to make a more objective judgment,''
Carrick said. ``As a consequence, politically, it is not the best
place for him to be in terms of winning a primary contest in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to emphasize that point to Gephardt in August.
Aides say Clinton was infuriated by Gephardt's early comments, in
which he said he could not rule out the possibility that the
president could be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt quickly heard complaints about his stance _ not from
Clinton, but from liberal stalwarts like the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
labor leaders John Sweeney and Gerald McEntee, and Terry McAuliffe,
who has served as a lead fund-raiser to both Clinton and Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Sweeney, the head of the
AFL-CIO, said Sweeney did talk by phone with Clinton once or twice
while the president was on vacation on Martha's Vineyard but called
Gephardt on his own to talk about Gephardt's position. ``He called
because he thought it was hurtful to Gephardt and hurtful
overall,'' she said. But Gephardt's aides said that several of
those who called said they were doing the president's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and House Democratic aides sent their own volleys
across the bow of the White House last week. James Carville, a
Clinton confidant, brashly called impeachment a war between himself
and Gingrich, and a host of liberal Democratic interest groups
announced that they planned to sponsor a television ad campaign to
strengthen Clinton and encourage Democratic turnout in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The House strategists complained that such partisanship could
backfire and that the ads could draw money away from needy
Democrats in heated campaigns. Such a Clinton-based defense, they
worried, might not help endangered Democrats in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   In these strange days in Congress, Gephardt says he has been
trying to write down his thoughts about politics, working on
airplanes or before going to bed. ``At some point I'm going to say
something about what I think has happened to our political
system,'' he promises. ``And it's larger than this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it,'' he said, ``the foundation, the heart,
the fabric of democracy is motivated, interested, participating
citizens, and we're eating away at that in the way this rolls
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But as if to disprove his point, Gephardt also admits he can't
escape the citizenry. At 11 p.m. one night last week, he stopped
into a Virginia supermarket after a late-night House session only
to be accosted by shoppers who wanted to talk about Clinton.

   ``People in there came up and said, `I know who you are, now let
me tell you,' '' Gephardt recounted. ``One person said, `Do not get
rid of him. Do not get rid of him. What he did was wrong. He should
be punished, but don't impeach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only under some prompting does he admit what the other shoppers
told him. ``Others say, `Get rid of him,'' he said. `` `Oh
absolutely. Tell him to resign. He's got to get out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say to them they don't know enough,'' he said,
starting to laugh at the absurd turn politics has taken in an era
when presidential indiscretions are transmitted on the Internet.
``They say, `I know too much.' ''

FOOTBALL COLUMN: NO-NAME QUARTERBACK MAY BE THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last draft was a tale of two quarterbacks _ Peyton Manning
and Ryan Leaf _ and the third-best prospect was supposed to be
Brian Griese. Charlie Batch was hardly mentioned. Leaf and Manning
were to rise to stardom and maybe Griese would later surpass both.
But Charlie Batch? He was considered a no-name quarterback with a
small game from a small college, Eastern Michigan, a school 40
miles from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   If Batch was lucky, maybe a team would select him in the final
couple of rounds. And take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The draft outsiders did not recognize the best of Batch, the
arm, the quickness, the intelligence or the poise. The draft
insiders did. Denver wanted him before Griese. Detroit wanted him
more. It traded its third-, fifth- and sixth-round picks in the
draft to Miami to obtain the Dolphins' spot (via Green Bay) in
Round 2, the 60th overall pick. Thus, the quarterbacks drafted last
April fell this way: first pick, Manning to Indianapolis; second
pick, Leaf to San Diego; 60th pick, Batch to Detroit; 91st pick,
Griese to Denver. Only one other quarterback, Moses Moreno of
Colorado State, was drafted, the 232nd pick, by Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf and Manning battle today when San Diego plays at
Indianapolis. Griese sits for Denver when Philadelphia visits.
Moreno watches when Detroit plays at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He watches Charlie Batch start.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rush of activity for Batch these last few weeks
and months, as his pro career rushes to prime time, as agonizing
pain in his life begins to subside, as his dreams become tangible
and touchable. Detroit's veteran quarterback, Scott Mitchell, was
benched as the starter after two games. Batch was tossed in as the
starter in Week 3 at Minnesota and the Lions lost, 29-6. And then,
on Monday night, Batch took lessons learned from his pro debut and
improved, and so did the Lions. Detroit won, 27-6, over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chicago (0-4) today, Batch looks for more redemption.
Leaf and Manning become only the second pair of quarterbacks
drafted first and second to start against each other in their
rookie seasons (Drew Bledsoe of New England and Rick Mirer, then of
Seattle, did it 1993). Manning has no victories. Leaf has two.
Batch has one. Manning has thrown 11 interceptions. Leaf has thrown
8. Batch has thrown 2. Manning's passer rating is 52.1. Leaf's is
32.1. Batch's is 52.0.
</P>
<P>
   Batch's history is that the more he plays, the more he hears and
sees, the better he gets. Mitchell, 30, is now widely regarded as a
quarterback who suffers mental lapses and who cringes under
pressure. Batch, 23, is becoming known as a man of steel. An
ironman. No wonder. He is 6 feet 2 inches, 216 pounds, and grew up
in Homestead, Pa., near Pittsburgh, and before Eastern Michigan he
played football at Steel Valley High for a team nicknamed the
Ironmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to all of the TV talk before the draft and my name
was never mentioned,'' Batch said. ``I had had a good career at
Eastern Michigan, but I guess people thought because the school is
small that it meant nothing. I played in four different offenses
there: the option, the play-action pass, a combination of both and
then a pro-style offense. That experience helped me learn how to
study defenses on film and how to recognize coverages. I hate when
people talk about me making rookie mistakes. In your first game,
you're a rookie. The way I see it, after that, if you make mistakes
they aren't rookie mistakes. They are mental errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stayed level-headed all of my life and I know that
things come and go. I know that tomorrow is not guaranteed.
Experience teaches you how to handle certain things, but it can't
be the answer for accepting all things. I know this lesson well.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned it from the death of his sister, Danyl, 17, who was
killed two years ago in an accidental, drive-by shooting while
walking in her neighborhood in Homestead. Batch said a suspect was
caught but released because of lack of evidence. Batch is finding
the tragedy easier to handle; harder to accept.
</P>
<P>
   It has toughened him. It has made him grow even closer to his
mother, Lynn Settles, whom he describes as ``my mother, my father,
my hero.'' It prepared him for the awesome request of being an
instant starting quarterback in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The Lion coaches say that Batch is good at learning on the run.
They say they seldom have to teach him anything twice. He has
completed 34 of 63 passes for 275 yards. He has yet to throw his
first touchdown pass. But already, he is providing stability at a
position where the Lions have been lacking. His quarterback role
models are Dan Marino in Miami and Randall Cunningham in Minnesota.
He grew up watching both, Marino at the University of Pittsburgh
and Cunningham with the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed against Tampa Bay that when we play for the full 60
minutes as a unit, we can have great success,'' Batch said. ``This
team is treating me as a leader, and I respect that. I respect my
elders. I keep my ears wide open; that's how you learn. People are
counting us out as a team and we have 12 games left to play. I
don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. The kid from 40 miles away is right at home with
doubt and detraction. He has new dreams now, and he is showing the
Lions, and those who ignored him, something different.

HANDSOME HUNK HAD DARK SIDE AS HIT MAN, FBI AND POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Members of World Gym in suburban Woodland Hills
couldn't help but notice the movie-star-handsome hunk who greeted
them with an exotic accent and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   A bodybuilder and part-time stuntman, Graham Miller embraced the
California dream fully after moving to the San Fernando Valley from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing Afrikaner won a wide circle of friends and
acquaintances, built a thriving career in the fitness industry,
drove a 1990 BMW and married in Las Vegas in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Women swooned at his chiseled, 5-foot-11, 190-pound physique,
tawny hair and million-watt smile. Men admired his friendly nature
and calm confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But he was living a double life, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Last week FBI agents arrested the man known to friends as Graham
Miller outside the gym on charges that he kidnapped and murdered a
British businessman seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His real name, they announced, is Neville Vandermerwe, a
28-year-old who lived in a swirl of shifting identities while
haunted by the dark accusation from his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just shocked. I can't believe this is true,'' said Brian
Forster, a friend whose Told Partners realty company leases space
to World Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a brother to me. He's basically like my best friend
over the last couple of years. He's outgoing, he's extremely
intelligent. Just fun to be around, very caring and helpful to
everyone that he's been in contact with.''
</P>
<P>
   Vandermerwe's attorney, Richard Crane, did not return repeated
phone calls. But his friends professed faith in his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my best friend, and I don't believe he's guilty,''
Forster said.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Shamis, 29, of suburban Chatsworth, who had trained with
Vandermerwe for six weeks this year, said she was floored by the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought of him as the perfect person who had no
problems, it seemed,'' Shamis said. ``He looked perfect, he had
lots of money, he had a perfect personality. He never lost his
temper.''
</P>
<P>
   As his friends and acquaintances struggle to understand how the
man they knew as the model of charm and civility could be linked to
such a gruesome crime, Vandermerwe is being held without bail in
the federal Metropolitan Detention Center downtown, awaiting
extradition hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office has 60 days from the date of his
arrest to prepare an extradition request on behalf of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The international hunt for Vandermerwe began in April 1991,
after a British accountant named Simon Law disappeared from his
home in Kent County, England. Nothing but a dressing gown was
missing from his home.
</P>
<P>
   According to the arrest warrant prepared by the U.S. attorney in
cooperation with the Kent County constabulary, Law had been
involved in a bitter business dispute with a South African named
David Jenkins, who believed Law had ``ripped him off.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was never resolved, and in mid-March, Law told a
friend, ``I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't send a couple of
blokes to sort me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Law was last heard from April 22.
</P>
<P>
   A red Vauxhall Astra automobile spotted at Law's home was traced
to Vandermerwe and another South African, Glen Chait, who had flown
to London about a week before. DNA tests showed blood encrusted on
its trunk proved an almost certain match to that of Law, whose body
was never found.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, a person calling himself Neville Uvan Der Merle
arrived in New York, the warrant states. Police said the birth date
and passport number of that man match Vandermerwe's.
</P>
<P>
   English police followed Vandermerwe to South Africa, but he was
already gone.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Willem Vandermerwe, told police his son returned
from England distraught and said: ``Someone has gone missing, and I
am going to get the blame for it and I've got no alibi,'' and ``I
will be traced here so easily, I have got to leave the country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Vandermerwe felt any such anxiety after moving to California,
he didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never acted like a guy that was hiding anything, or was
living a double life,'' said Bill Geiger, editor of Muscle &AMP;
Fitness Magazine, who knew Vandermerwe through World Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of self-assured about himself to maybe the point
of a little cocky. But probably deservedly, because he had a look
that could have been a model for a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, Vandermerwe declined an offer to model for
Muscle &AMP; Fitness, which Geiger said is published throughout the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, hold a highly visible position at both World
Gym and the former Quest Gym in Woodland Hills. Geiger said
Vandermerwe also appeared on a fitness video.
</P>
<P>
   His role at the gym is unclear. Forster and other gym members
believed him to be general manager, and said he handled complaints
and other official business for the gym. Geiger said he thought him
part owner.
</P>
<P>
   But a World Gym official who declined to give his name said
Vandermerwe was merely a personal trainer. Thom Mrozek, a spokesman
for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, confirmed that
Vandermerwe did not appear to hold any official position at the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   As Vandermerwe built his new life in Los Angeles, he switched
his name often and for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Vandermerwe's 1990 BMW is registered to Manuel Boaventura,
according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. His driver's
license is listed under the name Graham Manuel Miller, also known
as Manuel Fernando Boaventura.
</P>
<P>
   He married Christine A. Miller in Las Vegas in December under
the name Manuel Boaventura, the Clark County Marriage License
Bureau confirmed. Using a passport with his photo and that name, he
applied for resident alien status in January, the arrest warrant
states.
</P>
<P>
   While police records show his birth year to be 1970, his
driver's license and marriage certificate list it as 1966.
</P>
<P>
   With his new wife and another woman, Bernadette Miller,
Vandermerwe moved into a suburban Tarzana condominium in May under
the name Graham Boaventura, property manager Russell Beesley said.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, he traveled to the East Coast for a stunt
job, Shamis said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even seven years after Law's disappearance, however, police in
England never abandoned the hunt for Vandermerwe.
</P>
<P>
   Kent County constables, who had searched for Vandermerwe in his
home country, learned this year that he might be in Los Angeles
near his brother, said Superintendent of Police George Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to this, we'd exhausted all other avenues to look for
Neville in South Africa, and we were inevitably drawn to the
conclusion that he may be in Los Angeles,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   They enlisted U.S. law enforcement to track Vandermerwe down. A
Los Angeles police officer sniffed him out at his brother's
Hollywood home Sept. 8 by feigning a flower delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the U.S. attorney obtained a warrant for his
arrest. On Sept. 28 the FBI arrested him without incident at World
Gym.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing the next day, Forster said Vandermerwe was
characteristically calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed pretty confident and not to be worried, and in good
spirits,'' Forster said. ``When the judge asked him why he was
there, he didn't know why he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the years that have gone by may have buttressed
Vandermerwe's own sense of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the passage of time may have altered people's
perception of him, and he may have ... talked himself out of it,''
Rogers said. ``As time goes on, he may have convinced himself he
was fine.''

REEL COWBOYS RIDE TALL IN THE SADDLE TO KEEP OLD WEST ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's a tough fight these old movie and TV cowboys
have picked for themselves -- keeping the Old West alive.
</P>
<P>
   They've been hit with a big one-two punch this year -- losing
Roy Rogers in July, and now Gene Autry. The ranks of our
six-shooting cowboy icons are thinning rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men sitting around a booth at Big Jim's Restaurant
in suburban Sun Valley on Saturday morning have been beaten up and
shot by some of the biggest movie and TV cowboy stars to ever climb
into a saddle.
</P>
<P>
   There's John Locke, who drew his gun against Sheriff Matt Dillon
out on the main street of Dodge City in the seventh episode of
``Gunsmoke'' -- back when ``Miss Kitty was still very young,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember him. He was the guy getting dragged off the
dirt street at the end of the show while the credits were rolling,
and Matt was walking back into the Long Branch Saloon to have a
sarsaparilla with Miss Kitty.
</P>
<P>
   There's Big Al Fleming -- all 6 feet 8 inches of him -- who got
beaten up and shot by the good guys in ``Have Gun, Will Travel,''
``Rawhide,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and numerous other westerns.
</P>
<P>
   There's Al Cranston, Jack Iverson and many more who worked with
Autry and Rogers on their movies, TV or radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss 'em,'' Cranston says. ``It wasn't like working with a
star, and you're just a supporting player. It was more like working
with your buddies. You could forget all that caste-system stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a week, these men -- who call their group Reel Cowboys --
gather in the booths over at Big Jim's to stay in touch and mull
over ways to breathe new life and interest into western movies.
</P>
<P>
   I first met them in December, when they were down on their hands
and knees over at the YWCA in suburban Glendale, playing with some
little kids who had been physically abused by the adult men in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Reel Cowboys were throwing them a Christmas party, trying
their best to wipe the fear out of those little eyes and show these
kids that not all men were like the bad ones who had hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, the guys gathered back over at Big Jim's, wishing the
day would come when they had the chance to put some fear into the
eyes of the men who had beaten those kids.
</P>
<P>
   In the movies and on TV, they had to play the bad guys. In real
life, they were as good as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at those old westerns, and you see our heritage, our
royalty, in a way,'' says Iverson. ``Those B western movies that
Autry and Rogers starred in sustained the (movie) industry for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring back that feeling, perpetuate the whole
idea of the western movie, keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not fooling themselves, though. Old cowboys like Rogers
and Autry would be dated today because we've long passed what
Cranston calls ``the age of innocence'' in these movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back at Gene's old Melody Ranch, at the intimacy and
bonding among cowboys in the age of innocence, and you realize you
wouldn't see something like that again up on the screen in our
high-tech world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But something should be up there, these men say. The legacy of
our Old West should be offered to kids today, like it was to past
generations of children growing up on Autry and Rodgers, on
``Gunsmoke'' and ``Wagon Train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep the memories alive with the new
generation of kids coming up,'' Big Al says. ``The cowboy has
always been the American icon around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up, we still had them as heroes. Those old serial
cowboys were our heroes. Today's kids don't have heroes, unless you
think gangsters and rap artists are heroes. I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating thing, Locke says, is that the market for a new
western hero is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go across this country a lot, staging gunfights at Wild West
shows and giving talks about preserving the Old West,'' he says.
``Everywhere I go, people say they want westerns back on TV. But
where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a tough fight these old movie and TV cowboys have
picked for themselves -- keeping the Old West alive.

BASEBALL COLUMN: RANGERS PASS ALONG MESSAGE FROM YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees had their way with the
Texas Rangers and turned them into one-hit wonders. Next.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they wanted to do with us,'' Mark McLemore said
early Saturday. ``They shut down our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore was one of the Rangers' five one-hit wonders, the
players who batted second through sixth in their lineup. McLemore,
Rusty Greer, Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark and Ivan Rodriguez each
managed one hit in the Yankees' sweep of their three-game division
series. They batted a collective .093.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Rangers swung bats at opposing pitchers
like machetes all season and joined the Yankees as the most
ferocious offensive teams in the American League, the Yankees'
pitchers have sent a frightening message to the next team or two
they will play in this post-season.
</P>
<P>
   They held the Rangers to one run, a lone run, a mere run, a
measly run. No pitching staff had ever held a team to one run in a
post-season series, never in any of the 165 post-season series that
had been played before this year, not in a strike-created extra
series, not in a division series, not in a league championship
series, not in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees held the Rangers to one run. They do not have to
post the message on the signboard atop Yankee Stadium or on the
message board alongside the Deegan or on the ribbon running around
the building in Times Square for the remaining teams in the
playoffs to learn of the remarkable feat.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams had scouts scrutinizing the Yankees in their past
three games, and the scouts will write and relate horror stories to
their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Just like they will tell frightening tales about Shane Spencer,
whom Clark called ``the reincarnation of Babe Ruth'' after he hit
his second series home run and his ninth home run in his last 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one guy we didn't know as much about was Spencer,'' said
Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said. ``I don't know if he
realizes this is the playoffs. Did he recognize that? He's not
supposed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the phenomenal rookie is someone else's problem. So are the
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre, son of the Yankees' pitching coach and victim
of the first of those frighteningly good pitching performances,
offered his own scouting report on David Wells, Andy Pettitte and
David Cone: ``It starts with Wells. In August he pitched five or
six innings and gave up five runs. Earlier in the year he pitched
three, and he gave up nine. But in his last start against us, he
executed. He pitched a great game here in September. He had the
ball in on the right-handers, used his changeup, was always ahead.
This is a free-swinging club. They swing early in the count. He
stayed ahead. He executed that same type of game plan in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pettitte, to me, was so tough because he was ahead pretty
often. He pitched different than some of the films we've seen. He
threw the ball away from the hitters a lot more. He wasn't just
jamming the cutter in on right-handers. He executed that game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes when Cone picks his leg up he's not sure
what he's going to throw. I think he invents it on the way there,
so how can you come up with a game plan against a guy like David
Cone? He's awesome. He's one of the great inventors. He has great
stuff. He's a big-time pitcher. He's a gamer. He's the right guy
that you want on the mound when you're trying to close something
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone closed out the Rangers with five and two-thirds innings of
nifty pitching Friday night. The only reason he did not pitch
longer was a torrential downpour that delayed the Rangers' demise
and the Yankees' advance for 3 hours 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rain, after the rain, it did not matter. The Yankees'
pitchers retired McLemore, Greer, Gonzalez, Clark, Rodriguez.
Gonzalez, the one in the middle, the heart and soul of the Rangers'
lineup, the one who drove in 100 runs before the All-Star Game
break, battered the Yankees in the division series in 1996. He hit
five home runs, drove in nine runs, batted .438. In this division
series, other than his second-game double (he scored THE run), he
batted the ball out of the infield twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers throw much better in this series,'' he said,
clearly pained by the developments. ``They throw great. Great
location. When a great pitching staff throws great, you don't have
a chance to win ball games. They throw good; they throw in, out,
low. In the playoffs, they throw more curves, throw in, throw out,
use the corners a lot, throw a lot of slow pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said the Yankees' pitchers were often ahead in the count.
``That, in turn, makes you widen your zone,'' he added. ``It makes
you swing the bat, and that makes it a lot tougher when you're not
in a hitter's count.''

   Melvin, whose late July trades put the Rangers in the playoffs,
said he had not seen any team pitch the Rangers as effectively for
three consecutive games. ``From top to bottom they did a pretty
good job pitching our guys,'' he said. ``In the third game we still
weren't making quality contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, McLemore said, but the Yankees can be beaten. ``But these
three nights weren't the nights,'' he added.

GARY ROWE, 64, KLANSMAN AND INFORMER IN KILLING OF RIGHTS WORKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ala., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., 64, a controversial FBI informer who
infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan during the civil rights struggles of
the 1960s, died of a heart attack four months ago in Savannah, Ga.
He was buried under the name of Thomas Neal Moore, the identity
that federal authorities helped him to assume in 1965 after he
testified against fellow klansmen who were accused of killing Viola
Gregg Liuzzo, a civil rights volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe's death became known last week when a television crew
shooting footage for a program about the FBI and the Ku Klux Klan
searched for Rowe in Savannah, only to learn that he had died May
25. Eugene Brooks, who had been Rowe's lawyer, confirmed the death.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said Rowe had settled in Savannah, his home town, under
the federal witness protection program. The lawyer said Rowe had
worked for a private security company but died bankrupt. Rowe had
long been divorced, the lawyer said, and left five children, whose
names were not released ``for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   As an informer and a trial witness, Rowe provided information
that led to the conviction of three klansmen for the Liuzzo
killing. But for the next 18 years, he remained a figure of
recurring controversy, accused of, and at times admitting to,
planning and participating in the violence he was reporting to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, wearing a bizarre cotton hood that resembled a Klan
headpiece without the point, he told a Senate committee that the
FBI had known of and condoned his participation in violence against
black people and had ordered him to sow dissent within the Klan by
having sexual relations with the wives of Klan members.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to taking part in a brutal baseball bat assault on
Freedom Riders in Birmingham in 1961 and told Alabama police that
he had fatally shot a black man, never identified, in a riot in
1963 and that federal authorities knew about these incidents.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1983, Mrs. Liuzzo's children brought an unsuccessful
$2 million suit against the FBI, charging that through its
negligence in recruiting, training and controlling Rowe, it bore
responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   As Rowe made his often boastful disclosures, figures inside and
outside government debated the proper use of informers; some
demanded greater oversight and others contended that good
intelligence could not be obtained if infiltrators had to act like
angels or Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a historian of the civil rights period, learned of
Rowe's death from the television crew when it interviewed him for
the program. He passed the information on to The New York Times.
Rowe's story raised three sets of questions, he told The Times in
an interview. ``The first was to what extent did Rowe like to
behave like a thug irrespective of who he was working for? Then
there was the question of how much did he or did he not tell the
FBI, and then, after he went public as an informer, how much did
klansmen and their sympathizers try to offload every unsolved Klan
crime on his shoulders?''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe's name first appeared in public after the killing of Mrs.
Liuzzo, a 39-year-old wife of a Detroit teamsters official and
mother of four, who had come to Alabama to help in the
Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights march in the spring of 1965. On
March 25, the day after the procession, as she drove a young black
volunteer home, her car was overtaken and she was shot to death on
a desolate stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared war on the Ku
Klux Klan in a dramatic address to the nation and named Rowe as one
of four klansmen who had been arrested by the FBI in the shooting.
The president promised to bring the Klan ``under the effective
control of law'' and urged Congress to investigate the ``hooded
society of bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the four suspects within 12 hours of the crime
suggested that the FBI had inside sources, and when Rowe was the
only one of the four not indicted, he stood revealed as the
informer.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``My Undercover Years With the Ku Klux
Klan,'' published in 1976 by Bantam, Rowe wrote that an FBI agent
named Barnett Kemp urged him to join the Ku Klux Klan in 1960 and
report on its activities. He became a member of the Klan's Eastview
13 Klavern. FBI records show that he received $20 to $300 a month
from the bureau and earned a total of $12,000 from 1960 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The book became the basis for a television movie in which Rowe
was played by Don Meredith, the former football player.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Rowe testified in three trials that he had been with
the three accused men when they followed and overtook Mrs. Liuzzo's
car. When the others fired at her, he said, he pretended to shoot.
Despite his testimony and ballistics evidence linking the fatal
bullet to a weapon taken from a defendant, the first trial on
murder charges in an Alabama court in Lowndes County ended in a
hung jury. The second ended in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The third trial, in December, was a federal civil rights case
based on an 1870 law. The three defendants were found guilty, each
receiving the maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Rowe vanished into the federal witness protection
program, presumably becoming Thomas Moore. Then in 1975 he emerged,
masked in his hood, as a witness before the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He said that in 1961 he had given the FBI advance
warning of an attack in which he and other klansmen participated,
beating Freedom Riders with baseball bats, chains and pistols at
the Birmingham bus station. He said the klansmen had been promised
15 minutes of free rein by Birmingham police and that he had
advised his FBI contacts of this three weeks in advance. He added
that when he asked his FBI contacts after the attack why nothing
had been done, he said he was told: ``Who were we going to report
it to? The Police Department was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He also testified that the FBI had told him to cause dissension
in the Klan. ``I was told to sleep with as many wives as I could,
to break up marriages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, two sets of merging developments brought Rowe back into
the news, even though he still hid behind his assumed identity. The
first development involved a series of civil actions brought by the
Liuzzo children and by several former Freedom Riders who had been
injured in the Birmingham attack. They essentially charged the FBI
with negligence and failure to protect the civil rights workers.
The second development was a series of accusations by Alabama
investigators relying on former klansmen. Rowe was indicted in 1978
on murder charges for having shot Mrs. Liuzzo, on the basis of
evidence offered by the men he had helped convict in the federal
case 13 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to extradite Rowe were blocked, and other efforts by
Alabama to prosecute Rowe were rejected by a federal judge who
ruled that the prosecution was based on highly prejudiced evidence.
Earlier Alabama investigators had revealed that they suspected Rowe
of involvement in the 1963 bombing attack on the East 16th Street
Baptist Church in which four young girls were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 the Justice Department compiled a 302-page report on
accusations involving Rowe and concluded that the FBI agents knew
about and apparently covered up his participation in nonfatal
attacks on blacks. But it said there was no evidence in FBI files
to support accusations that Rowe had years earlier failed lie
detector examinations in which he had denied knowledge of the
church bombing. Robert Chambliss, who in 1977 was convicted of the
church bombing, had been Rowe's superior in the Eastview 13
Klavern.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1983 negligence suit filed against the FBI by Mrs.
Liuzzo's children, Dean Robb, the family's lawyer, said that when
Rowe was in the Klan and working for the FBI, he ``was a hostile,
violent, pugilistic unguided missile, a violence junkie.'' Judge
Charles Joiner, a federal judge in Mrs. Liuzzo's home state of
Michigan, ruled that no negligence had been proved. He even
credited Rowe's prompt reporting of the murder with the eventual
conviction of his companions.
</P>
<P>
   In another case in 1983, however, Judge Charles Stewart Jr. of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan ordered the government to pay
$25,000 to James Peck, one of the Freedom Riders who had been badly
beaten in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zipperer, a lawyer who had represented Rowe in the past,
said several people in Savannah knew about his role a Klan
informer. Zipperer said that Rowe would often talk about his life
in the '60s and ``was quite bitter about the FBI, feeling it had
disowned him.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography Rowe portrayed himself as a man eager to
help the FBI in its struggle against the Klan. He said he preferred
to call himself an ``undercover man,'' rather than an ``informer.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the book, he said: ``While my ghost was writing
the story, an editor remarked that it would make a good book if I
`could demonstrate a complete change of opinion and become a civil
rights advocate.' Maybe so but I prefer to let the facts speak for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he thought black people should be treated fairly, he
added, he did not approve of ``integrating schools or churches or
neighborhoods or interracial marriage.''

EXPANSION TEAMS MEAN INCREASED OFFENSE? A MYTH THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The 1998 performances of Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa just got even better.
</P>
<P>
   No, they did not hit any more home runs; aren't 70 and 66 enough
for one season? But a study of baseball's offense this year reveals
how much better they really were than just about anyone else.
McGwire and Sosa shattered the previous home run barrier in a
season in which offense was stagnant, no matter how it is viewed,
no matter how it is dissected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how fantastic a season they had,'' said Florida
Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Previous expansion seasons had been marked by a significant
increase in offense. In 1969, for example, when the leagues each
added two teams, National League teams averaged 100 more runs than
the previous season, American League teams 110. Scoring rose by
1.25 runs a game in the NL, 1.37 in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the NL added Florida and Colorado, the league's 14
teams scored an average of 100 more runs than they had the previous
season. But this year the league's 16 teams averaged 746 runs, the
same average its 14 teams had compiled in 1997. AL teams averaged
an additional 1.5 home runs over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion multiple, in fact, did not hold for any offensive
category. Increases were negligible, if not non-existent. The major
leagues averaged 2.08 home runs a game compared with 2.05 a year
ago (a 1.5 percent increase), scored an average of 9.58 runs
compared with 9.53 (half of 1 percent) and saw the batting average
slip half a point, from .2668 to .2662.
</P>
<P>
   Because home runs commanded everyone's attention this year, look
at what happened to them. The league that benefited most directly
from the McGwire-Sosa onslaught and had a third player, Greg
Vaughn, reach 50 home runs, had its home run ratio rise slightly,
1.91 a game to 1.98, but its runs per game dropped from 9.21 to
9.19.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 31 players in the majors hit 30 or more home runs;
this year that number rose by a mere two.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, who has been in baseball long enough to remember
even the earliest expansion, was among the many baseball people who
believed offense would rise with the growth to 30 teams. ``You'll
see offense go up because you won't have the talented pitching,''
the Cincinnati manager said in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, apprised of the statistics, McKeon was puzzled
and said: ``I have no idea why. I have no reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone. Other managers and general managers were
equally at a loss to explain the static offense.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella said he believed that expansion had something to do
with the performances of McGwire and Sosa but acknowledged that the
numbers do not ``bear out for the rest of the league and I don't
have an explanation for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he struggled to come up with an explanation, it was clear
that Piniella was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an answer,'' he said. ``I wish I did. The
ball was lively. But it was just as lively for everybody else. The
two expansion teams basically didn't help the offense much. They
didn't hit very well. I do know that the good got better and the
average didn't get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella might have hit on something there. Atlanta general
manager John Schuerholz and Dombrowski of the Marlins echoed his
thought about good and average players, and the general idea
received support from another club executive who is an expert on
statistics and their interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the diminishment in pitching over all was more
beneficial to the very elite of offensive talent,'' said
Schuerholz, who had mistakenly thought that offense had improved
generally. ``I consider McGwire and Sosa in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   When the major league population rises, Dombrowski said, the
superior players ``have a chance to rise further above the rest.''
He added: ``A lot of the other people are equal so they don't show
significant difference. The top guys do more. If Tony Gwynn had
been Tony Gwynn and not hurt, he would have put up numbers that
would have been career highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Epstein, director of baseball operations for the San Diego
Padres, said he had not studied this year's statistics, but he had
intimate knowledge of previous expansion experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually what happens in expansion years,'' Epstein said, ``is
the standard deviation of performance gets bigger, between players
and between clubs. Even if the mean doesn't get bigger, the
deviation is bigger and the dispersion is greater. There is a wider
dispersion from the mean. This year expansion may have created more
extreme performances.''
</P>
<P>
   Performances at the high end, Epstein noted, are more readily
seen than those at the other end. ``You don't get to see the other
extreme,'' he said. ``If a player is that bad, he doesn't get to
play all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Basing an expected increase in offense on expansion, Epstein
noted, is a mistake. The increases in previous expansion years, he
said, could be attributed to other factors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he said, the Los Angeles Angels played in
hitting-friendly Wrigley Field. In 1969, the mound had been lowered
and the strike zone shrunk. In 1993, a team played in mile-high
Denver for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is going to affect hitting,'' he said.

RODRIGUEZ AND GARCIAPARRA: MORE RECORD POWER  
 SHAME IN SOUTH FLORIDA  
 LEYLAND TO DENVER, UNLESS ... 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   More Record Power
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are the poor man's Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, but
Alex Rodriguez of Seattle and Nomar Garciaparra of Boston achieved
their own remarkable height of home runs. They are shortstops who
slammed a combined 77 home runs this season. Allow that total to
register: 77 home runs for a pair of shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   Compare their total with those of the top two home run-hitting
shortstops when Ernie Banks was, like they, an unusually powerful
shortstop. In 1955, when Banks hit 44 home runs, Johnny Logan was
second among shortstops with 13 for a total of 57. In 1958, Banks
hit 47 and the next highest was 17 by Darryl Spencer and Don Zimmer
for a top-two total of 64. The next year it was Banks with 45 and
Woodie Held with 29 for 74, and in 1960 Banks had 41 and Ron Hansen
22 for 63.
</P>
<P>
   Shame in South Florida
</P>
<P>
   With all of the positive elements of the season, baseball
nevertheless suffered a large black eye with the unprecedented
dismantling and deterioration of the World Series champion Florida
Marlins. It was an act officials should realize they should never
have allowed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins wound up with a worse record than the two expansion
teams, neither of which lost 100 games, as did the Marlins, whose
108 losses were the most ever for a team that won the World Series
the year before. Their total exceeded the previous low-water mark
for a defending champion (Cincinnati Reds, 1991) by a whopping 20
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as many members of the championship team wound up back in
the playoffs as finished the season with the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players remained with the emasculated Marlins while five
were on teams that reached the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou and Jay Powell are with Houston, Kevin Brown is with
San Diego and Felix Heredia is with the Chicago Cubs. Ed Vosberg is
with the Padres but has been on the disabled list all year.
</P>
<P>
   Others who came close to the playoffs were Robb Nen with San
Francisco and Al Leiter and Dennis Cook with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland to Denver, Unless . . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies hope to wrap up Jim Leyland as their new
manager this week as well as hire a vice president for player
personnel who eventually would replace Bob Gebhard as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, who left the Marlins last week, presumably would accept
the Rockies' job, at a salary of $1.5 million or more a season,
unless a more appealing vacancy develops first. That vacancy almost
certainly would have to be in Cleveland, an ideal location for
Leyland, who grew up in Ohio and lives in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But for Leyland to get that job, Mike Hargrove would have to be
fired, and the only way he most likely would be fired is if the
impatient Indians do not reach, or win, the World Series. Even then
the Indians might find it difficult to jettison a manager who led
them to the post-season for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, the Orioles continue to search for a general
manager but will retain Manager Ray Miller because he was the
choice of the owner, Peter Angelos, who was not satisfied with two
successive post-season appearances under Davey Johnson, who remains
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles will try to figure out what to do with the team that
had a record payroll and finished so far out of first its people
couldn't see the pinstripes on the Yankees' backs.

CLINTON USES FOUNDING FATHER'S TRAVAILS TO BUILD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers reached back this
weekend to the travails of an American Founding Father to argue
that sexual misconduct is not an impeachable offense, citing
Alexander Hamilton in a memorandum released ahead of Monday's House
vote on whether to begin a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was secretary of the Treasury when three members of
Congress investigated him on charges of financial corruption in
1792-93.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen, including the first speaker of the House,
Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, confronted Hamilton in his
Treasury office to ask about his dealings with a convicted swindler
named James Reynolds. Reynolds said Hamilton had given him Treasury
money to play the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton admitted giving money to Reynolds, but said the money
was his own and had been given for a different purpose. Hamilton
said he had committed adultery with Reynolds' wife, Maria, and had
paid Reynolds to hush up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, one of the framers of the Constitution, ``confessed to
a tawdry extramarital love affair to exculpate himself from the
charge of colluding with speculators,'' said Jeffrey Pasley, a
historian at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows the Founding Fathers' concern with public honor.
For, as Gail Collins writes in ``Scorpion Tongues,'' a history of
political gossip (William Morrow, 1998), ``Hamilton tried to acquit
himself of charges of corruption by proving that he was an
adulterer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamilton,'' she wrote, ``told his story privately to a
delegation of congressmen, going into far more detail than the
startled legislators said they required.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum released on Friday, President Clinton's lawyers
asserted, ``The members of Congress who heard Hamilton's confession
concluded that the matter was private, not public; that as a result
no impeachable offense had occurred, and that the entire matter
should remain secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Jefferson and Madison learned of the affair, but
kept silent. Thus, Clinton's lawyers say, ``It is apparent from the
Hamilton case that the framers did not regard private sexual
misconduct as creating an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the affair came back to haunt Hamilton, just as Monica
Lewinsky haunts Clinton. In 1797, a journalistic purveyor of
political dirt, James T. Callender, published a pamphlet repeating
the charge that Hamilton had skimmed money from the Treasury to
engage in speculative ventures with Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton published a lengthy rebuttal, describing his
``irregular and indelicate amour'' in lurid detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charge against me is a connection with one James Reynolds
for purposes of improper pecuniary speculation,'' Hamilton wrote.
``My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Hamilton's case suggests several differences
from the impeachment debate surrounding Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton's public apologies for an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and his defense against possible impeachment proceedings
do not completely echo Hamilton's admission that he was a
philanderer, not a crook.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in an interview, Pasley said that the lawmakers who
investigated Hamilton ``did not consider his case as setting a
standard or precedent for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, Hamilton readily confessed his sexual misconduct to
members of Congress and then revealed it to the world in a lengthy
pamphlet, while Clinton's account has been slowly extracted by
federal investigators relentlessly pursuing evidence of his
indiscretions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1797, as in 1998, juicy accusations against a public official
were often leaked to the press. Hamilton was a leader of the
Federalist Party. Callender apparently got his information from
John Beckley, the first clerk of the House of Representatives, who
had been dismissed from his position after Federalists won control
of the House in 1796.

EXCERPTS FROM TESTIMONY ABOUT LEWINSKY AND HER SEARCH FOR A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his report to the House, Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, cited ``substantial and credible information
that President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice'' by helping
Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job while she was a potential witness in the
Jones case. Starr's office questioned several witnesses on those
points over months of Grand Jury proceedings. Here are excerpts
from the testimony of some of the witnesses, some made public Sept
21, some Friday by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PODESTA, deputy chief of staff, before the Grand Jury, Feb.
5, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Do you recall any conversations, or do you recall ever
having conversations with anyone about Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: All right. And with whom, as best you recollect, were those
conversations with?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I initially had a conversation which I can't place
precisely, but I would say late in the spring or early in the
summer, initially with Mr. Bowles. ... Mr. Bowles said to me that
in conversation he had with the president that Ms. Lewinsky's name
had come up. That she was a friend of Ms. Currie's, that she had
worked at the White House, and that she _ Ms. Currie had been in
touch with her _ well, I'm forwarding to it _ I think that was a
subsequent conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K.
</P>
<P>
   A.: That she was a friend of Ms. Currie's, that she had worked
in the White House, that she had been sent over to work in the
Pentagon. That she was unhappy that had happened, and thought that
she hadn't been treated fairly in that job move. And that could he
look into it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Could you tell us, was there a subsequent _ some subsequent
activity in the fall of _ approximately in the fall of 1997 that
related to Ms. or Miss Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And can you explain to the grand jury what that involved?
</P>
<P>
   A.: This time Ms. Currie approached me directly, and _ and had a
conversation with me. And reminded me who Ms. Lewinsky was. That
she was her friend from the Pentagon. And told me that she was
moving to New York. ... And asked me whether I could give her any
referrals of any people she could talk to about getting a job in
New York. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you do something?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I did something.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K. And what was that?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Shortly after that conversation _ so I would place that
conversation in early October _ the president took a trip to South
America. I was running that trip _ if you will _ as the traveling
chief of staff on the trip. And during the course of that trip, I
talked to Ambassador Richardson, from the U.N. ... But in the
context of talking to Ambassador Richardson, who also I have known
for a while and is a friend of mine, I raised the fact that Ms.
Currie had a friend who was moving to New York, who was a
low-level, entry-level public affairs person, and did he _ could he
take a look at her.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM RICHARDSON, U.N. ambassador, before the Grand Jury on
April 30, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What is the first time that you learned about someone that
you later learned, or at the time learned, was Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Well, I believe that the first time this matter came up was
in one of the meetings at the White House, or somewhere in the
vicinity of where we have our meetings in the White House. John
Podesta, who is the deputy press secretary, asked me if I would
interview a person that was a friend of Betty Currie's for a
position in New York, because the person, according to John, was
moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time. I believe it was early October. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And what, as best you can recall, did he tell you?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think words were, ``There's a person I'd like you to
interview for a position in New York; this person is moving there,
and she's a friend of Betty Currie's.'' And I said, ``Well, what's
her name?'' He says, ``I don't know, but I'd appreciate if you
would just interview her.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you take _ did you interpret whatever words Mr. Podesta
used with you as a recommendation?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No. I interpreted it simply as a courtesy request for an
interview, which I get all the time from many people. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Have you had any communication at any time, up to the
present, with Mr. Jordan either directly or indirectly about
anything related to Monica Lewinsky, the job hunt, the Paula Jones
case, or any of that?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Have you had any communication up to the present, directly
or indirectly, with the president _
</P>
<P>
   A.: No, none whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: _ about any of those topics?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The president and I have never discussed Monica Lewinsky or
Paula Jones. Never.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Or the fact that you were involved in offering her a job and
interviewing her?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No. We have not discussed it whatsoever.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BETTY CURRIE, the president's secretary, before the Grand Jury
on May 6, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: You remember talking to Monica about getting a job in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And Vernon Jordan was aware of that, and Vernon Jordan
helped her.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And the president was aware that Monica was looking for a
job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I think so. I'm not positive, not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K. Are you saying you didn't talk to the president about
Monica looking for a job in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember. I probably did. I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q .: Didn't the president ask you to help Monica?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Get a job?
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: In New York?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember. I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: After Monica was rejected in terms of coming back to the
White House, didn't the president ask you to help Monica with her
further job search, wherever it would be?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Probably more like that, wherever I could find to help her.
And if I remember correctly, that's when I went to John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Didn't the president suggest that you go to Mr. Podesta?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember that. John's an old friend of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: I know. You used to work for him many years ago. Didn't the
president also suggest Ambassador Richardson, too? That you should
contact Ambassador Richardson?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember him saying that either.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Well, didn't the president suggest that _ go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A.: The best I remember is that I went to John and told him I
needed help finding a job for a friend. He has connections all
over, and the best I remember, he made the connection with
Ambassador Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did the president tell you to contact Vernon Jordan to help
Monica get the job? Get a job in New York?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't remember the President telling me to contact Vernon
to help get a job, help Monica get a job.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What did the president tell you about getting help for
Monica?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was doing it on my own. I was dealing with John and
Ambassador Richardson, which I thought was moving along fine and
that was going to work out fine. And then when she said she didn't
want that, then I went to Vernon, who has contacts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Were you keeping the president apprised of what you were
doing?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I may have been telling him that I'm doing this or the
other, but it was not a daily update. Plus, I wasn't working on it
daily.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   May 14, 1998
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: This is the third question. Do you know of anyone who
ever received, in your lifetime, the number of favorable supports
in seeking employment through people like Vernon Jordan, the
president, several other people in the White House and yourself
included, as one of those important people?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS:. In my lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Yes, ma'am.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS:. That's a long time. Let me think.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard people tell me that when _ they say that you've
approached Vernon for a job. I say, ``Yes.'' They say, ``Do you
know,'' the list goes on and on, the people who have approached
Vernon for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Monica did was just minor.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable? I've tried to help many people with jobs. I don't
know how far you think I've gone to help them. I haven't had the
president's backing on it, so I couldn't go as far as I would like
to.
</P>
<P>
   BY MR. EMMICK:
</P>
<P>
   Q.: I think his question is more the number and the high level
of the people. That is to say, the president, Podesta, Erskine
Bowles, Vernon Jordan, Richardson, yourself, all pulling together
to get Monica Lewinsky a job. Who else has had that kind of an
effort for them that you're aware of?
</P>
<P>
   A.: And Marsha Scott.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: And Marsha Scott.
</P>
<P>
   MR. WISENBERG: Marsha Scott.
</P>
<P>
   BY MR. EMMICK:
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Who else has had that kind of an effort?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I can't think of anyone; but, unfortunately, I think part of
it is that I consider these high-level people as being my friends.
And their level of importance didn't occur to me. They were just
friends who were helping a friend.
</P>
<P>
   VERNON E. JORDAN JR., the president's friend, before the Grand
Jury on March 3, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: So first of all, when is the first time that you recall
hearing anything about Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes. The first time I ever heard the name Monica Lewinsky is
when Ms. Betty Currie called me about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And can you give us a rough time frame of when that was?
</P>
<P>
   A.: It was early December, I believe. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And where were you, what did she call and say?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I was in my office. Betty Currie called, and she said: ``Mr.
Jordan, there's a former White House intern, her name is Monica
Lewinsky, and she would like and I am requesting your help in
finding her a job in New York. She would like to work in the
private sector, and would you be helpful?'' And I said, ``I'm happy
to be helpful.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Now, did Betty Currie indicate at all in that conversation
that the request was being made on behalf of anyone other than
herself or Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: She did not. ...
</P>
<P>
   March 5, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did Betty Currie in any way, any way whatsoever, connect Ms.
Lewinsky's signing of the affidavit to her job search?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did anyone ever tell you that something to the effect that
Monica had said, ``I'm not signing any affidavit until I get a
job''?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   ... &QC;  Q.: You learned from _ believe you said Ms. Lewinsky some
time between Jan. 8th and Jan. 15th that she had in fact been hired
by Revlon. Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you communicate that either directly or indirectly to
the president?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I told the president that she had a job. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And would it have been some time shortly after you learned
that from Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't think I put the phone down and then picked it up,
but at some point, I informed the president that my magic had
worked, that she had a job.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: It would have been, though, within a day or so of learning?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And what was the president's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The president was grateful; he said thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: When you had that discussion with him, did he say anything
else about Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: When you had that discussion with him, did you speak about
any other topics with him? Other than just like greetings?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I have never had a conversation with the president where the
subject of Monica Lewinsky was the only subject.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And do you understand that the reason we're doing this whole
line of inquiry is to figure out where you were on Nov. 5th and
whether you could have interviewed Monica Lewinsky that day?
</P>
<P>
   A.: That is obvious to me. I obviously, if this is correct, was
not in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And then based upon the fact that the White House records
show that you met with the president at 2:00 on Nov. 5th, and
coupled with the other documents that we've just shown you, do you
believe that you could have met with Monica Lewinsky on Nov. 5th
here in Washington, D.C.?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I have no recollection of having met with Monica Lewinsky on
Nov. 5th, and unfortunately my calendar does not show that. I have
absolutely no recollection of that.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And let me ask you my question again: Do you believe that
you could have met with her?
</P>
<P>
   A.: It is entirely possible. I have no recollection of it.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Is it your testimony, sir, that in light of that experience,
that the fact that you were helping Monica get a job and then you
later learned that she was a witness in a case involving the
president, that that later addition of information _ that she was a
witness in a case against the president _ had no bearing whatsoever
on your attitude of how you perceived your being involved in
helping her get a job?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yeah. The Webb Hubbell circumstance and the Monica Lewinsky
circumstance are not comparable, No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, make whatever judgment you want to make about my effort
to help my friend Webb Hubbell, it had absolutely nothing to do
with a conversation that I may have had with Ambassador Richardson,
who was ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: O.K. My question, sir, once again is: Is it your testimony,
sir _ and let's not focus on Ambassador Richardson. Let's focus on
you.
</P>
<P>
   A.: O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: My question, sir, is: After having gone through what you
were put through in the Webb Hubbell situation, is it your
testimony, sir, that the fact that making calls to, among others,
Revlon to help Monica Lewinsky get a job, you later learned that
she was a witness in a case against the president: that that
additional fact had absolutely no bearing on how you viewed and
felt about your being involved trying to get her a job?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And then is that the reason why it did not occur to you to
notify Ambassador Richardson of the fact that you later learned _
after knowing he was also helping her get a job _ that she was a
witness in a case involving the president?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I am Ambassador Richardson's friend. I'm not his lawyer, No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, I made _ it never occurred to me to have this
conversation with Ambassador Richardson based on the experience
that I had had with Webb Hubbell and Revlon. Zero.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONICA LEWINSKY, before the Grand Jury on Aug. 20, 1998
</P>
<P>
   JUROR: Could I ask one? Monica, is there anything that you would
like to add to your prior testimony, either today or the last time
you were here, or anything that you think needs to be amplified on
or clarified? I just want to give you the fullest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A.: I would. I think because of the public nature of how this
investigation has been and what the charges aired, that I would
just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie, and I was never
promised a job for my silence.
</P>
<P>
   And that I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for everything that's
happened. [The witness begins to cry.) And I hate Linda Tripp.

JETS HOPE TO MOVE RIVALRY WITH DOLPHINS INTO NEW PHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a Jets-Dolphins clash with fascinating elements that can
become part of their eclectic history: the mud bowl for the 1982
conference title, the faked spike that began a downward spiral for
the Jets, the almost-1,000-yard passing duel between Ken O'Brien
and Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a division game and because these are teams whose
franchises have been defined by glamour quarterbacks, Joe Namath
and Marino, their meetings are never ordinary. So, although
Sunay's 1 p.m. confrontation at the Meadowlands is merely Game 4
for both clubs, it has become a statement game for the Jets and a
testing of Super Bowl aspirations for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets, this game is a chance to bring them up to .500
after an 0-2 start. If they win, their 2-2 mark will be better than
last year's similar start because the 1998 ledger would include a
pair of division victories.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dolphins? Well, this is Year 3 of the Jimmy Johnson
regime, and he has had success quickly wherever he has been _ at
the University of Miami, which captured a national title in 1987,
and in Dallas, where the Cowboys won Super Bowls in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This matchup has all the earmarks of a statement game for the
Jets, even though coach Bill Parcells contends it's too early to
call it that.
</P>
<P>
   Statement games are the ones that tell whether a team is ready
for the next step. Usually, they also come at a point in the season
when fortunes can change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the 1994 debacle with Miami that left the Jets'
franchise in ruins? Marino faking the spike, freezing the rookie
cornerback Aaron Glenn, then tossing the winning touchdown over his
head to Mark Ingram? Only eight Jets remain from that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even think of those days anymore,'' running back
Richie Anderson said. ``Look at Fred Baxter,'' he said, pointing to
the tight end. ``He's one of the guys who are left from '94, and
I'm sure he doesn't even remember those days. Johnson wasn't there
in '94 and Parcells wasn't there in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   But the facts remain: after that loss to Miami, the Jets went
into 4-33 slide that ended only when Parcells took over last year.
On the other hand, Marino hasn't lost to the Jets from that moment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a grid myth has evolved about the main
protagonists: Marino always beats the Jets. Like most myths, it
contains a kernel of truth preceded by a lot of baloney.
</P>
<P>
   During his glory years, when Marino reached (and lost) his only
Super Bowl, he and the Dolphins had their hands full with the Jets.
Entering the 1994 season, for example, Marino's won-lost record
over the Jets was merely 10-9. Since then, it has swelled to 17-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we different, are they different?'' linebacker Mo Lewis
asked. ``Sure, look at the teams. The Jets and Dolphins are two
different teams compared to 1994. They were a Dan Marino passing
team then. Now they've still got Marino, but it's a Jimmy Johnson
team. And we're a Bill Parcells-coached team now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Parcells' Giants played the Dolphins only once, and
lost. At New England, Parcells' Patriots were 4-4. The Jets lost
their two games against Miami last season, giving Parcells-coached
teams a 4-7 record against the Dolphins. Meanwhile, the
Johnson-coached Dolphins are 4-0 over the Jets. Including the
Cowboy years, his overall record against the Jets is 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Johnson is one coach Parcells respects. Parcells is
also wary of the talent Johnson has assembled on the Dolphins;
their conference-best defense; their quarterback who, Parcells
believes, can still throw better than most. He has asked his
players to deliver a peak performance for the second game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Just two Sundays ago, the Jets were 0-2. Although they were
facing a struggling Colts team, the Jets' season would have crashed
with a loss. Parcells whipped them through practice that week and
stressed not only the significance of a victory, but also the
position it would put them in for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   His intensity has worked on them this past week. The Jets'
workouts were so good, said the coach, that he had to cut back. He
didn't want to get them at a fever pitch too early. On Thursday, he
shortened practice.
</P>
<P>
   No, Parcells said, he wasn't concerned about motivating players
for two must games in a row. After all, these are the Dolphins they
are facing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation helps; the players understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Marino remains in control for the Dolphins, new Jets are
trying to start their own tradition. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde
gets a second straight start.
</P>
<P>
   And Keyshawn Johnson, the Jets' wide receiver, is trying to
create his own legend against Miami. In four games against them he
has snared 19 passes, with 2 touchdowns, for 263 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' cornerback Sam Madison, a second-year player, has
already made their matchup personal. Johnson, Madison said,
``thinks he's the world's best football player. He thinks he's
better than Jerry Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said: ``I don't even remember playing against him. I'm
shaking. I'm scared of Sam Madison.''
</P>
<P>
   The talking is louder and trashier these days. The intensity is
the same. &QL;

50 YEARS AS EYE OF NEW ORLEANS' STORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (js) 
 By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ After ravaging the Caribbean and Florida last
weekend, Hurricane Georges raged through the Gulf of Mexico and
lumbered toward New Orleans. There, local television meteorologists
stood in front of computerized screens and grimly echoed the
National Hurricane Center's official forecast, that New Orleans
would be the hurricane's next ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   But on WWL-TV, an 80-year-old weatherman gripped a black marker
pen, pointed to his plastic weather board and calmly assured
viewers that the hurricane would veer off toward Biloxi, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Nash Charles Roberts Jr. was right.
</P>
<P>
   And like similar predictions in the last 50 years, this one came
hours before the competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as most New Orleansians can remember, getting a bead
on the storms that regularly threaten life and livelihood here
comes down to one simple phrase: ``What's Nash say?''
</P>
<P>
   A private meteorological consultant for oil companies in the
gulf, Roberts began a side job as the region's first regular
television weather forecaster in 1949. He stopped broadcasting
daily in 1984 and continues his private business. But he comes out
of retirement if he thinks a storm is threatening this vulnerable
Gulf Coast city, where June through November is hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see it as a menace, I call the news director and say,
`It's time for me to go on,' '' he said. ``Then they dust me off
and drag me out of the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually they drag the television cameras into Roberts' office
in an old-fashioned, two-story wooden building in the French
Quarter and set up in front of his plastic weather board. The
station trades in its chief meteorologist, Carl Arredondo, and his
Doppler computer for Roberts and his fistful of ink markers and 50
years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the public sees me come on, they know it's serious,''
Roberts said. ``I'm not doing entertainment. When there are people
evacuating or not based on what you say, it's serious business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a crisp white shirt and red suspenders, Roberts looks
and speaks like a Southern gentleman as he leans back in his office
chair. His gentle demeanor and slow drawl have calmed nervous
viewers for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other weathermen may not want to admit it, but they all
turn to him,'' Arredondo said. ``They all grew up with Nash. He's a
legend in this area.'' Locals know a storm is serious simply when
Roberts appears on the screen. ``They see me in the store buying my
mark-up pens and they follow me around asking when the storm's
hitting,'' said Roberts, whose successful predictions, he said,
come from treating each storm individually and keying in on the
factors and the environment that await it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like a detective tracking someone,'' he said. ``You
never know their next move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roberts said Hurricane Georges tipped its hand when the
high-pressure system steering it stopped and the storm headed east.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes refers to computers as ``newfangled gimmicks,'' but
Roberts insists he consults the same reports and computer printouts
sent to other stations. He also uses data from the oil rigs in the
gulf, his private clients. With compasses and protractors, he
calculates wind directions and plots each storm's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get the same information, but it's what you do with it
that makes the difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleansians discuss and watch forecasters' predictions like
racetrack bettors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here, you check out all the channels and then you turn on
Nash to hear the real deal,'' said Michael Armstrong, a waiter at
the Hotel Richelieu in the French Quarter. ``If Nash says it's
gonna hit, you better git.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is often criticized by other meteorologists for
deviating from National Weather Service reports, which he refers to
derisively as ``the house thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some weathermen get unhappy because I don't always follow the
federal line, but if I have evidence to the contrary it'd be
criminal not to give it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring the hurricane, Roberts spent last weekend working
around the clock for several days, as is his usual practice. While
his assistants traded off in eight-hour shifts, he would steal a
few hours sleep in a sleeping bag. As for how much longer he can
continue this regimen, that is not within a mortal's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts glances upward. ``I'm not going to get onto someone
else's territory.''

   EMBASSIES-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ As we race into the next century
of faxes, e-mail and instant worldwide newscasting, America's
diplomatic system is still grounded in the horse-and-buggy era. The
terrorist bombings of two remote U.S. embassies in East Africa
offers a reminder that the United States has a visible and often
vulnerable presence in almost every nation, at a cost of more than
$2 billion a year. Many of these outposts date from the Cold War
era, when the United States was fighting a propaganda war for the
hearts and minds of even the tiniest nation. But is that necessary
now? After budget cuts, the U.S. State Department has made some
reductions, but U.S. domestic agencies have created more and more
overseas postings. Some experts, including government auditors, are
looking for ways to reshape the embassy system. Among the ideas:
setting up regional embassies to serve several countries, hiring
private contractors to gather information normally collected by
diplomats, and far greater use of high tech communications.

were a whirlwind of giant leaps _ it went from its first manned
flight to stepping on the moon in just eight years _ the second
half of the agency's life has mostly been a comfortable routine of
workmanlike space shuttle missions. That's about to change. NASA
has big plans. It's mulling a new breed of spaceship, with the
emphasis on utility and cost-effectiveness. In the works: reusable
rockets that operate at a fraction of the cost, can take off in the

bowlegged. It's fitting for this former Marine and Vietnam veteran
who fancies himself a cowboy, not just because he owns and rides
horses but also because he believes in honor and the code of the
West and protecting the defenseless. Although he refuses to talk
about the case, the lead investigator for the Justice Department's
reopened probe into the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. is not sweating this latest high-profile assignment. As
the federal prosecutor assigned to win convictions against the Los
Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King, Kowalski is used to
performing under pressure. ``This is a lot less daunting,'' he
said, ``than whether the city is going to burn again. If we lost,
there would have been another riot. It made you need to win.'' A

   EVIDENCE _ Former FBI agent Donald Wilson has turned over to the

paper has a list that looks like a payment schedule next to such
words as ``hospital'' and ``Canada.'' It also says ``before 4-15''
at the bottom along with a word that could be ``Raul.'' King was
killed April 4. The other paper is the torn corner of a 1963 Dallas
phone book with a phone number at the top that a cross-directory
shows belonged to Jack Ruby and the Vegas Club. Clearly written
next to the phone number is the word ``Raul.'' Only a handful of
people have seen the two documents, which have never been
reporoduced in any publication. We have copies that will be shown

of the two documents and also shows the 1963 directory listing for
Ruby as well as a handwriting sample from Ray. (Atlanta

   GANG _ In what authorities warn is a growing menace, prison
gangs, fueled by racial and geographic animosities, are coming of
age in Austin and most other major Texas cities. In the past few
years, some prison gangs have begun recruiting members of youth
street gangs as soldiers in a growing crime network designed to
gain control of Texas' illegal drug markets. Their MO: murders,

SPENCER AND CONE TAKE TEXAS BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Tim Raines shouted for some attention,
shouted in such a shrill fashion that manager Joe Torre thought one
of his players had been injured during a clubhouse celebration. But
no one was hurt. Raines simply wanted everyone to listen to him as
he climbed on a wooden table and toasted a missing friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows we wanted to win this thing for Darryl
Strawberry,'' said Raines, clutching a bottle of champagne and
addressing his New York Yankees teammates. ``This one is for you D.
Strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees screeched in Strawberry's honor, barking his name
and showering Raines in beer and champagne. The Yankees had just
finished a draining evening with a 4-0 decision over the Texas
Rangers and a three-game sweep of the division series. But they had
Darryl on their minds and in their hearts. Disparate emotions will
continue dominating the Yankees as they pursue a World Series title
every day and pray for a teammate every hour. At least.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was scheduled to undergo surgery for colon cancer at
1 p.m. Saturday and the Yankees said they wanted him to go to sleep
Friday night knowing that the team had advanced to the American
League Championship Series. A rain delay of 3 hours 16 minutes may
have made that unlikely, but the victory was sufficient for the
Yankees and surely for Strawberry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do this for Darryl,'' said Joe Girardi. ``We
didn't want him to have to wait to see what happened until after
his surgery. So this was for Darryl. But we have a long way to go.
Darryl is going to be mad if we stop here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing the sticky champagne out of his matted hair, Tino
Martinez paused amid the boisterousness and added, ``Even now,
everybody on this team is thinking about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees had been emotionally wasted ever since
Strawberry was diagnosed with cancer on Thursday and were probably
relieved to celebrate fervently, in some ways, it was an awkward
scene. Less than 12 hours before Strawberry's surgery, the Yankees
were pulling bottles of champagne from a cooler and cans of beer
from three tubs and spraying the alcohol like 4-year-olds
discovering water pistols for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But were the histrionics necessary? Should the Yankees, a team
that was supposed to win anyway, have been more subdued because of
Strawberry's delicate situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they needed to let loose,'' said Torre. ``There's been
a lot of tension here. I just think they have a lot of stuff
inside. I think this was good therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis said no players thought of minimizing the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Darryl were here, he'd be celebrating with us,'' said
Davis. ``Even if he's not here, he wants us to celebrate. He gave
us the message today to go get them, to finish it off and to come
on back home. We did exactly that. We're celebrating not only
because we won, but also in his honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was referring to a 45-second videotaped message from
Strawberry, which the Yankees viewed before batting practice
Friday. Strawberry ended the message by pointing his finger at the
camera and declaring: ``Go get `em tonight, guys. Get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees obliged and then lauded Strawberry for motivating
them, something a team with 117 victories and a possible date with
destiny probably does not need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straw ordered us to win,'' Paul O'Neill reminded Raines.
</P>
<P>
   Raines smiled and responded, ``The man said take care of it and
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   When the clubhouse first opened to reporters, David Cone
hollered, ``It gets better every time, boys. The next round will be
even better,'' to start 30 minutes of drenching and dousing. Mike
Stanton scooped up a bottle of the Korbel and drily said, ``First
round, it's $8 a bottle. The second round, it'll be $12 a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Yankees were asked about Strawberry, the corks
were put back in the champagne and reality replaced rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much a family,'' said Derek Jeter. ``What he's
going through, everyone is going through. He's like a big brother
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said, ``It affected me as much as anyone. Darryl and I have
been together a long time. It shocked me. I didn't sleep well last
night. I don't imagine I'll sleep too well tonight either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said a group of players might try to visit Strawberry at
the hospital on Sunday if he can receive visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees maintained a locker for Strawberry at the Ballpark
in Arlington, with his uniform, gloves and cleats, despite knowing
that he would not be joining them anytime soon. O'Neill stood next
to Strawberry's locker early Saturday and spoke in reverent tones
about the teammate all the Yankees want to see healthy and back
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that message,'' said O'Neill. ``That kind of tugs at
your heart a little bit. This is a good friend of everybody's.
Obviously, the important thing is he gets this taken care of and
get on his road to recovery. Then he can be a part of celebrating
when this is all over. He's still a big part of this team.'' &QL;

QUOTAS ARE DROPPED FOR PARKING-TICKET WRITERS IN THE CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to years of public complaints, District
of Columbia officials have acknowledged that parking-enforcement
workers often felt that they had to rely on predatory, aggressive
measures to meet quotas for writing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve the image of the city and of its
employees, the Department of Public Works has announced a new
policy to develop what Cellerino Bernardino, the director of public
works, termed ``a more customer-focused work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, which took effect last month,
parking-ticket writers will no longer have to reach a quota, and
they will be required to improve the accuracy and legibility of the
tickets they write and to reduce response time in dealing with
questions about residential and commercial parking. They will also
take on the role of helping pedestrians and motorists with
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like the parking control aides to be ambassadors for the
city,'' Bernardino said. ``People should not have to fear the
parking situation in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed employees responsible for issuing parking tickets,
perennially the least popular public works employees in Washington,
had been expected to write 90 tickets each day during a six-hour
shift _ an average of one ticket every four minutes. The ticket
writers issued 2.1 million tickets last year, which resulted in $49
million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general perception of the public is that parking
tickets have been used just to generate revenue,'' Bernardino said.
``People thought we were trying to balance the budget by writing
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket writers will be required to complete a one-day customer
service training seminar, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions the fact that Washington has a parking problem.
About 750,000 cars are registered in the city and 850,000 more cars
are driven here by commuters each weekday, city officials say. But
with all this traffic, there are only 15,000 metered parking spaces
and no municipal parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the issues I have faced since my arrival here in
January, parking has been cited universally,'' Camille Barnett,
Washington's chief management officer, said in a statement. ``It is
an obvious problem in need of a solution, and I believe we are
taking the right steps to fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has also replaced old and vandalized parking meters
with high-tech, vandalproof models. The $24.9 million, seven-year
parking project is administered by Lockheed Martin IMS, which must
install, maintain and collect coins from 15,000 new meters.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin faces financial penalties if at least 97 percent
of the meters are not working properly at any given time. At the
end of the contract, the city will own the meters outright.
</P>
<P>
   The new digital meters will produce about $15 million of revenue
a year, officials predict.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new rules and parking meters, the Department
of Public Works is installing new traffic and parking signs to
replace those that are missing, faded or vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardino, the public works director, said he was confident
that the parking situation would improve. ``I know people won't
believe me, but a year from now people will have a much different
perspective on parking and parking enforcement in our city,'' he
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Dempsey, an actor who worked in theater, film
and television, died on Aug. 26 at his home in New York. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A versatile artist who took on a wide variety of roles, Dempsey
began his career in Toledo, Ohio, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to New York, he joined the Actors Studio and by the
1960s had won roles in ``The Deputy,'' ``Spofford'' and ``The
Love-Suicide at Schofield Barracks,'' among other plays.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Lincoln Center theater company under Jules
Irving, he appeared in ``A Cry of Players,'' ``King Lear'' and
``The Crucible.'' He also worked with the Yale Repertory Theater
under Robert Brustein's direction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Dempsey played Dr. Van Helsing in ``Dracula'' opposite
Frank Langella in the title role, winning a Drama Desk award for
his performance. He also appeared in ``Trelawney of the Wells''
with Meryl Streep, Mandy Patinkin and John Lithgow, in ``The
Threepenny Opera'' with Raul Julia and in ``The Mystery of Edwin
Drood'' with Betty Buckley, Cleo Laine and George Rose.
</P>
<P>
   His film credits include ``Network,'' ``Brewster's Millions''
and ``Tune in Tomorrow.'' Television viewers saw him in productions
including ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' and ``The Kennedys of
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Joan Devers of Sylvania, Ohio.

MALAYSIA'S TRIUMPH ECLIPSED BY CRISIS AND FEUDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad was notable as a man with a bold vision: a
physical and social transformation that would push this nation into
the forefront of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It almost came true.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is a medical
doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the
world's fastest rates of growth.
</P>
<P>
   He drove Malaysians to be more productive, to embrace high
technology and to begin major investments around the world. He
created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the
country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved
living standards and a new sense of Malaysian identity and pride.
</P>
<P>
   This year was to have been Mahathir's year of triumph, perhaps
paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration of huge
public works projects and impressive gatherings of foreign leaders
and sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia is on Asia's
critical list, its economy teetering on the edge of disaster and
its stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely
avoidable political cat fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir
apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption and illegal
sex acts. The move set off street demonstrations and aroused
international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends
in foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the region's most stable and prosperous nations is
suddenly in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that as in Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South
Korea, the pressures of economic collapse have spawned a political
crisis. In all those nations, the result was a change in
leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is far from clear. Unlike in Indonesia, there has
been little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. The
ouster of former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted
by many people. Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption
here.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia is not familiar with political demonstrations. Unlike
Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled
and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and the riot
police on the streets in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is unprecedented,'' said Ambassador John
Malott of the United States. ``This has never happened in Malaysia,
and nobody knows where it's going to go. You can write a lot of
scenarios but we are in totally uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, the confident nation-builder, seems to be flailing as
he watches his legacy crumble. An economy that had been growing at
more than 8 percent a year for the last decade is now headed for a
contraction of perhaps 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off from international
financial markets one month ago, turning his back on the foreign
investors whom he once embraced and who had fueled the country's
rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   The move had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian
currency, insulating it from the speculators Mahathir blames for
the crisis, and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of
questioning of the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary
Fund. But few foreign economists expect it to work for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahathir is attacking the fundamental beliefs of the free
market, of capitalism, of Wall Street,'' a foreign diplomat said.
``We are either watching economic theory being rewritten or
reconfirmed _ and I don't think it's being rewritten.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set off the
most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar, the
man he had been grooming to be his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Anwar was arrested at his home and held
incommunicado for 10 days, during which he says he was beaten by
his jailers. Last week he was charged with 10 counts of corruption
and sexual misconduct that could result in a prison term of up to
34 years.
</P>
<P>
   The harshness of those moves unleashed a surge of largely
unsuspected discontent that mobilized Anwar's motley fellow
constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals and
politically assertive Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, Malaysians by the thousands
demonstrated in the streets and in mosques and were met with tear
gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten and hundreds were
detained, although most were later released.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement,
the fear expressed by one Western diplomat is of a ``downward
spiral'' in which ``suppression breeds more discontent breeds more
suppression breeds more discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now be numbered.
But few venture a guess at what the number might be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus
or leadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm
as Anwar's trial proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   But he has struck a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation,
to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard to build under the
slogan ``Malaysia Can!''
</P>
<P>
   In this generally decorous nation, the depth of anger expressed
by two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing
to hear. Anwar, says the prime minister, is ``despicable'' and ``a
sodomist.'' Mahathir, says his former deputy, is ``senile'' and
``insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysians, who have stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian
rule with a mixture of gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned.

NEW POSTAL TRUCKS CAN RUN ON ETHANOL, BUT PROBABLY WON'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Ind.)   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six years ago, with smoke from the burning oil
wells of Kuwait barely cleared, Congress ordered the federal
government to help wean America from gasoline, and decided that by
1998, half of all new government vehicles should be able to run on
an alternative fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service announced last month that to comply, it would
buy 10,000 new delivery trucks that can run on ethanol or gasoline,
and that the first would be delivered for use in the New York City
region.
</P>
<P>
   But while the vehicles can use ethanol, Postal Service officials
say, they probably will not. That is because the nearest public
ethanol station is in Indianapolis. In fact, there are only about
40 stations in the whole country that sell ethanol, according to
vehicle manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethanol-capable vehicles will be all over,'' said a Postal
Service spokeswoman, Sandra Harding. She said the vehicles would be
sent wherever new trucks were needed, regardless of what fuels were
available. ``If they don't have ethanol available in certain areas,
then the automobile will just run on gasoline,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the new postal vehicles, modified Ford Explorers
with their steering wheels on the right so that letter carriers can
easily reach mailboxes, will begin arriving in May. In New Jersey,
Newark will get 100; Paterson, 53; Lakewood, 73, and Bellmawr, 50.
Hicksville, N.Y., on Long Island, will get 84.
</P>
<P>
   State officials in New Jersey and New York said they knew of no
public fueling site within their borders that sold ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who have been urging the use of alternative
fuels for years as a way to reduce dependence on oil and to lower
auto emissions, are not happy about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absurdity, an irrationality, having these vehicles
and not having fuel for them,'' said Nevin Cohen, the director of
research at Inform, a nonprofit environmental research group based
in New York. The federal government, he said, had tried to be
``fuel-neutral,'' meaning that it backed a variety of alternatives
to gasoline without choosing one over the others. But, he said,
``This isn't fuel-neutral; it's fuel-nutty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Natural gas would have made more sense,'' said Cohen, who
pointed out that United Parcel Service and other operators of large
fleets use natural gas vehicles in the New York region. The Postal
Service should send the new trucks to the Midwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Postal Service says that it runs 7,300 vehicles
nationwide that use alternative fuels, some of them natural gas,
but that some of those have to operate on gasoline because natural
gas is not available. And buying a truck that can use natural gas
(even if it does not) costs about $4,000 extra; buying one that can
use ethanol (even if it does not) costs only about $200 extra.
</P>
<P>
   Some Postal Service vehicles get their fuel from public gas
pumps, but major post offices often have their own pumps. The
Postal Service is resisting the idea that it should have ethanol or
natural gas pumps for its own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be a part-time utility company or a part-time oil
company,'' said Wayne Corey, a vehicle maintenance manager with the
Postal Service. ``That's what those people are in business for.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the problem of meeting the 50 percent quota for
vehicles that run on alternative fuels _ the quota rose to 75
percent in fiscal year 1999, which began Oct. 1 _ the Postal
Service had acted reasonably, Corey said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he and others say, is that the continuing drop in
the price of gasoline, combined with corporate streamlining by oil
companies and others involved in the manufacture of vehicle fuels,
has hindered the development of the alternative fuel market.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas, while cheaper than gasoline, has been handicapped
by the need for expensive compressor stations and by the problem of
squeezing the tanks into cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol, which is widely used in ordinary gasoline at blends of
up to 10 percent, presents other problems. In places where it is
publicly available, it is commonly sold as E-85, a blend that is 15
percent unleaded gasoline, but it costs 10 cents to 15 cents a
gallon more than regular unleaded gasoline, even with various tax
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler have adapted some of their vehicles for
ethanol, because they get credits for doing so under the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy law, as if their vehicles got better gas
mileage. But it is likely that many of those vehicles will never
see a drop of ethanol, either.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol's environmental and energy benefits are harder to
demonstrate than those of natural gas, although the fuel is popular
in Congress as a way to subsidize farmers, who grow the corn that
is one of its main ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Corey pointed out that bringing in the ethanol-capable vehicles
would improve air quality even if they never used ethanol, because
they are new and meet the latest emission standards. They are
replacing vehicles that are at least 10 years old, many of them
ancient Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   David Rodgers, director of the Energy Department's office of
technology utilization, said he was working with officials at the
Postal Service to ship the new trucks to places where ethanol is
available, even though the purchase contract with Ford specified
where they would be delivered. ``The groups that procure vehicles
are using systems they have had in place for 50 years,'' he said.
``The groups that are promoting alternative fuels are usually in
another part of the organization, and getting those groups to work
together is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Baca, manager of environmental policy at the Postal
Service, said that he was meeting with corn growers and ethanol
manufacturers to try to increase the supply of fuel, and that the
new vehicles, which will begin arriving in May, would be kept
together to make it easier to supply ethanol to them.
</P>
<P>
   When introducing a new fuel, Baca said, there has always been a
question about which would come first, the fuel or the vehicles
that use it. But he said he hoped the government's commitment to
the new trucks would encourage suppliers and other companies to try
alternative fuels, too. ``We are taking some risks,'' he said, ``in
hopes the rest of the country recognizes we all are better served
by clean air.''

 LILA KATZEN, 72, ABSTRACT SCULPTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lila Katzen, a sculptor whose abstract works have
adorned spaces from Fordham University's campus at Lincoln Center
to the U.S. Consulate in Hamburg, Germany, died Sept. 20 at Mount
Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Philip.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katzen was born and raised in Brooklyn. Early in life, when
she realized she wanted to be a painter, she began studying at the
Art Students League in Manhattan and later graduated from Cooper
Union. Ms. Katzen also studied with the abstract painter Hans
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   She began her career as a painter and as early as 1955 had a
solo exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art. A decade later she
began working with plastic, and in 1968 she created a multicolored
plastic floor with ribbons of black and gold for the Architectural
League of New York. In 1970, she made a series of light tunnels for
the Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil, and in 1988 she was the U.S.
representative to World Expo '88 in Brisbane, Australia, where she
exhibited a 20-foot-high sculpture of Cor-Ten steel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katzen's work is in the permanent collection of museums
across the country, including the National Gallery of Art, in
Washington, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and the Milwaukee
Art Center.
</P>
<P>

PADRES' LINEUP AND LOCALE MAY HINGE ON STADIUM VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It usually takes a precipitous change in the sunny
weather _ something, say, the magnitude of El Nino _ to shake the
relative calm of this sleepy Southern California city.
</P>
<P>
   But like people in much of the rest of the country right now,
San Diegans are excited about baseball again. And not just because
their Padres have a shot at reaching the World Series for the first
time since 1984, when they made their only appearance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a hotly contested referendum on the Nov. 3 ballot
to contend with, Proposition C. Yes, the Padres were set to play
host to the Houston Astros on Saturday night at a sold-out Qualcomm
Stadium, with the National League division series tied at one
apiece. But unless the measure for building a new ball park is
approved by voters next month, there is speculation _ at least in
the national news media _ that the Padres might be headed to
northern Virginia after next season. Team president Larry Lucchino,
who was recruited from the Orioles and who presided over the
building of Camden Yards, has strong ties in the area, after all.
</P>
<P>
   If so, San Diego will be without major league baseball for the
first time in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   And since the vote is expected to be close, Proposition C is all
that people seem to be talking about around here. That, and this
weekend's games with the Astros, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're free agents at the end of 1999,'' said the Padres'
principal owner, John Moores, who is generally credited with saving
the franchise since buying about 80 percent of the team during the
last players' strike. ``But our first preference is to stay in San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   Build it, or we will go. Sound familiar? The theme has been
played out in major league cities from coast to coast over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though. Moores is no Wayne Huizenga, who has
been vilified throughout the sport for dismantling his Florida
Marlins almost from the moment they won the World Series last fall.
Instead, Moores, who likes to make large contributions to local
universities, is considered something of a hero around San Diego.
After all, he bought the team from Tom Werner (whose ownership
group oversaw the fire sale of a talented squad in the early part
of this decade) and _ with Lucchino _ quickly turned it back
around.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Padres won the National League West in the final
weekend of the season. They won the NL West again this year, going
away, with a franchise-record 98 victories. In the process, the
Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 _ up nearly a million
and a half from three years ago _ in a stadium that was remodeled
exclusively for football purposes during all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in resuscitating the franchise, Moores says he has lost more
than $50 million in cash alone since buying the team for
approximately $80 million in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moores, who made his fortune in the computer software business,
said he will still try to sign his four high-profile free agents _
Kevin Brown, Wally Joyner, Ken Caminiti and Steve Finley _
regardless of whether a new ball park is approved. But Moores'
general manager did not sound so sure that was possible without
approval of the ballot proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked to any of our free agents yet,'' Kevin
Towers said in Houston earlier this week. ``They realize the
stadium issue is huge, or we would have started talking to them by
now. And I think the city of San Diego realizes that if we end up
having to stay at Qualcomm, will we be able to field a club with a
$50 million payroll every year? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is easy to draw parallels between this season's Padres
and last season's Marlins. But this is not the story of a franchise
built to win a World Series one year, then disassembled piece by
piece the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this ever getting that bad if the stadium doesn't
go through,'' Towers said. ``But it will certainly affect what we
do in the off season with our free agents and the potential free
agents that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' quest for a new ball park is actually closer to the
saga of the 1995 Seattle Mariners, who gained approval for a new
stadium, mostly by winning a lot of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will help sway the stadium vote,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But as Padres manager Bruce Bochy said: ``There's no
guarantee that having a winning season will get us a new ball park.
We just hope people realize we need a new ball park not just to be
competitive, but to be contenders, regardless of what happens in
the playoffs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an estimated $411 million proposal for a 26-block
redevelopment project in downtown San Diego, close to the city's
Gaslamp Quarter. If the measure is passed, the majority of the
money for the project would come from a hotel tax. The Padres would
have to come up with approximately $115 million, most of which
would likely be generated by naming rights to the stadium, as well
as potential licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, tourists and corporations would foot the bill.
So, it is fair to ask, what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there are plenty. First, many residents here were
angered at how the City Council approved a new lease for the
Chargers and funding the National Football League demanded for the
renovations of Qualcomm last year, essentially behind the voters'
backs. Moores then pointed out that the city might be sick of
ballot issues, thanks to the Qualcomm renovations, a recent measure
that approved funding an expansion of the city's convention center,
and some contentious City Council elections that followed
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there are questions about whether there will be
adequate parking and transportation downtown. (There are trolley
and train lines, however, and Qualcomm's parking situation has long
been a mess.) Some neighborhood groups have protested that they
have not been heard by the ball park's planners.
</P>
<P>
   And, because San Diego is basically a conservative town, there
is speculation that the vote may eventually be decided by how the
stock market stands on Election Day, and if the public fears that
it may have to foot the bill for some of the funding. After all,
tourism, long the city's staple, could decline as a result of a
protracted downturn on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moores said, ``I'm optimistic, but not overly
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the measure fails?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe surface in Virginia.

 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Murphy counts himself as one of the Downtown
Athletic Club's biggest fans, so he seemed a little embarrassed
that he was the only person shooting hoops in the cavernous indoor
basketball court before lunch one recent weekday.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe, he said, ``but when I first joined the
club, there was a waiting list and 4,000 members.''
</P>
<P>
   That was back in 1976, and since then the place itself has not
changed much. An odd combination of gentlemen's club and gymnasium,
it remains to this day one of the few spots in the city where a
member can play a fierce game of squash, simmer in the steam room,
take a cold plunge, shoot a round of billiards, eat a chicken pot
pie and cap it all off with a Scotch and cigar at what may be New
York's longest bar. (It is more than 70 feet long.)
</P>
<P>
   But fewer and fewer people seem interested in doing all these
things, at least under one roof. That helps explain how the
Downtown Athletic Club, home of college football's Heisman Trophy,
finds itself in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Membership is dwindling, to under 1,300. The building, at 19
West St. near the tip of lower Manhattan, is crumbling. And the
club's financial affairs are in utter disarray. (It is in
bankruptcy and owes the city more than $3 million in back taxes.)
</P>
<P>
   To pay off its back taxes without hocking the Heisman, the club
is trying to find a way to use its other asset, its building, which
dates to 1930.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of nasty disputes has broken out, pitting members
against a group of real estate developers who sought to buy and
renovate the building, and, most recently, against the city's
Landmarks Preservation Commission, which wants to preserve the Art
Deco exterior of the club's 35-story building. That desire may
stymie another developer's effort to upgrade the building and
rescue the club.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many New York battles, this one is over real estate. But
it is also a fight for the soul of an old-fashioned institution
that some people believe has outlived its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to work with them to allow the club and its heritage
to go forward, to bring the facility into the 21st century so it
could be enjoyed by a lot more people,'' said M. James Spitzer, the
lawyer for the real estate developers who tried to buy the club's
building and now hold the mortgage on it. But the members ``all
know each other _ the few that use it _ and don't want anyone else
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The members don't see it quite that way. ``Why shouldn't we keep
something that has made important contributions to the city for 50
years?'' asked William Dockery, who, as the club's new president,
is quarterbacking its latest effort to stave off oblivion. The
developers, Dockery contended, ``want to change the entire fabric
of the place, and make it like the Equinox or the Vertical, a
froufrou club with several thousand members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Froufrou'' is not a word anyone would use to describe the
Downtown Athletic Club. Masculine, yes. Impressive, perhaps. Empty,
often.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is a jazzy floor full of stationary bikes and
Stairmasters, where televisions are tuned to CNBC, music blares and
mirrors glare, just like at most health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But that floor seems almost jarringly out of place in a building
where time seems to have stopped decades ago. On the 18th floor is
a big boxing ring, where former heavyweight boxer Gerry Cooney
gives lessons some afternoons _ and where some of the plaster has
fallen from the high ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th floor is given over to an Olympic-size swimming pool,
with a balcony from which viewers can watch the slow strokes of the
half-dozen swimmers below.
</P>
<P>
   The top floors of the building, full of small rooms that members
and outsiders can rent by the day, week or month, are generous with
their harbor views but stingy with their bathrooms, which have
stall showers, just like college.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth floor, ``The locker rooms are kind of grubby, but
frankly, I don't care,'' said Byron Klapper, a bond-insurance
executive who has been a club member for almost 20 years. He boasts
that Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most famous felons in the
1980s, had the locker a few doors down.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth floor is the women's locker room, which can best be
described as pink. The club was one of the first of Manhattan's
men's clubs to admit women, which it did in the late 1970s. About
10 percent of the members are women.
</P>
<P>
   This early effort to increase membership had mixed results,
Murphy recalled. ``One hundred women joined _ but 75 old-timers,
the guys who like to smoke cigars and play dominoes, resigned,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, change has come hard for the club. Luigi D'Angelo,
who has worked there for 36 years, and now oversees the food
service, said that the members who eat there would be disappointed
if they could not get their corned beef and cabbage every
Wednesday, followed by corned beef hash every Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where else would the dining room include three billiard tables
at one end? What other place has anything like the Heisman Room, a
wood-paneled retreat covered with portraits of famous football
players?
</P>
<P>
   What other place has the fabled trophy, a bronze statue of a
football player stiff-arming his way to victory, which has been
awarded to the best college player in the country every year since
1935? And if the carpet in the lobby where the Heisman stands is a
little threadbare, so what?
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost all private clubs in cities across the country ran
into trouble in the early 1990s. ``When Congress took away the
club-dues tax deduction, that particularly hurt city clubs,'' said
Elizabeth Hart, a vice president of the National Club Association
in Washington. ``Instead of sending six executives to join a club,
companies might only send two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Downtown Athletic Club also faced special problems of its
own. Many of its members worked at stock brokerage firms and
investment banks that merged out of existence or moved uptown.
Shipping concerns started leaving lower Manhattan in favor of New
Jersey, and law firms dispersed all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, perhaps, New Yorkers' increasing interest in healthy
living also hurt the club. For one thing, a member who drinks a
three-martini lunch is far more profitable for the club than a
member who spends an hour playing pickup basketball.
</P>
<P>
   For another, spandex-clad single people have increasingly
preferred to go to clubs where they could meet other spandex-clad
single people, places like health clubs. These usually cost far
less that the athletic club's $1,800 annual membership.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the club's financial situation became
increasingly desperate. First the club fell behind on its real
estate taxes, then it had to pledge some of the revenues it gets
from the Heisman trophy to satisfy the bank that held its mortgage.
By the end of 1996, things were so dire that the club's accountants
expressed concern about whether it could stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the club's directors devised a plan to sell the
club's building to developers led by Richard Born, a well-known
hotelier who owns the Stanhope, and Steven Caspi, a Westchester
developer. The developers planned to renovate the building, operate
a hotel on the top floors, and lease space back to the club.
</P>
<P>
   But the club's members voted against the plan. The club's
lawyers say the deal was not good enough, financially. The
developers' lawyers say a new board of directors at the club tried
to scotch the deal because they feared losing control of their
private preserve.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the developers did not give up. They sued the club
to try to get it to go ahead with the deal. And last February, they
bought the club's mortgage from the Bank of New York, after the
club itself was unable to come up with the $5 million that the bank
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the club filed for bankruptcy protection, in part
over worries that the developers might foreclose on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all this, many club members have remained blissfully
unaware of the institution's peril. But others, like Dockery, were
galvanized. ``I didn't want to get involved _ I was happy working
on my hook shot,'' he said. ``But I saw the club headed down the
drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in May, Dockery and his fellow directors began trying to
clean up the club's rather chaotic accounting and operating
practices in the hope of finding a new deal that would provide
enough cash to pay off the city's $3 million tax lien.
</P>
<P>
   By August, they thought they had found it. Centaur Properties
tentatively agreed to lease the top floors of the building for
close to $1 million a year, and spend more than $12 million to turn
the dormlike rooms into suites that corporations could rent for
long-term stays. Centaur would also pay the club $7 million in cash
up front so that renters could use the club's athletic equipment;
that money would let the club pay the city and spruce up its
building.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, a snag arose. The city government
had been warning the club for some time that it planned to consider
designating the club's exterior a landmark; now, it proposed
holding a hearing on the matter in September.
</P>
<P>
   This did not go over well with Centaur, which complained that
such a designation would add at least $1 million to its costs and
untold time to its development plans. In particular, the developer
plans to punch holes in the exterior walls to put in air
conditioners; much of the building's Art Deco detailing occurs
under the windows, just where such holes would be likely to go.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Centaur plan goes forward, it is unclear whether the
developers who hold the mortgage would be satisfied. They could
declare the club in default if it does not meet certain financial
targets _ even if it makes all its payments on time.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery spent last week holding meetings with members to discuss
the plan to save their club. All seemed receptive, he said. He has
a lot of members rooting for him, including members like Robin
Segal, who comes down from Greenwich Village to exercise at the
club. ``My family has been members here for years,'' she said,
adding that this is a place her teen-aged children learned to love
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they pull it off,'' she said of the plan. ``It's a
shame _ there's so much tradition here.''

SERVING SANDWICHES LEADS TO CREW TRYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Buckley, a college all-American in sailing, sought out the
world of America's Cup yacht racing in a most circuitous way. Her
entree into the sport meant making sandwiches for the America True
crew, handing out team water bottles to sailors and arranging
tables for a promotional party. But the payoff has been handsome, a
chance this weekend to try out for the group's America's Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it even if I don't make the team,'' the 23-year-old
Buckley said about her self-paid trip to America True headquarters
in San Francisco. ``It's a fantastic thing to be around people who
really know how to do things well. I'm thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley is one of about 150 sailors who responded to a recent
public call for tryouts from Dawn Riley, a founder of the America
True yacht-racing syndicate. Of those, about 40 sailors _ 30 men
and 10 women _ were asked by the team to fly out to San Francisco
at their own expense. For Buckley, the trip from her home in Lake
Forest, Ill., is likely to cost as much as $700.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very high pressure deal,'' Riley said during a
telephone interview from San Francisco last week. ``You get
yourself out here, we'll be sailing with you for about four hours,
we'll interview you, and tell you to keep in touch. Then we'll send
you a letter when we make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is unique among America's Cup racing. Team members
are usually culled from the highest ranks of sailing. Crew members
are tapped at grand prix events internationally, and bidding wars
for the most elite sailors are common. But Riley sees value in
undervalued sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent pool has definitely diminished while at the same
time requirements for crew are exploding,'' she said. ``There is a
legitimate need out there to bring in new sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for fresh faces arises at a time when a record six
U.S. challenger teams are fishing from the same American pool of
experience. In most other cup years, the United States fielded only
defense teams, which drew two or three syndicates at the most.
</P>
<P>
   Riley gained her first foothold into America's Cup as the only
woman on Bill Koch's 1992 America3 team. She became involved again
in 1995 when the Koch group put out a public call for talent, and
received 650 resumes. In the end, 32 women were selected.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that she has about three or four slots to fill, but
she may be looking again in the spring. Interested sailors can
inquire on the team's web site: www.americatrue.org.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for Winds of Autumn
</P>
<P>
   Autumn is prime time for setting new sailing records. Indeed, a
top team of French and New Zealand ocean racers has been waiting
all summer for the fresh winds of fall. Their sights are set on a
nine-day trans-Atlantic passage established last July 7 by
Christophe Auguin of France. But at 147 feet, the new team's yacht
is more than twice as big as Auguin's 60-foot sailboat, and far
more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million carbon fiber yacht, Mari-Cha III, is owned by
Robert Miller, an American entrepreneur who lives in England. It is
being made ready for its oceanic voyage at Chelsea Pier in New York
City. The traditional route for Atlantic Ocean record attempts
begins at Sandy Hook, N.J., and ends at the Lizard, a point of rock
off southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stand by at Sandy Hook as soon as the weather begins
to look right,'' said Andre Luthy, first mate on Mari-Cha. ``At
this time of year, we shouldn't have to wait too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The current record, while unofficial because it wasn't properly
registered with the World Sailing Speed Record Council, stands at 9
days 22 hours 59 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boat-Show Season Bows In
</P>
<P>
   Fall also ushers in the annual boat-show season for power and
sail. Among the new designs likely to appear at one or more of the
numerous shows both east and west are the F-28 series of family
cruising trimarans built by Corsair Marine; the Predator 3000
Walkaround, a new 30-foot fishing catamaran with twin
225-horsepower engines produced by Cobra Sportfishing Boats; and
the Sou'wester 61, a new aft-cockpit, pilothouse version of the
Hinckley Company's classic Sou'wester 59 sailing sloop.
</P>
<P>
   Coming exhibitions on the East Coast include the United States
Sailboat Show Oct. 9-12 in Annapolis, Md., and the Long Island
In-Water Boat Show this weekend and next at Tobay Beach Marina near
Jones Beach. &QL;

 &HT;    Proof of conspiracy or just a hoax?
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two slips of paper are yellowing and brittle. They measure
3-by-4 inches. One is the ripped-out corner of a page from the 1963
Dallas telephone directory. The other has what look like dollar
amounts next to some words. Both appear to have the name ``Raul''
written on them.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI agent Donald Wilson announced in March that he had
removed the papers from James Earl Ray's abandoned car in Atlanta
30 years ago and kept them secret. Last month, he turned the
potential evidence over to the Justice Department, which has
reopened a limited investigation into the 1968 Memphis slaying of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal investigators are examining
the papers to determine their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The two slips of paper could be a significant development in the
assassinations of King and President Kennedy for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --This would be the first trace of the mysterious ``Raul.'' Ray,
who died in April while serving a 99-year sentence, recanted his
1969 guilty plea and insisted he had been set up by a smuggler he
knew only as ``Raul.'' Officials have maintained that Raul did not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   --The killings of King and Kennedy could be linked. A telephone
number at the top of one of the papers is the same as that of Jack
Ruby's Vegas Club. Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald, who was arrested
in Kennedy's assassination. Like Ray, Oswald claimed he had been
set up.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the papers fell out of Ray's 1965 white Ford Mustang
when he opened the passenger door, which was slightly jammed. The
papers were caught between the door and the frame and fell to the
ground. Thinking he had disturbed the crime scene, Wilson said he
panicked and stepped on the papers. He later put them in his pocket
when no one was looking.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he got home, Wilson said, that he realized what
he had found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI discounted Wilson's account this year, calling it a
fabrication. FBI officials also said Wilson was not on record as
one of the agents assigned to retrieve Ray's car from a housing
project parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, then a rookie agent, counters that he was asked to tag
along by a senior agent whose name he can't recall. He did not turn
in the papers sooner, Wilson said, because he didn't think he could
trust the FBI, which he considered a racist organization. He quit
the bureau after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he believes Ray had a passenger on the trip from
Memphis to Atlanta and that the papers probably belonged to that
person.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials will not discuss the case or give a
timetable for when a report may be issued.

 &HT;    Devestating effects of Hurricane Georges linger
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSS POINT, Miss. _ For Billie Poole, the moment came when her
7-year-old grandson called from his flood-ruined home and told her,
``Grandma, I don't have a single toy left.''
</P>
<P>
   For her husband, Alex, it came as he watched 23 years of
memories being hauled out the front door. The new carpet had turned
fishy brown; the hardwood floor lay buckled and jumbled in the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized that we're homeless,'' said Alex Poole,
56, whose brick home was filled by Hurricane Georges with three
feet of bayou water. ``We've got no place to stay of our own, and
that's a hard thought after living in a place for 23 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges, which slammed into the Gulf Coast last
Monday, hammering the area with rain, wind and floods, has long
since departed. But the effects remain _ visible not only in the
broken houses, ruined furniture and sand-covered roads, but in
lives that will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   From Mississippi to Florida, residents were measuring the
devastation, painting lines on garage posts and boathouse pilings
to show how high the waters had risen from the latest catastrophe
to roar ashore from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, the last storm to leave such an imprint was
Camille, which devastated the coast in 1969, killing hundreds. In
Alabama and Florida, the touchstones are Frederic in 1979, Opal in
1995 and Danny in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are part of life for coastal residents. Some accept
them, file insurance claims, rebuild and go about their lives
again.
</P>
<P>
   But for others, like the Pooles, the toll starts to mount. They
weigh the costs, the work, the financial hardship. Against these
they balance the joy of living near the ocean, of owning a boat, of
seeing suntanned children grow up catching fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised our three boys here and now they've grown up and
moved away,'' Billie Poole said. ``I send them pictures telling
them, `Here's the place that was your playground growing up.' But
this is hard. Maybe it's God telling us it's time to think about
moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   The glittering casinos of Biloxi and Gulfport heard no such
message.
</P>
<P>
   The towns that withered in the 1950s and 1960s have blossomed in
the '90s as the Las Vegas of the Gulf Coast. The waterfronts gleam
with high-rise hotels and gaudy casinos that draw streams of eager
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers can rest easy.
</P>
<P>
   Georges made landfall just to the east. The Gulf Coast's
gambling mecca was already bustling again by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles to the east, in Pascagoula, Georges struck with the
full force of its 110-mph winds. Gusts were reported as high as 172
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Pascagoula's skyline is dotted not with casinos, but with
cranes, silos and smokestacks. Prosperity here comes from weekly
paychecks, not from tourists dropping thousands on slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say Georges doesn't compare to Camille, which killed
hundreds with winds that topped 150 mph. But what Georges lacked in
wind, it made up for with a 10-foot storm surge and more than 10
inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Williams knows exactly how high the water rose. An
attorney with a gorgeous home looking onto Mississippi Sound, his
home is 13.5 feet above the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the line of flotsam and debris that shows how high the
water came ... ,'' said Williams, pointing to what resembles a
bathtub ring around his home's foundation. ``We were very
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles to the east, in a community called Orange Grove, Ira
Bang wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bang works at the Ingalls Shipyard, which dominates the
Pascagoula waterfront. He likes country living. Hunting dogs,
fishing boats and pick-ups with gun racks are as common here as
commuters are in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bang's mobile home lies down a rural road off U.S. 90 on the
banks of Bayou Cumbest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to get in there,'' he said late last week.
``I'm guessing it's all under water.''
</P>
<P>
   At a small cemetery a few miles from his home, floodwaters
opened dozens of graves. Caskets lay stranded like beached boats.
The grave of Bang's great-grandfather was untouched, but that was
small comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous about going back down to my house to see what's
left,'' he said. ``I've got $8,000 in insurance on my contents and
$8,000 on my structure, and that won't cover it if it's all ruined.
But we'll make it through.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of miles away, Gary and Darlene Tucker were less
optimistic. Their home is in a low-lying area, but it had never
flooded before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have flood insurance,'' said Darlene Tucker, as she
helped clean out her mother's nearby home, which also flooded.
``All my tables are upside down in my house and my couches are
floating. We've lived here 25 years and we never dreamed this could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's mother, Faye Floore, 67, has flood insurance on her
home, but her husband has none on the two rental homes and the
nearby catfish restaurant he owns. All were flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to ever get back to where you were,'' Floore
said. ``Not at this age.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles east, where the Dog River cuts inland from Mobile
Bay, Rufus and Emily Williams also faced a life-changing crisis
just when they wanted to enjoy their golden years.
</P>
<P>
   Georges pushed three feet of water into their home. They put
downstairs stuff up on counters and shelves, but the water came
higher than they ever imagined as Georges blew the waters of Mobile
Bay inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here 32 years and this is the highest we've seen,
higher than Camille,'' said Rufus Williams, a retired maintenance
supervisor. ``I had the doors sand-bagged and I thought we wouldn't
have to worry. But when we got in here, everything inside the house
was just floating.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had just paid the premium on his flood insurance and
can rebuild. But the future is clouded with uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what will happen now,'' he said. ``I'm not sure I
can ever feel comfortable in this house again.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles to the south, a secluded gem called Dauphin Island
is home to miles of single-family cottages.
</P>
<P>
   Georges devastated the narrow spit, washing tons of sand over
roads and sweeping more than a dozen houses off their stilts. They
lay helter-skelter in the aftermath, smashed by waves that carried
them inland like toys in a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert and Ulli Kastenhuber moved to the area to work for
DeGussa Chemical Corp., which is based in Hubert's native Germany
and has a plant in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to live in a suburb,'' Hubert Kastenhuber said.
``We said to ourselves that once in our lifetime we have a chance
to live right on the beach, so let's take that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had lived for more than a year in a neat, modern
cottage right on the Gulf. Last year Hurricane Danny shook them a
little, washing waves up near their house.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, however, picked the house up, washing it across the
road where it landed in a broken heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can serve you tea or coffee,'' Ulli Kastenhuber said,
opening a kitchen cabinet in which various glasses and foodstuffs
sat undisturbed. The rest of the house lay in ruins. The couple
picked through the debris, salvaging keepsakes and what furniture
they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even look over there,'' Ulli Kastenhuber said, nodding
toward the spot where the house once stood. ``I don't know if I
want to live on that same spot again. I'm too sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Mobile Bay in the resort towns of Gulf Shores and Orange
Beach, Ala., the damage fell far short of that on Dauphin Island.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were beachfront structures. Dozens of oceanfront
condominiums and hotels were left with sagging decks, broken
seawalls and crumbled parking lots. At least one sprawling condo
complex, the Marlin Key, was undermined so badly it cracked and
fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   In Pensacola and Navarre Beaches, a few dozen miles to the east,
in Florida, a few homes had foundations washed out or roofs ripped
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opal left three feet of sand in this house, and it left all
our belongings scattered across the island,'' said Frank Winn, an
attorney who owns two beachfront homes. ``We lost one of the roofs
in this one, but it doesn't compare. I was afraid we'd see the same
thing this time, but I was pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn said he won't move, even though he's been hit three times
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get my wife off this beach with a stick of
dynamite,'' he said. ``She loves it.

 &HT;    Countdown to liftoff begins for Glenn
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Columbus two weeks ago, the football frenzy that
envelopes fall Saturdays at Ohio State University broke momentarily
to let rabid Buckeyes unleash their appreciation for one of Ohio's
favorite sons (who is not an OSU alumnus).
</P>
<P>
   The marching band spelled out G-L-E-N-N across the field as Sen.
John Glenn and his wife, Annie, strode out. ``You had a standing
ovation by 90,000 people, that's pretty moving,'' Glenn said.
``That was heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's all heavy for Glenn: the emotion of leaving
behind 24 years in the U.S. Senate, the stream of requests for
appearances and autographs, and the thickening astronaut training
schedule that dictates how much time he spends on the other two.
</P>
<P>
   This week begins the last long training push toward liftoff,
with Glenn going to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., for a series of launch-site training sessions that include a
countdown test in which the crew members for the space shuttle
Discovery will practice their launch day routine, right down to
strapping into their shuttle seats. The launch is set for Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The training for Glenn, a temporary astronaut assigned for
specific scientific study and the lowest-ranking crew member, began
last February. He has split his time between space work and his
Senate duties, but steadily through the year the requirements for
NASA training have taken more and more of his days.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Glenn, 77, has spent more than 60 percent of his
time working at the Johnson Space Center in Houston on
crew-coordination skills and other shuttle requirements. And the
percentage has kept climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general terms, beginning Oct. 1 the crew dedicates 100
percent of their time to mission preparation,'' said Steve
Williams, who heads this flight's training program at Johnson Space
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The previous training focus on habitability in the shuttle,
wearing the launch suit and introductory science has given way to
the integration of those things into the cooperative duties of the
rest of the crew. In recent months they've spent time perfecting
crew coordination during such things as converting the shuttle's
interior into a laboratory, which begins moments after orbit is
achieved, and then stowing the science equipment for return to
earth, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   They also have begun training in high fidelity simulators that
use a wealth of computers to recreate every experience of being on
the shuttle, with the significant exception of weightlessness. Even
the windows are filled with monitors that display moving space and
earth scenes that are precisely what the astronauts will see.
</P>
<P>
   During those sessions, astronauts in the simulator communicate
with the same ground control that will work with them during the
flight. Using computers, the support team can create malfunctions
and other unscheduled problems to sharpen the crew's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   For Glenn's flight, the crew's longest stint in the simulators
was Sept. 16 when they spent 16 hours sealed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew goes into the simulator, and they're there for the
duration,'' Williams said. ``Not only are they practicing the big
events like a (satellite) rendezvous, but they're also going
through timeline activities which includes normal meal times and
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the lengthy simulator run, the crew goes in for
a debriefing to discuss the training session. Even with time
programmed for sleep inside the simulator, those days get long.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn, the geriatric astronaut, said neither long simulator
days nor physically challenging emergency exit procedures have
dulled his enthusiasm or made him doubt his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of our training so far, I think there hasn't been a
single time, in any of our egress training and things like that,
there hasn't been a single time that I haven't been able to perform
just like everybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then he added: ``The one area that I realize I'm not as
young as I used to be, and that is I wish I'd started flexibility
training about 20 years ago ... I found where some of the people
there are going through a hatch, for instance, bend over and go
through a hatch more easily than I do ... but I do it on my hands
and knees. And that's fine. It doesn't hold anybody else up.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, too, said Glenn is keeping pace, adding that although
the next four weeks will be busy, the essentials of preparing Glenn
to return to space has been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, from where we are... we're fine-tuning. The crew is
trained. They're ready to go. The senator is ready to go,''
Williams said. ``As a matter of fact, if for some reason they had
to launch tomorrow I think everybody would feel very comfortable
with their capabilities and the fact that they're trained.''

 &HT;    Reopening the King assassination case
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's casual Friday at the Justice Department, and
Barry Kowalski is wearing a white cotton shirt, patterned tie, blue
jeans and cowboy boots. As he walks to his office, it becomes
obvious he's somewhat bowlegged. It's fitting for this former
Marine who fancies himself a cowboy. Not just a horse lover, he
truly believes in honor and the code of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Although he refuses to talk about the case, the lead
investigator for the Justice Department's recently reopened probe
into the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. says he's
not cowed by this latest high-profile assignment. As the federal
prosecutor given the job of winning convictions in 1993 against
four Los Angeles police officers accused of denying Rodney King his
civil rights, Kowalski is used to performing under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot less daunting than whether a city is going to
burn again,'' he said. ``If we had lost, there would have been
another riot. It made you need to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He won. Although two officers were acquitted, the other two were
sentenced to 30 months in prison. Los Angeles didn't burn.
</P>
<P>
   Now he faces a different challenge. In August, Attorney General
Janet Reno opened a limited investigation into the Rev. King's
death and made it a civil rights issue by putting Kowalski in
charge. He is a special counsel for the criminal section of the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Reno asked Kowalski to investigate two
developments: a 1993 allegation by former Memphis restaurant owner
Loyd Jowers that a mobster paid him $100,000 to hire a hit man to
kill King, and the recent claim by ex-FBI agent Donald Wilson that
he took two pieces of paper with the name ``Raul'' on them from
James Earl Ray's abandoned car 30 years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who died in April while serving a 99-year-sentence,
recanted his admission of guilt within days of making it in 1969
and claimed that he had been set up by a smuggler he only knew as
Raul.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jowers' attorney said no federal officials had
contacted him or his client recently, Wilson relinquished the
documents to Kowalski's lieutenants 2 1/2 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reopened the case at the urging of King's family, who last
year announced their belief in Ray's innocence. They tried in vain
to obtain a trial for him.
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski, who turned 54 on the day Reno announced the
investigation, has prosecuted some of the most prominent racial
violence cases in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of joining the Justice Department in 1981,
Kowalski won convictions against two Ku Klux Klan members who had
abducted and hanged Michael Donald in Mobile, Ala. The next year,
Kowalski suffered his only major defeat when he failed to convict
an avowed white racist who had been charged in the 1980 wounding of
Vernon Jordan, then head of the Urban League, in Fort Wayne, Ind.
(The man now admits to the shooting.)
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski ``was very vigorous in his effort, and he was obviously
very bright,'' said defense attorney J. Frank Kimbrough, who faced
him in that trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski was back on the winning side in 1988 after securing the
convictions of two neo-Nazis in the 1984 machine-gun murder of
Denver talk show host Alan Berg. The next year, he helped to
convict 23 Dallas skinheads who had been harassing
African-Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's God's work,'' Kowalski said of his fight against hate
crimes. ``God made somebody a certain color, a certain way. God
didn't intend for that person to suffer because of that. When
someone gets hurt because of that, that is one of the most heinous
crimes. It's despicable. And when someone has power by virtue of
the authority the state has granted to him and someone gets hurt,
that's the second-worst thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning at all costs?
</P>
<P>
   But some attorneys who have battled Kowalski say he can get
carried away. Harland Braun defended Los Angeles police Officer
Theodore Briseno, who was acquitted in the Rodney King case. Braun
objected to Kowalski's closing argument, saying he unduly pressured
the jury by telling them the world was watching to see how they
would act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kowalski crossed over the line and attempted to use race in a
very dangerous and incendiary way,'' Braun said. ``I thought he was
unethical. Just because he's wearing the white hat in most of these
cases, it doesn't mean the end justifies the means.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski was ``trying to inflame passions,'' said Ira Salzman,
attorney for another of the Los Angeles police officers. Salzman
said Kowalski and his team had a ``win-at-any-cost attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They may well be right,'' Kowalski said. ``I made mistakes
during the trial, but I always did everything I could to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kowalski, that zeal comes from a sense of morality he has
held since his youth in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. The son
of a West Point graduate and two-term Democratic congressman,
Kowalski remembers going to an all-black nightclub in the early
1960s to watch Otis Redding and James Brown perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently,'' he said, ``we'd be the only white guys there.
But we'd be welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   After an undistinguished academic career at Brown University, he
went to work in 1966 as a junior political aide in the office of
Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1967, he had joined the Marine Corps, even though he
was opposed to the escalating war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined up because I thought it was unfair that poor guys had
to go but rich guys didn't,'' he said, seated in his cramped
fifth-floor office, a Marine Corps recruitment poster tacked to the
wall. ``I didn't want to go to school. I was sick of school. I had
political ambitions, and I thought I would be better situated to
fight against the war as a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   He served a year in Vietnam, as a lieutenant with an infantry
platoon, an executive officer with a rifle company and an adviser
to a South Vietnamese army pacification program.
</P>
<P>
   Out of his officers' school class, he was told, about
one-thirdfinished their tours unharmed, one-third were killed and
another third were wounded seriously enough to be shipped home
early. He was in the fortunate third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shot at almost every day,'' he said. ``I never fired
my weapon. As a platoon leader, you're not supposed to. I didn't
want to kill anybody. I didn't want to take a life if I didn't have
to. By the same token, I wouldn't have hesitated to shoot someone
trying to kill me. I was not beyond pulling the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He still thinks about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I gave orders that caused someone to die,'' he said.
``What weighs on me more are the mistakes I made that caused my men
to die. That still bothers me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon discharge in 1970, Kowalski went to the Catholic University
Law School in Washington, where he made law review. While still in
school, he got a job with the Interior Department's Office of
Endangered Species. He also worked on George McGovern's failed 1972
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion at that point became the environment and
wildlife,'' he said. ``I was disinterested in politics. I became
cynical. With what I saw in the war, what I learned from my dad and
from working on the McGovern campaign, I decided politics wasn't
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is not for him
</P>
<P>
   After graduation in 1973, he joined a Washington firm that
spcialized in antitrust law. The job bored him, and he lasted six
months. Then came a nine-month stint as a Washington prosecutor
working with juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he joined the faculty at Antioch School of Law. He held
that job until he joined the Justice Department in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter was getting ready for college,'' he said. ``The
school looked like it was going under. I'm probably the only guy
who came to the government for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a one-year break when he taught law in Wyoming, he's
been working civil rights cases with the Justice Department.
``Things that need vindication are very challenging,'' Kowalski
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has not considered work as a defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to represent someone who's guilty for money,''
he said. ``I'd represent someone who is indigent and can't afford
an attorney. There's a lot of difficulty ethically being a defense
attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe himself, he says he's ``someone who wants to
be a champion for a cause. At the same time, I'm constantly worried
about not having accomplished my job well enough. I'm a worrier.''
</P>
<P>
   A hyperkinetic and slight man, he constantly tears off a piece
of tape from a dispenser on his desk and plays with it as he talks.
Yet he claims to have slowed down in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate pressure,'' he said. ``I accept it as part of what
comes with the job. But it makes me worried. It makes me run
scared. I always run scared. It's useful to have that feeling, but
it doesn't feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   If not a change of pace, these last few years have brought him a
better quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced after graduating from law school, Kowalski only
remarried four years ago. He not only has two young grandchildren,
thanks to his 30-year-old daughter, but also a 2-year-old daughter
from his current marriage. He takes her riding on Moon, his
15-year-old paint horse he keeps at a friend's Virginia farm.
</P>
<P>
   Horses have been a part of Kowalski's life for years. He even
rode Moon to the outdoor altar on his wedding day. His wedding
photograph shows him in a black cowboy outfit that makes him look
like Robert Duvall in ``Lonesome Dove.'' The resemblance was not by
chance, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a work schedule that often has him on the road, he
doesn't miss his bachelor days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have to call home every day than be alone for the
dry spells, especially since my wife's an angel and tolerates all
my bad habits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic tranquillity hasn't made him soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who accomplish things in life have to believe that what
they're doing is the most important thing in the world,'' Kowalski
said. ``I get obsessed with a case when I'm working on it. This is
the only thing I'm working on right now.''

 &HT;    This time, La Nina spells trouble
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as Hurricane Georges faded last week, weather experts
suggested that more bad news may be on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   A weather phenomenon known as La Nina _ the reversal of El Nino
_ is developing and could create conditions favorable for frequent
and dangerous Caribbean hurricanes like Georges, say environmental
officials with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Georges is a typical storm for this time of year,''
said Peter Usher, chief of the U.N. Environmental Program's
atmosphere unit. ``But La Nina is now developing, and an important
feature is that it often enhances normal seasonal weather events,
and this is what could be happening in the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nina, a ``cold water event,'' occurs as a result of the
direct reversal of conditions that lead to the more widely known El
Nino, which is caused by abnormal warming in the central and
eastern equatorial stretch of the Pacific. La Nina, which is
Spanish for ``little girl,'' is the result of a below-normal drop
in Pacific temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Climate scientists met in Boulder, Colo., in July for the first
conference ever on La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the results of the conference last week, Usher said
that if La Nina ``develops how we think it might, then the concern
is that the frequency of storms like Georges might increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive flooding spawned by Georges along the Gulf Coast may be
part of a pattern around the world attributed to La Nina. In recent
months, Usher said, many countries, such as China and Bangladesh,
have experienced torrential rainfall that meteorologists blame on
La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   Usher also noted that last week the board of directors of the
United Nations Foundation, the charity established by Ted Turner,
approved $650,000 for a project to reduce the impact of
environmental emergencies by focusing on early warning and
preparedness efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In another development related to Georges, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration officials said the agency sent its three
hurricane tracking aircraft into the eye of Georges while it
hovered over Cuba. It was a rare move because hurricane aircraft
almost never fly over land, where the storms can spawn tornadoes.
They usually fly through hurricanes over the open sea.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center near Miami requested that the
aircraft fly into Cuban airspace so the storm's exact position
could be determined. Forecasters must know the location of the eye
of the storm so they can accurately predict the hurricane's track.
NOAA is the only federal agency with hurricane tracking capability
that Cuba has authorized to fly in its airspace.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Gerald R. Ford broke his silence
on the White House scandal Saturday and suggested that the most
fitting punishment for President Clinton would be a rebuke in the
well of the House, where he would stand and listen while
Republicans and Democrats denounced his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be an important boost for Clinton's search
for a way to short-circuit the impeachment process, Ford's
recommendation is striking not only because he breaks ranks with
Republican leaders who have pressed for impeachment hearings, or
called upon the president to resign, but also because of his own
experience with impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who made the recommendation in an Op-Ed article in
Sunday's New York Times, succeeded to the presidency in 1974, after
President Richard M. Nixon resigned during the impeachment
proceedings over Watergate. Ford later damaged his own political
standing by pardoning his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a president receiving not an ovation from the people's
representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members
of both parties,'' Ford wrote. ``I emphasize: this would be a
rebuke, not a rebuttal by the president. On the contrary, by his
appearance the president would accept full responsibility for his
actions, as well as for his subsequent efforts to delay or impede
the investigation of them. No spinning, no semantics, no
evasiveness or blaming others for his plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the special counsel to the president, Saturday
welcomed Ford's comments, and he did not rule out the possibility
of a rebuke. ``Gerald Ford is a man who has been there, who
understands a situation like this and understands the importance of
deferring to constitutional standards under all circumstances,'' he
said in an interview. ``President Ford is absolutely right: this
kind of conduct simply doesn't rise to the level of an impeachable
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford weighed in at a crucial point in the White House scandal.
Now that the House Judiciary Committee on Friday released the final
trove of evidence in its consideration of impeachment charges, the
scandal has shifted to political grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet Monday, and its Republican
majority is widely expected to recommend a formal House impeachment
inquiry. David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel for House
Republicans, plans to appear before the committee to expand the
current list of 11 possible grounds for impeachment of Clinton to
include counts involving making false statements under oath and
trying to conceal a crime, Republican officials said. They said
Schippers would insist that the case is not about sex.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and political aides said they were devoting
the weekend to scouring the 4,600 pages of newly released testimony
and transcripts, seeking evidence to support their case that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was motivated by partisan gain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three senior White House officials in interviews Saturday
offered scathing remarks about Starr's report to Congress. ``If you
look at what's in all the 10,000 pages that are out, the story is
it's the incredible shrinking Starr referral,'' said Joe Lockhart,
the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In his harshest comments about the Starr report, Craig asserted:
``This was not written for the purpose of informing or educating
the decision makers. It was written to trash the president with the
American people and to inflame the jury, which is the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior political aide to the president, said of
Starr, ``He's got more legal manipulation than he does legal
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Congress moves toward a formal impeachment inquiry,
Democratic lawmakers have been moving aggressively behind the
scenes to explore ways to reach a settlement that could save the
president _ and the Congress _ from a protracted impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Rockefeller of West Virginia and John Breaux of
Louisiana, who are both close to Clinton, approached Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut more than a week ago to begin talks on an
appropriate punishment short of impeachment that could be supported
by the Senate, several people familiar with the discussions said.
These people all spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were described as ongoing and informal, and the
senators have discussed several options _ ones not unlike the
suggestion of former President Ford _ including the possibility
that Clinton be rebuked with something stronger than a formal
censure by Congress but not a full impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling that it's got to be beyond censure,'' said a
Senate official who is close to the talks. ``This is not looking
for ways to defend the president. It is looking for ways to make it
clear that what he did was unacceptable but also listening to what
the American people want: to wrap this thing up and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said the point of the discussions was to see
``whether or not there's a center of gravity in the Senate,'' and,
specifically, whether where was ``an operating majority on a strong
censure.'' This person argued that ``while people do not want to
get in the way of the House of Representatives,'' the position of
the Senate was nevertheless critical because ``Gingrich said he
wouldn't move'' on impeachment ``unless there were enough senators
to get 67 votes.'' He referred to House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment process is now in the hands of the House,
a simple majority would be required to move the process to the
Senate, which would ultimately vote on any impeachment
recommendation. The votes of two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 senators
_ would be required to convict and remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the talks said Rockefeller had become one
of Clinton's staunchest internal defenders and that he and Breaux
reached out to Lieberman because he also has been close to the
president and gained credibility as the first Democratic senator
who rose on the Senate floor to chastise Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The three senators have been informally reaching out to other
Democrats as well as Republicans who could be pivotal to any effort
to short-circuit the impeachment process, Senate officials said.
The Republicans include Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, as well as three moderates: Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, Olympia Snowe of Maine and James Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably some Republicans who believe you could
proceed on this basis,'' said a Democrat close to the
conversations. Explaining that many voters particularly in the
Northeast would not want impeachment, he added, ``This could not be
good politics in states like Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and
New York to be part of having the Senate actually receive an
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig sought to tear apart Starr's case, and he argued
vigorously that the documents made public Friday ``destroy the
theory of obstruction of justice.'' Specifically, he said, there
was no evidence that Vernon Jordan, the president's close friend,
tried to keep Monica Lewinsky quiet about her affair with Clinton
by trying to find her a job. ``The statements to the grand jury
completely eliminate the theory that there was an effort to find
her a job to secure her silence,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Starr contended that Craig's initial
comments about the documents released that day were
``disingenuous.'' He found it significant, he said, that the White
House has not challenged the ``credibility or the factual
underpinnings of none of the 11 grounds for impeachment, including
the president's perjury in his deposition and before the grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike said they did not think the
final release of documents would significantly alter the already
hardened political contours of the struggle over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said what he perceived as
partisanship on the part of Republicans had driven more Democrats
to back Clinton. ``If Washington is being divided into two hostile
camps and the one camp appears to be unfair and highly partisan
that only leaves people to identify with President Clinton,'' he
said. ``And to many that is the most comfortable place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who is close to the House Democratic leadership said
of the document release: ``There was a feeling that this next cache
of documents would provide us with the very best way to at least
stall the momentum of the Republican argument. I tend to doubt
that's going to give us much lift for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   While some prominent Republicans, like former Sen. Bob Dole,
Clinton's rival for the presidency in 1996, have privately been
receptive to the notion of a settlement that stops short of
impeachment, no major figure in the party has gone as far as Ford
in calling for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The 38th president, who is 85, said Clinton had ``broken faith
with those who elected him,'' and ``has since been forced to take
refuge in legalistic evasions.'' Ford explained that while he had
no interest ``in rescuing'' Clinton, he feared the long-term
consequences for the nation of trying to remove Clinton from
office. But, he asserted, ``A simple apology is inadequate, and a
fine would trivialize his conduct by treating it as a mere question
of monetary restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said of his recommendation: ``Anyone who confuses this
scenario with a slap on the wrist, or a censure written in
disappearing ink, underestimates the historical impact of such a
pronouncement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ford's recommendation, and the drive in the Senate to
find an end to the scandal, private deliberations in the House over
a deal with Clinton have halted for now, people who have been
involved in the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who had pressed for a solution said it was clear that
Republicans would not be willing to reach any accommodation before
Election Day, and that there was no consensus even among Democrats
as to how the matter should be settled.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the talks said the political environment was
greatly unsettled, and that many lawmakers are bracing for other
potential turns in the case, like indictments from Starr or the
possibility appointment by the Justice Department of an independent
counsel to examine campaign finance accusations against Clinton.

TEXAS SCHOOL ACCUSED OF SHORTCHANGING ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ After graduating from O'Connell High School
last May, Billy Russell planned to go a community college and play
football this fall. Instead, he is sitting at home with a diploma
that is little more than a piece of paper in a nice red folder.
</P>
<P>
   Billy, 17, who was a special education student, said in a recent
interview that he had been recruited to play football at O'Connell,
a Roman Catholic school, with the promise of tutoring and financial
assistance. ``The coach said if there would be less kids, it would
be better for me and I can learn,'' Billy said in an interview
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the help never came, he said, and he failed most of his
classes. Still, he and six other students who were athletes were
allowed to graduate even though they lacked the necessary credits.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Billy's mother, Catherine Russell, asked for
her son's transcript last summer that she and her son learned that
Billy should never have graduated. By that time, the school had
released its principal, Thomas Ducote, and the football coach, Sam
Zimmerle, and the diocese said it had taken steps to ensure that
such a situation did not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools has
penalized O'Connell High School for several violations, including
breaking recruiting rules, and Billy and his parents have retained
a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school cheated him for a year,'' said Charles Argento,
the family lawyer. ``As far as I'm concerned they have to get him
the tutors and I think they need to pay for it. They're using these
kids. When football is done, they drop them.''
</P>
<P>
   But others connected to the school say its problems go beyond an
overemphasis on sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school football in Texas is out of hand,'' said Alan
Slay, a retired telephone-company employee who taught computer
science at the school last year. ``That is the top layer of the
story. But move down a notch. O'Connell is a Catholic school not
really equipped to handle a variety of students.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, the enrollment at O'Connell High School,
grades 9 through 12, has dropped to 133 students from about 300,
and parents have been concerned that the diocese might close its
doors. Teachers said academic standards had declined.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another problem. The school's bookkeeper, Cheryl
Zimmerle, the wife of the football coach, committed suicide after
the school's financial records were subpoenaed in connection with a
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the crowning of the bad times _ we had so many
tragedies,'' said Pat Teltschik, who has taught at the school for
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only year that Ducote and Billy would be at
O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   Ducote, who had been a principal at a Roman Catholic school in
Boca Raton, Fla., said he had taken the job at O'Connell to be
closer to relatives. He is now unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Billy said he had been recruited by Zimmerle while working out
at a local college after returning from Rialto, Calif., in the
summer of 1997. Billy, who played on the school's offensive and
defensive lines, said he had been drawn to the school because of
the promised academic help. ``I told them I wasn't no A-B
student,'' Billy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Russell said that when she asked whether her son would be
able to keep up at the school, she was assured by Zimmerle that
Billy would be tutored. Mrs. Russell said the coach said he would
take care of Billy's annual tuition of $4,250.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerle, who is teaching and coaching football at Needville
High School, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ducote said in a recent interview that by the end of Billy's
first month in school, September 1997, teachers said of him: ``He
can't read. He can't write. He can't spell. He can't do anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last October, Mrs. Zimmerle committed suicide after the school's
financial records were sought in connection with a $1.3 million
theft at Mrs. Zimmerle's previous place of employment. An audit
after her death found about $300,000 in school money unaccounted
for, diocese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Michael Gaurino said he had traced the missing
$300,000 to Mrs. Zimmerle. He said his office had been unable ``to
substantiate any evidence to charge anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, after football season had ended, Mrs. Russell said
she was called into the principal's office and told Billy was
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Ducote said he told her, ``We're not meeting your child's need,
and I think he needs to leave.'' He said Mrs. Russell became angry
and threatened to sue the school if her son did not graduate. ``We
couldn't afford a suit,'' Ducote said.
</P>
<P>
   So teachers continued to work with Billy as before.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Danesi, a teacher and a football coach at O'Connell last
year, was promoted to principal this year. Danesi said teachers
modified work to help Billy understand; they read test questions to
him and gave him longer to complete work.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Musick, a counselor, said she had tried to get Billy
into special education at a nearby public high school (O'Connell
has no such program), but that could not be arranged, because he
did not live in Galveston but in nearby Texas City.
</P>
<P>
   In May, with graduation at hand, Ducote said he had been
confronted with what to do about 12 students who did not qualify to
graduate out of a senior class of 48.
</P>
<P>
   In four cases, he said, students with failing grades, including
two athletes, were given blank diplomas. Three other students,
including one athlete, made arrangements to make up work to
complete their credits.
</P>
<P>
   In four other cases, three of them involving athletes, Ducote
said, he had gone against school policy and averaged first and
second semester scores and allowed the students to graduate
although they had failed the second semester. The 12th student,
Billy, was given a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make the best decision possible with the
information I had at hand,'' Ducote said and added, speaking of the
athletes, ``These children had been used and just cast aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Danesi disputes Ducote's statement, saying that that all 12
students were given signed diplomas when none were eligible to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell officials have appealed the sanctions by the
Association of Private and Parochial Schools, which put the school
on a one-year probation and barred its teams from going to district
playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to the kids,'' Danesi said. ``If you looked at all
the schools in Galveston and Houston, you would find a lot of cases
like it. We've been brought to light, and we're doing something
about it.''

COMMENTARY: GENTLE MASTERS BREED GENTLE DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, N.Y. _ Twelve bearded men bow their heads for grace
in the dining room of a mountaintop monastery. Behind each chair
rests a German shepherd, each with a placid mien to match its
master's.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are never far from the monks of New Skete, except
during morning and evening services. Then the monks greet or close
the day with soothing a cappella chanting in their hand-built
church, made of weathered barn siding and topped with an onion
dome.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are both companions and livelihood to the monks here,
who belong to the Orthodox Church in America, an offshoot of the
Russian Orthodox Church. Over the years, the monks have built a
reputation for breeding and training exemplary German shepherds,
sweet-natured and obedient.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the monks care for their breeding dogs as if they
were pets is emblematic of the monks' philosophy. They advocate
cuddling and massaging a dog as much as possible from the time it
is born, and molding the training regime to the animal's stages of
neurological development.
</P>
<P>
   The monks call their technique ``inseeing,'' a word as resonant
with holiness as the incense that billows through their church.
``We learn to think the way the dog thinks,'' said Brother
Christopher, the primary trainer. ``We listen to what is needed
rather than imposing our will. In that way the dogs play a crucial
role in our growth and consciousness, because only by getting
outside of yourself can you find God.''
</P>
<P>
   The monks, who came to upstate New York in 1966, found their
second vocation serendipitously. After building their rustic
compound amid the birch and pine forests near the Vermont border,
they set about finding a way to support a contemplative life. Since
they lived atop shale cliffs, unsuitable for growing crops, the
monks raised animals _ chickens, goats, and beef and milk cows _ to
feed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They earned pin money by selling liturgical books, music and
icons, since the guests who came here on retreat rarely donated
enough for room and board. Soon they decided to capitalize on their
skill with farm animals, building a smokehouse and producing fancy
meats and cheeses. Later, they affiliated with a small order of
nuns.
</P>
<P>
   This common monastic enterprise gradually gave way to the
unusual dog-breeding business, which began when the monks got a
German shepherd as a pet. They found that the animal's guileless
affection added warmth to their celibate lives, so when it died,
they replaced it with two others.
</P>
<P>
   Soon guests were begging for a puppy and the brothers began
studying veterinary medicine, animal nutrition and breeding
techniques. ``One thing led to another,'' Brother Mark said.
``There was no grand design that led us down this road.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the dogs from New Skete grew more popular. Now, there
is a two-year waiting list for a puppy, which costs $1,000. The
monks have written two books about their techniques and produced a
training video. They also train dogs of all breeds, charging $800
for three weeks of individual obedience instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Each monk is responsible for one or two breeding dogs, which
sleep in the monks' cells, join them at meals and wander with them
through the russet woods during the quiet hour between the end of
the workday and the evening meal. ``They have become part of our
community life,'' Brother Mark said. ``And since they reflect our
spiritual life, they are our ambassadors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the monks work with the dogs. Brother David runs the
smokehouse. Brother Barnabas makes the cheeses and Brother Elias
the pickled pineapple relish and other condiments. Everyone pitches
in for the weekly manufacture of sausages.
</P>
<P>
   And all come together for meals and services. One evening last
week, as a cold wind set the birches rustling and 17 bells tolled,
three visitors joined them. One was a dog lover from Rockland
County. The others were relatives of a resident monk.
</P>
<P>
   Candles lighted the dim church. The monks and nuns, in robes and
sandals, faced each other in two rows. In four-part harmony, they
chanted Slavic and Byzantine melodies, translated into contemporary
English. The air was sweet with incense. Across the way, in the
residence hall, the dogs of New Skete slept.

A DEATH SITE IS DISPLAYED TO OUTSIDERS BY SERBS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GREBNICKA MOUNTAIN, Yugoslavia _ Serbian authorities took
foreign reporters to a rocky crevice on this mountain Saturday to
show them four skulls and other human remains buried near a former
hideout of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   They said the remains were discovered on Friday by soldiers of
the Yugoslav Army who had reclaimed the mountain from the ethnic
Albanian separatists several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two skulls were lying on the ground at the bottom of a crevice
when the reporters arrived, along with two femurs on a path leading
to the crevice. Three laborers, supervised by technicians from the
Serbian police, lifted rocks and dug through the earth with
shovels. The laborers found two more skulls, some bones, debris
from what looked like civilian clothing and two boots. A strong
odor of decayed bodies permeated the site.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Serbian Interior Ministry police, Col.
Bozidar Filic, said it appeared that the people had been killed by
the guerrillas three or four months ago, and buried there. Col.
Filic was careful to say that there was as yet no proof of the
ethnic origins of the people killed. He said that six or seven
people, including some Serbs and two Gypsies, had been missing from
the area for the last three months. One of the missing is a Serbian
police officer, Ranko Remistar, from the nearby town of Klina, he
said. ``We can just assume these are the missing people but we
don't know,'' Filic said. ``We cannot tell for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to show the site appeared designed to counter the
international attention given to last weekend's massacre,
apparently by Serbian forces, of 18 members of an ethnic Albanian
family in the village of Gornje Obrinje and the execution of 13
ethnic Albanian men at nearby Golubovac. The official Serbian press
has called the massacre of the family a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bouckaert, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who saw
the human remains at the site Saturday, said it appeared from the
condition of the remains that they had been there for about three
months. Bouckaert said that one of the skulls had a bullet wound.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the remains raised again, Bouckaert said, the
importance of forensic experts from the war crimes tribunal in The
Hague being allowed to exhume and examine bodies from both sides in
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to investigate massacres and possible war
crimes in Kosovo has become increasingly heated. Ethnic Albanian
political leaders, who want Kosovo province to secede from Serbia,
have called for experts from the Hague tribunal to come. The
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has refused these requests,
which have also been made from Washington. Two of the tribunal's
investigators were in Kosovo last week but were not carrying
forensic equipment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were no Serbian forensic experts at the site Saturday,
which is at the end of a dirt path that winds up the mountain some
three miles southwest of Klina. Two police technicians videotaped
the site and put the remains into plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   These were to be taken to the hospital in Pec where forensic
specialists from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, would examine
them, said Veselim Cadzenovic, an investigating judge from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Cadzenovic said he was called to the site by the army and that
he asked for the Serbian forensic experts to take charge of the
remains at the Pec hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a commonly held position of Serbian officials in
Kosovo, Cadzenovic said that from what he had seen on Serbian
television the massacre of the 18 ethnic Albanian civilians of the
Deliaj family, including children and women, was ``stage managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, the Serbian authorities discovered 34 bodies
in a canal at Glodjane in central Kosovo and said they were mostly
Serbian civilians killed by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
International diplomatic monitors reported that the claims by the
Serbian authorities seemed credible.
</P>
<P>
   There was more doubt, the monitors said, about another site
discovered at Klecka in Kosovo in late August where the Serbian
authorities said 22 Serbs had been burned by the separatist
guerrillas in a lime kiln. The monitors said they were not sure
that the kiln could reach the high temperatures required to burn
the bodies.

COMMENTARY: THE PATH BACK TO DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., for use with CLINTON-STARR-RDP)  
 (Gerald R. Ford, the 38th president of the United States, was a
Republican member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to
1973.)  
 (bl)  
 By GERALD R. FORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Almost exactly 25 years have passed since
Richard Nixon nominated me to replace the disgraced Spiro Agnew as
vice president. In the contentious days of autumn 1973, my
confirmation was by no means assured. Indeed, a small group of
House Democrats, led by Bella Abzug, risked a constitutional crisis
in order to pursue their own agenda. ``We can get control and keep
control,'' Ms. Abzug told the speaker of the House, Carl Albert.
The group hoped, eventually, to replace Nixon himself with Albert.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, true to form, refused to have anything to do with
the scheme. And so on Dec. 6, 1973, the House voted 387-35 to
confirm my nomination in accordance with the 25th Amendment to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When I succeeded to the presidency, in August 1974, my immediate
and overriding priority was to draw off the poison that had seeped
into the nation's bloodstream during two years of scandal and
sometimes ugly partisanship. Some Americans have yet to forgive me
for pardoning my predecessor. In the days leading up to that hugely
controversial action, I didn't take a poll for guidance, but I did
say more than a few prayers. In the end I listened to only one
voice, that of my conscience. I didn't issue the pardon for Nixon's
sake, but for the country's.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, Americans once again confront the specter of
impeachment. From the day, last January, that the Monica Lewinsky
story first came to light, I have refrained publicly from making
any substantive comments. I have done so because I haven't known
enough of the facts _ and because I know all too well that a
president's responsibilities are, at the best of times, onerous. In
common with the other former presidents, I have had no wish to
increase those burdens. Moreover, I resolved to say nothing unless
my words added constructively to the national discussion.
</P>
<P>
   This much now seems clear: whether or not President Clinton has
broken any laws, he has broken faith with those who elected him. A
leader of rare gifts, one who set out to change history by
convincing the electorate that he and his party wore the mantle of
individual responsibility and personal accountability, the
president has since been forced to take refuge in legalistic
evasions, while his defenders resort to the insulting mantra that
``everybody does it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that everybody doesn't do it is the genuine
outrage occasioned by the president's conduct and by the efforts of
some White House surrogates to minimize its significance or savage
his critics.
</P>
<P>
   The question confronting us, then, is not whether the president
has done wrong, but rather, what is an appropriate form of
punishment for his wrongdoing. A simple apology is inadequate, and
a fine would trivialize his misconduct by treating it as a mere
question of monetary restitution.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president is not the only one who stands
before the bar of judgment. It has been said that Washington is a
town of marble and mud. Often in these past few months it has
seemed that we were all in danger of sinking into the mire.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after leaving it, I still consider myself a
man of the House. I never forget that my elevation to the
presidency came about through congressional as well as
constitutional mandate. My years in the White House were devoted to
restoring public confidence in institutions of popular governance.
Now as then, I care more about preserving respect for those
institutions than I do about the fate of any individual temporarily
entrusted with office.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I think the time has come to pause and consider the
long-term consequences of removing this president from office based
on the evidence at hand. The president's hairsplitting legalisms,
objectionable as they may be, are but the foretaste of a protracted
and increasingly divisive debate over those deliberately imprecise
words ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The Framers, after all,
dealt in eternal truths, not glossy deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Moving with dispatch, the House Judiciary Committee should be
able to conclude a preliminary inquiry into possible grounds for
impeachment before the end of the year. Once that process is
completed, and barring unexpected new revelations, the full House
might then consider the following resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Each year it is customary for a president to journey down
Pennsylvania Avenue and appear before a joint session of Congress
to deliver his State of the Union address. One of the binding
rituals of our democracy, it takes on added grandeur from its
surroundings _ there, in that chamber where so much of the American
story has been written, and where the ghosts of Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower call succeeding
generations to account.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a very different kind of presidential appearance in the
closing days of this year, not at the rostrum familiar to viewers
from moments of triumph, but in the well of the House. Imagine a
president receiving not an ovation from the people's
representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members
of both parties. I emphasize: this would be a rebuke, not a
rebuttal by the president.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, by his appearance the president would accept
full responsibility for his actions, as well as for his subsequent
efforts to delay or impede the investigation of them. No spinning,
no semantics, no evasiveness or blaming others for his plight.
</P>
<P>
   Let all this be done without partisan exploitation or
mean-spiritedness. Let it be dignified, honest and, above all,
cleansing. The result, I believe, would be the first moment of
majesty in an otherwise squalid year.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who confuses this scenario with a slap on the wrist, or a
censure written in disappearing ink, underestimates the historic
impact of such a pronouncement. Nor should anyone forget the power
of television to foster indelible images in the national memory _
not unlike what happened on the solemn August noontime in 1974 when
I stood in the East Room and declared our long national nightmare
to be over.
</P>
<P>
   At 85, I have no personal or political agenda, nor do I have any
interest in ``rescuing'' Bill Clinton. But I do care, passionately,
about rescuing the country I love from further turmoil or
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   More than a way out of the current mess, most Americans want a
way up to something better. In the midst of a far graver national
crisis, Lincoln observed, ``The occasion is piled high with
difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.'' We should
remember those words in the days ahead. Better yet, we should be
guided by them.

FINDING NEW, TRENDIER WAYS TO SPREAD THE WORD OF THE LORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not a standard airplane banner that caught the
eyes of sunbathers from Jones Beach to the Hamptons on the Labor
Day weekend. Instead of hawking suntan lotion or happy hour drinks,
the sign read: ``Make a Friend in a Very High Place.
Marblechurch.org.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the abbreviated version of a print and poster
advertisement for the Marble Collegiate Church that also says:
``Everyone knows it helps having friends in high places, and no
one's higher than God. So stop by Marble this Sunday and make a
powerful new friend. Or just strengthen your friendship with an old
one.''
</P>
<P>
   God's messenger these days is as likely to be a Madison Avenue
account executive as a missionary. Religious advertisements have
become savvier, slicker and certainly wittier than the staid church
announcements found on the religion pages of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   And they have turned up in the strangest places. In the past,
church ads were generally found in magazines and newspapers and on
radio broadcasts. Now, with the ascendance of a generation of
clergy raised on television and video, the ads might also appear on
the airborne streamer, the telephone kiosk, the construction site
and the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks are saying, `If we want to reach out to people and we
are not out pounding on doors, we must do something we haven't done
before,'' said Roy Lloyd, the broadcast news director for the
National Council of Churches, who also works in print media.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he continued, ``People no longer join a church
because that's where their family belonged, and denominational
loyalty is a thing of the past. Today, people are looking for
places that coincide with their values or challenge them in ways
that are appealing. An impression built over time that mainline
religion is dull and boring and you have to give them a different
perspective,'' he said. The church is on Fifth Avenue and 29th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Marble Collegiate's current advertisements, which were
introduced in summer resort publications like Hamptons magazine and
Dan's Paper in the Hamptons and The Fire Island Tide, are now
running in New York magazine, Time Out New York and The Village
Voice, and are attached to boarded-up construction sites around the
city. They will also go up on more than 30 telephone kiosks in
December. And the airplane trailer is scheduled to make another
overhead appearance on Oct. 18 at Giants Stadium, during a New York
Giants-Arizona Cardinals game.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five other messages in the campaign is one proclaiming
``You Don't Have to Be a Sinner To Attend Our Church. But It
Helps.''
</P>
<P>
   That ad and others were meant to counteract the image of church
as judge. ``There is an enormous amount of bad feeling because of
the sense that you are a sinner, you are wrong,'' said Dr. Arthur
Caliandro, the church's senior minister. ``That is not what Marble
is all about, nor, in fact, what true religion is about.''
</P>
<P>
   John Follis, president and creative director of Follis/N.Y., the
church's ad agency, said, ``In my 20 years in the business, I have
worked on everything from Coca-Cola to infant thermometers, but
never have I worked on a product that does absolutely everything
and is free. Advertising Marble Church is essentially selling
God.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, God is being sold elsewhere as well. Last fall, the
Church of the Heavenly Rest, the majestic Episcopal house of
worship at Fifth Avenue and 90th Street, began using similarly
amusing ads and is now running two campaigns a year geared to
subway poster display. A typical message: ``Sex Doesn't Mean a
Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In smaller type, it continues: ``Neither does race, age,
economic status, political affiliation. Or whether you believe in
God. If you need help, you won't be turned down. You've got to
start somewhere. Start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Paluszek, a senior copywriter for Grey Advertising, and a
member of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, wrote the copy. ``I
didn't want them to even remotely look like church ads but to be
constructively provocative, she said. ``I wanted to combine a New
York in-your-face challenge with a warm welcome and a promise of
Christian hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she continued, she was inspired by Christ himself.
``When he was working among the people, he spoke the vernacular of
the time and there were compelling bold images in his parables,''
she said. ``Some of his images were very graphic, and I took a cue
from his style in a way. I felt that the ads should be part of the
fabric of New York City life.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is not alone in the phenomenon, which is being taken to
an extreme in London, where Charles and Maurice Saatchi, the
advertising tycoons, will open the Saatchi (named for their
parents, not themselves) Synagogue this month. An ad has already
appeared showing a piece of gefilte fish with the catch line, ``At
our new synagogue, this is the only thing which gets rammed down
someone's throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most religious institutions are not so brash. The Rev. James
Burns, rector of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, had a simple goal
when he broached the idea of the advertising campaign shortly after
becoming its spiritual leader two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was after two groups of people,'' he said, ``people not
affiliated with any particular church, who slog up the subway
stairs each day and wonder `Is this all there is?' and parish
members who might want to rethink what their church and their
participation in it is about. When people come in who are new to
the church, we ask, `Did you see the ad?' and about 50 percent say
`Oh, yeah.' Then we have a job delivering something worth staying
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the church's goal was not primarily to bolster membership.
``We are a fairly large church with 1,600 members and are in good
financial shape,'' said the associate rector, the Rev. Steven
Woolley. ``We are not trying to bring in members for the sake of
growth or to raise money. We are trying to feed the spiritual
hunger, doing what God told us to do: proclaiming the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Caliandro said he was disturbed by the waning assumption that
church is a normal part of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious worship is no longer an expected part of what we do
on Sunday,'' he said. Citing the lures of ``staying home and
washing the car, playing golf or reading the Sunday newspaper,'' he
said, ``thirty years ago there would have been a fourth option. You
might want to go and worship, but that is no longer in the thinking
of people. In New York City, there is such intense competition for
attention that religious institutions need to let people know they
are there and have something to offer.''

GIULIANI, DURING VISIT, PLEDGES STORM SUPPORT FOR DOMINICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
arrived here Saturday to lend New York City's support in rebuilding
the hurricane-battered nation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani flew into Las Americas International Airport at 10 a.m.
on a twin-engine jet from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., then headed into
the capital city of Santo Domingo, where he met the president of
the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was accompanied by the New York City police
commissioner, Howard Safir, and Jerome Hauer, the director of the
mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani met privately with Fernandez at the presidential
palace, where the president described the extent of the storm
damage for the mayor and detailed the support that the nation
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani pledged to help. ``As mayor of the second-largest
Dominican city in the world, we owe this assistance to the
Dominican people,'' he said at a news conference after the meeting.
``The connection between New York and the Dominican Republic is
very, very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor later left the presidential palace and, traveling in a
seven-car motorcade, headed 32 miles west to the coastal city of
San Pedro de Macoris, in one of the hardest-hit areas. He was
scheduled to meet there with the family of Sammy Sosa, the Chicago
Cubs slugger. Sixty-three New York City firefighters, police
officers and emergency medical technicians have already been
deployed there to assist in rescue and rebuilding efforts,
including repairing major damage to the city's main hospital.
Giuliani was also scheduled to visit Puerto Rico Saturday and
survey the damage wrought there by Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's visit came as this country struggled to rebuild
itself 11 days after being battered by the most devastating
hurricane to strike here in 20 years. The government here estimates
that more than 500,000 homes were damaged and that more than 500
people were injured during the storm. So far, estimates place the
number of dead at 249 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation and damage is even greater than has been able
to be reported,'' the mayor said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican and U.S. officials estimate the cost of the
destruction to be about $3 billion, or $500 million more than the
nation's annual operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Saturday that New York had already shipped 1
million pounds of food, clothing and water in 12 shipments aboard
commercial and military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the city had another half-million pounds of
provisions to send, but that it had limited means for transporting
them. He called on commercial airlines to make available more cargo
space on their planes to help deliver the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said he planned to send a team of city officials
next week to help the Dominican authorities coordinate the cleanup
effort and restore power to some of the hardest-hit areas. He did
not provide any additional details. He also said he would call on
Consolidated Edison for technical support to help restore power to
some areas here.

 RODDY McDOWALL, 70, CHILD STAR AND VERSATILE ACTOR  
 (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roddy McDowall, who provoked tears of sadness, sympathy and joy
from millions of moviegoers for his boyhood roles in ``How Green
Was My Valley,'' ``Lassie Come Home'' and other film classics of
the 1940s, died Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. McDowall, who
went on to become a versatile character actor on screen and on
stage, was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Robert Lantz, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy McDowall's unaffected, poignant performances in his first
Hollywood films brought him instant fame and respect as an actor.
In a career that spanned more than 60 years, he made 130 movies and
appeared in scores of plays and television dramas. He also found
time to become a skilled photographer and to publish five books of
his photos.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his work as an actor, he was known for the
company he kept. He was a friend of the famous, beginning with
Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had an extraordinarily close
relationship. They acted together in ``Lassie'' and also
``Cleopatra,'' and became friends for life.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he meet almost every artist of stature in movies
and theater, but he also photographed most of them. Although he was
one of Hollywood's great storytellers, McDowall never told tales
out of school, one key to the longevity of his friendships. As he
said, ``I'm a great believer in the private existence of public
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   In a business marked by competitiveness and cold-bloodedness, he
was known as a man to be trusted. His sense of loyalty could be
traced back to his earliest years, when he took heart and also a
moral lesson from those idealistic films that first made his
reputation. ``The experiences as a child inside those movies were a
particular life enhancement,'' he said. ``The values had great
influence in shaping my character.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Ms. Taylor, McDowall grew up in the movies, and more
than many actors who had been stars as children, he matured and
maintained his equilibrium about his celebrity. Acting, he said,
was ``like being a fruit picker _ it's seasonal,'' and no matter
how popular an actor is, he worries about his next job. His
response was to keep working, sometimes accepting assignments that
were beneath his talent, but generally finding something of value
in whatever he did.
</P>
<P>
   He tried not to concern himself with critical reaction. In his
interview, he said he had once asked Noel Coward how he was able to
survive rejection and vilification by the critics. Assuming a crisp
Coward voice, he recalled the response: ``It's perfectly simple.
They're wrrrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He loved movies and was an assiduous collector, with a large
library of films, tapes and memorabilia, including still
photographs and autographs. His knowledge of the business was so
encylopedic that if he so desired, he could have been a film
historian. In his own private way, he was an historian, and among
his many cinematic activities, he was actively engaged in the film
preservation movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been absolutely demented by the moving image,'' he
said. ``I think movies must be preserved, because they're such an
important part of our heritage. They have clocked absurdities and
monitored style and have offered a moving account of 100 years,
some of it fanciful, some of it accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   He regretted that he was too young to have been alive at ``day
one'' of the movies when audiences were first transported into a
world of the imagination. As he said, ``I would have loved to have
been part of the formation of this great art form, which nobody
knew was an art form, except Lillian Gish.''
</P>
<P>
   Roderick McDowall was born in London on Sept. 17, 1928. His
father was in the merchant marine and his mother, who had lived in
the United States as a child, had always wanted to act in the
movies. By the age of 5, he was enrolled in elocution classes. Two
years later, guided by his mother, he was acting in his first
movie, ``Murder in the Family.'' In that English mystery, he played
the brother of two young actresses, Jessica Tandy and Glynis Johns.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by his mother, he appeared in more than 20 movies,
but because he was under 14, the age allowed under a child labor
law, he had to be smuggled into film studios hiding on the floor of
a car.
</P>
<P>
   With the outbreak of World War II, he came to the United States
with his mother and his sister. Within several weeks of his arrival
he did a screen test for ``How Green Was My Valley.'' Lew
Schreiber, the casting director at 20th Century Fox, disliked him
because he was not, in the actor's words, ``cute and adorable'' in
the Hollywood tradition. When the test came on the screen,
Schreiber put his hands over the projector, and said to William
Wyler, ``You don't want to see this kid.'' But Wyler, who was
scheduled to direct the film, insisted on seeing him, and hired the
young English actor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was momentarily shelved, but young Roddy took time out
to act in Fritz Lang's ``Man Hunt.''2 wds Then then John Ford
decided he wanted to direct ``How Green Was My Valley'' and
persuaded Darryl F. Zanuck to go ahead with the project. Ford kept
the boy in the cast, and he was soon acting alongside Walter
Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara and Donald Crisp. As Huw, the youngest
member of a Welsh coal-mining family confronting tragedy, he was a
splendid combination of stoicism and sensitivity. The movie won
five Academy Awards, including one as best picture of 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The child star was quickly in great demand in Hollywood,
appearing a series of family movies surrounded by horses and dogs _
in adaptations of the Mary O'Hara novels ``My Friend Flicka'' and
its sequel ``Thunderhead: Son of Flicka,'' and in ``Lassie Come
Home,'' in which he played Lassie's loving master and Ms. Taylor
played a supporting role. He loved Lassie the collie and disliked
Flicka the horse. ``There were a lot of Flickas,'' he said, and one
of them stepped on his foot. Although the original Lassie had
doubles, there was, he said, ``only one Lassie, who was an
extraordinary dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He always rated ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come
Home'' very high, along with another, personal favorite, ``The
White Cliffs of Dover,'' in which he fulfilled one of his dreams by
acting with Irene Dunne.

UNDATED: Irene Dunne. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 18, he was still playing the role of a child. Realizing that
acting as a boy did not bear ``any relation to acting as an
adult,'' he moved to New York to study acting. He made his stage
debut in ``Young Woodley'' at the Westport Country Playhouse in
Connecticut and was soon working on Broadway in Shaw's
``Misalliance'' and playing in Shakespeare at the Stratford
Festival in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 he did three plays, ``The Doctor's Dilemma'' at the
Phoenix Theater, ``The Tempest'' at Stratford (he played Ariel to
Raymond Massey's Prospero) and ``No Time for Sergeants'' on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Often he had to fight typecasting. After playing a Southern
soldier in ``No Time for Sergeants,'' he had difficulty getting
roles as Englishmen. After acting in ``Compulsion'' on Broadway, he
was typed as a psychopath. That was followed by ``Look after
Lulu,'' ``The Fighting Cock'' and the stage musical ``Camelot,'' in
which he played Mordred.
</P>
<P>
   He also acted on television, and after about five years he
returned to the movies, eventually acting in movies as varied as
Orson Welles' production of ``Macbeth'' (he played Malcolm both on
stage and on screen), ``Cleopatra'' (he played Octavian) and the
``Planet of the Apes'' series of films.
</P>
<P>
   His other films included ``The Subterraneans,'' ``The Longest
Day,'' ``The Loved One,'' ``Lord Love a Duck,'' ``Evil Under the
Sun,'' ``Fright Night,'' ``Dead of Winter,'' ``Last Summer in the
Hamptons'' and ``The Grass Harp.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the actor who had once played such warm-hearted,
well-behaved children was in demand to play villains.
</P>
<P>
   As a collector of performances, he was outspoken about such
favorites as Laurette Taylor and Bette Davis and also about actors
who were trapped by their stardom. ``Celebrity sometimes is the
most dangerous component in the continuance of a career,'' he said.
``Certain people are wildly talented but their legend becomes the
currency in the marketplace.'' Among those underrated actors he
named Mae West, Jean Harlow, Alice Faye, Alan Ladd and Tuesday
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was back on stage in New York as Scrooge in the
musical version of ``A Christmas Carol,'' a role of the greatest
distance from him and from the character of Huw in ``How Green Was
My Valley,'' but one that he approached with his customary
diligence. As always, he looked incredibly young _ until makeup
transformed him into Dickens' elderly miser. He gave an assured
performance as the centerpiece of an otherwise overblown
production.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his sister Virginia, who lives at the Actors
Home in Los Angeles, where McDowall often visited elderly actors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roddy McDowall never turned his back on his childhood
acting, it also became something to overcome. It was, he said, a
``demon walking with you.'' He added, ``My whole life I've been
trying to prove I'm not just yesterday.'' The fact is he had to
keep reinventing himself in his many guises as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But as a student of film he also knew that yesterday's treasure,
like ``How Green Was My Valley'' and ``Lassie Come Home,'' was
eternal. Because of all his personal attachments and his memories
connected with those films, he had difficulty watching them again.
In common with other moviegoers, he would weep at the grief of the
little boy on screen.

 SCHOOLS PROMOTING EARLY STUDY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ ``Rapido, escoge un color,'' Diana Alfaro told
a pupil. Quickly, pick a color. ``Morado,'' the boy responded.
Purple. Five other second-graders holding up rectangles of
different colors quickly picked out purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muy bien,'' Mrs. Alfaro told them with a big smile.
``Excelente.''
</P>
<P>
   Still speaking in Spanish, Mrs. Alfaro asked a girl sitting on
the floor for her name. ``Rojo,'' the girl answered incorrectly.
Red. After being asked again, the girl finally answered, ``Yo me
llamo Natalie.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, in another rapid-fire Spanish lesson at Johnson
Elementary School, where second-graders take 15 minutes of Spanish
instruction every day and Senora, as all the pupils call Mrs.
Alfaro, speaks nary a word of English.
</P>
<P>
   The program at the school, part of the Princeton Regional
District, was created to help comply with 1996 state curriculum
guidelines that require foreign language instruction at the
elementary level. Within a few years, officials at the school plan
to offer Spanish to children as young as kindergarten age.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts by Princeton Regional, and by other districts
around the state, are being made as New Jersey joins a small core
of states that are raising the premium on younger students'
learning a second language.
</P>
<P>
   But while the half-dozen other states have requirements for
foreign languages in elementary schools, according to the American
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, only New Jersey is
requiring elementary students to pass a proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're placing a high value on learning another language,''
said Jay Doolan, the director of standards and professional
development with the New Jersey Department of Education. ``We feel
it's not only appropriate for competing in a shrinking world, but
that learning another language also helps you do better in your
first language.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators who back the growing national movement of beginning
foreign language instruction at an early age say, like a mantra,
that brain research has shown that at about age 10, the window of
opportunity closes for learning another language well.
</P>
<P>
   Doolan said research has shown that the study of a foreign
language enhances memorization and listening skills, and that
students who speak another language go on to score higher on the
SAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives children a sense of personal satisfaction to
communicate with someone else in another language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every school district in New Jersey will get to pick which
language, or languages, it will offer _ including American Sign
Language _ and at which grade the school wants to begin. But
starting in the 2001-2002 academic year, all fourth-graders in the
state will have to pass a proficiency test in that language, under
the state's new curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Doolan said state officials do not know how many districts, like
Princeton, have already begun putting their foreign language
program in place in the elementary schools. Among those that
already have a program, there is much variation in terms of how
long the language lessons are, how frequently they are offered and
the level of training of teachers who are instructing in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   But local school officials seemed to be united in their
complaints about the cost of the foreign language programs. They do
not receive any extra money from the state. They are also
frustrated by the demands that the new guidelines are placing on
their schedules, which are already crowded with other mandated
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   State officials suggest that districts use regular classroom
teachers, perhaps with the help of technology like the Internet, to
teach foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is cutting edge,'' said Nancy Rhodes, director
of foreign language education for the Center for Applied
Linguistics in Washington. ``It makes sense to have an assessment
to show proficiency. A lot of people are very excited about what
New Jersey is attempting to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Hoch, who is in charge of foreign language instruction for
the North Carolina Department of Education, which is seen as a
model for many other states, said her state failed in not including
a testing requirement in its legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, she said, many districts have simply not complied
with the state requirement that all schools offer foreign language
instruction in kindergarten through fifth grade. Only 40 percent to
50 percent of the state's elementary school students take a foreign
language.
</P>
<P>
   David Edwards, executive director of the Joint National
Committee for Languages, a lobbying group in Washington, said New
Jersey is responding to what parents across the nation seem to be
demanding of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant amount of the push for foreign languages in
elementary school is coming from parents, who want good jobs and
good futures for their children,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A check with about a dozen of New Jersey's 600 school districts
shows there is wide variation in how they will comply with the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County, for example, the school
district of 814 students offers an exploratory foreign language
program for third-graders during the last trimester of the year,
and then a full-year program beginning in the fourth grade, when
children study a language for 25 minutes three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement has been in place for several years, and there
are no plans to offer foreign languages at the lower grades, said
Elliot Solomon, the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect that our children will be successful on the
test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In those districts that have decided to expand their offerings
to younger children, the financial and staffing consequences have
been immense. In the Montclair Public School District in Essex
County, for example, the decision to provide foreign languages to
all of the districts' first- and second-graders has diminished the
program of one of its schools, which has been offering foreign
language to children as young as preschool for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Nishuane Elementary School, has long prided itself
on providing foreign language instruction four times a week as a
centerpiece of its magnet school philosophy, but now it will be
able to offer French and Spanish lessons only twice a week because
two language teachers will have to divide their time among more
schools in the district as the program is expanded to include all
first- and second-graders.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say they know the program will be valuable only
if they continue the instruction for each child throughout the
child's schooling. Those districts that want to offer more than one
choice in foreign language are realizing they will need a dizzying
strategy to accommodate the choices.
</P>
<P>
   In Teaneck, Janice Dowd, the instruction leader for foreign
languages, said that in putting an elementary school foreign
language program in place, school officials feared that by offering
only Spanish, they would cause the French program now offered at
the high school level to eventually die out.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate both languages, they will offer Spanish to
first-graders and French to second-graders. In the third through
fifth grades, students will take both languages, alternating by
10-week grading periods. The school hopes to add Latin and Italian
in the sixth grade, and by the seventh grade, they will allow
students to pick one language to study in depth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Princeton schools, the plan is to eventually offer
Spanish to all students from kindergarten through fifth grade. By
the time students are in middle and high school, the foreign
language classes will involve more sophisticated topics, like the
study of another culture's literature, said Martin Smith, director
of foreign language instruction. This year they are offering
Spanish only to second- and fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   In Julie Rice's second-grade classroom, most of the students
eagerly raised their hands to answer all of Mrs. Alfaro's questions
during her short Spanish class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like learning a second language,'' said Ilana Sigal, who is
8. ``I like just knowing that if somebody knows Spanish, I can talk
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher said she appreciates the students' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect age to learn another language,'' said Mrs.
Alfaro, who was recruited by the school especially for the program.
``They're not afraid of anything new. They listen. If you wait
until they're in high school, they're too busy thinking about
boyfriends and girlfriends, or they think, `Oh, I'm going to make a
mistake and look stupid.'''

TO SURVIVE, PRIVATE CLUBS SHED OLD WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-ATHLETIC-CLUB)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The decline of the Downtown Athletic Club has been
mirrored at private clubs across New York City, many of which have
been forced to close in recent years by changing fashions,
economics and their own inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``About four or five years ago, we drew up a list of 25 clubs
that had gone out of business,'' said Dan Condon of Condon,
O'Meara, McGinty and Donnelly, an accounting firm that specializes
in clubs. ``And there were only about 60 private clubs in New York
in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton and others said that the hardest hit have been clubs in
lower Manhattan, an area that lost many businesses in the late
1980s, and smaller clubs that lack gyms or private rooms where
members can stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that things have bottomed out, Condon said: Club
membership has inched up by 2 percent to 3 percent in each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   But that is too late for the City Midday, Drug and Chemical Club
at 140 Broadway, which ceased operations in December 1997. The
original City Midday Club was founded in 1901. ``There was a
decline in membership,'' said Leonard Dome, a lawyer who is
overseeing the club's demise. ``Lifestyles changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs that have survived, Condon said, have done so by
updating their menus, renovating their buildings, and easing up on
dress codes and old attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, for example, the situation began to look
rather grim at the Down Town Association, a club on Pine Street in
lower Manhattan that dates from 1860. Membership had fallen from
around 1,100 in the mid-1980s to below 500 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But the current president, Mark Altherr, said the club had
rebounded somewhat from those dark days. Today, membership has
inched up to about 580. ``We renovated the building,'' he said.
``We brought in new management and upgraded the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dutton, the president of the local chapter of the Club
Managers Association of America and the general manager of the Yale
Club, on Vanderbilt Avenue in midtown Manhattan, said that other
clubs were getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been improving the rooms, adding fitness equipment
and bringing in creative cuisine,'' he said. ``The stuffy old club
doesn't make it anymore.''

OUTDOORS: BACK TO THE PURE AND SIMPLE JOYS OF FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETE BODO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDES, N.Y. _ These days, walking any distance to go fishing is
like leaping to pluck a gleaming apple off a bough and eating it on
the spot. The scenario strikes a poignant, familiar chord in all of
us. But few people actually do it. We buy our apples at the
supermarket and when we get a chance to fish, we drive right up to
the roadside pullout beside the river and jump out, ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Richard Franklin and I decided that hiking in to fish for
brook trout in a remote pond near this upstate community in the
Catskills would be a novel way to end the trout season.
</P>
<P>
   Wild brookies, woefully sensitive and unspeakably lovely
creatures, have gone the way of walking. These days, most
flyfishers want to match wits with tough, wily brown trout or zesty
rainbows, neither of which is native to Northeastern waters.
Moreover, we can drive our loaded sports utility vehicles within
casting distance of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hapless native brookie is steadily pushed into
the ever-diminishing nook of cold, pure water by its more hardy and
flexible cousins, and by the degradation of the environment. We
sometimes forget that a creature need not be fierce to be
quintessentially wild.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into our hike, bearing unwieldy inflated float tubes on
our backs like gaudy blue-and-tan balloons, we were right back at
square one. We had taken three wrong trails, and broken a sweat in
doing so. We felt ashamed, with good reason. In his own way, each
of us was thinking, ``So it's come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   But we started off again, marching uphill, through stands of
sturdy oak, cherry, beech and ash trees. We hiked about two miles.
Then, off in the distance below us, I saw through the blazing fall
foliage the dark glint of water.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-pound porcupine, a creature with no reason to run even at
the worst of times, allowed us to approach within about 15 feet
before it flared its neck and rump to display its ivory quills. It
didn't even bother to turn head-on to confront us. The porcupine
stood sideways, regarded us and then waddled off along the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we had strapped on our flippers and plopped into the float
tubes. These rigs, ingenious variations on the inner tube, allow
anglers to maneuver and fish freely in still water of any depth.
The trade-off is that you look like a floating bathtub toy, and
feel as if you were nestled in a cushy Barcalounger. The only thing
missing is the remote.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensation is misleading, because these ``belly boats''
are quiet and unobtrusive, ideally suited for the low-impact
approach that befits fishing in remote, pristine waters.
</P>
<P>
   I called over to Richard. The ghastly echo of my voice startled
me. By virtue of its surroundings, this pond demanded absolute
silence. While neither of us had experienced that natural mandate
in a long time, we grew accustomed to it quickly. And under that
mantle of silence, wild brook trout tipped up their snouts and
gently sipped tiny yellow mayflies from the surface of the black
water.
</P>
<P>
   Brookies are neither discriminating feeders nor spectacular
fighters when stung by the hook. When it comes to that ``man vs.
fish'' thing, they just don't get it, not any more than the great
herds of bison understood the nature of the chase in the heyday of
the great buffalo hunt. They just stood there and fell when shot.
Likewise, brook trout will usually take any old fly, the gaudier
the better, if you throw it in front of them. But even that is
sometimes easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   The brookies of the pond were elusive, rising sporadically. By
the time we cast to a rise, the fish were long gone. This was not
the game of skill that flyfishers crave to play with steadily
rising trout. It was much more natural than that. Dead trees stood
like giant bones at the marshy end of the pond, and behind them the
colored hardwoods and handsome dark pines shivered in the light
breeze and sparkled in the clear sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we paddled over to some odd structures barely
visible on the far shore of the pond. It turned out that they were
part of a spillway, slab concrete and steel pipe, man-made. But in
the deep hole near the outflow we saw the fish _ half a dozen of 15
or 16 inches, with broad olive backs. The conspicuous ivory edging
on their fins identified them as brookies. The fish hung suspended
in the water like paintings on a wall. Occasionally, one would
leisurely swim a lap of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost spawning time, and the big brookies probably
gathered there because a hint of flow deceptively suggested the
existence of a tributary in which they could find ideal spawning
habitat. It didn't seem quite right to fish for them from atop a
concrete culvert, but I did anyway. I didn't catch any. I guess at
some level all of us were fooled, but I'm proud to say that we
didn't get lost hiking back out to the car.

WOOTEN'S WOES CONTINUE WITH DEATH THREAT AND TIGHTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   New York Giants safety Tito Wooten has had more to worry about
of late than the possibility of losing his starting job because of
poor play. Wooten, who has had a series of personal problems, has
received at least one death threat within the past six weeks,
according to high-ranking National Football League executives.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was taken so seriously by the Giants and NFL
officials that extra security was provided for Wooten at a home
game earlier this season and at Wooten's home.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were told that someone was planning to kill Wooten
either at Giants Stadium or his residence in New Jersey, said the
executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The team then
notified the league's security office.
</P>
<P>
   League officials say they believe the threat may have come from
a friend or family member of a woman with whom Wooten previously
had a relationship. The Giants would not comment, and NFL officials
told Wooten not to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   During his college and professional years, Wooten has had a
series of troubled relationships with women. He has been arrested
three times on charges relating to domestic violence, but in all
three cases, the women declined to seek prosecution. The most
recent case occurred last December and involved his girlfriend
Akina Wilson. She eventually dropped charges that Wooten had choked
and beaten her. In January, she committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It is not rare for an NFL player to receive threats. There have
even been cases in which gamblers phoned in fake threats to a key
player, such as a quarterback, to try to distract him into having a
bad game, the league executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But the league and the Giants considered the threat against
Wooten more serious. There was extra security in Giants Stadium for
Wooten at a home game earlier this season _ the officials would not
say which one. The league also arranged security for the fifth-year
safety at his home after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL spoke to law enforcement officials, who proceeded to
investigate the threat. It was determined by both the authorities
and the NFL that Wooten was in no immediate danger, and the extra
security lasted for only one game.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten has been having problems on the field as well recently.
He has consistently blown coverages and been beaten deep by
opposing wide receivers. Officially, he missed last week's game
against San Diego with a sore hamstring. Privately, coaches and
players say Wooten was benched because of his poor play.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Wooten's teammates think his backup, Percy Ellsworth, is
a smarter, better player. Ellsworth had two interceptions against
the Chargers last Sunday. If he continues to play well, he could be
in the starting lineup permanently.

   How to Spell Mess  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seven National Football League teams finished September without
a victory, the most there have been at the four-week juncture at
any time in the 1990s. One of the seven teams is Philadelphia,
whose situation with running back Charlie Garner is one of the most
awkward in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Garner has asked for a trade. Several teams have been interested
in him, especially Kansas City. During the off season, Garner
signed a four-year, $6.4 million contract, but because of an
injured ankle he has been mainly a backup. He refuses to speak to
reporters, and one Eagle said he barely speaks to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Garner is said to want out. So, probably, does coach Ray Rhodes,
who is miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Dogfight of the Month
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks-Steelers game in Pittsburgh last week was one of
the most physical and emotional of the season so far. The Seattle
running back Ricky Watters said he was punched, bitten and kicked
almost every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, after an exchange with the Steelers
defensive lineman Kevin Henry, Watters threw a right hook to
Henry's head. The officials did not see it, or Watters would have
been automatically kicked out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Seahawks linebacker Chad Brown, who felt heat on
and off the field. Brown was one of the best-liked Steelers when he
played linebacker for them for four years. In February 1997,
however, he signed a six-year, $24 million contract and instantly
became hated by Pittsburgh fans.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Brown made a play _ and he made a lot, with 14
tackles and a sack _ he was heavily booed. After the game, Brown,
one of the frankest and most talkative of players in the league,
voiced his opinions about Steelers players, fans and the intensity
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   On what fans said to him as he walked off the field after the
game: ``For the most part, when I came off, fans were cool,'' he
said, though some were obscene. ``How does love turn to hate? You
loved me two years ago, and you hate me now? Does your $45 obligate
you to cuss at me? If you saw me walking down the street, I'd
basically beat your behind if you cussed at me, so I don't want to
hear that garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   On his former teammate Jerome Bettis, who does a dance after a
big run: ``Bettis is going to talk. He's going to do his little
dance. The first time he tried to do it this game, I hugged him and
pushed him back to the huddle. I don't want to see that. He got a
5-yard run. Hey, you're 250 pounds, you're supposed to get a 5-yard
run.''
</P>
<P>
   On another former teammate, tight end Mark Bruener: ``He holds a
lot. You know, that's his blocking style. I give him credit. It
works. So I threw him down. He tried to kick me because he thought
I was going to try and kick him in his face. No way. I wasn't going
to get kicked out of the game. But at the same time, I don't play
that garbage. No matter what it is, I don't take it.''
</P>
<P>
   He Knows His Place
</P>
<P>
   Now that Denver's backup quarterback, Bubby Brister, is 2-0
replacing the injured John Elway (strained right hamstring), is
there a quarterback controversy? ``Hey, this is John Elway's
team,'' Brister said. ``It always has been, and it always will
be.''

NEW SETTLEMENT PLAN MAY BE NEAR IN STATES' TOBACCO LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Fla., Minn., Miss., N.C., N.D., N.Y., Okla.,
Pa., Texas, Wash.)  (js) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign that a new tobacco settlement deal may be near, state
attorneys general nationwide will be told this week about the
details of a plan intended to resolve their lawsuits against the
industry, lawyers familiar with those discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   The briefings, which are expected to begin on Tuesday, are the
strongest indication yet that negotiators representing eight states
and two major cigarette makers have resolved most major differences
between them, said those lawyers, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington
state told reporters in a telephone conference call that
negotiators still had three unresolved issues, including how to
deal with smaller producers who do not take part in a settlement.
But two lawyers who were briefed on the status of the talks said
Saturday that they believed the discussions were far more advanced
than Ms. Gregoire had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the meetings this week is to brief state
attorneys generals about the status of settlement talks and solicit
their reaction to details of the proposal, the lawyers added.
Several lawyers interviewed Saturday provided differing views on
the status of the talks, but all said they expected that a new
settlement plan would emerge soon.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is likely to cause debate among public health advocates
because it apparently contains fewer advertising and marketing
restrictions on cigarette makers than the $368.5 billion settlement
proposal reached last year between state officials and the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette producers would still be allowed to advertise their
products both inside and outside retail stores, though there may be
restrictions on the size of signs, lawyers briefed on the proposal
said. They added that the plan, at present, also did not apparently
contain restrictions on tobacco advertisements in magazines or call
for the elimination of advertising figures like the Marlboro Man.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers would also be allowed to continue existing
sponsorships of sports events like car racing, another marketing
outlet that would have been eliminated under last year's deal. That
proposal, attacked by anti-smoking groups as inadequate, collapsed
in the congressional debate earlier this year over national tobacco
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire, who is leading the states involved in the talks,
declined on Friday to discuss details of the settlement discussion.
Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, also declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the prospect of a settlement has already touched off
a sharp debate between some states over the division of settlement
proceeds, which industry analysts on Wall Street expect to reach
between $170 billion and $200 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state lawsuits were brought to recoup Medicaid
expenses for treating smoking-related illness, some officials have
advocated that settlement money be divided based on each state's
percentage of the national Medicaid population. But lawyers for
other states have contended that they should get a greater cut
because they sued earlier or worked harder to prepare their cases
against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some states that haven't done anything,'' said one
of those lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The current round of talks, which began in early June, has moved
ahead in fits and starts as tobacco producers, emboldened by a
recent string of court victories, have taken a hard line. Cigarette
makers are seeking to settle the state lawsuits because they view
them as a potential financial threat that has kept down the price
of their stock.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Washington, the states involved in the last round of
talks are California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, only two of the nation's four largest cigarette
makers _ Philip Morris Companies and Lorillard Tobacco _ have been
involved in settlement discussions. But the other two producers,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., are
expected to take part in any settlement deal, both industry and
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, tobacco producers have settled Medicaid-related
lawsuits brought by four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi
and Texas _ agreeing to pay about $36 billion over 25 years. Under
the Minnesota plan, the most sweeping of the settlements, producers
agreed, among other things, to drop all tobacco advertising on
billboards and buses, to finance smoking-cessation programs and to
refrain from making any false statements about the health effects
of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said she was optimistic about a settlement but
would be disappointed if negotiators did not achieve significantly
more than lawyers for Minnesota did.

   GREBNICKA MOUNTAIN, Yugoslavia _ Serbian authorities took
foreign reporters to a rocky crevice on this mountain Saturday to
show them four skulls and other human remains buried near a former
hideout of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   They said the remains were discovered on Friday by soldiers of
the Yugoslav Army who had reclaimed the mountain from the ethnic
Albanian separatists several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two skulls were lying on the ground at the bottom of a crevice
when the reporters arrived, along with two femurs on a path leading
to the crevice. Three laborers, supervised by technicians from the
Serbian police, lifted rocks and dug through the earth with
shovels. The laborers found two more skulls, some bones, debris
from what looked like civilian clothing and two boots. A strong
odor of decayed bodies permeated the site.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Serbian Interior Ministry police, Col.
Bozidar Filic, said it appeared that the people had been killed by
the guerrillas three or four months ago, and buried there. Col.
Filic was careful to say that there was as yet no proof of the
ethnic origins of the people killed. He said that six or seven
people, including some Serbs and two Gypsies, had been missing from
the area for the last three months. One of the missing is a Serbian
police officer, Ranko Remistar, from the nearby town of Klina, he
said. ``We can just assume these are the missing people but we
don't know,'' Filic said. ``We cannot tell for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to show the site appeared designed to counter the
international attention given to last weekend's massacre,
apparently by Serbian forces, of 18 members of an ethnic Albanian
family in the village of Gornje Obrinje and the execution of 13
ethnic Albanian men at nearby Golubovac. The official Serbian press
has called the massacre of the family a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bouckaert, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who saw
the human remains at the site Saturday, said it appeared from the
condition of the remains that they had been there for about three
months. Bouckaert said that one of the skulls had a bullet wound.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the remains raised again, Bouckaert said, the
importance of forensic experts from the war crimes tribunal in The
Hague being allowed to exhume and examine bodies from both sides in
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to investigate massacres and possible war
crimes in Kosovo has become increasingly heated. Ethnic Albanian
political leaders, who want Kosovo province to secede from Serbia,
have called for experts from the Hague tribunal to come. The
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has refused these requests,
which have also been made from Washington. Two of the tribunal's
investigators were in Kosovo last week but were not carrying
forensic equipment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were no Serbian forensic experts at the site Saturday,
which is at the end of a dirt path that winds up the mountain some
three miles southwest of Klina. Two police technicians videotaped
the site and put the remains into plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   These were to be taken to the hospital in Pec where forensic
specialists from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, would examine
them, said Veselim Cadzenovic, an investigating judge from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Cadzenovic said he was called to the site by the army and that
he asked for the Serbian forensic experts to take charge of the
remains at the Pec hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a commonly held position of Serbian officials in
Kosovo, Cadzenovic said that from what he had seen on Serbian
television the massacre of the 18 ethnic Albanian civilians of the
Deliaj family, including children and women, was ``stage managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, the Serbian authorities discovered 34 bodies
in a canal at Glodjane in central Kosovo and said they were mostly
Serbian civilians killed by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
International diplomatic monitors reported that the claims by the
Serbian authorities seemed credible.
</P>
<P>
   There was more doubt, the monitors said, about another site
discovered at Klecka in Kosovo in late August where the Serbian
authorities said 22 Serbs had been burned by the separatist
guerrillas in a lime kiln. The monitors said they were not sure
that the kiln could reach the high temperatures required to burn
the bodies.

   NEW YORK _ Dormant churches could once fend off dismemberment
because communities regarded empty houses of worship as sacred. But
in the big city today, a church that stops breathing for even a
moment is fair game for wrecking or secular conversion. In my own
neighborhood in Brooklyn _ historically known as ``the city of
churches'' _ one church has become a supermarket and several others
have been refitted as apartments. With church architecture in vogue
and shrinking congregations barely holding on, developers keep an
eye out for houses of worship that might soon go dark.
</P>
<P>
   Church watchers estimate that small, neighborhood churches are
closing their doors at the rate of about 50 a week. But while
traditional churches die out, a new strain of large,
consumer-oriented worship _ loosely known as ``the Next Church'' _
is packing in parishioners by the millions. Next churches are often
large _ some exceeding 10,000 people _ nondenominational and devoid
of standard religious vestment. Their buildings are deliberately
secular in look, resembling civic centers or campuses. Stained
glass and hymnals have given way to overhead video screens, hip
music and stadium-sized sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Many parishioners are Woodstock-era exiles who quit church as
soon they could say ``no'' to their parents. Some of these
returning exiles prefer religion without brimstone and punitive
edicts, but some are fundamentalists. The Next Church serves them
not just on Sundays, but seven days a week, in a deliberate attempt
to be all things to parishioners. The largest churches sponsor
sports leagues and offer workshops on subjects ranging from
spiritual growth and bringing up baby to money and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from size, what most distinguishes the Next Church from
its predecessors is the tenacity of its evangelizing style _ and
the businesslike intent on ``broadening God's market share,'' as
the writer Charles Trueheart put it in ``Welcome to the Next
Church,'' published in The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The new mindset is paying enormous dividends in growth,
community influence and revenue, according to Dr. John Vaughan,
whose Center for the Study of Growing Churches keeps a census of
what Vaughan calls ``megachurches,'' with memberships of 2,000 or
more. Thirty years ago, there were fewer than 10 such churches in
the United States. Today, there are nearly 500, Vaughan says. One
of the fastest growing of these churches is Saddleback Valley
Community Church in Mission Viejo, Calif., which mushroomed from a
few people in 1980 to a congregation of 14,000 today. The
Saddleback congregation's master plan calls for a sanctuary that
will seat 7,000 to 10,000, with education buildings, youth
facilities and parking structures. The price tag is $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-driving evangelism that produces this magnitude of
growth is on display at the Potters House in Dallas (congregation,
16,000), pastored by the best-selling author and ecclesiastical
celebrity Bishop T.D. Jakes. Each Sunday, the Bishop's emissaries
fan out into Dallas, picking up homeless people, who get showers,
fresh clothes and makeup before partaking of the service. One Jakes
revival reached prisons with satellite broadcasts. Last summer,
Jakes held a scriptural conference for women in Atlanta that drew
50,000 women. The bishop's message goes out through e-mail, direct
mail, pamphlets, videotapes, audiotapes and books.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Church phenomenon is certainly eye-catching. But its
growth and vivid personalities are not as unique as most people
think. In the 19th century _ long before e-mail and satellite
television _ Henry Ward Beecher built a megachurch in Brooklyn
Heights called Plymouth Church. His Sunday audience numbered 2,000.
He heightened interest by attracting national leaders like Abraham
Lincoln. A showman to the bone, Beecher dramatized the cruelties of
slavery by staging mock slave auctions, with himself in the role of
the auctioneer. When rivals called him a sensationalist, Beecher
replied that ``He is the best fisherman who catches the most
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a half-dozen ministers in the Northeast alone whose
reach and influence probably equaled Beecher's. But if we visited
their churches today, we would find most of them greatly
diminished, with less excitement and certainly more pews than
parishioners. Traditional churches have lost connection with the
evangelistic spirit that once made them powerful and vibrant
institutions. Until they reconnect with that tradition, they are in
danger of becoming stained-glass condominiums and relics of lost
religions.

EDITORIAL: A DANGEROUS POKER GAME WITH IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Oct. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In altering its approach to Iraq, the Clinton administration is
blundering into a policy that allows Saddam Hussein to rebuild a
deadly arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. That makes it
all the more repugnant that the administration is trying to
discredit and intimidate Scott Ritter, a former top U.N. weapons
inspector in Iraq who is rightly sounding an alarm about the
developments in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of economic sanctions and contested arms inspections
in Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf War have fatigued the
Security Council. Saddam has several times manipulated the
simmering confrontation to force Washington to reinforce its
military presence in the region, at considerable expense. But for
all the frustration, the clear lesson from these encounters is that
only the credible threat of force can keep Iraq from resuming its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has now muted that threat even as Saddam has blocked
the most critical avenues of inspection. Though cameras and sensors
continue to operate at suspected weapons sites, nearly all spot
inspections have been banned by the Iraqis. Baghdad's scientists
and engineers are essentially free to concoct biological and
chemical toxins at unmonitored sites and install them in bombs and
missiles. The Clinton administration, in effect, has suspended its
effort to keep Iraq from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration maintains that its restraint has
allowed the Security Council to deal directly with Iraq, giving
members a better appreciation of Saddam's defiance. The council, in
turn, has rebuffed Iraqi appeals to lift the embargo on most oil
sales. That is fine, but the embargo is just one piece of the
puzzle and the Security Council shows little desire to deal with
the rest. Even without oil revenues, Saddam has more than enough
money to finance new weapons. Absent aggressive inspection, he will
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, an American who directed and conducted inspections in
Iraq, has correctly warned that the world has largely lost its
ability to hunt down Iraqi weapons projects. He resigned in
protest, disclosing that the United States blocked several
inspections to avoid a new confrontation with Baghdad. Ritter also
reported that many of the best intelligence tips about Iraqi
activities came from Israel, an understandable source given
Israel's vulnerability to Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has been rewarded for this truth telling with a stern
warning from the United Nations, a federal criminal investigation
into his association with Israel and the ludicrous assertion of
U.S. officials that he does not know what he is talking about. This
treatment is an embarrassment to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Every day that passes without spot inspections gives Iraq more
time to re-arm. While Washington is toasting its success in uniting
the Security Council behind the embargo, Saddam is busy building
weapons that can threaten the entire Middle East.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 4:
</P>
<P>
   This week, for just the second time this century, the House of
Representatives is likely to approve an impeachment inquiry into
the conduct of a president. Given the serious charges leveled
against Bill Clinton by Kenneth Starr _ and the need to have those
charges resolved in an open, orderly way _ that decision is
justified and will be supported by many Democrats. But how the
inquiry is conducted is a matter that requires very careful
consideration by the American people and their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With midterm elections just a month away, the political conflict
promises to be intense. But it need not be disabling, if sensible
rules are adopted and followed. The plan proposed by the Republican
majority looks sound and fair.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially the model used 24 years ago by a
Democratically controlled House in examining the conduct of Richard
Nixon in the Watergate case. It sets no limits on the duration or
dimensions of the inquiry. Democratic leaders on Friday urged the
House to set a late-November deadline for completion of the
Judiciary Committee's work, and to limit the investigation to the
Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Though this page favors the expeditious handling of this case,
and believes it could eventually be resolved through a censure that
would allow Clinton to remain in office, an artificial timetable
serves no useful purpose. It only invites the White House to stall
and forces the committee to rush its work. Though Americans are
impatient with the Lewinsky scandal, a snap inquiry would be a
disservice to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no reason for the committee to fence off
Whitewater, the dismissal of staff at the White House travel office
and the White House misuse of FBI background files, matters still
being investigated by Starr. Those who complain that Starr has
spent too much time and money investigating Clinton cannot now
argue that the results of that work should be denied to Congress,
if they are germane.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr must tell the Judiciary Committee right away if he has
additional evidence of impeachable offenses by Clinton. The
committee, for its part, must assure that marginal matters are not
added to its investigation. Nor should the 1996 campaign-finance
abuses be included in this inquiry, since Attorney General Janet
Reno seems to be moving toward the long overdue appointment of an
independent counsel in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The natural contours of an impeachment inquiry accommodate two
converging avenues of work, one dealing with the evidence, the
other with the constitutional question of what constitutes an
impeachable offense. The Judiciary Committee has wisely chosen to
consider these in tandem, with the expectation that each inquiry
will inform the other.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the committee, has proposed
other sensible rules, including subpoena power for the Democrats,
public hearings and ample opportunity for the White House to defend
the president and to contest the committee's work. He has also
authorized a bipartisan group of members to review Starr's files
for exculpatory evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both constitutional and practical considerations
argue for keeping the process moving under clear rules. On the
first point, the charges against Clinton cannot now be ignored or
allowed to linger. They must be resolved in the way described by
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On the practical side, gearing up this somber constitutional
process will provide incentive for the Republican congressional
leadership and the White House to try to find a settlement that
respects both political continuity and the rule of law.

POLICE SAY IMMIGRANT HAD STROKE IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family of a 53-year-old Haitian man who underwent
emergency surgery hours after being taken into police custody is
asking for an investigation to determine whether he had been beaten
by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ulrick Charles remained in critical but stable condition
Saturday at Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was admitted on
Sept. 24. His son, Jean Robert Charles, said at a news conference
Saturday that his father was in a coma. He said his father had been
``in perfect health'' before he was taken into police custody.
</P>
<P>
   The son and two lawyers representing the family could provide no
direct evidence of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode on Saturday reiterated
an earlier police statement that Charles' arrest and his condition
were not related. ``The man had a stroke,'' Ms. Mode said. ``He
apparently collapsed and was in some sort of seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   A police statement about the incident said the hospital's
emergency-room physician told investigators that Charles had
extremely high blood pressure and suffered a stroke when a blood
clot formed on his brain. Surgery was necessary to relieve the
pressure on the brain caused by the clot, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Sept. 24, Charles surrendered to officers at
the Brooklyn South Task Force on a warrant that his lawyers said
had been issued for his failure to display a city license in his
automobile shop.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later, the lawyers said, Charles' family
received a telephone call from hospital officials, informing them
that Charles had undergone surgery to remove a blood clot on his
brain. When relatives arrived at the hospital after the surgery,
the lawyers said, they found Charles unconscious and handcuffed to
a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was put into police custody perfectly healthy and within 20
minutes he was completely unconscious and needing medical
attention,'' said Eric Poulos, one of the family's lawyers. Michael
Ratner, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, is also
representing the family.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Charles' son questioned whether undue
police force contributed to his father's condition. He said there
were bruises on his father's face. He said his brother, Jean Ulrick
Charles Jr., overheard a police officer telling an emergency-room
worker that the police had used force while handcuffing their
father at the Brooklyn South station house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to indicate that,'' Ms. Mode said. She said the
police were investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of police brutality is particularly sensitive among
Haitian immigrants. On Friday night, the Charles family received
support at Brooklyn Hospital Center from Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant who has accused officers in the 70th Precinct of
torturing him last year.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos and Ratner said police officers visited Charles' Brooklyn
automobile-repair shop a few months ago. After the officers
inspected the shop, the lawyers said, they issued a summons for
failing to display the original copy of a city license required to
operate a compressor.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos and Ratner said that Charles did have a license and that
a photocopy of it hung in his shop. They said his son had offered
to run home from the shop and bring back the original, an offer
rejected by the police officers. In the following weeks, the
lawyers said, Charles twice appeared in court, but the case was
postponed both times at the request of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos said Charles apparently missed a third court date, which
caused Brooklyn Criminal Court to issue a bench warrant. When
Charles received the warrant last week, he called the Brooklyn
South station house and arranged to appear on the morning of Sept.
24, Ratner said. Charles arrived with Jean Ulrick Charles Jr. and
was informed that he would need to clear up the matter in court.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Charles was taken to Criminal Court at 9:40
a.m., where he suffered a seizure. On Sept. 25, a letter addressed
to the precinct commanding officer stated that the warrant against
Charles had been vacated because the case had been dismissed.

FULLBACK WHO STOPS FOR NO ONE, EVEN TEAMMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By GRANT GLICKSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Pinnock, an all-America fullback, says that he
truly cares about his Bloomfield (Conn.) high school teammates. He
just has a funny way of showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to run people over in practice,'' he said. ``I feel
that in order to get everybody pumped up, I need to start off with
a big pop.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a pop when Pinnock, a 6-foot, 250-pounder, decides to
lower his shoulder and barrel over a defender. After each hit,
those capable of gaining their feet usually plead with him to stop.
But Pinnock, who doubles as a defensive end, refuses to relent. ``I
like my teammates,'' he said, ``but I like the intensity of
practice. It is important that we get ready for our games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Bloomfield, the defending Class S
champion, has prepared for its games as well as any team in the
state. The Warhawks has reached five straight state title games,
and last season's 12-0 team boasted Connecticut's top-ranked
offense, scoring 552 points, including 70 points on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield (2-0), which took on Avon-Old Farms (1-1) Saturday,
is the favorite to capture the Class S title again this season.
Pinnock is joined by three other Division I prospects: Kevin Moore,
an offensive and defensive back; Daemeon Grier, a 300-pound
defensive lineman; and Darrell Shabazz, a speedy outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a great work ethic,'' said Jack Cochran, who has
compiled a 55-8-2 record since becoming Bloomfield's coach in 1992.
``These kids are hungry and their goal is to be No. 1 in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cochran, Pinnock could be the team's model for work
ethic, on the field and off. Pinnock has taken great pride in
overcoming a learning disability. And while football has always
come naturally for Pinnock _ he is a powerful runner who has run
the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds _ he can usually be found one hour
after practice running through his own regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pinnock joined the track team to work on his speed.
In an effort to help build his body, as a junior he also
participated in a state weight-lifting competition. Bloomfield won
the competition, largely because Pinnock placed first in squats
(550) and second in bench pressing (375) and power clean-and-jerk
(268).
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, Pinnock's work has been even more determined.
In his sophomore year, Pinnock showed that he no longer belonged in
a special education program. He now takes modified mainstream
courses, and he should have no trouble qualifying for a scholarship
under National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. Kentucky,
Michigan, North Carolina State, Penn State, Tennessee and Syracuse
have all shown interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnock, one of two children, has held a job _ ranging from
social work for the Northwest Boys and Girls Club to data entry
with Phoenix Home Life, where his mother, Patricia, worked _ since
he was of legal age. He has followed his mother's lead: Patricia
Pinnock has worked double shifts since her children's father
abandoned them when Andrew was in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid is a great success story,'' Cochran said. ``He
deserves all the recognition that he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinnock, with 5,470 yards rushing and 60 touchdowns, is closing
in on state career records in both. Rashon Spikes, now with North
Carolina State, scored 77 touchdowns for Maloney High from 1992 to
1995, and Kyle McIntosh, now with Syracuse, holds the Connecticut
rushing record with 7,400 yards at Cheshire High from 1991-94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my coach at the beginning of the year that I wasn't
going to put pressure on myself to break those records,'' Pinnock
said. ``That I was going to go out and play hard and let the
records take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only concern that I have now,'' he continued, ``is leading
this team back to a championship and taking care of business in
school.''

MOYNIHAN BACKS SCHUMER AS CRUCIAL TO PARTY IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Warning that Democrats in the U.S. Senate were
``perilously close'' to losing even minimal influence over that
body's deliberations, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan on Saturday
urged the election of Rep. Charles Schumer, saying he would help
block the passage of ``radical, reactionary legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare foray into a New York state campaign, Moynihan went to
the house where Schumer grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, to hold a
news conference and voice his support for the congressman, the
Democratic candidate for the Senate seat held by Alfonse M.
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 71, looking grim as he framed the emerging consensus
among Democrats in Washington, warned that the party was in danger
of dropping below its 45-seat minority _ and, in fact, might emerge
from the November election with less than the 40 votes it needs to
sustain a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go perilously close to a point where we can't
use a blocking 40 votes against radical, reactionary legislation,''
Moynihan said. ``The more, then, do we need a Chuck Schumer, who
will not be there just to vote, but to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the endorsement by a Democratic senator of a
Democratic candidate for Senate would be less than surprising. But
this case is noteworthy because Moynihan has long enjoyed cordial
relations with D'Amato _ whose name he did not mention once on
Saturday _ and because Moynihan has frequently been criticized for
failing to tend to the parochial needs of the Democratic Party and
its candidates in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, there was much curiosity, even among Schumer's
supporters, over whether Moynihan would venture an opinion on
D'Amato's campaign advertisements attacking Schumer as a Brooklyn
liberal who is out of touch with the interests of voters upstate,
where Moynihan lives.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Moynihan never answered those questions. As
the news conference proceeded, the senator looked increasingly
flushed. When Moynihan was asked if he considered D'Amato's
campaign divisive, the senator appeared confused and his speech was
halting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to go over there and sit down for a
minute,'' Moynihan said. ``I have a fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who was watching Moynihan's difficulties with evident
concern, said, ``The senator had a cold and wasn't going to come
today and then decided to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, assisted by Schumer and aides, Moynihan walked stiffly
over to a folding chair in the back of the postage stamp of a yard
where Schumer grew up and tried unsuccessfully to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you mind if I just went off to the car?'' Moynihan
inquired. ``You can answer all those questions. I've got the
damnedest flu.'' Moynihan than left.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan called from Washington later in the day, saying that he
had been battling a flu for much of the last three days and had
decided to try to return home to recuperate. In response to a
question, Moynihan said he did not think that D'Amato had been
doing anything unfair _ or, for that matter, unusual _ in stoking
regional divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfectly normal pattern of political statement,''
Moynihan said. ``It's the way things are done. George Washington
Plunkett once said, `New York City is pie for the hayseeds.' That
kind of perception goes back and forth. In upstate, you'll find the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan declined to comment on Schumer's advertisements, which
accuse D'Amato of lying. ``I don't want to get near that subject,''
Moynihan said. ``I'm not aware of it. As you might be aware, we
have a lot going on down there.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Moynihan declined to offer any critical words about
Schumer's opponents. ``I'm for Schumer,'' he said, before ending
the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan could help Schumer by rebutting D'Amato's portrayal of
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has also endorsed Peter Vallone, the New York City
Council speaker, in the race for governor, and has campaigned for
him at times. Schumer's campaign manager, Josh Isay, said he hoped
that the senator would do the same thing for Schumer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schumer's aides were clearly unsettled by Saturday's news
conference. Nonetheless, they portrayed Moynihan's endorsement as a
boost for Schumer, noting that in 1992, the senator did not endorse
D'Amato's Democratic rival, Robert Abrams, until Oct. 19. Moynihan
as a rule refrains from criticizing D'Amato, and the two frequently
attend events together that serve them both well politically. (
Moynihan and Schumer are to appear at a news conference on acid
rain in Washington on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides said they were not worried about the endorsement
and quickly came up with examples in which Moynihan had been
equally nice to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Moynihan has been quoted as saying that Senator
D'Amato is passionate and detailed in his work for New York
state,'' said Harvey Valentine, D'Amato's campaign spokesman.
``It's more extraordinary that a Democratic leader like Senator
Moynihan would have this high praise for Al D'Amato than a
perfunctory endorsement for Chuck Schumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he avoided mentioning D'Amato, Moynihan offered warm
words for the representative from Brooklyn. He credited him for
sponsoring legislation to restrict the spread of guns. He noted,
approvingly, that Schumer was one of the Democrats who voted for
legislation that used tax increases and spending cuts to eliminate
the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he and Schumer had made a practice of having
dinner together once a month for 20 years. ``He is an extraordinary
legislator with an unequalled record of achievements in the House
of Representatives,'' he said.

WHERE HAS JUREVICIUS GONE? HE MAY REAPPEAR SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was supposed to be the secret weapon in the New York Giants'
passing attack this season, but he has been kept in hiding so well
that some fans may have forgotten he was on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner rather than later, it's likely that the Giants rookie
wide receiver Joe Jurevicius will get another chance to show why
the team made him its second-round draft pick out of Penn State
this spring. The mystery is why he hasn't seen more action already.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch Jurevicius was the team leader during the
preseason in every receiving category _ passing yards (218),
average gain per catch (27.3), receptions (8) and longest gain (59)
_ but since the second quarter of the opening game of the regular
season, he has barely stepped onto the playing field except for his
role on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   With his size and surprisingly good downfield speed, Jurevicius
was supposed to be the big-target wide receiver the Giants
desperately need on a receiving corps that lacked height. And he
immediately impressed his coaches in summer training camp as a
polished, poised receiver with good hands.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 14 quarters since he caught a 22-yard pass in the
second quarter of the Giants' opener against Washington, Jurevicius
has had two balls thrown his way _ both were incomplete passes
during garbage time at the end of a Giants defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the Giants' victory at San Diego, Jurevicius
didn't get onto the field for a single play from scrimmage. The
week before, he was in on just a few plays. When the team has gone
to four-wide-receiver sets, Jurevicius has been the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   He is the fifth receiver on a team that dresses five receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Comella, an undrafted rookie fullback, has had twice as
many balls thrown his way as Jurevicius has. Comella has caught one
pass for 3 yards. David Patten, the team's fourth receiver, has had
three times as many balls thrown his way and has one reception for
5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a natural suspicion _ this being a team sport with
lots of strict rules, regulations and a complex set of plays _ that
Jurevicius has got on someone's bad side, that maybe he missed a
meeting or a curfew, or hasn't sufficiently learned the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason he hasn't been out there is he's playing
behind Chris Calloway,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said, referring to
the team's most experienced and reliable receiver, whose 20
receptions tie him for the team lead with Ike Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing Joe hasn't done. Sometimes it's just hard to get
on the field when the guy in front of you is such a good player.
But you'll see Joe again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius, team officials said, has also been slowed by a toe
injury sustained in the final preseason game and by some other foot
ailments, although he has been healthy enough to play on special
teams. The biggest factor, the coaches have said, is that the
Giants have some depth at wide receiver for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, for Joe to play we're taking somebody off the field
who's been playing pretty good,'' the Giants' receivers coach,
Jimmy Robinson, said. ``If Calloway comes out, you're taking out a
guy who has touchdowns in three of the four games we've played. And
Amani Toomer has emerged as the third receiver. He has caught six
balls, and two of them were for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing because we've got some very capable people,
Joe being one of them. But we're not displeased with him. His time
will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius does not seem upset by his lack of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait and see,'' he said, perhaps knowing his role could
increase in Sunday's game with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ``I'm
confident they believe in my abilities or they wouldn't have
drafted me where they did. My job on this team right now is on
special teams.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unintentionally, it is on the punt team that Jurevicius has
drawn the most notice. He has twice been called for 15-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. The first was for a hardly
perceptible shove of an opponent at or after the whistle, and the
second for supposedly blocking after the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties were so borderline in the view of the Giants
coaches that they didn't reprimand Jurevicius for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches didn't say a thing,'' said Jurevicius, whose
greatest contribution to the Giants this season might be as a tall
receiver when the offense is near the goal line. ``That's just one
of those things. Maybe they're just picking on the rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone besides the referees could be singling out Jurevicius in
games to come. At 6-5 and 230 pounds, he's too big to keep hidden
for long.

EMBRACED AT WRIGLEY, SOSA SEES HOPE FOR CUBS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Who could blame Sammy Sosa for not wanting this season
to end? He hit a remarkable 66 home runs, leading the Chicago Cubs
to the post-season for the first time since 1989. He battled Mark
McGwire with class during a historic home run race that mesmerized
the sports world. And during his joyous ride, Sosa has been
embraced by fans everywhere, as he was in Atlanta on Wednesday and
Thursday, when he received a standing ovation on both days before
his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has refused to believe he has come this far, and
accomplished this much, only to see the Cubs eliminated by the
Atlanta Braves. So as he prepared for Saturday night's Game 3, with
the Cubs trailing 2-0 in the three-of-five-game series, Sosa
sounded more confident than concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably going to come back and win three in a row,''
said Sosa, looking forward to swinging his bat Saturday in front of
the home faithful at Wrigley Field. ``We've done it before, and we
are probably going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Sosa did on Saturday night, he knew Wrigley would
be rocking with Cubs fans, eager to see their team extend its
season at least another day. Chicago was 51-31 at home this year,
and the Cubs hoped the atmosphere created by their supporters would
help shift momentum their way.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa gets an adrenaline rush at Wrigley just by hearing people
react when he steps onto the field. The love affair between Sosa
and Cubs fans is strong, and instead of being flustered by spending
a season in the spotlight, Sosa has basked in the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life
in Chicago,'' said Sosa. ``It has been unbelievable. I have a lot
of respect for the fans in Chicago. They have always been there for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs, who have not won a World Series since 1908,
entered Saturday's game on the verge of falling short again. And
how Sosa fared Saturday will probably go a long way toward
determining Chicago's fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the series at Turner Field, Sosa went
2 for 7 with a double and a single, but he was still looking for
his first rbi or home run. Blame the Braves' excellent pitching,
and their refusal to give Sosa much to hit until his teammates
prove they can pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago entered Saturday night's game batting .150 in the
series, and key players like Mark Grace (0 for 8), Gary Gaetti (0
for 7), and Lance Johnson (1 for 8) were all struggling. Meanwhile,
the Cubs faced another potentially frustrating experience Saturday
against Greg Maddux, Atlanta's starter and four-time Cy Young Award
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was a career .290 hitter against Maddux (9 for 31) entering
Saturday's game, but Maddux has handled Gaetti (.235), Grace (.222)
and Johnson (.200) in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for another possible pitchers' duel, with the
Cubs relying on their 21-year-old rookie phenom, Kerry Wood, to
help keep their season alive. The last time Wood faced the Braves,
on July 21, he outpitched Maddux and led Chicago to a 3-0 victory,
striking out 11 batters in 7 2/3 innings. But Wood has not pitched
since Aug. 31, sidelined by a sore elbow, and nobody knew if he
would have the stamina or control to pitch effectively on a chilly
night after a long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, however, liked the idea of having Wood on the mound.
``Kerry Wood is like Randy Johnson of the Astros,'' said Sosa. ``We
have a lot of confidence in Kerry. He's going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs were not ready for the season to end, and Sosa
entered Saturday night's game still with visions of playing in the
World Series. Considering Chicago's 2-0 deficit, a World Series was
a long shot for the Cubs. But who believed Sosa would hit 66 home
runs when the season started? Who believed that he would drive in
158 runs? Who believed he would be the leading candidate for the
Most Valuable Player Award? Until the series was over, Sosa planned
to keep swinging. There would be plenty of time later to savor the
memories. ``I've got everything on video,'' said Sosa. ``After the
year's over, I'll be at home relaxing and I will play the tape. And
believe me, I'm going to jump.''

COMMENTARY: THE PATH BACK TO DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., for use with CLINTON-STARR-RDP)  
 (Gerald R. Ford, the 38th president of the United States, was a
Republican member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to
1973.)  
 (bl)  
 By GERALD R. FORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Almost exactly 25 years have passed since
Richard Nixon nominated me to replace the disgraced Spiro Agnew as
vice president. In the contentious days of autumn 1973, my
confirmation was by no means assured. Indeed, a small group of
House Democrats, led by Bella Abzug, risked a constitutional crisis
in order to pursue their own agenda. ``We can get control and keep
control,'' Ms. Abzug told the speaker of the House, Carl Albert.
The group hoped, eventually, to replace Nixon himself with Albert.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, true to form, refused to have anything to do with
the scheme. And so on Dec. 6, 1973, the House voted 387-35 to
confirm my nomination in accordance with the 25th Amendment to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When I succeeded to the presidency, in August 1974, my immediate
and overriding priority was to draw off the poison that had seeped
into the nation's bloodstream during two years of scandal and
sometimes ugly partisanship. Some Americans have yet to forgive me
for pardoning my predecessor. In the days leading up to that hugely
controversial action, I didn't take a poll for guidance, but I did
say more than a few prayers. In the end I listened to only one
voice, that of my conscience. I didn't issue the pardon for Nixon's
sake, but for the country's.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, Americans once again confront the specter of
impeachment. From the day, last January, that the Monica Lewinsky
story first came to light, I have refrained publicly from making
any substantive comments. I have done so because I haven't known
enough of the facts _ and because I know all too well that a
president's responsibilities are, at the best of times, onerous. In
common with the other former presidents, I have had no wish to
increase those burdens. Moreover, I resolved to say nothing unless
my words added constructively to the national discussion.
</P>
<P>
   This much now seems clear: whether or not President Clinton has
broken any laws, he has broken faith with those who elected him. A
leader of rare gifts, one who set out to change history by
convincing the electorate that he and his party wore the mantle of
individual responsibility and personal accountability, the
president has since been forced to take refuge in legalistic
evasions, while his defenders resort to the insulting mantra that
``everybody does it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that everybody doesn't do it is the genuine
outrage occasioned by the president's conduct and by the efforts of
some White House surrogates to minimize its significance or savage
his critics.
</P>
<P>
   The question confronting us, then, is not whether the president
has done wrong, but rather, what is an appropriate form of
punishment for his wrongdoing. A simple apology is inadequate, and
a fine would trivialize his misconduct by treating it as a mere
question of monetary restitution.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president is not the only one who stands
before the bar of judgment. It has been said that Washington is a
town of marble and mud. Often in these past few months it has
seemed that we were all in danger of sinking into the mire.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after leaving it, I still consider myself a
man of the House. I never forget that my elevation to the
presidency came about through congressional as well as
constitutional mandate. My years in the White House were devoted to
restoring public confidence in institutions of popular governance.
Now as then, I care more about preserving respect for those
institutions than I do about the fate of any individual temporarily
entrusted with office.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I think the time has come to pause and consider the
long-term consequences of removing this president from office based
on the evidence at hand. The president's hairsplitting legalisms,
objectionable as they may be, are but the foretaste of a protracted
and increasingly divisive debate over those deliberately imprecise
words ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The Framers, after all,
dealt in eternal truths, not glossy deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Moving with dispatch, the House Judiciary Committee should be
able to conclude a preliminary inquiry into possible grounds for
impeachment before the end of the year. Once that process is
completed, and barring unexpected new revelations, the full House
might then consider the following resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Each year it is customary for a president to journey down
Pennsylvania Avenue and appear before a joint session of Congress
to deliver his State of the Union address. One of the binding
rituals of our democracy, it takes on added grandeur from its
surroundings _ there, in that chamber where so much of the American
story has been written, and where the ghosts of Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower call succeeding
generations to account.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a very different kind of presidential appearance in the
closing days of this year, not at the rostrum familiar to viewers
from moments of triumph, but in the well of the House. Imagine a
president receiving not an ovation from the people's
representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members
of both parties. I emphasize: this would be a rebuke, not a
rebuttal by the president.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, by his appearance the president would accept
full responsibility for his actions, as well as for his subsequent
efforts to delay or impede the investigation of them. No spinning,
no semantics, no evasiveness or blaming others for his plight.
</P>
<P>
   Let all this be done without partisan exploitation or
mean-spiritedness. Let it be dignified, honest and, above all,
cleansing. The result, I believe, would be the first moment of
majesty in an otherwise squalid year.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who confuses this scenario with a slap on the wrist, or a
censure written in disappearing ink, underestimates the historic
impact of such a pronouncement. Nor should anyone forget the power
of television to foster indelible images in the national memory _
not unlike what happened on the solemn August noontime in 1974 when
I stood in the East Room and declared our long national nightmare
to be over.
</P>
<P>
   At 85, I have no personal or political agenda, nor do I have any
interest in ``rescuing'' Bill Clinton. But I do care, passionately,
about rescuing the country I love from further turmoil or
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   More than a way out of the current mess, most Americans want a
way up to something better. In the midst of a far graver national
crisis, Lincoln observed, ``The occasion is piled high with
difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.'' We should
remember those words in the days ahead. Better yet, we should be
guided by them.

 &HT;    Thrashers scouting their future
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell was relating a phone
conversation he just had with team scout John Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's up in Moose Jaw today,'' Waddell said. ``He's going to go
watch Kootenay play tonight. But he's staying in Prince Albert.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Albert?
</P>
<P>
   ``To give you a reference point, it's about two hours north of
Saskatoon.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say if Gill would be departing on the noon balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League has not returned to Atlanta quite
yet. The extent of the Thrashers' participation this season will be
preparing scouting reports on amateur players from Moose Jaw,
Prince Albert and other remote Canadian outposts, and evaluating
lesser NHL players in more accessible cities. It is from those
talent pools that Waddell and his scouting staff will stock the
Thrashers' first roster in expansion and entry drafts next June.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell will meet with his staff this week to share his
philosophy on scouting. ``I'm not impressed with guys who tell me
they know 1,000 players,'' he said. ``We all know 1,000 players.
I'd rather know a lot about fewer players than a little about a lot
of players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I send somebody to scout the Red Wings, I don't need him to
come back with scouting reports on Steve Yzerman and Niklas
Lidstrom. We need to focus on the bottom half of rosters. If you go
to a game and focus on 10 players on each team, you can pick up on
tendencies a lot easier than if you're trying to watch every guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell, assistant general manager Les Jackson, NHL scout Murray
Oliver and two part-time scouts will concentrate mostly on NHL
games, with plans to see about 400 this season. Waddell himself
expects to attend 125 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other full- and part-timers will focus on Canadian
amateurs, U.S. collegians and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   With Atlanta's rookie draft picks likely spending at least a
year in the minor leagues, the team's roster for the 1999-2000
season mostly will be made up of third- and fourth-line veterans
from existing teams. In the expansion draft, each team can protect
15 players (one goalie, five defensemen and nine forwards) or 12
(two goalies, three defensemen, seven forwards) on its 24-man
roster. First- and second-year players are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will take special interest in how Washington,
Florida, Carolina and Tampa Bay fare in the newly formed Southeast
Division, Atlanta's future home. For now, it appears the weakest of
the six divisions. ``I'd like to know going in if it's going to be
a black-and-blue division or a highly skilled division,'' Waddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the expansion Nashville Predators also will be of
interest to Waddell. The Predators traded several expansion draft
picks for future amateur picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really building for four, five years out,'' he said.
``We want to be competitive right away. I'm sure they do, too, but
I don't know if we could (have the same philosophy).''
</P>
<P>
   And, no, Waddell won't hire a coach soon. He said about a dozen
qualified candidates have contacted him _ as well as 20 others _
but added, ``I won't even start dealing with it until after
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   There are too many games to see.

<P>
   THREE FOR THE CUP
</P>
<P>
   1. Philadelphia: An upgrade in goal (John Vanbiesbrouck) and a
motivated Eric Lindros (playing for a long-term contract) might be
just the thing to push the talented Flyers over the top _ if coach
Roger Nielson doesn't get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   2. Buffalo: The Sabres failed to adequately improve their
offense. But coach Lindy Ruff has been able to squeeze the most out
of his players, and goalie Dominik Hasek has carried teams before.
Just ask the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   3. New Jersey: Players say they enjoy the looser atmosphere with
Jacques Lemaire gone. The question is whether new coach Robbie
Ftorek can match his success. Having Martin Brodeur and Bobby Holik
helps.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE HUNT
</P>
<P>
   1. Washington: The Capitals overachieved to reach the finals. To
take the next step, they need to come up with another scorer than
Peter Bondra (52 goals) and hope goalie Olaf Kolzig's 1997-98
season (2.20 goals-against average) wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   2. Boston: Pat Burns is one of the league's best coaches. The
Bruins have young talented forwards in Jason Allison, Sergei
Samsonov and Joe Thornton. And Byron Dafoe has solidified the
goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK OUT BELOW
</P>
<P>
   1. Pittsburgh: The retired Mario Lemieux cannot collect deferred
salary. Team ownership and finances are a mess. Center Ron Francis
signed with Carolina as a free agent. Petr Nedved, who sat out last
season with contract problems, is threatening to do it again unless
traded. Defenseman Darius Kasparaitis could be lost for the season
with a torn knee ligament. And Jaromir Jagr may not be able to hold
the pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   2. N.Y. Islanders: GM-coach Mike Milbury inquired about the
Thrashers GM job, that's how much he wanted to stay. Last year's 30
wins may look good by the end of the year to the cash-strapped,
goal-starved team.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Well-traveled goalie Sean Burke, on signing with Florida, which
lost Vanbiesbrouck and failed to land Mike Richter or Felix Potvin
as a replacement: ``I look at the situation and see Florida as a
team that underachieved last year, and I personally underachieved
and maybe that's a good situation.'' Huh? ... Potvin has been at
the center of more trade rumors than any other player since Toronto
signed Curtis Joseph as its starter. ... Most creative offseason
maneuver goes to the Islanders' legal counsel, which claimed the
team was ``constructively evicted'' from ``uninhabitable'' Nassau
Coliseum. After moving training camp to Lake Placid for 17 days,
county officials obtained a restraining order, temporarily tying
the team to the aforementioned slum. ... The early massive
rationalization award goes to new Florida coach Terry Murray, who
was hired by his brother, GM Bryan Murray: ``Coaches and GMs are
tied together no matter what the relationship is, whether it's a
brother relationship or not.'' ... If commissioner Gary Bettman
wants the league to go global, here's his poster child: Devils
rookie center Scott Gomez was born in Anchorage, Alaska, to parents
of Mexican and Colombian descent and is the first Hispanic to go in
the first round.

 &HT;    Out with the old ...
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As players grumble about messing with tradition and coaches
whine about their clutch-and-mug defensive systems being
sterilized, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman focuses on something he
deems far more important: The red light behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman wants to see it flash more often, signalling a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses have gone over the edge,'' Bettman said. ``We had to
do something to not only stop the trend but go in the other
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL heads into the season, which opens Friday, seemingly
going in different directions at once. Fan base remains strong,
four expansion franchises have committed a combined $320 million in
signup fees and a new five-year, $600 million television contract
with Disney is in place _ assuring that every player in some way,
shape or form is a Mighty Duck.
</P>
<P>
   However, the league also saw its already anemic TV ratings slip
last season, salaries have skyrocketed to where they are outpacing
revenues and up to 20 of 26 teams claim to have lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, however, views things through a rose-colored goalie's
mask. He believes things will work themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing perceptions of declining interest, the commissioner
and his lieutentants concluded the problems center on goal scoring.
Or lack thereof. Last year's average of 5.3 goals per game was down
a full goal from two years earlier, three goals from a high of 8.3
in 1981-82, and represented the lowest output since a 5.1 average
in 1955-56.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is a redesigned playing surface and new rules. The
goal lines have been moved from 11 to 13 feet from the end boards,
creating more space behind the nets for skating and playmaking. The
goal crease was shrunk, creating more freedom in front and
potentially cutting down on goals that had been disallowed for
being in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   New restrictions on a goaltender's equipment also will be
enforced to prevent them from getting an edge. Example: an
oversized jersey that hangs below the armpits and assists in a
save.
</P>
<P>
   And the league is increasing the number of whistles on the ice.
Each team will play 20 regular-season games with two referees
instead of one, the intent being to increase the flow of the game
by cracking down on neutral zone obstruction penalties and cheap
shots behind the play.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe this is an experiment, as evidenced by the fact no
commitment for the playoffs has been made. But the league is
calling it a ``phase-in process,'' giving more officials adequate
time to be trained.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said goal-scoring is up slightly in the preseason and he
expects the trend to continue. But not all are thrilled. Even
Anaheim forward Paul Kariya, whom the rules are meant to benefit,
said, ``I've always said the game is terrific the way it is. If the
game is (officiated properly) and referees are given the mandate to
call hooking and holding, the games will open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules aside, this season won't be short of changes. The phasing
in of four new teams _ Nashville this season, Atlanta in 1999-2000,
Minnesota and Columbus the year after _ led to restructuring of the
two conferences into six divisions. Detroit, seeking its third
straight Stanley Cup, will start the year without head coach Scotty
Bowman, who is uncertain of returning because of health concerns.
The Red Wings face strong challenges from Dallas, Philadelphia and
Colorado, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As long as everybody scores more, Bettman will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league, from a whole variety of standpoints, has never
been stronger,'' he said. ``We don't think we've made radical
changes. We just needed to tweak some things. All sports leagues do
it. We're the guardians of this game and we have to monitor it.''

REAL ESTATE: CUTTING DOWN ON HOUSEHOLD CLUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Va.)  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Organizing a household almost always involves one crucial word:
clutter. ``Most people I deal with have too much stuff,'' said
Linda Rothschild, head of Cross It Off Your List, a professional
organizer and moving consultant in Manhattan. ``And most people
with too much stuff have their stuff in all the wrong places.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, she said, ``stuff'' falls into three categories: useful
things that are available when needed; useful things that are lost;
and lost things that wouldn't be useful even if found. The latter
two, she said, constitute clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have a tremendous resistance to getting rid of
things,'' Ms. Rothschild said. ``I'm convinced that a lot of people
don't even know what they really have. And when you let things go
like that for a while, you end up with one overwhelming mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy for dealing with household clutter, Ms.
Rothschild said, is to assess what you have in terms of what you
need. ``Are you really going to read that book or magazine again?''
she said, addressing one of clutter's most fertile areas: printed
material. ``And do you really need to keep that ratty old sweater
you got from your first boyfriend?''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with printed material, she said, is to get
a file cabinet and use it judiciously. ``Papers need a place to
live,'' she said. ``So every home needs a file cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a specific place to store papers and documents, she said,
makes a person address clutter's primary cause: indecision. Either
a piece of paper is important enough to keep or it isn't. If it is,
file it; if it isn't, put it in the recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
   When organizing closets, Ms. Rothschild said, the thing to do
after getting rid of that ratty old sweater is to use every inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't use all their storage space properly,'' she
said, adding that while most clothes closets have a shelf installed
over the hanger bar, many have a lot unused space between that
shelf and the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just adding a few more shelves and using them to store
off-season clothes should free up a lot of room,'' she said. ``Just
make sure that what you're putting there is really something you're
going to wear next summer.'' And anything that hasn't been worn for
more than a year or so, Ms. Rothschild said, would probably look
better on someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to the Salvation Army,'' she said. ``That way you get
rid of something you don't need and feel good about it at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Moore, a professional organizer in Richmond, Va., said that
a significant cause of clutter is old shoes. ``I've had clients
with dozens and dozens of shoes,'' Ms. Moore said, adding that in
most cases, it is unlikely that shoes in the back of a bedroom
closet will ever come in contact with feet again, unless they are
donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   For those with children whose shoes can end up virtually
anywhere, Ms. Moore said, it is sometimes useful to put a small
bookcase near the front door for quick storage. A curtain or piece
of decorative fabric draped across the front can camouflage the
function when company arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason people find themselves with messy houses is that
they don't stop clutter before it begins. ``I call it the
psychology of clutter,'' Ms. Moore said. ``If putting something
away properly is not comfortable, you won't put it away.'' For
example, she said, many people can't understand why someone would
insist on hanging coats or jackets on the back of a chair rather
than in a nearby closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because the closet is probably packed with wire
hangers,'' she said, adding that since it is difficult if not
impossible to extricate one wire hanger from a jumble, it becomes
easier and more comfortable to use the back of a chair. So simply
discarding unnecessary hangers and opening up space in a cluttered
cabinet goes a long way toward keeping chairs available for
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Denton, the owner of Denton &AMP; Co., an organizing
service in Cincinnati, said that people who tend to let clutter get
the upper hand should try to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organization has both mental and physical sides,'' Ms. Denton
said. ``Sometimes, being messy is just a lack of discipline. Other
times, it's a lack of physical space.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Generally, she said, the latter problem must be addressed first;
even the most disciplined individuals need places to put things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be creative,'' she said. ``There is storage space
all over the house,'' she said, ``if you just look for it'' _ over
desks in dens and over dressers in bedrooms, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the space in the closet beneath your shirts is dead air
until you put a wire rack or shelf under it,'' she said. ``And
don't forget that those behind-the-door shoe racks really do work,
particularly when you're pressed for space.''
</P>
<P>
   Attics, basements and garages, Ms. Denton said, should also be
exploited, albeit cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for these areas to become storage graveyards,'' she
said, pointing out that see-through plastic storage containers are
worth the investment since they make it easy to find stored items.
At very least, she said, the content of all boxes should be marked
clearly on the outside. Storing things in unmarked boxes, she said,
can increase clutter if it becomes necessary to buy a duplicate
because the original can't be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people put things in boxes and never see them again,''
Ms. Denton said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she said, once the physical space has been optimized,
the more subtle mental component remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a designated place for every object, you end
up thinking, `Now where is the perfect place to put this?''' Ms.
Denton said. ``And if you can't think of the perfect place right
away, you end up putting it just about anywhere until later. And
later never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denton, who is on the board of the National Association of
Professional Organizers, a trade association based in Cincinnati,
said that those who need professional help _ which can cost
anywhere from $50 to $200 an hour _ can call the organization at
(512) 206-0151 for a referral.

REAL ESTATE: SMALL TOWN WITH ARTS AS REVIVAL FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBERRY, S.C. _ Nicholas Smith, who has homes in Britain and
France, now also has one in this small town of 10,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   To some here, his choice signifies how far Newberry has come.
Smith is the conductor of the South Carolina Philharmonic
Orchestra, based 40 miles southeast in Columbia. Yet in June he
rented a second-floor apartment over an international printing
business as his local home.
</P>
<P>
   He spends about 20 weeks here each year during the season, which
runs from October through April. He wanted the space so badly that
he moved in before the three other apartments in the building were
finished. ``It's absolutely amazing what's been achieved here,'' he
said. ``The place itself is a jewel.''
</P>
<P>
   The rustling of rebirth blows smartly through the 10 blocks
considered to be downtown, thanks to an ambitious plan to redefine
downtown Newberry as a center for the arts. The 115-year-old
Newberry Opera House, across the street from Smith's apartment,
provided the focus.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents raised $5 million to renovate the building,
which reopened in June with a performance by Hal Holbrook, the
actor, and his wife, Dixie Carter, a singer and star of the
television series ``Designing Women.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening was the first time in 40 years that the sounds of
performing arts filled the 426-seat hall. ``Newberry is almost not
recognizable as the same town it was a few years ago,'' said Ernest
Shealy, the director of the Newberry Visitors Center, housed in an
elegant former courthouse building adjacent to the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the downtown buildings have been renovated or are in
some phase of repair, or have just been bought by a new owner with
the intention to renovate.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year a dozen businesses have opened, including five
antiques stores, two art-supply dealers, two gift shops and a
newspaper/coffee stand. About half of the dozen or so recently
built downtown apartments are rented at an average of $500 for a
one-bedroom to $1,000 for a two-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Like Newberry, a number of Southern cities have used the arts as
a catalyst for rejuvenating beleaguered downtowns. Asheville, N.C.,
has seen a resurgence since the construction of Pack Place, a
two-theater, four-museum complex. Now the downtown has many more
permanent residents, and longtime residents say so many people
flock there at night that parking is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, S.C., some formerly empty and worn buildings now
house restaurants and businesses. The rebirth began with the
construction in the early '90s of the Peace Center, a
performing-arts hall named for its largest benefactor, the Peace
family, former owner of The Greenville News and other newspapers.
The hall incorporated an abandoned textile mill into its design.
</P>
<P>
   Conxus Communication, a paging company, moved into a building
vacated in the '80s when J.C. Penney moved to a new mall on
Greenville's outskirts. After a renovation, the Main Street
building has become Conxus' corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a $63-million arena, to be the home of a
minor-league hockey team, opened Sept. 3 with a performance by the
singer Janet Jackson. And at the edge of downtown, buildings to
house the South Carolina Governor's School for the Arts are taking
shape. Greenville outbid a number of cities, including Newberry, to
get the school, which will bring arts students from all over the
state to live and study.
</P>
<P>
   But for Newberry, the arts rebirth seems to some a more
difficult achievement. With a relatively small population, Newberry
must draw from other cities to make it happen. ``At the outset, it
was a leap of faith,'' said Deborah Smith, the executive director
of the Newberry Opera House, who is not related to the conductor.
``There were a few visionaries who thought the Opera House was the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith has managed to bring in a number of well-known acts,
including a new version of the Mamas and Papas, the '60s
folk-singing group. For the new season, the Opera House has signed
on Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, the actor couple, and the singers
B.J. Thomas, Judy Collins and Glen Campbell. The Lettermen and the
Kingston Trio will also perform here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith says the Opera House's intimacy makes performers feel
comfortable and able to connect with audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back row is closer than some front rows,'' she said,
referring to larger opera houses. ``You don't get any opera glasses
in the Opera House.'' She added that she hoped to see 50,000
patrons in the first full season at the Opera House, which has a
capacity of more than 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1.7 million people between Greenville and
Columbia,'' she said. ``It is far easier for them to come to
Newberry'' for entertainment than to go back to the downtowns in
the bigger cities, she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Construction inside the French Gothic Opera House began in 1995
after several years of planning. The work was clearly a renovation,
not a restoration. The downstairs had for many years been home to
City Hall, and pictures did not show the original colors. Designers
chose blue, wine and mustard for the interior because they were
common in the 1880s, when the house was built.
</P>
<P>
   After City Hall moved into a former bank building, the
downstairs was transformed into a grand lobby, thanks to a $500,000
gift from an executive of Duke Power Co. who grew up here.
</P>
<P>
   On the technical side, the sound, lights and hydraulic lift for
the orchestra pit are considered state of the art. Bose Corp., a
maker of sound equipment, donated the sound system. Ten thousand
square feet of space was added to accommodate rehearsals and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Now city planners are turning their attention to downtown
streets, installing Victorian-style lighting and more attractive
landscaping thanks to $350,000 allocated by the city and the
federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Turner has seen the transformation close up. As the owner
of Turner's Jewelry Store for 35 years, Turner stayed on Main
Street even as the Ritz Theater closed and Roses Department Store
moved to the Route 76 bypass outside town. By 1991, 22 stores on
Main Street were empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the few who saw it through and had hope and
faith,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, what some saw as the final assault on downtown occurred
with the closing of the last two department stores. Abandoned
buildings rotted, and the roof on the building across the street
from the Opera House leaked so badly that rainfall seemed almost
the same inside as out. Now, Turner feels so heady about downtown's
prospects that he bought the building next door to his jewelry
store as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy, the Visitors Center director, said that 16 of 62
buildings are vacant on Main Street, but that nine of them were
being restored. Three more were bought recently by developers who
intend to renovate them. To maintain the flavor of the restored
buildings, Newberry created an architectural review board to
oversee changes to buildings downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The resurrection has lapped over to residential real estate as
well. Several Victorian and colonial homes near the downtown are in
various stages of renovation, including a 5,000-square-foot house
now on the market for $169,000. The owners of the four-bedroom
house had intended to retire to Newberry, but sickness in the
family made them decide to stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the asking price of a 3,700-square-foot, five-bedroom,
three-bath house with a traditional design is $174,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newberry has always had the attraction of those Old South
homes,'' said Sinclair Kenan, a real-estate broker. ``And it is a
great retirement haven, close to Columbia, Atlanta, the beach, the
mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, the conductor, Newberry looks totally unlike the
place he saw for the first time four years ago, when he took over
as musical director of the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much love and care has been put into this,'' he said. ``And
those are the things that are so lacking nowadays.''

REAL ESTATE: AT HOME IN A ONE-TIME CHURCH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people might find it vaguely unsettling, perhaps
even blasphemous. They wouldn't even consider living in a building
that used to be a church, as if God might be looking down at them,
wtching and judging as they engage in their very human and earthly
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   But to Thomas Head, a medieval-history scholar who was moving to
New York to take a teaching position at Hunter College, making his
home in a former church seemed perfectly natural. For nearly two
decades his intellectual life has centered on saints and their
artifacts, on the history of religion. What could be more
appropriate than placing his big wooden desk beneath a huge arched
stained-glass window that used to shed light on the faithful when
the building was Spencer Memorial Church?
</P>
<P>
   A number of churches in New York have been turned into
apartments, and in most cases there are few external signs
signifying their transformation. The shells are left intact.
Sometimes the only clue to their new use is the lack of
parishioners filing in and out on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   This particular church, a Gothic Revival structure of granite
stonework at the corner of Clinton and Remsen streets in Brooklyn
Heights, was built in 1851 by a group of abolitionists who broke
away from the existing Presbyterian church to create their own, and
made it a stop on the Underground Railroad that helped black slaves
escape to freedom in the North.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, the Presbyterian congregation was dwindling, and
the building was no longer needed. It was saved from demolition by
its inclusion in the area's historic district, and in the late
1970s it was bought by two brothers, Jean and Joe Miele, an
architect and an engineer, for $165,000. They sent the pews to
Columbia University and divided the space into 10 apartments,
including duplexes and triplexes, plus storage space in the attic
where the slaves used to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Head saw the apartment in the church on a ``reconnaissance
trip'' to New York in late March, shortly after he decided to take
the position at Hunter, drawn by the chance to teach graduate
students again, as he had at Yale, and to make contact with other
medievalists, who he said were scarce in St. Louis, where he was a
professor at Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Being in New York would also put him closer to his mother in
Rhode Island, where he grew up. For five days, he stayed in
Brooklyn Heights with some friends from Harvard, where he had been
both an undergraduate and graduate student. ``A couple of things
became clear,'' he said. ``Stuff on the market went incredibly
quickly. And with mortgages what they were, I did all the math and
decided it made sense for me to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   In five days, he saw 35 places, many of them in Chelsea, the
Upper West Side and the lower East 30s, three areas he had decided
made sense for him. But as he returned each night to his friends'
apartment in Brooklyn Heights, he found the neighborhood appealing.
So when Elizabeth Celano, a broker at William B. May Co., asked him
if he wanted to see the duplex in the church, he was interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in, I loved the place,'' he said, which isn't
hard to understand. The first floor of the duplex apartment is
open, like a loft, with only the galley kitchen in the middle, and
a combination laundry and bathroom, closed off. Upstairs is a
library area, an office, and a bedroom and bath. It is light, airy,
and high-ceilinged, with huge floral-patterned stained-glass
windows on the second floor, in green, blue, lavender and white.
They are the only reminder of the building's original use.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Head was also interested in a loft on 23rd Street in
Chelsea, a neighborhood that seemed quintessentially urban. ``It
was what I envisioned a New York place would be like,'' he said,
whereas Brooklyn Heights felt urban in a more familiar way, like
Cambridge, Mass., or the Back Bay section of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after returning to St. Louis, he made a full-price bid
of $349,000 for the duplex in the church. He liked the
stained-glass windows, and, more practically, it was several
hundred square feet larger than the Chelsea loft, providing more
space for his hundreds of books, books like ``The Harvest of
Hellenism,'' ``Introduction to the New Testament'' and ``Medieval
Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who had never owned a co-op, the process of closing
and approval, including a lengthy interview with the board, was
somewhat mystifying. ``Everyone was friendly,'' he said. They asked
questions about his hobbies (probably trying to find out if he was
a player of loud music), the source of his money and even his plans
for taking care of his mother. ``Basically, they were saying,
`Prove to us that you're not going to be bankrupt,' '' he said.
``I'm only a college professor, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   After he closed, he had the hardwood floors sanded and the walls
painted in colors like Wedgwood blue and a rich salmon. He has hung
his eclectic collection of art, including a piece by an elderly
Aboriginal woman that he bought on a trip to Australia and some
manuscript pages from the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture he inherited from his great aunt, such as a cedar
chest that became locked in the move and happens to be keyless, and
a regal chair upholstered in red velvet, easily cohabit with rugs
from Morocco and a carved wooden couch he bought in New Mexico. He
moved in on a Thursday and by the next Tuesday was up at Hunter
teaching a course on the early Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The commute to Hunter has turned out to be quick enough,
especially now that he has learned to switch to the local on the
same platform at Grand Central. ``I was changing at 59th Street and
walking up and down those long stairs,'' he said. ``This is called,
`Tom learns about New York.' '' He remembered how a stint in Paris
taught him that knowing the subway system is more important than
knowing actual distances.
</P>
<P>
   Life in a former church has turned out to be pretty similar to
life anywhere, although there are the random doorbell ringers who
cannot find the doctors' offices below. The signage and doorbells
are so subtle that most passersby would probably assume the church
is still used by a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Raised as a Roman Catholic, he is not impervious to the
emotional power of the building's history.
</P>
<P>
   He especially feels it in his study, working at his computer
beneath the stained-glass window, having it light the room where he
engages in late-20th-century pursuits, such as updating the Web
site he keeps _ www.artsci.wustl.edu _ where surfers can learn
about saints and their artifacts, and his students can get
information about his courses.
</P>
<P>
   The building's transformation, he said, is not unlike the
process that drives his life in history, trying to get a
contemporary perspective on the past. ``That combination of old and
new,'' he said, ``is what being a historian is about.''

chest that became locked in the move and happens to be keyless, and
a regal chair upholstered in red velvet, easily cohabit with rugs
from Morocco and a carved wooden couch he bought in New Mexico. He
moved in on a Thursday and by the next Tuesday was up at Hunter
teaching a course on the early Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The commute to Hunter has turned out to be quick enough,
especially now that he has learned to switch to the local on the
same platform at Grand Central. ``I was changing at 59th Street and
walking up and down those long stairs,'' he said. ``This is called,
`Tom learns about New York.' '' He remembered how a stint in Paris
taught him that knowing the subway system is more important than
knowing actual distances.
</P>
<P>
   Life in a former church has turned out to be pretty similar to
life anywhere, although there are the random doorbell ringers who
cannot find the doctors' offices below. The signage and doorbells
are so subtle that most passersby would probably assume the church
is still used by a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Raised as a Roman Catholic, he is not impervious to the
emotional power of the building's history.
</P>
<P>
   He especially feels it in his study, working at his computer
beneath the stained-glass window, having it light the room where he
engages in late-20th-century pursuits, such as updating the Web
site he keeps _ www.artsci.wustl.edu _ where surfers can learn
about saints and their artifacts, and his students can get
information about his courses.
</P>
<P>
   The building's transformation, he said, is not unlike the
process that drives his life in history, trying to get a
contemporary perspective on the past. ``That combination of old and
new,'' he said, ``is what being a historian is about.''

 &HT;    Panel designs anti-gang program
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Warning that Texas faces a growing threat from
organized crime gangs, a special Senate committee is poised to
recommend creation of a statewide Violent Gang Task Force to better
coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a report expected to be made public today, a five-member
Texas Senate committee that has been studying gangs and juvenile
justice issues will recommend the task force be made up of
representatives from the prison system, police agencies and
prosecutors _ to better coordinate gang enforcement and monitoring
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations include creation of a statewide computer
network to track gang members, stricter parole rules for imprisoned
gang members and a new 211 telephone help line for parents,
teachers and police.
</P>
<P>
   The 116-page report, obtained Wednesday by the
American-Statesman, represents the most comprehensive look at the
growing gang-crime problem that the Legislature has undertaken in
several years. It also is a first step in what legislative leaders
have said they expect will be several new laws to crack down on
teen-aged street gangs and gang members in prisons when lawmakers
convene in January.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending the statewide computer database on gang members,
the report suggests police agencies across Texas should consider
standardizing gang data. It also suggests the Legislature consider
whether parents should be notified when their children are
designated as gang members, whether files on juveniles should be
purged as they grow older and stay out of trouble and whether
access to the gang database should be limited because of
constitutional privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a special three-digit phone number, patterned after
Atlanta's successful 211 system, would allow parents, police,
teachers and others to quickly and easily access information about
gang intervention, counseling and assistance programs. The
projected cost: $574,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the recommendations could carry a pricetag of more than
$49 million. More than $41 million of that is expected to be sought
by the Texas Youth Commission to expand juvenile lockups. The
state's current two-year budget is about $87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   --Require the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin noting
on its computer files whether a crime was gang-related or a
criminal is a confirmed member of a prison gang, a move that could
help improve safety for street cops.
</P>
<P>
   --Require parole officials to more closely supervise gang
members who are released from prison, including tougher
restrictions on their movements and whom they associate with.
Parole officials said Wednesday they already are working on such
new rules.
</P>
<P>
   --Require the Texas Education Agency, local public school
officials and Prairie View A&AMP;M University's Juvenile Crime
Prevention Institute to better train school personnel to identify
and report gang membership and gang behavior.
</P>
<P>
   -Bolster with additional money existing state programs for
at-risk youths, as a way to thwart what has become prison gangs'
biggest pool of new recruits. State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas
Democrat who heads the special committee, did not return a phone
call for comment Wednesday. But in a letter to Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
accompanying the report, West urged ``a stronger commitment to
prevention and intervention services for our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to reducing juvenile delinquency lies in providing
at-risk youth with healthy alternatives such as after-school and
weekend programs, as well as offering more prevention and
intervention services for those children who show a need.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimating there could be more than 145,000 gang members in
Texas _ at least 5,000 of those in prisons _ the report says most
are members of teen-aged street gangs. But those in spray-painting
and vandalism gangs, who police say are increasingly working with
the more violent prison gangs, are part of a growing crime problem
all across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the report estimates Texas has 3,276 active youth gangs
_ second only to California. But despite the growth in numbers of
gang members, police in several major Texas cities estimate
gang-related crimes have dropped in the past two years _ 28 percent
in Austin alone.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, police say, is that more gang members are being
arrested and sent to prison at the same time as gangs are refining
the way they do business _ becoming more selective, oftentimes more
violent, in the types of crimes their members are involved in.

NO. 1 OHIO STATE PULLS AWAY IN SECOND HALF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ One minute 25 seconds before the Ohio State
band marched on the field at halftime and 2:16 after it left was
all the time it took for the top-ranked Buckeyes to turn a tense,
well-played football game into a 28-9 drubbing of Penn State on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In that brief span, Ohio State converted a crucial fourth down,
blocked a punt, scored two touchdowns and lost its quarterback
coach, Tim Salem, to a bloody hand.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to how tense the first half was, Salem shattered
the window of the press box in a moment of cathartic celebration
after his protege, Joe Germaine, found Michael Wiley for a
touchdown pass with 23 seconds remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a sluggish Buckeye team had a 14-3 halftime lead that
it didn't really deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The good tidings continued when Ohio State returned for the
third quarter. In the play that turned a classic game _ played
before a rain-soaked crowd of 93,479 at Ohio Stadium _ into another
drumming of a Top 25 team, senior safety Percy King blasted through
the Nittany Lion line and blocked Pat Pidgeon's punt.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Pidgeon was punting from the end zone, and the Buckeyes'
Joe Cooper flopped on the ball as Ohio State took a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Germaine who was responsible for engineering the Buckeye
offense's only first-half score. He ran the two-minute offense to
perfection as time wound down on the first half. Ahead by 7-3, Ohio
State took over at its own 49-yard line with 1:48 left in the half.
The senior quarterback completed passes of 17 and 13 yards to Penn
State's 33.
</P>
<P>
   But as it had all day, the Nittany Lion defense stiffened to
force a fourth-and-9. The Buckeyes' kicker, Dan Stultz, had missed
from 40 yards in the first quarter and had his 50-yard attempt
blocked earlier in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   So coach John Cooper kept the ball in Germaine's hands, where it
had paid off all afternoon. In the first half alone, Germaine kept
drives alive _ twice by passing, on third-and-6 and third-and-9,
and once by scrambling to convert a third-and-19.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a quick drop, Germaine found Dee Miller cutting across
the middle of the field for an 11-yard gain and crucial first down.
Three plays later, this time facing third-and-8, Germaine found
Wiley, who streaked past the overmatched linebacker Mac Morrison,
to catch a bullet at the goal line.

AFTER A LONG, EMOTIONAL DAY, THE YANKS CATCH THEIR BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Yankees gathered in the hotel lobby here
Saturday morning, ready to travel, with manager Joe Torre and the
others looking surprisingly refreshed considering the ordeal they
went through to finish their division series sweep of the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   They waited through a 3-hour-16-minute rain delay to beat the
Rangers, 4-0, in Game 3 of the three-of-five-game series, a game
that ended at 2:26 a.m. New York time. David Cone allowed just two
hits over five and two-thirds innings, and Paul O'Neill and Shane
Spencer each hit home runs to account for the scoring. The Yankees
returned to New York, where many will visit the ailing Darryl
Strawberry before beginning the American League Championship Series
against either Cleveland or Boston on Tuesday night at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won 117 regular-season and playoff games this
year _ the record is 118, set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs _ but none
were more surreal than their victory over the Rangers in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Cone went to dinner with his father, Spencer and David Wells on
Thursday night, and Wells watched Cone as he chewed a steak, saw
how quiet Cone was, how intense. He was sure Cone would dominate
the Rangers, but did not say anything to anybody. ``I didn't want
to put a curse on it,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone slept poorly that night, his mind flooded with thoughts of
Strawberry, and even as he took the mound for the bottom of the
first inning on Friday, Cone found himself thinking of his
teammate. Once he started pitching, however, Cone felt he was able
to focus entirely on the Texas batters.
</P>
<P>
   When pitching with five or more days of rest since May, Cone's
earned run average in the regular season was 1.57, or more than two
runs lower than when he pitched with four days of rest. Cone had
five days of rest on Friday, and he was in control, strong. Through
the first five innings, catcher Joe Girardi said, he was pitching
as sharply as he has at any point during the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron Sele, the Rangers' right-hander, was pitching
effectively as well, stifling the top of the Yankees' lineup.
Before the fifth inning began, with a scoreless tie, Torre
collected the first five hitters in his lineup _ Chuck Knoblauch,
Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez _ in
the runway and told them they were going about their business as if
they were down two games to none. Just relax, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Batting with one out in the top of the sixth inning, O'Neill
waited on a high curveball and smashed it to deep left-center, the
ball carrying over the wall and into the Yankees' bullpen. Even
before O'Neill circled the bases, however, the flags above the
Ballpark changed direction and looked frozen in a stiff wind; a
storm was coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit an infield single with two outs, and Tim Raines
poked a double into the left-field corner, Martinez stopping at
third. Dick Bosman, the Texas pitching coach, went to the mound as
Spencer waited at home plate. Hints of lightning could be seen in
the distance. The rain started, sending fans scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat, Sele had thrown Spencer a meaty curveball,
and Spencer had popped up. Before this at-bat, in the sixth inning,
Spencer told himself to stay back and wait for the pitch to come to
him. Sele spun a curveball, Spencer recognized it, and he hit it.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off third base, Martinez saw the ball jump off Spencer's
bat, toward the left field wall. You've got to be kidding, Martinez
thought, joyfully. Players on the Yankees' bench lurched forward to
follow the flight of the ball. ``Get up!'' a few yelled. It
cleared, and Spencer circled the bases, with that look of
astonishment on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like he looked,'' Cone said. ``We were in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said: ``I'm enjoying it. As long as I am not getting
booed off the field, I guess I can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 4-0, and Cone retired the first two batters in
the bottom of the sixth before sheets of rain began to fall, a
torrential downpour. Cone walked off the mound, angry in the
knowledge that he probably would not pitch when play resumed.
``It's going to be a long one,'' Umpire Joe Brinkman told Cone of
the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Play stopped at 10:08 p.m. New York time, with the Yankees 10
outs from finishing the series. They waited and waited, Torre
playing hearts, O'Neill indulging in too many cookies, many of the
players lounging in the clubhouse and watching the movie ``Dumb and
Dumber.'' They all felt like they were bouncing off the walls,
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   The rain stopped around midnight, and the grounds crew started
removing the tarp before the sheets of water fell again. At some
point, league officials began planning for the possibility that the
game would be suspended for the night, then resumed Saturday. The
Yankees did not want that. They wanted to finish the Rangers and be
done with the series.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the rain stopped, and the game resumed at 1:24 a.m.,
with Graeme Lloyd on the mound for the Yankees. Lloyd gave way to
Jeff Nelson for the seventh and eighth innings, and Nelson turned
over the ball to Mariano Rivera in the ninth. Rivera completed the
shutout at 2:26, and the Yankees started dousing each other with
champagne, with Tim Raines pausing to toast Strawberry to great
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers had the most potent offense in the American
League, outside of the Bronx, and in three games they mustered one
run and 13 hits, a .133 batting average. ``If they keep pitching
the way they're pitching,'' said Todd Stottlemyre, the Rangers'
right-hander, ``it's going to be real tough to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the Texas slugger Juan Gonzalez, ``To beat the Yankees, you
have to play perfect, because the Yankees have everything _ speed,
power, good relievers, a good pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   And now they have three days off before moving on to their next
assignment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The former chief executive of Siemens AG, Karlheinz Kaske, died
Sept. 27 after a long illness, the company reported from Munich. He
was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Kaske, head of Siemens from 1981 until 1992, oversaw the growth
of the German company into a global electronics and engineering
giant during the 1980s. He masterminded the company's expansion
overseas, particularly in the United States and East Asia, and
strengthened its position in various fields, especially
microelectronics.
</P>
<P>
   He also formed an alliance with the chip makers IBM and Toshiba,
and signed a contract to cooperate with China in the field of
electronics. Kaske was also responsible for the acquisition of the
computer maker Nixdorf in 1990 and the takeover, together with
General Electric Co. of Britain, of the Plessey Company PLC, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1928 in Essen, Germany, Kaske joined Siemens &AMP; Halske
AG, as the company was then called, in 1950. He rose to join the
management board in 1975 and six years later was named chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions and a revamping of Siemens increased annual
profits to 2 billion Deutsche marks ($1.19 billion at current
exchange rates) when Kaske served as chairman. Sales during those
years more than doubled, from 35 billion marks ($21 billion) to 79
billion marks ($47.2 billion). The number of employees rose to
413,000, from 338,000.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from Siemens, Kaske continued to serve on
the boards of Eastman Kodak Co., Linde AG and MAN AG. In addition,
he served on the German League of Science Foundations, the board of
trustees of Munich University and as chairman of the administration
board of Deutsches Museum in Munich.

   EMBASSIES-FUTURE _ WASHINGTON _ As we race into the next century
of faxes, e-mail and instant worldwide newscasting, America's
diplomatic system is still grounded in the horse-and-buggy era. The
terrorist bombings of two remote U.S. embassies in East Africa
offers a reminder that the United States has a visible and often
vulnerable presence in almost every nation, at a cost of more than
$2 billion a year. Many of these outposts date from the Cold War
era, when the United States was fighting a propaganda war for the
hearts and minds of even the tiniest nation. But is that necessary
now? After budget cuts, the U.S. State Department has made some
reductions, but U.S. domestic agencies have created more and more
overseas postings. Some experts, including government auditors, are
looking for ways to reshape the embassy system. Among the ideas:
setting up regional embassies to serve several countries, hiring
private contractors to gather information normally collected by
diplomats, and far greater use of high tech communications.

were a whirlwind of giant leaps _ it went from its first manned
flight to stepping on the moon in just eight years _ the second
half of the agency's life has mostly been a comfortable routine of
workmanlike space shuttle missions. That's about to change. NASA
has big plans. It's mulling a new breed of spaceship, with the
emphasis on utility and cost-effectiveness. In the works: reusable
rockets that operate at a fraction of the cost, can take off in the
kind of weather that would scrub a shuttle lunch, and turn around
in a remarkable seven days. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post).

   KOWALSKI _ It's casual Friday at the Justice Department, and

bowlegged. It's fitting for this former Marine and Vietnam veteran
who fancies himself a cowboy, not just because he owns and rides
horses but also because he believes in honor and the code of the
West and protecting the defenseless. Although he refuses to talk
about the case, the lead investigator for the Justice Department's
reopened probe into the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. is not sweating this latest high-profile assignment. As
the federal prosecutor assigned to win convictions against the Los
Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King, Kowalski is used to
performing under pressure. ``This is a lot less daunting,'' he
said, ``than whether the city is going to burn again. If we lost,
there would have been another riot. It made you need to win.'' A

   EVIDENCE _ Former FBI agent Donald Wilson has turned over to the
Justice Department the two slips of paper he says he retrieved from
James Earl Ray's abandoned car in Atlanta 30 years ago. One slip of
paper has a list that looks like a payment schedule next to such
words as ``hospital'' and ``Canada.'' It also says ``before 4-15''
at the bottom along with a word that could be ``Raul.'' King was
killed April 4. The other paper is the torn corner of a 1963 Dallas
phone book with a phone number at the top that a cross-directory
shows belonged to Jack Ruby and the Vegas Club. Clearly written
next to the phone number is the word ``Raul.'' Only a handful of
people have seen the two documents, which have never been
reporoduced in any publication. We have copies that will be shown
in a grafic that highlights and explains the significant portions
of the two documents and also shows the 1963 directory listing for
Ruby as well as a handwriting sample from Ray. (Atlanta

<P>
   GANG _ In what authorities warn is a growing menace, prison
gangs, fueled by racial and geographic animosities, are coming of
age in Austin and most other major Texas cities. In the past few
years, some prison gangs have begun recruiting members of youth
street gangs as soldiers in a growing crime network designed to
gain control of Texas' illegal drug markets. Their MO: murders,
shootings, beatings and home-invasion robberies. (Ward, Austin

Austin American-Statesman). 17. WITH PHOTOS.

 &HT;    Georgia Southern celebrates 100th game with win
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Georgia Southern celebrated its 100th game at
Paulson Stadium Saturday by routing Virginia Military 63-7 before a
crowd of 9,687.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern (5-0, 3-0 Southern Conference), ranked third in
Division I-AA, opened a 35-7 halftime lead and rested most of its
frontline players in the second half. When this one finally grinded
to a halt with reserves playing most of the fourth quarter, the
Eagles had amassed 605 yards of total offense and completed their
5-0 start since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we got good contributions from all three facets:
offense, defense and special teams,'' said Johnson, after his
Eagles had pushed the school record at Paulson to 89-11. ''We made
some mistakes and got a lot of penalties, but were able to overcome
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth straight game in which Georgia Southern has
scored over 40 points. Against an opponent it whipped 49-0 a year
ago, the contributors were more than a precious few.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Greg Hill, sitting out most of the second
half, completed 8-of-11 pass attempts for 94 yards and a touchdown
and rushed for 66 yards and another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Adrian Peterson, averaging 169.3 yards rushing entering
the game, gained 122 yards on 16 carries and scored two touchdowns
before leaving in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Backup fullbacks Jevon Sullivan and Carl Small combined for 157
yards and 3 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Senior slotback Corey Joyner caught a 16-yard scoring pass, and
later raced 64 yards for a touchdown on a punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to come out focused, because these are the hardest
kind of teams to get up for,'' Joyner said. ''Everybody expects you
to blow them out. It's a credit to the maturity of this team that
we came out and played well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63 points tied the second highest total in school history.
The Eagles were up 35-7 at intermission, and could easily have
equalled that total in the second half _ before settling for 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to play a full four quarters,'' Hill said. ''We've
been scoring most of our points in the first half, and averaging
only 17 in the second half -- which is the same amount our
opponents have averaged in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   VMI actually put together a 14-play, 85 yard drive for a
touchdown in the first period, but could muster little afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really pleased with our defense in the second,'' Johnson
said. ''I think we allowed them only two first downs and 25
yards.''

 &HT;    Buddy, can you spare a nickel?
 &HT;    By Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so many offenses around the NFL increasingly reliant on
three-wide-receiver sets, the ``nickel'' cornerback, a position
once relegated to spare-part status, has taken on starter's
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Woe to the secondary that does not possess a solid nickel
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of spread offenses is spreading secondaries
thinner than ever before. It is no surprise that six of the top
10-rated offenses are those that use three wide receivers 45
percent to 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy, can you spare a nickel back? Most teams can't. But in the
chess games played out every Sunday afternoon, the quality of the
nickel defender often means the difference between checking an
offense or being checkmated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon the pun, but good nickel players aren't exactly a dime
a dozen out there,'' San Francisco secondary coach Jim Mora Jr.
said. ``With as much as we're playing the nickel coverages, you're
going to be exposed if you don't have one. Everybody's looking for
that third corner. It's a high priority all over the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's San Francisco-Atlanta game offered a good example.
On 20 of their 41 snaps in the first half, the 49ers had either
three or four wide receivers on the field, and they averaged 13.0
yards per play. Steve Young completed 14 of 15 passes for 203 yards
and three touchdowns, and five San Francisco running plays netted
57 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year cornerback Juran Bolden, who the coaches apparently
thought was good enough to cover Jerry Rice in the game, wasn't
even good enough to be on the roster just two days later. Despite
permitting a pair of scores to Rice, both on long passes, Bolden
was claimed on waivers by Green Bay, another team seeking nickel
help.
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't have a capable third cornerback _ veteran
Terry McDaniel couldn't run anymore and fourth-rounder Roosevelt
Blackmon of Morris Brown struggled through most of camp _ the
Packers have been scrambling their third-down coverages.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal nickel defender, most coordinators agreed, would be a
cornerback. He could line up on the slot receiver or permit one of
the starting corners to move inside on long-yardage situations.
``That third corner is the luxury everyone wants,'' Indianapolis
secondary coach George Catavolos said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming Monday night game, one of the most compelling
matchups of the season to this point, Green Bay and Minnesota will
use safeties as nickel players because neither team has a third
cornerback good enough.
</P>
<P>
   If the Packers deploy in their usual nickel scheme, strong
safety LeRoy Butler will move into the slot to cover Cris Carter,
and 13-year backup safety Mike Prior becomes the extra defensive
back. For the Vikes, strong safety Robert Griffith plays against
the slot receiver _ probably Derrick Mayes _ and backup free safety
Torrian Gray is the extra defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to force the defense to put someone on the field
who can't cover us in our three-wide-receiver offense,'' Minnesota
offensive coordinator Brian Billick said. ``It gives us a chance to
stretch a defense and find some seams. It creates opportunities in
the running game, too. The teams that have three great wideouts
have an advantage, because there simply are not that many defenses
with three great corners.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few teams with three superior cornerbacks is Kansas
City. Neither magician nor alchemist, third corner Mark McMillian
nonetheless has turned his nickel position behind Dale Carter and
James Hasty into gold. McMillian is one of the few defenders in the
NFL whose salary ($1.25 million for 1998) is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   A starter in Philadelphia and New Orleans from 1993 to 1996, the
seventh-year veteran initially found his new role difficult to
accept. But he led the NFL with eight interceptions last season and
was on the field more than 60 percent of the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel like a starter,'' McMillian said. ``There's
certainly no stigma anymore to the nickel job. Not many people can
do what I do.''

 &HT;    Le Mans here gets top drivers
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Game day in the heart of football country coupled with
major-league baseball playoffs makes an auto race named after a
foreign place seem like the underdog of the year in Georgia. But it
helps if that place is the home of the most famous and largest
sports-car race in the world, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   And like the French Le Mans, Saturday's Petit Le Mans at Road
Atlanta in Braselton is more than just a one-day affair. It'll be a
week of sports cars, pomp, ceremony and then sports-car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jarry, mayor of Le Mans, France, will be the honorary
starter _ Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell did the same at Le Mans _ and
Francois Fillon, former minister, deputy of the Sarthe and
president of the regional council of Loire in France, is the grand
marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The Petit Le Mans is 1,000 miles or 10 hours, whichever comes
first. Start time is 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The field of 40, largest ever for a sports-car race, boasts the
best in the world, including the 1998 Le Mans-winning No. 26
Porsche, driven by Yannick Dalmas of France, the BMW team and
factory-supported Ferrari teams.
</P>
<P>
   Team Panoz will field three cars, the two GT1s that ran at Le
Mans and the new, hybrid Panoz Q9 that's a combination of Ford and
an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for the big turnout of heavy hitters, Team
Panoz operations manager Jim Selwa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Petit Le Mans is an opportunity to qualify for (the) 24
Hours of Le Mans field. This is a big deal for a lot of the
teams,'' Selwa said. ``You wouldn't see the likes of the Porsches,
Ferraris, BMWs or Mercedes if it wasn't a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Split into two organizations _ Professional Sports Car Racing,
sanctioning body for the Petit Le Mans, and United States Road
Racing Championships, owned by NASCAR's Bill France _ sports-car
racing has been diluted on the track and in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowds at Road Atlanta in recent years have been for
AMA motorcycle races, totaling about 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Selwa said Road Atlanta officials are hoping for more than
40,000 fans Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While most prerace inspections happen in private, the Petit Le
Mans inspections will be a public, almost carnival-style affair at
Lenox Square on Tuesday and Wednesday. Inspections will be in the
northwest corner of the mall, 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>

CLINTON-STARR-RDP, 10-3 -- Former Pesident Gerald R. Ford, who
pardoned President Richard M. Nixon, says that President Clinton
should be rebuked in the well of the House, where he would stand
and listen while Republicans and Democrats denounced his conduct.
``Imagine a president receiving not an ovation from the people's
representatives, but a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members
of both parties,'' Ford wrote in an Op-Ed article in Sunday's New

   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishop
of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the Communist
system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by paying
such homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned by
the Tito government as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped
into one of the most divisive Serbian-Croatian disputes in all of
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman Catholic
Croats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. To
Orthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries but
have largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, the
beatification is a political provocation. They have long viewed
Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regime
that killed tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and
Gypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today's
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,
who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewing
history through a different prism than the peoples he says he wants
to reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-born
John Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviet
totalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted by
the Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   But in post-Communist Croatia, it has been a long time since
religion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. As
one of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats and
Muslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredient
of the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded onto a steep
hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, there was pride in the
beatification and defiance of its critics. ``It is good to have a
saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,'' said Kruno
Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who came north to Marija Bistrica,
arriving at 2 a.m. to ensure that he would catch a glimpse of the
pope. He shrugged off the complaints of minorities: ``We don't care
about their saints. Why should they care about ours?''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia, but he has made
several trips to Balkan sites, always preaching peace and unity in
an area torn by ethnic and religious differences. In 1994 he made
his first visit to Croatia, which is more than 75 percent Catholic
and which lost a third of its land to the Serbs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as the
Catholic Church's complicity in the systematic killing, eviction or
forced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under Tudjman,
moreover, many Croats are recasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe, who were
led by Ante Pavelic, as patriots and founding fathers of the modern
Croatian state.
</P>
<P>
   The beatification of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heart
of this history. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Pavelic
led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly independent
Croatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent anti-Communist,
initially embraced the Pavelic government as ``God's hand at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews and
other minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 he
began denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,
in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested by
Tito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,
jailed and put under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XII later made
him a cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundreds
of Jews and Serbs, but his critics maintain that by not speaking
out more, he in effect supported the Ustashe regime. To Serbs he
has long been a symbol of Catholic priests' cooperation with the
Ustashe.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the pope left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Paris asked the Vatican to delay beatification of the cardinal
until historians could give the case further study. The request
infuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,
Jews expressed resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''
said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jews in Croatia, who number
about 2,000. He described the cardinal's record as mixed. ``He
tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he never condemned
the regime as such,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely to
the cardinal's resistance to Communism _ was unlikely to prompt
Croats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will not
clarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatian
society has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt with
successfully.''

AFTER AN EARLY LAPSE, MIAMI TURNS SERIOUS

   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Miami pulverized Rutgers 53-17 Saturday, and
the margin might have been greater had the Hurricanes had their
minds completely on the game from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has drawn votes in the national polls, although not enough
to push it into the top 25. Rutgers had lost 16 straight games to
Division I-A opponents until it upset Army last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was a four-touchdown favorite in this Big East game, but
there was a danger signal: Its next two opponents are Florida State
and West Virginia, both nationally ranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to take a crazy game plan to beat Rutgers,''
Scott Covington, Miami's senior quarterback, said this week. ``A
week like this is really good for us because we can work on stuff
that's not necessarily for this game, but for later games.''
</P>
<P>
   College football coaches hate to hear their players talk like
that, because the divided attention leaves their teams ripe for an
upset. And for much of the first half Saturday, Miami left the door
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a somewhat poor first half,'' said Butch Davis, the
Miami coach. But Rutgers could not match Miami's talent or its
big-play capabilities, and when the Hurricanes turned on the
switch, they overwhelmed the Scarlet Knights.
</P>
<P>
   At least Miami was quick and merciful once it got going. Its
scoring drives took a total of only 8 minutes 28 seconds, and its
13-3 halftime lead ballooned with four touchdowns in the third
quarter and two in the fourth. Three touchdowns came in a
four-minute span on passes of 12, 28 and 71 yards from Covington to
Santana Moss, the sophomore flanker.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first quarter, the 21,419 spectators at
Rutgers Stadium watched Rutgers line up for what appeared to be a
35-yard field-goal attempt. But it was a fake, and Rutgers passed
instead, incomplete. After that, it was all Miami, whose record
climbed to 3-1. Rutgers dropped to 2-3.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miami had the ball for only 20:51, but it gained 569 yards, 398
by passing. Covington completed 21-of-30 passes for 312 yards, and
Edgerrin James, the junior tailback, carried 15 times for 131 yards
and two touchdowns. Moss caught six passes for 146 yards and is
averaging 22.5 yards a catch this year.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Aaron Brady and cornerback Reggie Stephens,
both seniors and backbones of the Scarlet Knight defense, said
Miami attacked where Rutgers was vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really took advantage of our young players at the
corners,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens added: ``I told our young guys that if the other team
makes big plays, you have to let it go. This is the best experience
they're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Covington's fourth-quarter relief pitcher, Kenny Kelly, threw
two passes and completed both, one for 56 yards to set up a
touchdown and the next for 30 yards and a touchdown. That did not
thrill Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way they ran up the score,'' said Bill
Powell, the Rutgers flanker.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had good offensive numbers _ 452 yards from scrimmage,
177 yard rushing, 27 first downs. But Mike McMahon's passing
(17-of-33 for 275 yards) and Dennis Thomas' rushing (19 for 88
yards) could not overcome poor field position. And as Coach Terry
Shea of Rutgers said, ``I don't think we're going to beat anybody
running the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers has given up 40 or more points in 12 of its last 19
games. Still, the Scarlet Knights play hard and remain upbeat. As
Thomas said, perhaps too optimistically, ``I know we can play with
any team in the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Gill Ross, a starting outside linebacker for Rutgers, sustained
a sprain of his left ankle in the second quarter and did not
return. ... This was the seventh game between Miami and Rutgers.
Miami has won them all. ... At halftime, the Rutgers Football Hall
of Fame inducted four newcomers _ defensive back Ken Smith (Class
of 1981), inside linebacker Tyronne Stowe (1987), the late running
back Charles Hoyt ``Bus'' Terrill (1926) and historian Larry Pitt
(1939).

ACTORS TAKING ACTION TO DRAW LINE AGAINST PHONY SIGNATURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While Agent Mulder battles black ooze and alien
takeovers on ``The X-Files,'' actor David Duchovny has been filing
lawsuits in Los Angeles, trying to unravel what may be a real-life
conspiracy:
</P>
<P>
   Who or what is behind a mysterious plot to put fake signatures
on the actor's photos and sell them for $50 -- and can they be
stopped?
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the case could be decided at a hearing Monday, in
which a judge will consider an Internet autograph company's request
to throw out the actor's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the case survives the legal challenge, the issue
seems no more likely to disappear than controversies over Roswell
aliens and crop circles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Duchovny and enough stars to open a
Planet Hollywood -- including Arnold Schwarzenegger and former
``Lois and Clark'' star Dean Cain -- have sued mail-order and
Internet autograph distributors, claiming the signatures they sell
are forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local memorabilia stores are growing more skeptical
of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa autographs, telling customers that a
black-market baseball or a photo with the sluggers' signatures more
likely was signed by someone else's little brother in the family
rec room.
</P>
<P>
   In the autograph capital of the world, Los Angeles memorabilia
experts say there are plenty of legitimate products out there, but
warn celebrity junkies and sports fans to watch closely for
counterfeits, especially online and at trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can be very dangerous,'' said Richard Khoury, who
has been working closely with signatures for 20 years at Sports
Memorabilia Etc. in suburban Studio City. ``Ninety-five percent of
the people will be thrilled. They won't even know it's a fake until
they try and sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether his lawsuit has merit, Duchovny has plenty
of reason to be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Truly Unique Collectibles was selling his photo on the Internet
for $50 -- well below the asking price of other A-list stars such
as Sean Connery ($95) and Mel Gibson ($110).
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes has-beens and never-weres at
bargain-basement prices -- actors Scott Baio and Linda Lavin each
sell for $20. And there is a staggering number of obscure actors
from ``Star Trek'' and other sci-fi franchises -- $30 buys a signed
photo from Peter Mayhew, who howled his way to fame as Chewbacca in
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny was the first celebrity to challenge the autograph
merchants, suing a now-defunct mail-order company called CPG Direct
in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1996. He eventually won a $364,000
judgment against the company, said his lawyer, Farhad Novian.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Duchovny and Cain filed separate lawsuits
against Truly Unique in federal court, claiming it is run by the
same people who owned CPG.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Truly Unique vehemently deny the allegations and
include authentication papers for their signed photos in court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Truly Unique attorney Ronald Drescher said in court papers that
the company adheres to standard industry practice, randomly
selecting photos and using outside firms to check their
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Drescher filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuits that are
scheduled to be heard by U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Novian, who is also Cain's lawyer, said both stars ordered
photos from the companies they are suing and determined that they
are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cain and Mr. Duchovny looked at the signatures and
immediately knew they were signed by someone else's hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Novian said Duchovny filed the lawsuits to protect his fans and
protect his name. He advised viewers to write directly to the
actor's publicist for a signed photo, because he'll never be able
to sue all the companies suspected of selling fake memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Mr. Duchovny's resources, at $70 a pop he can't go
after everybody,'' the attorney said.

 Los Angeles: the attorney said. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As for sports stars, Khoury describes Michael Jordan as though
he's Michelangelo, with a signature that is the celebrity autograph
equivalent of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves his own special trademarks,'' Khoury said, pointing
out the subtle way the star turns the ``M'' in his name into his
jersey number, 23. ``If you know the business, you know all of his
loops and slashes. It can't be copied.''
</P>
<P>
   While fellow NBA All-Stars Dennis Rodman, Patrick Ewing and
Charles Barkley have inconsistent scribbles for signatures that are
difficult to authenticate, Khoury said an experienced dealer can
spot a fake Jordan from 3-point distance.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury gets most of his inventory directly from sports figures
or orders from reputable companies such as Upper Deck
Authenticated, which has contracts with the stars and uses devices
such as holographic seals to prevent forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI estimates that as much as 75 percent of the $750
million-per-year sports memorabilia market involves fraudulent
products, although Khoury and others in the business said that
figure is too hard on the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury said some of the forgeries he's seen are so obvious it's
funny. For example, Babe Ruth died in 1941, when athletes were
still using fountain pens or pencils to sign autographs. Khoury
recently was presented a Babe Ruth item that was signed with a
ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   Other fakes can even deceive an expert's careful eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some that come through look good; they look really good,''
Khoury said. ``I tell people, `If you're in doubt, just walk away
from it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Autograph dealer David Rodriguez has a stern warning for those
looking for a piece of history: If a strange guy walks up carrying
a stack of bats with McGwire's name on them, they're probably
phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much bad McGwire out there because his signatures
are in high demand and he's terrible about signing,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He doesn't do shows. He'll sign one autograph per kid at
the ballpark, and that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who sells sports and celebrity autographs on the
Internet, said he's 100 percent certain that his product is
legitimate. His screening process is simple: ``We do everything in
person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he has a group of ``kids,'' ages 16 to 24, who go
to award shows, movie premieres and personal appearances to get
photos autographed by the stars and sports figures themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The best about signing are John Travolta and Jackie Chan.
``Jackie's walked out on the street and signed a dozen autographs
to one kid and been really good about it,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst are Barbra Streisand, The Artist Formerly Known as
Prince and Marlon Brando. ``I think I've had one kid in 10 years
who got two Brandos, but he's been turned down 10 times,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some stars, such as Tom Cruise and Michael Jackson, have
offered autographs to keep signature hunters from tailing their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's limo driver will stop and say, `Quit following us
and he'll sign one piece each,' '' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he includes as many autographed photos as
possible on his World Wide Web site, at signatures.com, so buyers
can inspect his product for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like Khoury, Rodriguez said certificates of authenticity are
less important than knowing who you do business with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost meaningless,'' he said. ``These authenticators
don't necessarily know any more than the people out getting
autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Novian is also skeptical of authentication papers. And the
lawyer said he has become even more cynical about autographs than
he was when he filed Duchovny's first lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go by a memorabilia store in a mall, I wonder: Is
any of this legitimate?''

SPECIAL MASTER REPORTEDLY HIRED TO INVESTIGATE GRAND JURY LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of the U.S. District
Court has reportedly appointed an outside expert to assist her
inquiry into whether the office of the Whitewater independent
counsel had illegally leaked grand jury evidence about the Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was reported Saturday by Associated Press,
citing unnamed legal sources who said that Ms. Johnson last week
secretly ordered the appointment of an expert, or special master.
Normally, a lawyer or law professor would be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The special master probably will review evidence submitted by
Kenneth Starr to rebut allegations that his office leaked
information. The special master will report to Ms. Johnson, who
will decide whether a penalty is required.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, and David Kendall, one of
President Clinton's lawyers, declined to comment. Associated Press
said its sources were outside Starr's and Kendall's offices.
</P>
<P>
   It is a violation of federal law for prosecutors or their
investigators to reveal information being considered by a grand
jury, but the law is rarely enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states that
prosecutors ``shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand
jury.'' Violations are considered contempt of court and are
punishable by fines and even prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But two law professors interviewed in February, Gerald E. Lynch
of Columbia University and Sara Sun Beale of Duke University, said
they knew of no instance in which a prosecutor was charged with
violating the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have long complained about the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a senior adviser to Clinton, said in February:
``When I see story after story that cites sources close to the
investigation, I think it's fair enough to call into question that
someone somewhere is leaking information. And I'm pretty sure it's
not the president's lawyers.''

EARNHARDT DECRIES LACK OF RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Five days after speedway developer Bruton Smith
said NASCAR Winston Cup racing has gotten monotonous, seven-time
series champion Dale Earnhardt called for the sanctioning body to
rethink its 5-and-5 aerodynamic rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not racing good now. We're playing follow-the-leader,''
said Earnhardt, who will start 36th in today's UAW-GM Quality 500
at Charlotte Motor Speedway. ``Everybody is real loose around other
cars. They've got to give everybody across the board some \Rrear\S
spoiler back and some \Rfront\S valence so we can drive the cars in
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-and-5 rule was introduced by NASCAR at the beginning of
the season in an effort to reduce speeds by taking away aerodynamic
downforce from the rear and front ends of the 3,400-pound cars.
That has made the cars less stable through the corners, forcing
drivers to lift off the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of dominating performances by the new Ford Taurus
early in the season, the rules were adjusted in March. The Taurus
and Chevrolet Monte Carlo currently compete with a 4.75-inch-high
rear spoiler and 5-inch front valence on all tracks 1 mile or
longer (with the exception of the restrictor plate races run at
Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway).
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR allows the Pontiac Grand Prix to compete with a
6.50-inch-high rear spoiler and 4.5-inch front valence height at
all tracks of one mile or longer (with the exception of Daytona and
Talladega).
</P>
<P>
   As confusing as it gets for the fans, Earnhardt said it is plain
frustrating for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not run in the corner with somebody behind me,'' said
Earnhardt, a five-time winner on CMS' 1.5-mile trioval. ``I'll let
'em by and then race behind them and then try to get back by them
later. You just can't race. They took the racing out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose Speedway Motorsports Inc. empire includes CMS and
Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, bemoaned the fact that even
championship points leaders Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin rarely race
side-by-side any more because of the rules. CMS added 12,000 seats
since last year's fall race here to increase capacity to 147,000.
Approximately 10,000 seats remained unsold for today's race, and
TBS' live telecast will be blacked out within a 50-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually the fans will get bored watching single-file runs
around these racetracks and they'll quit coming,'' said Earnhardt,
driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy. ``If NASCAR
wants to hurt the show, that's what they'll do.'' McLaughlin wins
BGN race Mike ``Magic Shoes'' McLaughlin stretched his fuel mileage
over the last 93 laps/139.5 miles en route to a strategic victory
in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series All Pro Bumper to Bumper
300.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin made his second and last pit stop during a caution
period on lap 107 of the 200-lapper. As series points leader Dale
Earnhardt Jr. and runner-up Matt Kenseth raced up front, McLaughlin
patiently remained within the top five. McLaughlin took the lead
for the second and last time on lap 178, after both Earnhardt and
Kenseth pitted for four tires and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up track position to get fuel mileage. But we were
catching up to the leaders, despite all that,'' said McLaughlin,
driver of the No. 34 Goulds Pumps Chevy. ``The boys in the pits won
it. They made the right calls. I even questioned them when they
left me out for track position, and they said we could make it on
fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's second career victory, and second of the season,
came at the expense of Kenseth, who finished 24.074 seconds behind.
Points leader Earnhardt was third, but retained his 97-point
advantage over Kenseth with three races remaining. McLaughlin's
winning average speed was 145.376 mph. Another Gordon streak Gordon
will have to hustle to keep a personal streak going during today's
race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has a 199-point lead over Martin, will be gunning
for his 15th consecutive top-five finish. But he qualified the No.
24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy in 26th, the first time he has
started outside the top 10 since a 17th-place effort at Texas Motor
Speedway in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely proud of 14 straight top-fives,'' said Gordon,
who is gunning for his third Cup title in four years. ``I'm amazed
at it and don't want it to end. If it ends, I hope it's because I
finish sixth. But the deciding factor for this championship is if
something breaks on my car or Mark's car, or if we get caught up in
a wreck or cause a wreck. That's the deciding factor _ not whether
we finish fifth or sixth.'' Mayfield tops practice Jeremy Mayfield,
Martin and Ernie Irvan were the only drivers to exceed the 176-mph
barrier during yesterday's Winston Cup ``Happy Hour'' final
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield topped the speed chart at 176.800 mph in the No. 12
Mobil 1 Ford. Martin's best lap was 176.621 mph in the No. 6
Valvoline Ford. Gordon was 33rd overall after a best lap of 172.557
mph.

AGGIES RALLY PAST JAYHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum was quick yesterday
to attempt the positive spin on Texas A&AMP;M's come-from-behind 24-21
victory over lightly regarded Kansas in the Aggies' Big 12 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would liked to have come out of here firing on all
cylinders, thinking you've got everything all oiled up and ready to
go,'' Slocum said. ``But sometimes when you do that, the other side
is you think you're in great shape. When you play like this and
still get a win, you don't have any trouble motivating your
players. They know we've still got a lot to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Slocum also admitted that the 18th-ranked Aggies may be in
for another dizzying experience next week against unbeaten Nebraska
if they don't solve some lingering problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play like we've played today, this year, particularly
on offense, and stay on the field with Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Randy McCown deftly engineered an 11-play, 75-yard
fourth-quarter scoring march that lifted A&AMP;M over the two-touchdown
underdog Jayhawks (2-3, 0-3). Dante Hall's 3-yard touchdown run _
his third of a 177-yard afternoon _ came with 3:24 to play. A&AMP;M's
defense, which had given up consecutive KU scoring drives of 87 and
83 yards, righted itself to stop the Jayhawks on fourth down at
their own 48 with 2:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   But all agreed that such heroics should not have been necessary
after the Aggies jumped to an early 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could have put the game away a little earlier, but
things didn't happen for us, and we let them get back into the
game,'' said McCown, who went the distance in place of Branndon
Stewart. ``We were fortunate everyone played well and rose up at
the end of the game. It's an ugly win. But it's a win and that's
what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M played well early and late.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dat Nguyen _ him again _ intercepted KU quarterback
Zac Wegner's game-opening pass at the KU 28. His 17-yard return set
up Hall's first TD on an 8-yard sweep two plays later. The Aggies
then came back to go up 14 after an impressive 70-yard drive that
Hall ended with a 1-yard leap.
</P>
<P>
   End of good first impression.
</P>
<P>
   KU responded when Wegner hit Termaine Fulton behind cornerback
Jason Webster for a 58-yard touchdown before the end of the
quarter. Then came a futile second quarter during which A&AMP;M took 19
of 20 snaps inside the KU 50 _ and did not score. Slocum once
disdained a 40-yard field-goal attempt by sophomore Russell Bynum _
after flanker Leroy Hodge dropped a first-down pass at the 12 _ and
the Aggies failed to convert on fourth-and-eight at the KU 23.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M also punted twice from the KU 31, evidencing Slocum's doubt
about his young field-goal kicker, who missed twice (35, 28) last
week. And in the third quarter after Nguyen recovered a muffed punt
at the KU 13, the Aggies failed to score twice from inside the 1
and again from the 3 _ settling for Bynum's 21-yard field goal and
a 17-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job of scheming, blitzing and catching us in
slants in the red zone,'' said Hall, who was stopped short in each
of the three bursts into the line. ``They just did a great job of
putting pressure on us. And we didn't handle it.'' Extra points
Hall (36 carries, 177 yards, 255 all-purpose yards) became the
first Aggies player to gain 100 or more yards this season. His
previous high was 84 against North Texas and his only better game
was 184 yards against Texas Tech as a freshman (1996). ... McCown
netted 15 yards rushing on 13 carries, but gained 24 yards on three
carries in the telling 75-yard TD drive before losing a pair on a
sack. ... A&AMP;M gained a season-high 223 yards rushing, but against a
team that ranked No. 101 against the run with an average yield of
230.5.

 &HT;    Tennessee squeezes tight victory from Auburn
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Had someone taken an air pump and squeezed twice,
the football would've expanded enough to cross the goal line.
That's how close this was. Tennessee's Tee Martin had fumbled.
Auburn had recovered, the ball spotted a silly millimeter from the
end zone. One emphatic surge and Auburn would cut the Vol lead to a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   First-and-goal, a millimeter to go: Auburn inserts Gabe Gross at
quarterback. The titular starter, Ben Leard of Hartwell, Ga., has
had a frightful half. He has completed but one pass, has had a
shovel pass intercepted (!) and returned for a 90-yard touchdown,
had fumbled on a keeper inside the Vol 10. Oh, yeah: Leard has also
been dealt an elbow bruise.
</P>
<P>
   So now comes Gabe Gross, a freshman. (His center, Ben Nowland,
is likewise.) But hey, it's first-and-a-millimeter. From here, Gabe
Kaplan could direct the Sweathogs to a touchdown. One emphatic
surge. That's all.
</P>
<P>
   First down: Gross bobbles the exchange from Nowland and nudges
forward. Second down, two millimeters now. Gross sneaks again.
Touchdown? No ref lifts his arms. The Vol defenders turn and
gesture to their orange-hued backers, seated in the end zone
directly behind. (Georgia fans fondly remember this section of
seating as the Hose Zone.) The traveling Vol Army starts to scream.
Is such a thing possible? A goal-line stand from a millimeter away?
</P>
<P>
   Auburn calls timeout. This is the play it selects for use on
third-and-goal _ a line smash by fullback Tellie Embrey. Embrey
weighs 222 pounds. He gets nothing.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Fourth-and-goal, the Tennessee backers beside themselves
now. Leard returns, tender elbow notwithstanding. This is a Key
Moment. Down 17-3 at home, the nation's No. 3 team poised to
inflict another loss on the once-mighty Tigers, Auburn simply
cannot let itself blow this gimme. Leard takes the snap, turns and
hands again to Embrey. And, to borrow the words the venerable Vol
broadcaster John Ward used to describe another bit of Orange
stonewalling (at Kentucky in 1987):
</P>
<P>
   ''Not. . .even. . .ITALICSclose.ITALICS END''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five minutes of the second quarter and the entire second
half remained, a longish span over which much appeared to happen
but in truth nothing happened. Tennessee's offense crashed,
mustering only four first downs those 35 minutes. Auburn, behind
Gross exclusively, kept drawing near enough to kick field goals but
no closer. The final score, 17-9, tells us: (A.) that Tennessee is
the least imposing No. 3 team in the history of polling, and (B.)
that Auburn has fallen so far as to be unable to pick off a
conspicuously wheezing opponent even at Jordan-Hare.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols are a puzzlement. They beat Florida in OT on a night
they were outgained hugely. They beat Auburn by eight shaky points
after seizing a 14-0 lead in the first five minutes. Martin,
successor to the sainted Peyton Manning, completed a grand total of
five passes. The splendid back Jamal Lewis appeared to hurt his
ankle in the fourth quarter. Even so, the Orange never seemed in
real peril. When the opponent can't score from a millimeter away,
where's the worry?

 &HT;    No happy ending for Tennessee-Auburn matchup
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ For Tennessee, it was not a performance that will
gather the confidence or the endorsement of the pollsters. For
Auburn, it was an exercise in frustration that will have the Tigers
thinking what might have been for many weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be said of Saturday afternoon's exercise at
Jordan-Hare Stadium is that No. 3 Tennessee beat Auburn 17-9 in a
game that left no one happy.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (4-0) exited the stadium wondering what happened to
its much-vaunted offense. Thanks to a 90-yard interception return
by defensive end Shaun Ellis and a 67-yard touchdown by Jamal
Lewis, the Volunteers led 14-0 with less than five minutes gone in
the game. After that the Tennessee offense was no where to be
found. Jeff Hall would add a field goal at the 2:51 mark in the
first quarter and that would be all the scoring the Vols' machine
could muster.
</P>
<P>
   For Auburn, the afternoon's disasters on offense almost defy
description. In the first half alone, Auburn had the ball at the
Tennessee 11, 10 and 1 and did not score a point.
</P>
<P>
   By the second half the Tigers were being led by a true freshman
at quarterback, Gabe Gross, who took over for the injured Ben
Leard. Gross led Auburn to a pair of field goals and got the Tigers
to the Tennessee 22-yard with two seconds left. His pass to Karsten
Bailey was broken up in the end zone on the final play of the game
and Tennessee manged to cling to the win.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped Auburn to 1-3 for the first time since 1981
with road games against Mississippi State and Florida coming in the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is still undefeated but asking a lot of questions
about its offense this morning after its inability to move the
ball. Lewis, the sophomore from Marietta, suffered an ankle sprain
in the second half but it is not known if he'll be at full speed
for next Saturday's nationally-televised game with Georgia.

 &HT;    Inept offense foils prospect of victory for Clemson
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ With his job prospects hanging very much in
the balance, Clemson head coach Tommy West needed a win, obtained
by any means possible, to quell the calls for his demise. On
Saturday, he might have gotten it were it not for his inept
offensive unit which cost the Tigers a 21-14 verdict to an equally
hapless North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a tragedy of errors between two teams with a
combined record of 1-7 turned out to be a wild finish that put the
Tar Heels in the winner's circle for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers held a 14-7 first-half lead until early in the fourth
quarter, when Carolina (1-3, 1-1 ACC) scored two touchdowns in a
1:02 span to send Clemson (1-4, 0-3) to its fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels forged a 14-14 tie on a four-yard TD run by Rufus
Brown, and took the lead with 10:06 to play following a Clemson
fumble. Redshirt freshman Woodrow Dantzler, who started in place of
the struggling Brandon Streeter at quarterback, lost the ball by
running into into his own offensive lineman on a scramble.
Carolina's Steve Fisher recovered at the 12 for Carolina, and Deon
Dyer caught a 12-yard screen pass from Oscar Davenport on the next
play for the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Streeter, who threw four interceptions in a loss to Wake Forest
last week, came in to take the Tigers all the way down to the
Carolina 2. But on fourth and goal, Travis Zachery took an option
pass and was dropped for a three-yard loss by Jomo Legins with 5:08
to play. Clemson was driving deep in the last 90 seconds when Brian
Wofford fumbled after catching a Streeter pass near the goal line.
A mad scramble for the ball ensued, but it rolled out of the back
of the end zone for a Carolina touchback at the 1:29 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson led 14-7 at halftime despite not completing a pass or
converting a third down. Punter Kevin Laird twice pinned the Tar
Heels deep, with both efforts leading to short, defense-aided
touchdowns. Clemson tied the score at 7-7 when Alex Ardley
intercepted a Davenport pass initially tipped by linebacker Chris
Jones and returned it 26 yards untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were forced to punt three plays and out on their next
series, but Laird got a good roll and Antwan Edwards downed the
ball on the Carolina 2. On first down, Rufus Brown was stripped by
Jones, with Adrian Dingle recovering the fumble at the Tar Heels'
14. Dantzler got a first and goal to the one on a nine-yard option
run, then handed off to Terry Witherspoon for the go-ahead points.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina opened the scoring early in the second period on a
20-yard touchdown pass from Davenport to Na Brown. Davenport, who
started for the first time since tearing a left knee ligament in
the season opener, was lifted for true freshman Ronald Curry. But
when Curry went out after sustaining a pinched nerve in his left
shoulder late in the first quarter, Davenport perservered.

 &HT;    Inspired Alabama overcomes against Florida
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Eighth-ranked Florida eked out a 16-10
victory over inspired Alabama on Saturday and in the process
absolutely buried its once-mighty reputation as the SEC's most
dominant team _ at least in coach Steve Spurrier's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't play like champions any more. We play like a bunch of
losers,'' Spurrier said. ''That's all you can say about us. We're
not smart enough, we're not tough enough. I don't know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just an average bunch right now. We can't put a team
away. Can't score once we get down there, take advantage of
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida wide reciever Travis McGriff caught nine passes for 213
yards, the second-best single-game receiving yardage performance in
school history, including the Gators' only touchdown. Kicker Jeff
Chandler converted on field goals of 24 yards twice and a 28-yarder
with 4:01 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida's impotence near the goal line and a mental lapse on
defense enabled Alabama to keep the ending suspenseful until
Florida cornerback Tony George intercepted substitute quarterback
Andrew Zow's first down pass at the Gators 32.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (4-1, 2-1 SEC) appeared to be wrapping up this one with
3:19 to play. The Gators had driven from their 27 to the Bama 26.
On fourth-and-1, tailback Terry Jackson took the handoff and
attempted to squeeze through the middle of the line but was stopped
short of a first down.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide then shocked Florida with a 45-yard Zow to
Calvin Hall pass for a first down at the Gators 34.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were going to catch it and score a touchdown,''
Spurrier said. ''We were playing four deep and our defensive back
decided he wanted to play a little shorter than that. We're a very
undisciplined team; they don't play like the coaches ask. We've got
to try to make some changes and do something, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, George stepped in front of sideline pass
intended for Hall and the Gators sat on the final nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left for the Gators to do was examine their
futility on offense. The last time Florida was held to 16 points or
less in a victory was a 14-9 win over Florida State in 1991. It was
the Gators' lowest output since a 30-6 loss to Mississippi State in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Florida lost one scoring opportunity on one interception and
lost two fumbles, bringing its five-game total to 12. The Gators
lost just eight through 11 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Florida had first downs at the Alabama 9
and later at the Alabama 12 and had to settle for field goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, a first-and-goal at the Bama 8 died when
Fernando Bryant intercepted Doug Johnson in the end zone. A
first-and-goal at the 4 brought another Gators field goal. A
first-and-goal at the 2 was squandered when Johnson fumbled and
Travis Smith recovered for the Tide.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fourth quarter, Jackson lost a fumble on
first-and-goal at the 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me and the older guys on the team were sitting over on the
bench thinking we're pretty sorry now,'' Jackson said. ``We should
be scoring a lot of points easily but we're not. We're down on the
5-yard line and not scoring. High school teams can score from the
5-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternating Jesse Palmer and Johnson at quarterback, sometimes
on every other play, Spurrier's offense lacked any semblance of
consistency. He said he would try to go with one quarterback next
week against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just told Doug and Jesse, whoever has the best week of
practice is going to start the (LSU) game and got a chance to go
with it. I'm tried of this zig zaggin' around. When one's
struggling the other one's going in,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was 10-for-20 for 187 yards, Palmer 10-for-19 for 169
yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida defense sacked Alabama quarterbacks eight times and
held the Tide running game to 41 yards.

 &HT;    No need for trepidation as Georgia Tech takes win
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is without doubt that George O'Leary moved into the
second half at Georgia Tech Saturday afternoon with some degree of
trepidation. Likewise, he was counting on the old tradition that
there's some advantage in a team playing on its own yard. Grant
Field has been home to Georgia Tech football teams since 1913, the
oldest on-campus stadium south of Harvard and Pennsylvania, and
blessed by the addition of Bobby Dodd's name in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on Duke's turf last year, Georgia Tech rode casually
into the fourth quarter on a cushion of 38-11. At the end, the
Yellow Jackets were gasping and O'Leary wondered what had become of
all that stuff about the luck of the Irish. Duke coach Fred
Goldsmith had inserted a fifth-year quarterback who had lettered
only once, and David Green and Corey Thomas connected for four
touchdowns, like Montana and Rice, in harrowing succession. Georgia
Tech was saved by the clock, like a last-minute stay of execution.
O'Leary's team was already working on a three-game losing streak.
That would have been a deadly blow.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Devils came out of the box in the third quarter
here Saturday and drove from kickoff to touchdown with offensive
efficiency, you could hear the beat of O'Leary's heart. On this
first Saturday in October, though, the fourth quarter would belong
to Georgia Tech. Philip Rogers caught a 33-yard pass from Joe
Hamilton, Ed Wilder punished Duke defenders on an 11-yard run for
touchdown, and O'Leary felt so giddy, he introduced a new field
goal kicker, and Kai Cornwall, a sophomore from Newport News, Va.,
was true from 33 yards. That was it, Georgia Tech 17, Duke 0 in the
fourth, and the breathing was easier.
</P>
<P>
   As lopsided as the 41-13 score would indicate, Georgia Tech
could not have gone into this game with a bloated ego. Winning at
North Carolina was against a team of undetermined quality. Duke was
not a team to be taken lightly, as O'Leary had insisted and
newspaper headlines had corroborated. Nor did Goldsmith and company
come to this old accumulation of concrete and steel to surrender.
In fact, he was feeling pretty good in the second quarter, and here
the Duke coach takes up the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''We drop a dadgum interception that would have been a
touchdown,'' he said. ``Then we get the ball back and drive down
there. Everything looks fine and we go to the well once too often
on the naked bootleg.''
</P>
<P>
   There, Spencer Romine, the Duke quarterback, fumbled, Matt
Uremovich, redshirt freshman linebacker from New Lenox, Ill.,
picked up the bouncing ball and ran 54 of the most exhilirating
yards of his life for a touchdown. The score became 24-3 instead of
17-10, by Goldsmith calculation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Georgia Tech looked to be just too much for
Duke at this stage of the season. With each new day in the trench,
Hamilton picks it up another notch. ''I think we're beginning to
click,'' he said, and it's there to be seen. Line play, running
backs and receivers _ with an asterisk. Between them, six passes
were dropped Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If so it be, it's not a moment too soon. Georgia Tech now moves
into the killer stretch of the season, N.C. State, Virginia and
Florida State in a row, all conference rivals, but happily, the
latter two on home ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the record, this was the 577th game Georgia Tech has won in
intercollegiate football. Of more immediacy, this broke O'Leary's
personal tie at The Flat. He has moved over the edge, 21 times a
winner, 20 times loser.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech focuses on N.C. State after win over Duke
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three games removed from the Boston College fiasco and facing
the defining three games of its season, Georgia Tech shoved Duke
out of its way 41-13 on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly a win over Duke means in hard to say; the Blue
Devils have now lost an ACC record 21 straight conference games. A
better test awaits the Yellow Jackets (3-1 overall, 2-0 in the ACC)
in the next three weeks: a showdown against giant-killing N.C.
State, followed by home games against No. 10 Virginia and No. 9
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of next week's game at N.C. State's Carter-Finley
Stadium will be 3-0 in the ACC and tied for first place with
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it,'' Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton said. ``The
conference is won or lost right there, these three games. ... We're
going to show up Saturday and see what N.C. State is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   One man ready to see Hamilton on his way to Carter-Finley
Stadium and beyond is Duke coach Fred Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamilton needs to get his butt to the NFL,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   The junior quarterback passed for 256 yards and three touchdowns
as the Yellow Jackets won their third straight since being upset by
Boston College 41-31 in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton completed 20 of 32 throws, although six of his passes
were dropped. He threw no interceptions for the third game in a
row. Just one of his last 250 passes have been picked off, dating
to last year's North Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamilton wasn't dropping back to pass, he was burning Duke
on the option. Tech ran it 17 times and got 124 yards. Charlie
Rogers led the running backs this week with 51 yards on eight
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton took the suspense out of the game of the week from the
start. Alternating between run and pass, he opened the game by
taking Tech on a 92-yard drive that ended with Duke's defense
biting on a play-action fake and Hamilton hitting Dez White deep
for a 53-yard touchdown play and a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tech scored on three of its first four possession and never
allowed Duke closer than 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton used another drive of 90-plus yards to take care of any
chance for Duke (2-3, 0-3) to build momentum after the Blue Devils
had cut the lead to 24-13 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   This time Tech rolled 94 yards and scored on a 33-yard swing
pass to Phillip Rogers. The junior had dropped a similar pass in
the first half, but took this one, broke through any would-be
tacklers up the left and stretched into the end zone to give the
Yellow Jackets a 31-13 lead with 14:24 remaining in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach George O'Leary's only real complaints came with the
dropped passes and a lack of domination in the red zone _ Tech
settled for a field goal after a first-and-goal from the 7, and
later for a Brad Chambers' field goal try from 47 yards that
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has now scored more than 40 points three games in a row,
the first time the Jackets have done that since their 1990 UPI
national championship team did so in its last three wins over Wake
Forest, Georgia and Nebraska. Defensively, the Yellow Jackets can
feel good about the last three games too. Other than a pair of long
passes to Richmond Flowers, Tech was able to negate Duke's tandem
of good receivers and limited the Devils to a pair of Sims Lenhardt
field goals, of 45 and 50 yards, in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   For the third game in a row, Tech pulled the quarterback
sandwich, with defenders coming from opposite sides _ one pounding
the quarterback and the other picking up the resulting fumble and
running for the end zone. This week it Delaunta Cameron supplying
the first hit on Romine and Matt Uremovich scooping up the ball at
his feet. He returned it 54 yards, pulling away from one tackler
and scoring for a 24-3 second quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tech forced two turnovers in the first half and converted them
into 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Where last year's Tech defense surrendered four Duke touchdown
passes in the last quarter to make the game close, this one shut
the door on Duke on the way to Tech's eighth win over the Blue
Devils in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew everyone was going to be watching us real close after
the North Carolina win last week,'' Uremovich said. ''And we wanted
to let everyone know it wasn't a fluke. We wanted to show everyone
that we really do have a good defense here.''
</P>
<P>
   The true test, though, is next Saturday, when Tech's defense
will try to figure out what to do with N.C. State quarterback Jamie
Barnette and receiver Torry Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're standing right where we want to be, except for that one
loss,'' senior defensive end Jesse Tarplin said. ''We're headed in
the right direction. Every week we're getting better and better.
... (A win at N.C. State) puts you in the driver's seat. We've got
to concentrate hard and beat N.C. State.''

   The undersized Morehouse Maroon Tigers gave a good fight but
eventually succumbed to the Alcorn State Braves 27-13 Saturday
before a crowd of 6,500 at B.T. Harvey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn (2-3), a Division I-AA team from the Southwestern
Athletic Conference, outweighed Division II Morehouse (0-6) by an
average of 60 pounds per man. The Maroon Tigers used an array of
different sets on offense and various stunts on defense in an
attempt to neutralize the Braves' size advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assistant coaches did a great job of getting our players
in position to make some plays,'' said Morehouse first-year head
coach Frank Hickson. ``I really hurt for these kids because they
played hard. They came up against a formidable SWAC opponent, but
they hung together. I think they found out today that they can play
with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn head coach Johnny Thomas, also in his first year at the
helm, was impressed by the Maroon Tigers' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should have won this game by more than we did, but
you have to give Morehouse credit,'' Thomas said. ``They were
extremely well prepared and they are a good football team. We made
some mistakes and had some penalties that hurt us. Were thankful
for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Alcorn was en route to a blowout. Four minutes
into the contest, the Braves drove 74 yards in eight plays. Running
back Rodney Thomas capped the drive with a 1-yard touchdown to put
Alcorn on top and set the course for a record-setting day for the
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas finished with 32 carries and a school-record 240 yards.
But more impressive is the fact that he missed the better part of
three days of practice because of his class load. The
biology/pre-med major has a 3.2 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be much better than he already is,'' Thomas said.
``He is a great model for the student athlete and he does a
tremendous job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn led by only one, 7-6, at halftime as Morehouse senior
wide receiver Bruce Randall scored on an 8-yard run. The two-point
conversion failed, but the Maroon Tigers held Alcorn scoreless in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Braves scored 20 unanswered points in the second
half to put the game away. Two third-quarter touchdowns came on
passes of 26 yards to Donald Driver and 37 yards to Rennard
Reynolds from quarterback Damion Ford, who completed 13 of 28
passes for 228 yards, and ran for 51 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and his receivers were able to make some big plays when
they were left in man-to-man coverage when the Maroon Tigers
blitzed.

MR. OCTOBER HAS COMPANY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Another fall. Another chance for Reggie Jackson to defend his
title.
</P>
<P>
   It's 21 years ago this month that ``Reg-gie!'' earned seemingly
eternal man-of-the-month bragging rights with his unprecedented
World Series heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Three swings that won a game. One moniker that earned him
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. October.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this year's challenge to his reign will come from
back-to-back perfect games by flame-thrower Randy Johnson or more
two-touchdown frolics by footballer-turned-majorette Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Mr. October is safe. But he's also gotta be lonely.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to fill out the calendar _ the definitive millennium
sports chronicle hailing the 12 athletes who best defined a month
during the 20th century. Picked up in the year 2098, this calendar
will provide a snapshot of who we cheered and when we cheered them
back in the good ol' days of McGwire, Jordan and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means the 12 best or even best-known. Instead, this
log is filled with 12 who _ when viewed in their moment of glorious
triumph _ left no question as to what time of year it was in the
sports year.
</P>
<P>
   MAN FOR ALL SEASONS
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The only man who proved as consistent and predictable as time
itself. As unstoppable as blinking, he didn't define a specific
month during his 2,632 consecutive days on the job, but he did
manage to affix the national spotlight on the everyday chore of
going to work.
</P>
<P>
   MR. JANUARY
</P>
<P>
   Joe Montana
</P>
<P>
   Held a nation's breath by setting up ``The Catch'' with ``The
Pass'' to beat the Cowboys in the 1981 NFC Championship Game,
catapulting him and the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   MR. FEBRUARY
</P>
<P>
   1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team
</P>
<P>
   No matter when or where you see the grainy video footage from
Lake Placid now, you can't help but remember where you were and how
you felt when the underdog amateur Americans slayed the mighty
Russians, then won the gold.
</P>
<P>
   MR. MARCH
</P>
<P>
   John Wooden
</P>
<P>
   Only after his departure did college basketball blossom into
madness. Before, the genius UCLA coach swallowed any suspense by
amassing 10 NCAA men's basketball titles in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   MR. APRIL
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever prowled the greens and azaleas of The Masters
like the Golden Bear. A record six green jackets made his visits to
the Butler's Cabin a rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   MR. MAY
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky
</P>
<P>
   The most dominant hockey player of all time upstaged Kentucky's
horses and Indy's cars by capping four NHL seasons with Stanley
Cups and another nine with Most Valuable Player awards.
</P>
<P>
   MR. JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Six NBA Finals appearances. Six NBA championships. Six NBA
Finals MVP awards. The game-winning shot in what might have been
his final game. Basketball's best ever wore a path to Grant Park
under the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   MR. JULY
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Borg
</P>
<P>
   Long before the days of oversized titanium racquets and
style-over-substance images, he was the king of Wimbledon's
pristine lawn courts. Using a steely stare and a cruel two-handed
backhand as his fireworks, the stoic Swede won tennis' ultimate
tournament a record six times. (See Martina Navratilova and her
nine Wimbledons in the ``Ms.'' calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   MR. AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lewis
</P>
<P>
   Whether smoothly striding over 200 meters, taking a baton for a
furious final 100 anchor leg, or soaring into the sand, he captured
10 Olympic medals over 12 years on sultry days and nights dripping
with sweat and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   MR. SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
</P>
<P>
   Only Jerry Lewis has piled up gaudier numbers than these two
around Labor Day. Their home-run chase was better than any pennant
race, gluing fans to arguably the most memorable month in the
history of America's past-time.
</P>
<P>
   MR. OCTOBER _ Reggie Jackson
</P>
<P>
   Like his trifecta at Yankee Stadium on Oct. 18, 1977, his
14-pitch battle with Dodgers rookie Bob Welch that ended in a
strikeout became a '78 fall classic.
</P>
<P>
   MR. NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jackson
</P>
<P>
   From growling about ``big uglies'' to jumping out of his ABC
blazer over a ``fumblllllllle!'', no one set the stage for an
autumn college football rivalry like him. Jackson's folksy ``Whoa,
Nellie'' vernacular became as traditional in early winter as Ohio
State-Michigan, Oklahoma-Nebraska, Texas-Texas A&AMP;M and
turkey-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   MR. DECEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi
</P>
<P>
   The only man more comfortable in knee-deep snow and minus-20
wind chill was Santa Claus himself. The image of the gritty Green
Bay Packers coach in his element _ stalking the ``frozen tundra''
with a rolled-up playsheet _ is as powerful today as when his teams
went 22-2-2 in December games from 1959-67, and won five NFL
championships.

WHITE HOUSE DENOUNCES LATEST RELEASE OF MATERIAL FROM STARR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House Saturday denounced the latest
disclosures in the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal as ``garbage,'' while
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee appeared ready to
signal that his panel would complete an impeachment inquiry by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   With the midterm congressional elections only a month away, all
sides in the controversy are struggling for the high ground as an
impeachment inquiry is all but certain to begin in earnest this
week on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife retreated to Camp David Saturday
afternoon for a respite from the storm that has consumed the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, White House and Democratic lawyers continued
to examine the 4,610 pages of grand jury testimony, FBI interviews,
and tape transcripts released Friday by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The release of three thick volumes on Friday means that almost
all of the significant evidence compiled by the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, during his eight-month investigation of
Clinton's affair with a former White House intern has been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Joseph Lockhart, Saturday described the
evidence as politically motivated. ``If you take a careful read now
of these two massive gargage dumps, I think serious questions
become clear about some of the conclusions and inferences that the
Starr referral reached that are not backed up by any evidence,''
said Lockhart, who took over as press secretary Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress appears to be moving inexorably toward an
impeachment inquiry. Representative Henry Hyde, the Illinois
Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is expected
to express his intent to try to finish the inquiry by the end of
1998 when he appears today on television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic proposal that an inquiry end by Nov. 25 has been
rebuffed by Republicans, but Hyde is expected to make a
conciliatory gesture Sunday. He reached out to Democrats on Friday
when he reversed himself and agreed to ask Starr whether he intends
to send Congress more evidence of impeachable offenses on other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat, led a
bipartisan effort to secure that information from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats and Republicans expect the GOP-controlled
Judiciary Committee to vote along party lines to begin an
open-ended inquiry to determine whether Clinton should be
impeached. The full House is expected to approve the inquiry as
early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides then expect the committee to do nothing until after
the Nov. 3 election. ``It seems to me that we are going to be
treading water until November,'' said Judiciary Committee member
Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said Republicans need to keep the possibility of
impeachment alive until the election to keep their conservative
base content, but not push so far that they alienate Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have a dilemma,'' said Frank, who added that
prolonging the matter until the next Congress in January 1999 would
be unfair to both Clinton and the public.
</P>
<P>
   While Frank and others believe that Democrats no longer are just
playing defense, he cautioned that the political situation is
uncertain. ``The Democrats have a dilemma if the White House starts
to get too cocky,'' said Frank, a supporter of Clinton. ``They
cannot forget in this situation that Bill Clinton did something
wrong. They are entitled to fairness, but not to indignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee staffers Saturday worked behind the scenes
to prepare for tomorrow's historic hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Stratman, a committee spokesman, said he could not
confirm reports that David P. Schippers, the leading committee
investigator, will drop abuse-of-power charges from Starr's list of
11 impeachable offenses, while adding charges related to witness
tampering, obstruction of justice, and making false statements
under oath.

US WINS SUPPORT FOR NEW CREDIT FOR HEALTHY ECONOMIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finance officials from the world's seven wealthiest
nations began negotiating a plan Saturday to revive the ailing
global economy, which has left one-quarter of the world in
recession and shows new signs of weakening the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it won support from Britain and France for
one of President Clinton's main ideas, the creation of a new line
of credit for economically sound nations that nonetheless need to
convince jittery investors that they can pay their debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, while welcoming
the plan, told reporters that it ``would not be very convincing''
unless Clinton persuades Congress to approve $18 billion for US
commitements to existing International Monetary Fund programs.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, meanwhile, claimed support from six Asian nations for its
proposal to spend $30 billion in aid to help revive other East
Asian economies. US officials helped kill a similar plan last year,
and US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has said that Japan, the
world's second-largest economy, can help the world most by spending
its money to clean up its own debt-ridden banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of plans floating around this town for big
reforms,'' said Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who is skeptical of some US proposals.
``Let's hope it works, but I wouldn't bet on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of meetings in Washington this week, finance
ministers and central bankers from around the world are casting
about for ways to shore up the ``global financial architecture,'' a
sweeping phrase that refers to the rules for global investment and
to several international agencies, including the IMF and World
Bank. Those lending agencies were created to encourage development
and stability, and they have been sharply criticized for their
response to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the bureaucratic talk, the ministers are trying to
ease a crisis that has played havoc with hundreds of millions of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that once-robust Asian nations were close to bankruptcy,
investors have pulled billions of dollars from of East Asia in the
past 14 months, leaving companies without cash and people without
jobs. Japan is also in recession. ``We're looking at two years of
negative growth and two years of low, even if it is positive,
growth,'' Mari Pangestu, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Indonesia, said of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian turmoil has also roiled Latin American markets such as
Brazil, and there are also fresh signs that it will end seven years
of economic expansion in the United States. Gillette Co. of Boston
announced 4,700 job cuts last week, blaming low sales in Asia,
Brazil and Russia. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.7
percent last week and is in negative territory for the year. And on
Friday, the government said that US job growth slowed in September.
</P>
<P>
   World finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in
several forums to fashion a response. The so-called G-7 nations met
Saturday, and they will convene an unusual meeting Monday with
officals from 15 emerging market nations. The G-7 major industrial
nations are: the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy,
Canada and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, annual meetings begin at the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. President Clinton has said he will
``personally participate'' in Monday's meeting of industrial and
emerging nations, and he will address the IMF-World Bank meetings
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the table will be several proposals that are already stirring
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a proposal that aides have left vague, is proposing
a new line of credit at the International Monetary Fund to aid
nations that are essentially sound, but which find themselves swept
into the financial panic. US officials have not named countries,
but Brazil might be an example.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the Asian crisis, panicked investors have begun pulling
their money from all emerging markets. Some investors fear that
these nations have borrowed more money than they can repay or have
insufficient reserves to buy up their own currencies to maintain
the value of the currency. A nation might allay these fears merely
by having access to a large credit line, even if it was never
tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French
President Jacques Chirac to lobby personally for the idea and got a
favorable response, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
Miyazawa told reporters he would also support it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea is politically charged because Clinton, while
pressing allies for the new credit line, has not yet won a
year-long effort to win $18 billion from Congress to shore up the
IMF's reserves.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress aiming to adjourn for the year on Friday, Clinton
used his weekly radio speech Saturday to press lawmakers again for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also proposed a debt-restructuring plan
for Asian nations and companies. Some nations owe so much to
lenders that they cannot spend much money to spur their own
economies. Under the plan, which is still in development, the
United States and other nations would recruit bankers and global
agencies to change the terms of the loans or to accept stock in
companies that borrowed the money in return for forgiving part of
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   However, a coalition of creditors warned Saturday that it would
oppose any effort to extend the idea to include so-called
``emergency debt standstill'' provisions, under which nations can
suspend payments on their debts while negotiating new terms with
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday An even more controversial idea, proposed by France and
Japan in vague language, would allow countries in times of crisis
to restrict the flow of money by investors into or out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Known as capital controls, the idea is opposed by bankers and by
the United States. But others say it could force investors to lend
money or buy stocks in foreign nations more wisely, as they would
not be able to remove their money quickly if economic conditions
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, capital flowed into the factories, banks and other
companies in emerging Asian nations at the rate of $100 billion a
year. Within months of the Asian panic, it flowed out at the same
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to avoid the conclusion that a system of totally
unfettered global capital markets exposes most countries,
especially small and medium-sized countries, to the risk of serious
financial disruption,'' said Moeen Qureshi, a former prime minister
of Pakistan and former World Bank vice president.

STARR SAID TO HAVE RECEIVED TIP ON AFFAIR BEFORE CALL BY TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1.)  
(lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his impeachment report to Congress, Kenneth
Starr said he was first informed about President Clinton's affair
with a White House intern by a Pentagon employee, Linda Tripp, who
called the Whitewater independent counsel's office on the evening
of Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   What the report does not disclose is that the independent
counsel's office had already been tipped off by a lawyer with
connections to the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At least a week before Mrs. Tripp's call, Jerome M. Marcus, a
Philadelphia lawyer with ties to the Jones legal team, informed a
law school friend in Starr's office of the accusations related to
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, lawyers familiar with
Starr's inquiry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The tip in early January indicates that the independent
counsel's office could have been developing a strategy to persuade
the Justice Department to expand the scope of the stalled
Whitewater inquiry before the call from Mrs. Tripp. That strategy _
arguing a parallel in the efforts by the President's friend Vernon
Jordan to find jobs for Webster Hubbell, the convicted Justice
Department official, and Ms. Lewinsky _ prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton's lawyers and political advisers have
complained that lawyers sympathetic to Mrs. Jones' case had fed
information to Starr in hopes of prompting a criminal inquiry of
the president and elevating the importance of the Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit. After the scandal became public later in
January, Hillary Rodham Clinton claimed that there was ``a vast,
right-wing conspiracy'' determined to destroy her husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to people familiar with the discussions, the role of
go-between played by a group of conservative lawyers with ties to
the Jones case created an early and previously undisclosed
back-channel between Starr's office and Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus is one of a group of conservative lawyers who assisted
the Jones legal team and then secretly helped Mrs. Tripp find a
lawyer and bring her accusations to Starr's attention, according to
lawyers familiar with their actions. Marcus, a partner with the law
firm of Berger &AMP; Montague in Philadelphia, did not respond to
messages left at his office. Nor would Starr's office confirm any
involvement by Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person in our office did get a heads-up call that some
information may be coming or may be out there,'' Charles Bakaly, a
spokesman for Starr, said Saturday. ``And this person was
instructed that we accept information through the front door, and
that the appropriate person to contact is Jackie Bennett, the
Washington deputy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said it was against the office policy to name either the
lawyer who tipped off Starr's office in early January about the
Lewinsky matter, or the particular prosecutor who took the phone
call.

</P>
<P>
   STARR SPOKESMAN DENIES CONSPIRACY
</P>
<P>
   Responding to White House charges that the investigation of
Clinton is the product of a conservative conspiracy, Bakaly said,
``We believe these kinds of allegations that something was improper
or inappropriate are merely efforts to divert attention from the
facts and evidence that was gathered by this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Marcus, the group of lawyers that helped Mrs. Tripp
included Richard W. Porter, a law partner of Starr's at the Chicago
firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, and George T. Conway III, a partner at
Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The three lawyers, who were all members of the Federalist
Society, a conservative legal organization whose events have been
attended by Starr, helped Mrs. Tripp find a new lawyer, James A.
Moody, who was also a member of the Federalist Society. They then
worked together, in secret deliberations with Mrs. Tripp's
confidante Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent, to bring
Mrs. Tripp's tapes and story to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg said Saturday that she had told these lawyers and
several other friends who are politically conservative about Mrs.
Tripp's accusations in late December and early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else would I go to to get involved in something like
this?'' Ms. Goldberg asked. ``The people who have the most axes to
grind.''
</P>
<P>
   The three lawyers who formed a secret bridge between Mrs. Tripp
and Starr share involvement in the Paula Jones case, membership in
conservative groups and friendships, some of which extended into
Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Lewinsky matter, Marcus had signed a friend of
the court brief filed with the Supreme Court in support of the
Jones case, and he is an outspoken critic of the president. In an
Op-Ed article published on Sept. 23 in The Washington Times, Marcus
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton's lies didn't just cover up an adulterous act. His
lies covered up his selfishness. His lies covered up his total lack
of respect for the American people, and his lack of respect for the
house of ours in which we have invited him to live for a time.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRM INVESTIGATES LAWYER'S WORK
</P>
<P>
   Conway and Porter have also done legal work in support of the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Starr himself was briefly involved in the Jones case:
Before becoming the Whitewater independent counsel in August 1994,
he helped the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative
organization, file a friend of the court brief in the Jones case.
Starr was not paid for his services.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31 of this year, Starr announced that he was taking an
unpaid, indefinite leave of absence from Kirkland &AMP; Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kirkland &AMP; Ellis began an internal
investigation into whether Porter was doing unapproved legal work
on the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Responding by fax, Porter said Saturday night: ``The information
raised by The New York Times is unclear. What is clear is this: I
say without qualification or parsing, neither I nor my firm has
ever offered legal counsel to Lucianne Goldberg or Linda Tripp or
represented them at any time in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who like Marcus is a 1987 graduate of the University of
Chicago Law School, was also a senior aide in the Bush White House
and conducted ``opposition research'' for Vice President Dan
Quayle, which included preparations for Quayle's debate with Al
Gore in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Conway also played a behind-the-scenes role in the Jones case
and helped write the Supreme Court brief in the Jones case. He did
not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   EFFORT TO HIDE LINK TO STARR IS DETAILED
</P>
<P>
   The three lawyers went to great lengths to hide their
communications with Ms. Goldberg and Starr's office. In early
January, Ms. Goldberg had conversations with Marcus and Porter to
discuss how Mrs. Tripp might contact Starr. In her interview on
Saturday, Ms. Goldberg described Marcus as ``a cutout,'' who was
brought into the matter to keep Porter's role obscured because of
his close ties to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, several days after Marcus' call, Mrs. Tripp
contacted Bennett, Starr's deputy, from her home in Columbia, Md.
Ms. Goldberg said Porter had passed on Bennett's office phone
number, which she gave to Mrs. Tripp. Mrs. Tripp spoke with Bennett
for 90 minutes. At 10:30 p.m., three prosecutors and an FBI agent
climbed into a van and rushed to Mrs. Tripp's home, where they
spoke with her for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released on Friday by Congress included some
details about the early days of Starr's inquiry into the Lewinsky
matter. The documents said it was Ms. Goldberg who had steered Mrs.
Tripp to Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, said the information given
to a lawyer in his office, whom he refused to identify, was
``vague'' and ``somewhat sketchy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just one friend calling another friend,'' Bakaly
said. ``We get information from all kinds of sources. As far as we
were concerned, we didn't get the information until the 12th, until
Linda Tripp called.''
</P>
<P>
   The early call to Starr's office from Marcus, and his
involvement in the Jones case, were not disclosed by the
independent counsel when Starr sought approval from the Justice
Department in January to expand his investigation from
Whitewater-related matters to include the Lewinsky matter.

</P>
<P>
   DOCUMENTS LINK JONES AND STARR CASES
</P>
<P>
   The role of link between the Jones and Starr cases as played by
Mrs. Tripp is more clearly spelled out in the 4,600 pages of
additional documents compiled by Starr and released by the House of
Representatives on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another link is Michael Isikoff, a Newsweek investigative
reporter who covered the Jones case and wrote the first
comprehensive story about the Lewinsky investigation, and whose
dealings with Starr's office is the subject of new and previously
undisclosed dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sandler, a Democratic Party lawyer, recently referred
questions to a Federal judge about Isikoff's communications with
Starr's office in mid-January, in the days before Starr's expanded
inquiry became publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, meanwhile, served as a logical bridge for Starr between
the Whitewater inquiry and the Lewinsky case. The parallel was
highlighted in Starr's impeachment report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations with respect to Mr. Jordan and the job search
were similar to ones already under review in the ongoing Whitewater
investigation,'' Starr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, lawyers for Clinton complained that the reference to the
Clintons' failed Whitewater land deal was one of only two in the
455-page impeachment report.
</P>
<P>
   REPORTER DENIES URGING TRIPP TO MAKE TAPES
</P>
<P>
   In the newly released documents, and in interviews this week
with principal participants in Starr's inquiry, Mrs. Tripp's role
in prompting Starr's sex-and-perjury inquiry became clear:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Oct. 6, Mrs. Tripp met with Isikoff at a Washington
apartment and offered to play for him audiotapes of her telephone
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. In an FBI interview with Mrs.
Tripp last June, she said Isikoff had declined to listen to the
tapes but ``suggested that Tripp make additional tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Isikoff and Ann McDaniel, Newsweek's Washington bureau
chief, adamantly denied this week that the reporter had suggested
Mrs. Tripp record additional tapes.
</P>
<P>
   _ In November, according to the documents released on Friday,
Mrs. Tripp anonymously called lawyers for Mrs. Jones and told them
about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president. Both Mrs.
Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky were subsequently subpoenaed in the Jones
suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ms. Goldberg added that she also phoned Bennett some time in
January to discuss Mrs. Tripp's accusations, but she refused to say
when. Ms. Goldberg, who in 1972 was a Nixon campaign informer on
George McGovern's presidential campaign plane, acknowledged that
she relished her role as an instigator and source to Isikoff. ``It
was cloak and dagger,'' she said with a laugh, ``like the old Nixon
years.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 13, just a day after she called Starr's office, Mrs.
Tripp wore an FBI wire and taped a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky.
This was one day before Starr asked the Justice Department to
expand his investigation. At the urging of the office of the
independent counsel, Mrs. Tripp repeatedly steered the conversation
with Ms. Lewinsky to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 15, Isikoff was chasing the Lewinsky story for
Newsweek. On that day, he went to Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   What transpired at that meeting is the subject of still another
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Sandler, the Democratic Party lawyer, raised
questions about Isikoff's Jan. 15 meeting with Starr's prosecutors
in a letter to Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court.
Ms. Johnson has been investigating accusations that Starr's
prosecutors leaked confidential information to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Ms. Johnson, according to several Democratic
lawyers who are familiar with its contents, recounts a conversation
that Sandler said he had had with a limousine driver, Waverly
Jenkins. Jenkins picked up Isikoff outside Starr's office on Jan.
15.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sandler's letter, Jenkins, who declined to be
interviewed for this article, said he had overheard Isikoff making
a telephone call from the car's backseat in which Isikoff said he
had listened to tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff denied that such a conversation had taken place, denied
listening to tapes in Starr's office and called Jenkins' account
``preposterous,''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike did make contact with Starr's office, as we reported in
the magazine,'' added Ms. McDaniel, the Newsweek bureau chief.
``This was part of the normal course of his reporting. But a
nanosecond of tape was never played for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in Starr's office also denied having played tapes or
having provided Isikoff with confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't listen to any tapes,'' said Bakaly, the independent
counsel's spokesman. ``We listened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Isikoff and Bakaly challenged several assertions
made by the limousine driver. For example, the driver claimed that
he had heard Isikoff say he was in the office for ``four or five
hours.'' In fact, he was there for one hour, Isikoff and Bakaly
said.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP MET SECRETLY WITH JONES' LAWYERS
</P>
<P>
   Sandler, who became involved in the matter through a client, a
Democratic consultant named Jennifer Lazlo, refused to discuss the
matter except to say, ``I have referred it to the appropriate
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 15, Starr's prosecutors told Justice
Department lawyers that Isikoff's pursuit of the story created
pressure for quickly expanding the Whitewater independent counsel's
authority to investigate the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, with approval to expand the investigation, Starr's
team confronted Ms. Lewinsky in a failed attempt to win her
cooperation. That night, on the eve of Clinton's deposition in the
Jones case, Mrs. Tripp secretly met for hours with lawyers for Mrs.
Jones and briefed them about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Tripp's secret meeting with the Jones team was cited by
Clinton in his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news reports are that Linda Tripp talked to you, then went
and talked with the Jones lawyers and, you know, that she prepared
them for this,'' Clinton told prosecutors. He also said he was
convinced that Mrs. Tripp had ``set me up.''

WITH BOSTON'S TEAM, THE SCRIPT IS ALWAYS THE SAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, they are always the Red Sox. Good turns
into bad. Victory dissolves into defeat. Joy gives way to sadness.
We go to the theater and enjoy the performances, but the script
never changes. Hamlet dies in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Time to bring the storm windows up from the cellar and peel the
tarp off the cordwood, sports fans. Boston's baseball summer is
over. Mo Vaughn's Red Sox career might be over. The Olde Towne Team
is not going to win the World Series. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost Game 4 of their American League Division Series
against the Indians, 2-1, at Fenway Park Saturday afternoon/last
night. It was an excruciating defeat that gave the Tribe a 3-1 win
in the best-of-five series and sent the Sox home for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Controversial Boston starter Pete Schourek pitched 5 1/3 stellar
innings of two-hit baseball, and got one run of support when
wonderboy Nomar Garciaparra homered in the fourth. Schourek looked
like he'd go down in New England sports history alongside Gary
Waslewski and David and Gerald Henderson. He was the surprise hero.
</P>
<P>
   But then Sox manager Jimy Williams and pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan started thinking too hard. The manager and coach had been
pressured by fans and media to bring back ace Pedro Martinez on
three days' rest but said they would not deviate from their
season-long plan. They said they would not panic. They looked like
geniuses when Schourek delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Then they panicked. The did something they did not do all
season. Leading, 1-0, after seven, the Sox summoned closer Tom
Gordon to start the eighth. Gordon is a one-inning specialist who
saved 46 games this season, including 43 straight leading into the
playoffs. Before you could say ``Jim Burton,'' Gordon gave up two
hits and a two-run double to David Justice with one out in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox threatened in the bottom of the eighth when Vaughn hit a
one-out double off the wall. Donnie Sadler ran for Mo. After Nomar
grounded to third and Mike Stanley walked, Troy O'Leary (1 for 16
in the series) popped weakly to center.
</P>
<P>
   There was good and bad karma before the game. Folks hanging
around the batting cage were not inspired when Vaughn took his turn
and said to coach Jim Rice, ``Come on, man. It's the last hurrah.''
But things turned for the better when Johnny Pesky and Charlie
Wagner threw out ceremonial first pitches. Pesky has been part of
the Red Sox for more than a half-century but was taken out of
uniform and banished from the clubhouse by the current regime.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek needed only seven pitches to get through the first
inning. The first two Cleveland batters hit fly balls to the
warning track, then Justice grounded to first and Schourek got a
big hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway was deadly quiet in the second when Schourek surrendered
a double and a walk before getting out of the inning with a nifty
strikeout (Richie Sexson, swinging) and a hard ground out by Sandy
Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth were rocking-chair innings for Schourek.
Then he got a lead when Garciaparra homered on the first pitch of
the bottom of the fourth. The 411-foot (over the Sox bullpen) homer
staked Schourek to a 1-0 lead and gave Nomar 11 RBIs in the
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe got the call to warm up in the bullpen when Schourek
walked Sexson and Alomar with one out in the fifth. After Enrique
Wilson flied to right, Schourek worked the count to 3-2 on Kenny
Lofton, then got the dangerous Cleveland leadoff hitter to fly to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Justice doubled with one out in the sixth, and that was it for
Schourek. Lowe came on and got Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome to end
the threat. At that point, three Cleveland baserunners had reached
third but none had scored. Lowe retired five straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had a golden chance to add to the lead in the bottom of
the sixth, but third base coach Wendall Kim inexplicably sent John
Valentin around third on Mike Stanley's single to left. Justice's
throw was on the mark, and Valentin was out by 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On to the seventh. And the eighth. And the ninth. And the
winter.

PATRIOTS HOPE TO AVOID FALL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be Octoberfest. Instead, it was Octobermess.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Patriots went 4-0 in September, but when
October arrived, they turned into pumpkins. A 1-3 month included
losses to Denver, the Jets, and Green Bay, and the Patriots skidded
again in early November, losing to NFC Central teams Minnesota and
Tampa Bay. They hit their low point of the season, at 6-5, with a
27-7 loss to the Buccaneers on a warm Florida day.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened to begin their October skid isn't quite
clear. They had beaten doormat teams to accumulate their undefeated
record, but when the mettle hit, they weren't ready.
</P>
<P>
   As this year's first October game arrives Sunday in the
Superdome _ the site of a pretty lousy Jan. 26 in 1997 when the
Patriots bowed in the Super Bowl _ New England vows to avoid the
dips that marked its 10-6 season a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team has a better idea of what we're trying to do
than the team last year at this time,'' said free safety Willie
Clay. ``We're comfortable in our defense. We know what needs to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some adjustments we needed to make during the bye week
and I think we've done that. I think it's going to be tough to go
into a losing streak. You never know in this game, but I think it
would surprise everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Trounced by the NFC Central last season (1-3), the Patriots must
avoid the same fate against the NFC West this season. They begin
with the 3-0 Saints. The surprising 3-0 Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you looked at the schedule and saw the Saints on it,
you'd think, `Well, here's an easy win,''' said quarterback Drew
Bledsoe. ``But that's not the case anymore. They're a team worthy
of being 3-0. They're playing great and that program is really
turning around.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll's team is certainly doing everything it can to
avoid the fall this time around. Carroll has made certain there
were no New Orleans-type distractions. With a schedule that had
players tied up in meetings until 9:15 p.m. last night, followed by
a 10:15 bed check, it was virtually impossible for any of them to
sneak down to Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have a New Orleans flavor of their own. A few
members of the coaching staff worked for Jim Mora on the Saints'
staff for many years. Tight ends coach Carl Smith (1986-96) was
Mora's offensive coordinator, Steve Sidwell was defensive
coordinator (1986-94), and Steve Walters was receivers coach
(1986-96).
</P>
<P>
   What that means is anyone's guess, but the staff can certainly
help with noise management, which they see as a potential problem
in this game. The Patriots didn't handle the crowd noise very well
in Denver in a 27-21 loss the first week of the season, taking all
three of their second-half timeouts in the third quarter to ruin
their chances of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Since that game, the Patriots have implemented a game plan for
noise. They have practiced amid leaf blowers and worked on their
hand signals to call in plays from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe also will wear a wristband that lists the lengthier
plays. That will help him save time in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll hopes his team can do what it did in an exhibition game
in Mexico City back on Aug. 17. More than 106,000 screaming fans
were rooting for the Dallas Cowboys that day, but the Patriots
quieted the crowd with strong, sustained drives and early points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought what we did in Mexico was great,'' said Carroll.
``We dealt with the noise and we put an end to it. It's all about
dealing with enthusiastic fans by going out and executing our
plays, and the goal is to quiet that crowd as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for X's and O's, Carroll knows that if Saints coach Mike
Ditka had his way, ``He'd start a fistfight at the line of
scrimmage.'' Indeed, it is said that most games are won or lost
precisely at that spot. The Patriots' offensive line has to win the
battle against a very active New Orleans group that has already
sacked the quarterback 12 times. New England will have to open
holes for rookie Robert Edwards, who is still looking for that
first breakthrough game.
</P>
<P>
   Run blocking will be a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've made the kind of progress that would
establish that we are on our way,'' said Carroll. ``I think we are
in the process. I still feel positive that we are going to be
effective with our offense in the long run. At this time, I don't
think we're playing with any dominant side to our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe expects to get blitzed but hopes that his line, as well
as the backs, will be able to pick them up. If the blitzes do come,
you might see a big day from Ben Coates, who may be somewhat alone
in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Patriots will be without end Ferric Collons,
one of their top run stoppers, who has an ankle injury. Chris
Sullivan will start, with relief from second-year man Brandon
Mitchell.

DENVER STADIUM VOTE A GOING CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL head coaches whose jobs are in jeopardy should be trying to
move their voting residence to Colorado in time for the Nov. 3
election. That day, Denver voters will decide whether to pass a
ballot initiative that would extend a sales tax already in effect,
with the money earmarked to finance a new stadium. If it fails,
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan could end up on the open market after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   When Shanahan signed his new contract worth $2.4 million a
season in August, it included an out clause that allows him to
leave if owner Pat Bowlen sells the team. On the surface that might
seem absurd, but word is that Bowlen is considering selling if the
voters reject the stadium proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen would then try to make a bid for the eventual expansion
franchise into Los Angeles, a market that some think could cost its
investors a $1 billion franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's unlikely that the vote will fail and Bowlen will
sell out, if that did occur, you might well find more than the
usual suspects among the unemployed head coaches because of a
headlong rush to land Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   With both Shanahan and Green Bay's Mike Holmgren on the market,
how long would Seattle owner Paul Allen, for instance, stick with
Dennis Erickson if his club slides backward again?
</P>
<P>
   How long would Baltimore, Buffalo, Washington, Philadelphia,
Arizona, Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, and even Tennessee stick
with their present coaches if they thought could land a marquee
coach like Holmgren or Shanahan?
</P>
<P>
   How long? Not long.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a owners meeting scheduled for Oct. 27 in
Kansas City to discuss preliminary requirements for the next
expansion franchise, and pitches will be made from representatives
of Houston and several from Los Angeles, nothing will be done.
Among the presenters will be former Hollywood mogul  &UR; Michael
Ovitz &LR; . Ovitz has added  &UR; Shaquille O'Neal  &LR; and  &UR; Jerry West  &LR; to his
group trying to build a new stadium in Carson, Calif. The so-called
Hacienda would be a stadium and mall project designed to lure a
team back to the second-biggest TV market in the country. Problem
is, Ovitz has one of several competing proposals in LA, including
one to refurbish the Coliseum, and none have either public money or
political support behind them. In contrast, Houston businessman
 &UR; Robert McNair  &LR; already has a stadium plan and public funding
approved to raise $300 million-$400 million to build both a
football stadium and an arena for the Houston Rockets.  &UR; Leigh
Steinberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been asked to be a consultant by every LA
group but Ovitz's, is thus convinced that Southern California is
not yet ready to compete. ``We are so far away from being
effectively able to compete for a franchise,'' Steinberg said.
``We're not ready as a region. We have no political figure behind
any plan. Not the governor or the mayor or the head of the Board of
Supervisors. In every successful situation like this, there has
always been a political center of support. No one has that in LA.
As long as  &UR; Mark Ridley Thomas  &LR; and the Coliseum remain alive as a
prospect, all other plans are out of it because no politician wants
to fight the inner city.'' ... Despite the denials of Eagles owner
 &UR; Jeff Lurie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; don't be surprised if  &UR; Don Shula  &LR; surfaces as the
Philadelphia coach next season if  &UR; Ray Rhodes  &LR; can't get things
back on track. One well-placed NFL source said he had spoken
several times with Shula recently and ``he really wants to get back
in football. Don't ask me why but he does, and Lurie is the kind of
guy who would love to have a Hall of Fame coach to hang around
with.'' ... At one point during last Sunday's game with the Colts,
New Orleans's 270-pound defensive end  &UR; Joe Johnson  &LR; found himself
called upon to cover running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk  &LR; as the Saints
launched a zone blitz at  &UR; Peyton Manning &LR; . Manning picked it up and
got the ball to Faulk for a 78-yard touchdown. Johnson was
unaffected. ``I had him,'' Johnson said when he came to the
sidelines. ``I had him! He was just faster than I was.'' ...  &UR; Brett
Favre  &LR; is more than the most valuable player of the NFL. He's the
most valuable player of the NFL Quarterback Club. Favre accounted
for 21.2 percent of all 1997 merchandise sales from the Club, which
handles merchandising for the bulk of the league's marquee players.
Believe it or not, Dallas running back  &UR; Emmitt Smith  &LR; was second to
Favre, with 12.9 percent of the sales ... Despite the Vikings'
explosive offense, which is second only to Denver in scoring with
129 points, Minnesota wide receiver  &UR; Cris Carter  &LR; expects the
Packers to play the three-wide-receiver sets man-to-man the
majority of the time Monday night. ``They like the challenge of the
man-to-man matchup,'' Carter said. ``They play very physical and
they have a lot of confidence in their man-to-man.'' Asked about
the emergence of rookie  &UR; Randy Moss &LR; , Carter said, ``I think he is
the most natural receiver I've ever seen without any work, at the
early stages of his career. You have to realize he's only 21 and I
don't believe he's been involved with a very sophisticated passing
attack. But he's very, very natural as far as his movements to the
ball, his route running. He's a tremendous athlete, not just
jumping for the ball but unbelievably fluid going to the ball, very
comfortable in a crowd and very, very tough. He has unbelievable
drive inside of him to be a good player.'' Carter has taken the
once-troubled rookie under his wing since Moss was drafted with the
21st pick in the first round, far below where he had been rated.
Carter started his career with similar problems and can relate to
some of what Moss is facing. ``I came out of a situation that was
very similar to Randy and I know how people judged me and I didn't
want to do that to him,'' Carter said. ``I gave him the benefit of
the doubt. The one thing Randy understands is I tell him, `If you
can't tell me the truth, I'd rather you not tell me anything.'
That's the basis of our relationship. So there are certain things I
don't talk to him about. I don't force myself on him, especially as
far as social issues are concerned. I'm not his chaperone. He has
to realize that his past is not a myth. It's not something the
media has created. It's something he brought on himself. He
realizes that. All he can control is what's going on today and what
is going to happen in the future. If he wants people to stop asking
about the past, then he needs to continue to make good decisions on
a daily basis.'' ... The Colts signed  &UR; Ironhead Heyward  &LR; to a
one-year, $850,000 contract _ a long way from the four-year, $4.5
million deal with St. Louis that was terminated when he was
released Sept. 2 after refusing to report to camp at a weight coach
 &UR; Dick Vermeil  &LR; felt was reasonable. Heyward was over 300 pounds in
the Rams' mini-camp but was down to 262 last week in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Vermeil, he cut nearly 40 minutes from his daily
practice schedule at the insistence of his players, but there was
never a threatened mutiny, as reported in some corners. St. Louis
is now practicing two hours a day instead of nearly three ...
Here's Moss's assessment of the Chicago Bears, who once were his
favorite team: ``I favor the '85 Bears. They were my favorite team.
There was a lot of excitement. The '98 Bears, I'm not as excited
about them.'' ... The 0-4 Bears are believed to be the first NFL
team in history to lead at halftime in four straight games and win
none of them. ``Other teams are looking at us and saying, `Hey,
they can't play in the second half,''' said defensive end  &UR; Mark
Thomas &LR; . ``I think we should just stay out (on the field) at the
half.'' It couldn't hurt. The Bears have been outscored, 44-0, in
the third quarter ... Saints coach  &UR; Mike Ditka  &LR; says he has stuck
to his promise not to return to his profane former self, and that
applies even on the golf course. ``I went through a whole summer of
it and did real well,'' Ditka said. ``For the first time in my
life. It's just not that important. I did it for years and I'm
saying to myself, `You sound stupid.' Not only that, I think you
offend people around you. I'm going to give that up for good.'' The
way he's done that on the sidelines, he says, is simply to
recognize that every blown play is not his players' fault. ``I
think I'm starting to understand there are good players on both
teams,'' he said. ``We can't make good plays every play. They can't
make good plays every play. It's got to be a little give and
take.''

TWO REFS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ruins captain Ray Bourque regards the National Hockey League's
new rules as a mixed bag. Bourque, who enters his 20th season, has
seen changes over the years. Of the newest edicts, he likes the
smaller crease very much, thinks the jury is still out on the extra
2 feet behind the net, and believes the two-referee system is
flat-out awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, not at all,'' said Bourque. ``I think the one
ref calls a great game. If they keep calling things through the
whole three periods, I think they do a fine job. Even if it's one
or two refs, I don't know if they'll ref any different once it
comes to crunch time. That you won't see in exhibition or even
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two refs, it seems like there's too much called. You've
got to be able to do some stuff out there and, not really get away
with it, but there has to be some kind of contact at times where
with some refs, everything is called. I think there are enough
special teams. If you start playing the whole period shorthanded or
on the power play, it's too specialized. The majority of the refs,
they call a pretty good game and it's such a tough job. With two
refs, it's an extra guy out there, an extra body.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers agree with Bourque. Despite beating up on Montreal,
7-1, in a game that included 50 minutes in power plays for the
Flyers and a total of 88 minutes in penalties, coach Roger Neilson
was furious with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stinking referees want to see who can make the most
calls,'' he said. ``No, I don't like this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Flyers GM Bob Clarke agreed: ``It's horrible, just horrible. Two
refs isn't going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flames GM Al Coates thinks the system just needs time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our players adjust to changes, whether it's the goal
crease or a crackdown on obstruction. We just have to be patient
with it,'' said Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Lewis, the league's director of officiating, said the
two-referee system can actually speed up games. The average length
of games with one referee, according to Lewis, has been 2 hours and
44 minutes while the average length with two refs has been 2:36.
</P>
<P>
   As for the experiment of taking out the red line, which was done
when Boston faced Montreal in Providence, Bourque made a face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a joke,'' said Bourque. ``Leave it alone, leave the
game alone; it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The league continues to look for ways to increase scoring, which
was down last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are paying attention to defense,'' said Bourque.
``They're taking care of things when they don't have the puck.
That's the way you should play. That's the way coaches should
coach. When you don't have the puck you've got to defend, when you
do have the puck you try to create but then you're playing against
a team that defends well, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want goals, but we'll have to make dramatic changes if
they want more goals or stuff like that and I don't think it will
be good for the game. It would be fine for a while, then they'd get
sick of that, then it will be, `We have to tighten up the game.'''

   There is a roster freeze until Monday morning's waiver draft.
When that deadline passes, watch what happens with Vancouver. Word
is that the Islanders will send unsigned veteran forward  &UR; Trevor
Linden  &LR; to the Maple Leafs for goaltender  &UR; Felix Potvin &LR; . The Isles
are then expected to package Potvin and defenseman  &UR; Bryan Berard
 &LR; to the Canucks for disgruntled forward  &UR; Pavel Bure &LR; . The Canucks
are desperate for a No. 1 goalie, Bure has demanded a trade, and
Berard would shore up the Vancouver blue line ... So far, Canucks
coach  &UR; Mike Keenan  &LR; has been less than thrilled with the progress
of talented forward  &UR; Markus Naslund &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was taken No. 16 overall
by Pittsburgh in the 1991 draft. ``He's in a position where he can
either lose a job to the youngsters or he can take a job,'' said
Keenan. ``He has to put some points on the board.'' Naslund, who
played in just two of the Canucks' first six exhibition games, had
no points and four shots. He isn't overjoyed with the situation,
either. ``I want to play, it's no fun sitting around,'' said
Naslund. ``If they're not going to play me here, I'd like to go
somewhere else. I'll wait a bit and see what's going on. I'm only
25. I'm not even close to being the player I want to be. Obviously,
Mike is unhappy with the way I've been performing. I've not felt
good, either, but it's preseason. I'll get going.'' ... Former
Bruins goalie  &UR; Andy Moog &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who retired after playing last season
with the Canadiens, is enjoying his new role as part-owner of the
Fort Worth Brahmas of the Western Professional Hockey League. ``Am
I starting to miss it now that the guys are two weeks into training
camp?'' said Moog. ``Can't say that I do. I don't have a problem
with it. But when the games come, I think there'll be a change, at
least for a little while. When the season starts, I'll probably be
saying, `I should have played, I should have played.' But I think
you can appreciate my position.'' Moog turned down a little less
than $2 million from the Habs to stay on another year. The Canucks
also were interested in his services. New GM  &UR; Brian Burke  &LR; and aide
 &UR; Steve Tambellini  &LR; tried to talk Moog into extending his career.
``I had a long discussion with Brian and an even longer one with
Steve,'' said Moog. ``But what I told them was, `You have a coach
(Keenan) who really falls in love with one goalie. If I was the
guy, I probably would have played 40 out of the first 50 games, and
then where would I have been?'' ... These are hard times for New
Jersey defenseman  &UR; Lyle Odelein &LR; . His 5-month-old daughter,
 &UR; Paulina &LR; , is scheduled to have her fourth and fifth operations
this month to correct a problem that affects her breathing and
ability to take nourishment. The problem is extra cartilage in her
epiglottis. ``It's been tough on us,'' Odelein said. ``My wife gets
two hours sleep a night, getting up to take care of her when her
breathing gets particularly bad. I'm up a couple of times every
night, too, but it's much rougher on Paulina.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If you thought the  &UR; Jason Allison  &LR; saga was long, take a peek at
what is happening in New Jersey with defenseman  &UR; Scott
Niedermayer &LR; . Reports are that Niedermayer has offers on the table
for $9.75 million over three years or $6 million for two.
Niedermayer has said he would take less than the $4.15 million
 &UR; Scott Stevens  &LR; makes and the $3.665 million  &UR; Martin Brodeur
 &LR; makes. It's possible that his next move will be to ask for a
trade. ``Scotty will move on in life,'' said Niedermayer's agent,
 &UR; Don Meehan &LR; . ``He is more brave and independent than I am. He
won't stay in New Jersey for what is being submitted to us now.
Last week, Scott made a bold and progressive move by making a
proposal that would have paid him less than both Scott Stevens and
Martin Brodeur. I'm sure (GM  &UR; Lou Lamoriello &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; felt it was
important that Scott be paid less than both those players. I
thought Lou would accept the proposal by that afternoon but he
didn't and we've withdrawn it. We've now moved to a point where we
have to determine what our options are.'' Those options are: sign
an offer sheet with another club, ask for a trade (which Lamoriello
said he wouldn't do), or play in another league ... Sharks right
wing  &UR; Brantt Myhres &LR; , &UR;  &LR; signed as a free agent, will be out of
hockey indefinitely after entering the league-sponsored program for
substance abuse. ``He needs support and we're here to give it to
him,'' said  &UR; Doug Wilson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Sharks' director of pro
development. ``Our main concern is his well being. Myhres, who has
taken part in the program since the beginning of last season, had
169 penalty minutes in 23 games for the Flyers. After being sent to
the minors March 5, the club sent him home because of his alcohol
dependency. ``We had full knowledge of that before him coming
here,'' said Wilson ... Center  &UR; Doug Gilmour  &LR; said he's looking
forward to playing on the same team as pesky defenseman  &UR; Chris
Chelios &LR; . ``It's going to be good to be on his side,'' said
Gilmour, who signed with the Blackhawks as a free agent in the
offseason. ``I'll save a lot of energy. I don't have to concentrate
on whacking him. I'm pretty excited about that.'' ... Senators star
 &UR; Alexei Yashin  &LR; has donated $1 million to the National Arts Centre
in Ottawa, a gift that will be paid out over five years. Yashin,
who learned to love the arts in his native Russia, said his
decision has been met with differing reactions, particularly in his
home country. ``They say, `He makes so much money, he doesn't know
what to do with it. He throws the money around,''' said Yashin.
``This hurt. Those who were negative don't know about my life in
Canada. They just see it from where they are. They don't really
understand why it was done, and what kind of connection I have with
the Canadian people and expecially with the people in Ottawa.''
Yashin is hoping some of his donation will be used to bring Russian
artists over to perform in Canada ... Hope  &UR; Eric Fichaud  &LR; has
invested in a good suitcase. The 22-year-old goalie, who was taken
No. 16 overall by Toronto in the 1994 draft, has changed teams
again. His rights were dealt from the Leafs to the Islanders on
April 6, 1995. After some called him the goalie of the future in
New York, the Oilers picked up Fichaud via trade in the offseason
and last week sent him to the Nashville Predators.
</P>

   It will be interesting to see how the addition of strong
personality  &UR; Brett Hull  &LR; works in Dallas. The captain,  &UR; Derian
Hatcher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is no shrinking violet. ``He can be outspoken as long as
he plays our game,'' said Hatcher, when asked about Hull's
loquacious nature. ``I don't care what he says to the media. It's
what he does on the ice. If he's not buying into our system, then
yeah, there's going to be some problems, but he knows that.'' ...
It appears that reports of  &UR; Darius Kasparaitis's  &LR; season being over
are premature. The feisty Penguins defenseman, who tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, was expected to miss
up to six months, but he could be back as early as a month after
deciding against surgery. ``I felt pretty strong about it,'' said
Kasparaitis. ``I knew what surgery would mean to me. I figure I
should try to play that way. Nobody knows if it's torn or if it's
not. If something happens, it happens.'' He is in the midst of
aggressive rehabilitation, and if all goes well, he will receive
clearance to skate ... Phoenix captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk &LR; , who
secured &UR;  &LR; an $11 million bump in his contract, notched a 138-yard
hole-in-one at the Ridge Club. His playing partner was none other
than  &UR; Bobby Orr &LR; , &UR;  &LR; which most people would consider better than a
hole-in-one. ``I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever get one,''
said Tkachuk, a 5-handicapper. ``I mean, I played every day this
summer. It was bound to happen someday.'' ... Looks like Devils
forward  &UR; Jason Arnott &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who suffered a finger injury during a
fishing accident over the summer, will miss at least the first two
games of the regular season. He has been cleared to practice and is
due to be reevaluated Oct. 14. ``I can't really take a slapshot
yet,'' said Arnott. ``When you're out there, you really want to
shoot it but the pain lets you know.'' ... Former Boston University
defenseman  &UR; Tom Poti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now with the Oilers, has impressed coach
 &UR; Ron Low &LR; . ``Tom Poti's had a tremendous training camp,'' said Low.
``We've heard all about his offensive attributes and we've seen
them all, but what I liked about him is the way he played in his
own end of the rink. I don't think there's much doubt that Tom Poti
is going to make our hockey club. He certainly stepped up and did a
job that makes you think that he can play here right now.'' So far,
he's been teamed with  &UR; Roman Hamrlik &LR; . ``He's very talented, lots
of skill,'' said Hamrlik. ``I like playing with him. He's a smart
guy, kind of European style. He likes to pass the puck, likes to
rush, lots of talent.'' ... The Bruins will hold their annual open
practice for season ticket-holders and Corner Club members Thursday
at the FleetCenter from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. The doors open at 10:30
a.m., and invitations must be presented to gain admission ... Six
days to opening night.

YOUNG QUARTERBACKS CAN SNAP

<P>
   Danny Wuerffel understands well the essence of the problem that
led Ryan Leaf to lose his mind a week ago and Peyton Manning's
father, Archie, to concede recently that even he was unprepared for
the amount of obsession surrounding his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to expect coming in that you'll do well because
you did well in college,'' said Wuerffel, the New Orleans Saints'
starting quarterback and former Heisman Trophy winner. ``But you
don't have a concept of what it takes to do well in this league. As
far as the pass rush and the competition, it's like playing
Florida-Florida State every weekend. The rush is just phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but for Manning and Leaf, who will oppose each
other for real Sunday for the first time, it has been more like
Florida-Framingham State.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has yet to find a way to lead the Colts to a victory, in
large measure because he has thrown 11 interceptions and only three
touchdown passes, while Leaf's Chargers are 2-2 but know they have
been fortunate in their victories because their young quarterback
has eight interceptions, a turnover-to-touchdown ratio of 11-1, and
enters Sunday's game at the Hoosier Dome with a quarterback rating
of 32.1. That number is so stunningly low as to give meaning to an
otherwise meaningless statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their similar travails, something separates the No.
1-drafted Manning from the No. 2-selected Leaf: their public
reaction to adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has remained unfailingly polite and outwardly unbowed.
Leaf, on the other hand, had a videotaped meltdown the day after a
horrendous 1-for-15 performance against Kansas City. And after a
petulant three days acting like a spoiled 8-year-old, Leaf played
so badly against the Giants last Sunday that he (a) was benched and
(b) had his public service announcement for the Make-A-Wish
Foundation booed when it was shown on the scoreboard screen at San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   That both quarterbacks have struggled was predictable. But
nobody is prepared for the kind of failure that can befall a rookie
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize the gulf that exists between college
football and the NFL,'' said Colts president Bill Polian. ``It's
the Pacific Ocean. It's as different as night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average fan's perception is the game is similar to the
best college football, but the worst NFL team would beat the
college champion by five touchdowns. These kids who played
quarterback, even in the best programs, faced maybe three or four
guys on defense who will play in the NFL. Now everyone they face is
good enough to play in the NFL. It causes them a lot of problems
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as predictable as the interceptions and the confusion were
the reactions of Manning and Leaf. Manning has suffered in silence;
Leaf erupted with the kind of emotional display that can come back
to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me Peyton was involved in something like that, I
would have been flabbergasted,'' said Manning's agent, former
Boston College and NFL lineman Tom Condon. ``I knew this would be
difficult for him on the field and he's not happy about it, but if
there was ever a more unflappable guy, I haven't met him. He and
Ryan are very different in makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton has such a strong belief in his abilities that he looks
at adversity and doesn't get mad at it. He looks to overcome it. He
has an absolute confidence things will get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father told me when he signed with me that Peyton wouldn't
take much babysitting, and he hasn't. He's struggled, but he knows
it does no good to get mad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has always been a more emotional person. In good times that
makes him appealing. But when those emotions turn red hot during
turbulent days, eruptions like the ones that have occurred lead his
own fans to boo him.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout and the added pressure that can create for an
already struggling young quarterback is a concern to Chargers
general manager Bobby Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with him on a couple of occasions the last two weeks,
not in a stern way but to let him know we were still in his
corner,'' Beathard said. ``This was a tough situation he brought on
himself, but I tried to assure him we were not coming out against
him, to get it off his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He denied that it bothered him. I told him, `If it didn't
distract you, you wouldn't be doing these things.' He's not used to
having games like that. You try to prepare them for how difficult
it's going to be, but in the back of their minds they believe
they're not going to have as tough a time as they end up having and
they're embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both us and the Colts expected there would be problems
on the field and, frankly, I'd agree with Tom that it was more
likely an incident like this would happen with Ryan than Peyton
because Peyton's environment was one where he was more prepared for
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people of San Diego love Ryan. They didn't boo him.
They booed his actions, and he's responsible for them. He
understands that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The action on the field can cause some young players to act up
off the field, and it can cause others to sink into themselves.
When Leaf publicly questioned his own fitness to play after being
benched last weekend, some saw that as a sign that the pressures
had gotten to him.
</P>
<P>
   But Leigh Steinberg, Leaf's agent, has been through this process
with a number of NFL quarterbacks _ Drew Bledsoe, Warren Moon, Troy
Aikman, Tony Eason, Steve Bartkowski, Kordell Stewart _ so none of
this surprised him. What it has done, he hopes, is teach his client
a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan sort of set himself up for a fall by playing better than
any rookie quarterback has a right to,'' Steinberg said. ``Then he
had about as bad a game as you can have and he followed it with a
bad week, but this is a long voyage and the boat has just left the
dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rookie year for a quarterback tends to be a rugged
experience. It's not always pretty to watch. They'll do things that
make you wonder how they ever got drafted in the first place. You
have to keep that in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan is going through something that is not an elegant part of
the process, but it's the only way to get better. The fact is, 20
or 30 years ago these guys wouldn't even be playing. They'd be
sitting behind some veteran, which until the recent addition of the
salary cap was considered the best way to develop a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's done differently, and Ryan has to learn from it.
There were some lessons I thought he already understood, but he
just snapped. He suffered a self-inflicted wound because he'd
played badly for the first time and felt as if the world was
against him. He felt cornered as the week went on and he didn't
react well, but he's apologized for it and learned from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget these are young kids. It's pretty dramatic to be
booed on the first play of a game. I think some of the comparisons
with Peyton have been overblown, but there's no question Ryan is a
more emotional, opinionated, and instinctive person. He'll never be
a button-downed quarterback. He's not going to fit into a Steve
Young or Warren Moon mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one in football doubts he'll be successful. He has
tremendous self-confidence and ability. We all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Polian, Manning is just as confident in his quiet
way, and it is beginning to show. Although his team has yet to win
and he has yet to have a day free of interceptions, Manning is
showing Polian the things he once saw in a young Jim Kelly and a
young Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton has a historical perspective on what's happening to him
this season,'' Polian said. ``He got that from his dad and his own
study. He understands his problems are par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unless you've seen him every week you can't see the
tremendous strides he's made. He's come miles from that first game
with Miami. His decision-making has been magnificent. Last week he
had three interceptions but two were tipped and the third was a
timing route where the receiver slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played much better and he feels that himself. He's
awfully upset that we can't win but he understands he's getting
better. This is the third time I've gone through this with a young
quarterback and I know he'll succeed big in the long run. There's
not a person in this organization that doesn't believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Ryan are very different, but without question they'll
both be great quarterbacks. When they play together this time it
won't mean much. But one day they'll play against each other for
the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they do, there is much growing _ and some grimacing _ to
go through. They will suffer loudly or quietly, but suffer they
will.
</P>
<P>
   And suffering right along with them will be Tom Condon, Leigh
Steinberg, Bill Polian, and Bobby Beathard, four guys trying to
keep two young quarterbacks afloat until they learn how to swim
with the NFL sharks.

BIRD REPLAYS TAKE ON LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Bird wants us to close the book on his storied playing
career, but he's the only one who figures to do that. Unless his
image becomes something monumentally different _ and three years of
coaching may not be enough _ he's going to be remembered for what
he did in those short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's legacy, of course, is planted in Boston, with many, many
branches in many, many buildings throughout the NBA. He mentions
that his favorite game was Game 3 of the 1985 Cleveland series, but
there is no team he tortured more than the poor Atlanta Hawks and
there is no team he enjoyed playing against more than the 76ers
when there actually was a real Boston-Philadelphia rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of Bird stories still in circulation in every
NBA venue. He liked to play in the HemisFair in San Antonio because
of all the servicemen in the balcony. For some reason, he enjoyed
the old Memorial Coliseum in Portland. He hated the Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
   We asked four veteran NBA executives to recall their favorite
Bird story or anecdote. The only qualifier was that they had to
have witnessed Bird at his best. As you might expect, they didn't
have to think very long.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Kasten, Atlanta Hawks: ``I have many, many great Bird
stories, and I hate all of them. I don't know if there is any team,
anywhere, that he killed more thoroughly or consistently as ours.
He had his career point game against us (60 in New Orleans). In
what has to be the greatest game in our franchise history (Game 7,
1988 Eastern Conference semifinals, a k a The Shootout), we not
only didn't win the game, he beat us. I have no favorite story.
They're all bad. It was just extraordinary the way he played
against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought, is he the greatest passer? Probably not. Is
he the greatest rebounder? Maybe not. Is he the greatest shooter?
Probably not. But he was the greatest package of all those skills.
I'd love to be able to say kind things about him, since we still
have to compete against him. But the pain endures. And now he's
beating us as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   (Kasten also is the man who said, ``I rushed out and bought
Newsweek'' when told that Bird was on the cover of Time in 1985.)
</P>
<P>
   Pat Williams, former Philadelphia and Orlando GM: ``I have three
Bird stories that I will always remember. The first was when he was
still in college and his team was playing Rutgers in the (1978) NIT
in Piscataway, N.J. (a 57-56 Rutgers victory). I drove down with
the late Jack McMahon (talent scout/assistant coach) and we saw him
and we didn't think too much of him. We left the game, and on the
way back we were debating: Is he a Steve Mix kind of player? Or a
Steve Kuberski? I hope those scouting reports are either locked up
or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second is Game 7 of the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals. I
spent most of the game in a broom closet; I couldn't bear to watch.
I peek out every now and then and I see him make the winning shot.
He comes down the floor and drills it. That's his whole career. No
one else in the building can swallow or breathe, and he drills it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My final one is when the Celtics made their first visit to
Orlando. I had this radio show at a restaurant and I asked the
Celtics if Larry might want to come on. The next thing I see, he's
coming into the place and he sat down and did an hour, live. Then I
go to the arena and he's shooting before the game and my son is his
ballboy. Then Larry challenged him to a game of HORSE and a
photographer got a picture, which was on the front page the next
day. My son is now a junior in college and it's still the highlight
of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, former Utah Jazz president: ``There was one
night when we were playing the Celtics in the Salt Palace and, of
course, Larry was out there shooting before the game. All of a
sudden, about an hour before the game, in walks the Chief (Robert
Parish). He's walking the way he always walks with that stride, and
he's wearing a topcoat. Bird sees him and says something, but
Parish ignores him. Then when Parish gets under the basket, Bird
stops and goes over to him and lets him have it. He grabs him by
the coat and says, ``Do you know what time it is? We got a game in
an hour. Go get dressed.'' (Checketts did say Bird may have used
some adjectives and nouns not fit for a family publication.) So
after the game, I told this story to Frank Layden. And then I said,
`And we depend on Adrian Dantley for this?' He was something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry St. Jean, former assistant coach, Milwaukee Bucks: ``The
thing I will always remember is his banter during the game, which
most people weren't privileged to hear. There was a game in the old
Mecca where he was hitting everything and he'd go by our bench and
say, `Anyone there who can guard me?' But the one feeling that
always came over me every time we came into the Garden was hearing
that ball banging on the floor two hours before the game and
knowing it was him out there shooting. It was a lock.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bird was toasted, honored and praised all over Springfield
Friday and even got  &UR; Wilt Chamberlain's  &LR; vote for his first forward
on his dream team. ``He is the consummate pro,'' Chamberlain said.
``He learned his basketball the proper way. Now, not to slight
someone, but you take a guy like  &UR; Dominique Wilkins &LR; . He has the
great physical attributes that you don't see in Larry Bird, but
Larry Bird does everything better. The brain, when it is used in
the right way, is also a talent.'' ... And then there is  &UR; Bill
Walton's  &LR; take on Bird's mind: ``He coached every game he played
in. Sometimes the coaches agreed with him. And sometimes the
coaches were a couple days late.'' As for Bird as coach, Walton
said, ``Look at all the coaches who are in the Hall of Fame:  &UR; Lenny
Wilkens &LR; , &UR; Red Holzman &LR; , &UR; Jack Ramsay &LR; , &UR; Chuck Daly &LR; . With these guys,
it's not about hype. Or self-promotion. It's not about fancy
clothes. Larry is like that, and so is  &UR; Phil Jackson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who will be
in the Hall of Fame someday as a coach. Larry infuses light, hope,
exuberance, and spirit, and the Indiana Pacers were broken in
spirit before he got there.'' ...  &UR; Alex Hannum &LR; , &UR;  &LR; former
Philadelphia and St. Louis coach, had the privilege of coaching
both  &UR; Larry Brown  &LR; and  &UR; Doug Moe  &LR; in the ABA. He said he always
thought Brown would be a coach someday. ``He really knew the
game,'' Hannum said. And Moe? ``I would never have guessed that he
would become a coach. He was in another world half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said one of the regrets from his NBA playing career is
that he didn't get to play for  &UR; Red Auerbach &LR; . But he said he came
close. ``When the Hawks moved to Atlanta, I thought I had a chance
of getting traded to Boston,'' he said. ``I was salivating just
thinking about the possibilities.'' However, by that time, Auerbach
had given up the coaching duties to  &UR; Bill Russell  &LR; ... Speaking of
Russell, while he was winning a gold medal in Melbourne in 1956,
the Celtics, who had drafted him, were 16-8 with  &UR; Arnie Risen
 &LR; manning the middle. Risen said the credit he gets for tutoring
Russell during the 1956-57 season is overstated. ``It has been
exaggerated,'' he said. ``The whole thing back then was that we
were a team and everyone helped everyone out. I know Bill has said
that I helped him a lot and I'm grateful for that.'' Risen was one
of Auerbach's first late-career guys who were brought in to help
win a title. He had wanted to retire and go into the construction
business, but Auerbach talked him into coming to Boston, where
Risen helped the Celtics win their first title. Auerbach always
liked to bring in a so-called ``over-the-hill'' guy to help win a
title, be it Risen,  &UR; Bailey Howell &LR; , &UR; Don Nelson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; or Walton ...
Hannum on his call to Chamberlain to present him for his
enshrinement: ``Wilt never answers the phone and he likes the night
life. So you can't call him in the morning. I called about 9 and he
actually picked up the phone and said he'd do it. I thought that
was the end of it. Then, three hours later, Wilt calls back. `What
did I say to you, anyway?''' he said.

ECONOMIC LEADERS DIFFER IN STRATEGY ON CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; first three grafs are new, refinements
throughout.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finance ministers of the world's largest industrial
nations agreed Saturday night to explore President Clinton's
proposal on Friday to change the strategy of the International
Monetary Fund and allow it to intervene earlier in propping up
economies that are at risk of being swept into the global financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came in a vaguely worded communique issued
after an all-day meeting here as financial leaders from the major
economies, as well as from many of the most shell-shocked, gathered
for several days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated earlier in the day that Clinton's
proposal had already been agreed to by Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France, but diplomats said
there were still reservations from Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is facing unusual challenges from Europe,
Japan and emerging-market nations, each of which is arriving with
different and even contradictory strategies for stabilizing the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of approaches, which began to play out as Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin sat down Saturday morning with Japan's
Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, reflects the extraordinary
tension and the behind-the-scenes power struggles under way as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank open their annual
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bank
failures and bankruptcies across the globe, governments are
searching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach that
can halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be easy, officials concede. As the meetings
opened, Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aid
stricken countries throughout Asia. The program includes government
loans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian countries and
guarantees that private bank loans will be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   While Southeast Asian countries immediately hailed the move, the
administration's response was lukewarm. Rubin had said on Friday,
even before the announcement, that Japan's action was
``constructive,'' but that getting its own banks in order and its
huge economy restarted was ``by vast multiples more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, a former prime minister who has 40 years of experience
dealing with the United States, shot back Saturday that Clinton's
proposals for new strategies for how the IMF could choke off crises
before they start ``would not be very convincing unless the United
States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to.'' He was referring
to the refusal by Congress so far to approve $18 billion in new
money for the fund, an issue that Senate and House conferees will
debate as the meetings go on here next week.

LEWIS-HOLYFIELD? AFRAID NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ Sometimes braggarts don't know just how
right they can be.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before Lennox Lewis was to defend his portion of
the heavyweight title against No. 1 contender Zeljko Mavrovic, the
brash World Boxing Council champion predicted what the fallout
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will actually say, `Why are you ducking Lennox
Lewis?''' the multi-passported, English-Jamaican-Canadian boxer
hooted in the general direction of his American alter ego, World
Boxing Association-International Boxing Federation champion Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Lewis huff and puff his way through 12 desultory
and disappointing rounds with the unknown Mavrovic, Holyfield is
probably asking himself the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it wouldn't be out of fear Lewis struck into him after
going the distance with a man who never once fought a rated
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it wouldn't be out of fear Lewis struck into him in
his previous outing, either. That night, Shannon Briggs nearly
knocked Lewis senseless in the first round of a fight the champion
eventually won after Briggs nearly passed out on his own, falling
in exhaustion without being hit after missing with a wild left hand
in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, has Holyfield not agreed to accept $25 million to
fight Lewis and unify the heavyweight title for the first time
since Riddick Bowe won it from Holyfield six years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he knows he doesn't need Lewis to cement his
place in history and he's grown weary of hearing a guy who has
managed to avoid every big name of his era talk as if every
heavyweight since Jack Johnson has lived in fear of having to face
him.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it's simply that he knows Lewis isn't worth
the $10 million he wants for the chance to hit Holyfield and the
lottery on the same night. If you care to dispute this latter fact,
consider this. Holyfield fought the nondescript Vaughn Bean two
weeks ago and drew 41,357 to the Georgia Dome (which, admittedly,
is in Holyfield's hometown of Atlanta). Lewis fought the equally
nondescript Mavrovic in the first heavyweight title fight in New
England in 33 years and barely drew 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's performance led Showtime's Jay Larkin to comment, ``In
every big fight he's had by his standards, he hasn't delivered.
Holyfield has been just the opposite. If Lewis was half as
successful in the ring as his lawyers have been in court, he'd be
an all-time great.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest names on Lennox Lewis's record are Ray Mercer, who
I thought he lost to, and a washed-up Razor Ruddock. Evander has
fought Mike Tyson twice, Riddick Bowe three times, Michael Moorer
twice, George Foreman, Larry Holmes. How do you compare the two if
you have half a brain?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's that big an event any more. My only
interest in it is it's something Evander wants to do, but I don't
think it will be made too soon now.''
</P>
<P>
   As even Lewis's trainer, Emanuel Steward, conceded before the
Mavrovic debacle, ``I think most of the public views Evander as the
champion. He's been a household name since the 1984 Olympics. He's
been involved in highly visible fights. After doing what he did to
the monster (Tyson) _ destroying him _ the public has accepted him
as the champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox needs to be a totally dominant factor to make the
fight. Then the public might acknowledge him and pressure
Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that a groundswell for Holyfield to fight
Lewis resulted from the performance against Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Steward both talked endlessly of the need for Lewis to
destroy Mavrovic and anyone else he had to face thereafter to force
Holyfield's hand because they believe Holyfield's promoter, Don
King, wants no part of a unification fight _ because if Holyfield
loses, King loses control of the most valuable championship in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   It is their opinion that King fears what Lewis might do to
Holyfield, whom he would outweigh by at least 25 pounds. It is
their opinion that because Lewis is 34-1 with 27 knockouts and
stands 6 feet 5 inches and 243 pounds, there is ample reason for
small heavyweights such as the 217-pound Holyfield to cower at the
sight of him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is, until the fighting starts. Once that happened
last weekend, no one passed the knowledge of such fears along to
the 214-pound Mavrovic. He stood up to the best Lewis could throw
without buckling or backing down. Mavrovic ended up with a
five-stitch cut on his chin and some scrapes and bruises on his
face, but his eyes were open at the end and his mind was clear
despite being hit by 219 of Lewis's power punches, including a
half-dozen right uppercuts that landed flush and did little damage.
</P>
<P>
   That Lewis is a physical specimen worthy of the NFL is obvious.
Unfortunately for him, he doesn't move as well as most people his
size in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   His large feet often trip over themselves when forced to pursue
or retreat.
</P>
<P>
   After a few rounds, his jab often goes unused, out of laziness
or general apathy, in favor of a clubbing right hand that gives him
all the grace of a man swinging a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   His chest, though chiseled, tends to heave after a half-dozen
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Lewis is a fearsome heavyweight who keeps
insisting that Holyfield is afraid of him, a claim that even
Lewis's promoter had a hard time making after the Mavrovic fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Evander was watching the fight tonight and saw
weaknesses in Lennox,'' said Dino Duva, who once promoted
Holyfield. ``Whatever it takes to get Evander to push King to make
the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   What is feared most by Lewis, Holyfield, and officials at both
HBO (which pays Lewis) and Showtime (which pays Holyfield) is that
each champion was so underwhelming in his most recent outing that
the public may have already lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   An angry HBO Sports senior vice president Lou DiBella said,
``It's obvious these guys can't get up for these kind of fights.
It's time to make Holyfield-Lewis before one of these guys loses a
fight they shouldn't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   As DiBella mumbled, Lewis sat with a bemused look on his face at
a postfight press grilling when he was asked what happened to his
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really make a statement tonight,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis may have been wrong there, too.

   Tyson's planned relicensing hearing was set back again last week
and a court fight appears to be brewing as early as Monday over the
battery of psychological tests he was given at Massachusetts
General Hospital. The tests were given at the insistence of the
Nevada State Athletic Commission, which said it would not restore
Tyson's license without an independent evaluation of his mental
state. At the time, the commission told Tyson's attorneys they
would need the results by Sept. 28, but in a letter written by Dr.
 &UR; Ronald Schouten  &LR; on Sept. 24 to commission doctor  &UR; Flip
Homansky &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Schouten said his understanding was that the results
were not due until Sept. 30. Regardless, they have yet to be
received because Tyson's lawyers are now trying to block the public
release of the evaluation. Schouten said in his letter that he
believed public release was ``unnecessary for the purpose of the
Commission's determination of his fitness to return to the ring ...
More importantly we believe this would be harmful to Mr. Tyson and
contrary to his best clinical interests.'' But when the lawyers
from the Nevada Attorney General's office said any such material
would become public record because the commission is a public
agency, Tyson agreed to submit the test results and evaluation. But
now his attorneys may seek a stay Sunday to argue the matter in
front of the Nevada Supreme Court. The consequence of this is that
a new Oct. 19 hearing date has been postponed and if enough time
passes Tyson would be unlikely to receive his license in time to
fight before the end of the year _ unless he leaves the country or
goes to a state that does not have a commission. But to leave the
country, Tyson would need the permission of Indiana Superior Court
Judge  &UR; Patricia Gifford &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who remains in control of his parole
status. Yet it is likely that Tyson will try to find some way to
fight by Dec. 31 because he recently made a deal with the Internal
Revenue Service for back taxes in which the IRS agreed not to seize
any of his personal property if he signed to fight before the end
of the year. While all this was swirling around Tyson, there were
two more troubling developments. This week Playboy will release an
obscenity-laden interview in which Tyson says of Holyfield ``I
wanted to kill him, bite him. I was just enraged and angry.'' He
goes on to say, ``My life is doomed the way it is.'' Earlier in the
week, the New York Post carried a story in which a photographer
claimed Tyson had to be restrained by bodyguards from going after
him when he tried to take his picture on a New York City street
only days before Tyson allegedly kicked a man and punched another
following a fender-bender accident in Maryland.

 WASHINGTON: next week.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton will take the unusual step of taking part directly on
Monday in a crucial meeting of finance ministers and central
bankers from 22 countries. And on Tuesday, he will speak to the
entire IMF, which represents 182 countries, in his second major
speech on the world economy in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The president set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday,
when he declared that the world was on a ``financial precipice.''
But Clinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become
far more publicly involved in dealing with the world's financial
chaos, insisted that it was not too late to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of us
that enjoy growth will take the initiative and move now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may come
within days as the fund, the Treasury Department and Brazil's
finance minister, Pedro Malan, put the final touches on a package
of $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin met with Malan at the Treasury on Friday, and there was
considerable speculation that the package could be announced as
soon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's election. The
vote is expected to result in the re-election of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso. Administration officials say they fear that a
financial meltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America
and Mexico with it, and bring the crisis to the United States'
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that it
will be extraordinarily difficult to get agreement on a common
agenda from countries facing a varied array of problems _ deep
recession and mass unemployment in Southeast Asia, political
paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, huge bank failures in Japan, an
incipient currency crisis in Brazil, but continued prosperity in
Western Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for instance, is insisting that there be no
backing away from a decade-long move toward freer and more open
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about
``capital controls'' that would reimpose government regulation to
prevent investors from moving billions in short-term investments
from one country to another with a few taps on the computer
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of the
committee that oversees the monetary fund, while Russia is
threatening to default on its loans unless it is quickly given
billions that the fund suspended when President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed his team of economic reformers and violated the terms of
his accord for Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   A senior fund official said last week that Russia's threats were
``a form of blackmail,'' but the enormous turbulence set off by the
Russian financial debacle last month gives real teeth to Russia's
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin are hoping to formulate their own strategies
to calm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of the
recession from hitting American shores, where exports and corporate
profits are already badly affected.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate of those strategies would allow the fund to
begin pre-emptive strikes to bolster the finances of fundamentally
healthy economies where the global economic contagion seems likely
to hit next.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aid
only after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing. But by that
time, the country's currency is already under heavy attack, and
putting together a bailout can cost far more and often involves
austerity measures _ from budget cuts to sky-high interest rates _
that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal will first be debated by the Group
of Seven industrial nations and then, if it gathers much support,
by a meeting of 22 countries, including most of the major emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Japanese official said Saturday that the
president's plan ``seems aimed mostly at Latin America'' and
probably would ``not meet a lot of enthusiasm in Europe and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, meanwhile, are debating how to respond to calls
from Washington for a lowering of interest rates, a step Japan and
the United States have already taken, though with the most modest
of reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, hinted late last week
that London might follow suit. But Germany, traditionally far more
concerned about inflation, has declined to go along. The German
government is playing an unusually small role here as its
Chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroeder, prepares to assemble an
economic team.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Asian countries _ which only five years ago were
the subject of a much-discussed World Bank study called ``The East
Asian Miracle'' _ arrived here in shock and confusion about what to
do next. The first country to be hit by trouble, Thailand, is mired
in difficulties, but looks good in comparison to most of the
region's other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia is suffering economic turmoil, and Indonesia's economy
is plunging so deeply into recession that the monetary fund is
backing away from many of its demands on its government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country,'' an Indonesian said during a
question-and-answer period at the opening session here, ``IMF means
I'm Finished.''

   &UR;  &LR; Why did rumors of banned drug use follow Florence Griffith
Joyner to her untimely death last month? Because no woman has come
close to the astounding marks she set during three months in 1988.
Flo-Jo ran the 100 in 10.49 in a qualifying heat in 98-degree
weather at the Olympic trials. Nobody has broken 10.60 since. She
ran 21.34 in the 200 at Seoul. Nobody has broken 21.70 since.
</P>

   Nothing raises eyebrows like record performances that come from
athletes (such as Irish swimmer Michelle Smith) who've never been
at that level. That's the insidious thing about doping: It calls
every extraordinary feat into question. Nobody said a word about
drugs when US swimmer Mary T. Meagher, in one week in 1981, set two
amazing butterfly records, both of which still stand. If she did it
today, Meagher would be under suspicion.

   How expansive _ and expensive _ have the Winter Games become?
Salt Lake City recently unveiled a ``lean'' budget of $1.4 billion
for 2002. That's $400 million more than Nagano spent this year and
only $300 million less than Atlanta spent on the larger Summer
Games in 1996. Much of it is a matter of accounting: Nagano didn't
factor in nearly $500 million in construction costs that were
covered by the Japanese government. But Salt Lake's facilities
aren't nearly as lavish as Nagano's _ no Big Hats or M-Waves or
Aqua Wings _ and the figure skating arena (home of the Jazz) and
main stadium (at the University of Utah) were already built. Though
the Games are more than three years away, most of the venues are
already up and running. Still in progress are the second hockey
arena (in Provo), the large ski jump, the biathlon/cross-country
area and the athletes' village ... It won't make up for Nagano, but
 &UR; Todd Eldredge  &LR; got some satisfaction by beating Olympic skating
champ  &UR; Ilya Kulik  &LR; head-to-head at the recent Grand Slam event in
South Carolina.  &UR; Michelle Kwan  &LR; defeated  &UR; Maria Butyrskaya  &LR; for the
women's title in the top-drawer pro-am, which was scored by
international judges. Eldredge and Kulik are having at each other
this weekend in a Daytona Beach pro-am, while Kwan faces  &UR; Nicole
Bobek  &LR; and  &UR; Surya Bonaly &LR; . The blending of Olympic eligibles and
ineligibles, though, is baffling for skating fans. Kwan, Kulik, and
Eldredge, who are all still eligible (i.e. non-professional), are
competing in the US Pro classic later this month ... Next challenge
for US Olympic women's ice hockey coach  &UR; Ben Smith  &LR; will be
directing the makeshift men's team at next month's special world
relegation pool tournament in Austria. The Yanks, who ended up a
pathetic 12th in this year's global championships, have to beat the
likes of Kazakhstan, Austria, and Estonia to stay in the A pool for
next year. Smith, who was just named USOC coach of the year for his
gold-medal job in Nagano and accepted the William French Award last
night from the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame, has plenty
of international men's experience: He was Olympic assistant in 1988
and national team assistant in 1987 and 1990.

   Though their top ticket prices will be higher than Atlanta's,
the Sydney organizers say they'll keep the average lower with
plenty of cheap seats. Ten thousand tickets to the opening
ceremonies will go for $61; Atlanta's lowest price was $212.
Seventy percent of all tickets will be offered for less than $35
and some (even in gymnastics) for less than $6. The reason: to
preserve domestic tranquility. Three-quarters of the tickets are
going to Australians ... Though they've technically been at war for
45 years, North and South Korea could compete as one country in
Sydney. The South has been pushing the idea hard and the
International Olympic Committee is on board. What the isolationist
North will do is anyone's guess. The two countries formed joint
soccer and table tennis teams earlier in the decade but have gone
their own ways since ...  &UR; Picabo Street  &LR; says she still has
nightmares about her horrific post-Olympic crash that tore up her
right knee and broke her left leg. ``I see it in my head over and
over,'' she says. ``I live it over and over.'' Street is due back
on slopes next month but won't be competing at all this season.
``I'm coming out of a hole,'' she says. ``I'll ski for the winter,
then decide what's next.'' ... Encouraging start for Winchester
bobsledder  &UR; Jim Herberich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the two-man title (with  &UR; Paul
Wise &LR; ) at the recent world push championships in Monte Carlo. The
World Cup season starts next month in Calgary ... New but familiar
face in the US luge camp belongs to  &UR; Clay Ives &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a two-time
Olympian for Canada who just received dual citizenship and is
looking to switch. The reason: better funding from the Yanks. Until
he qualifies for the national team, though, Ives will be on his own
dollar ... High hopes for the US cyclists at this week's world road
championships in the Netherlands. Best chances ride with  &UR; Bobby
Julich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was third in the Tour de France, and  &UR; Dede
Demet &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has won two medals. Also on the squad is former champ
 &UR; Lance Armstrong &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has bounced back from testicular cancer.

downhill) at the recent world mountain biking event in Quebec.

   Add sailing to the list of Olympic sports (e.g. rowing and
boxing) that have had to trim numbers to accommodate new additions
(e.g. triathlon and trampolining) to the Sydney program. With the
entries reduced from 450 to 400, countries (except for host
Australia) now have to qualify through world regattas. Mixed
results so far for the Americans, who've earned slots in the
Soling, 49er, Laser, and men's 470 classes but missed out this year
in Finn, Europe, Star, and women's 470. They'll try to qualify this
fall for Mistral and Tornado. Everybody gets three chances ...
Modest expectations for the US riders at the ongoing world
equestrian games in Rome. The Americans, who won two medals last
time, have already missed the podium in team dressage. New
Englanders on the squad include  &UR; Shelly Francis  &LR; (Woodstock, Vt.)
in dressage and  &UR; Kerry Millikin  &LR; (Westport, Mass.) and  &UR; Cindy
Collier  &LR; (Newtown, Conn.) in eventing ... Three members of the US
Olympic men's volleyball team that won the historic triple crown
(1984 Olympics, 1985 World Cup, 1986 World Championships) will be
inducted into the Hall of Fame in Holyoke this month:  &UR; Steve
Timmons &LR; , &UR; Dusty Dvorak &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Craig Buck  &LR; will be joined by  &UR; Paula

medals in 1984 and 1992.

STRAWBERRY HAS SURGERY; CANCEROUS TUMOR REMOVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry, the 36-year-old Yankees
outfielder, underwent what doctors said was a successful and
uncomplicated three-hour operation to remove a cancer of his colon
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical team at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in
Manhattan, headed by Dr. George J. Todd, said it removed a
cancerous tumor that measured 2.4 inches in length and that nearly
blocked his intestine. There was no visible evidence during the
operation that the cancer had spread beyond that area of the bowel,
the doctors said in a statement issued Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be about a week before the results of the key
pathology tests are available. The findings will determine what
anti-cancer therapy the doctors will recommend for Strawberry after
he recuperates from surgery. He was expected to stay in the
hospital for one week.
</P>
<P>
   The pathology findings will provide the doctors with information
they need to stage, or classify, the severity of Strawberry's
cancer and provide a statistical base for a long-term prognosis.
Although Strawberry's wife, Charisse, had said the cancer was a
favorable stage A or B, cancer experts said in interviews that
there was no way to know the stage of the cancer until the final
pathology tests were available.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the pathologist's examination of the cancerous
tumor and the other tissues removed are generally considered more
important than the size of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' statement that the tumor nearly obstructed the
intestine would be a likely explanation for the abdominal cramping
Strawberry had experienced in recent weeks. Abdominal pain is not a
usual symptom of an early colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The operation went smoothly, the doctors said, and afterward
Strawberry was resting comfortably with his family at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer was located in the area of the large intestine known
as the descending colon. After removing a 16-inch portion of bowel
containing the cancer and the segment of normal colon to either
side of it, the surgeons sewed the severed ends of the colon
together.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the surgeons did not need to create a new opening
through the abdomen, known as a colostomy, to eliminate wastes from
the bowel. An ultrasound test performed during the operation showed
no evidence of spread of the cancer to the liver, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, pathologists will add fixatives and
chemical dyes to the removed cancer and tissues to make it easier
to examine under a microscope. By looking through a microscope, the
pathologists can detect cancerous cells that would not be visible
to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Because several steps are involved in the preparation of the
tissues, and it takes time for the fixatives and chemicals to act,
it usually is about a week before such pathology tests can be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day fans stopped by Columbia-Presbyterian to
check on Strawberry's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Casanova, 34, drove in from Ringwood, N.J., with her two
children, Andrew, 10, and Kelly, 12. Casanova described herself as
a diehard Strawberry and Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl's whole life has been baseball,'' Casanova said. ``He's
been a great asset to the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd, a specialist in surgery of blood vessels, was assisted in
the operation by Dr. Alan Benvenisty, Dr. John A. Chabot, Dr.
Kenneth A. Forde and Dr. Richard L. Whelan. Dr. Steve Mercer was
the anesthesiologist, and Jeanette Hofman and Kim Vanbeverhaut were
the nurses. Dr. Stuart Hershon, a specialist in bone and joint
surgery and the Yankees' team physician, was also present.

 SCHOOLS PROMOTING EARLY STUDY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ ``Rapido, escoge un color,'' Diana Alfaro told
a pupil. Quickly, pick a color. ``Morado,'' the boy responded.
Purple. Five other second-graders holding up rectangles of
different colors quickly picked out purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muy bien,'' Mrs. Alfaro told them with a big smile.
``Excelente.''
</P>
<P>
   Still speaking in Spanish, Mrs. Alfaro asked a girl sitting on
the floor for her name. ``Rojo,'' the girl answered incorrectly.
Red. After being asked again, the girl finally answered, ``Yo me
llamo Natalie.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, in another rapid-fire Spanish lesson at Johnson
Elementary School, where second-graders take 15 minutes of Spanish
instruction every day and Senora, as all the pupils call Mrs.
Alfaro, speaks nary a word of English.
</P>
<P>
   The program at the school, part of the Princeton Regional
District, was created to help comply with 1996 state curriculum
guidelines that require foreign language instruction at the
elementary level. Within a few years, officials at the school plan
to offer Spanish to children as young as kindergarten age.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts by Princeton Regional, and by other districts
around the state, are being made as New Jersey joins a small core
of states that are raising the premium on younger students'
learning a second language.
</P>
<P>
   But while the half-dozen other states have requirements for
foreign languages in elementary schools, according to the American
Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, only New Jersey is
requiring elementary students to pass a proficiency test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're placing a high value on learning another language,''
said Jay Doolan, the director of standards and professional
development with the New Jersey Department of Education. ``We feel
it's not only appropriate for competing in a shrinking world, but
that learning another language also helps you do better in your
first language.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators who back the growing national movement of beginning
foreign language instruction at an early age say, like a mantra,
that brain research has shown that at about age 10, the window of
opportunity closes for learning another language well.
</P>
<P>
   Doolan said research has shown that the study of a foreign
language enhances memorization and listening skills, and that
students who speak another language go on to score higher on the
SAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives children a sense of personal satisfaction to
communicate with someone else in another language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every school district in New Jersey will get to pick which
language, or languages, it will offer _ including American Sign
Language _ and at which grade the school wants to begin. But
starting in the 2001-2002 academic year, all fourth-graders in the
state will have to pass a proficiency test in that language, under
the state's new curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Doolan said state officials do not know how many districts, like
Princeton, have already begun putting their foreign language
program in place in the elementary schools. Among those that
already have a program, there is much variation in terms of how
long the language lessons are, how frequently they are offered and
the level of training of teachers who are instructing in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   But local school officials seemed to be united in their
complaints about the cost of the foreign language programs. They do
not receive any extra money from the state. They are also
frustrated by the demands that the new guidelines are placing on
their schedules, which are already crowded with other mandated
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   State officials suggest that districts use regular classroom
teachers, perhaps with the help of technology like the Internet, to
teach foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is cutting edge,'' said Nancy Rhodes, director
of foreign language education for the Center for Applied
Linguistics in Washington. ``It makes sense to have an assessment
to show proficiency. A lot of people are very excited about what
New Jersey is attempting to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Hoch, who is in charge of foreign language instruction for
the North Carolina Department of Education, which is seen as a
model for many other states, said her state failed in not including
a testing requirement in its legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, she said, many districts have simply not complied
with the state requirement that all schools offer foreign language
instruction in kindergarten through fifth grade. Only 40 percent to
50 percent of the state's elementary school students take a foreign
language.
</P>
<P>
   David Edwards, executive director of the Joint National
Committee for Languages, a lobbying group in Washington, said New
Jersey is responding to what parents across the nation seem to be
demanding of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant amount of the push for foreign languages in
elementary school is coming from parents, who want good jobs and
good futures for their children,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A check with about a dozen of New Jersey's 600 school districts
shows there is wide variation in how they will comply with the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County, for example, the school
district of 814 students offers an exploratory foreign language
program for third-graders during the last trimester of the year,
and then a full-year program beginning in the fourth grade, when
children study a language for 25 minutes three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement has been in place for several years, and there
are no plans to offer foreign languages at the lower grades, said
Elliot Solomon, the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect that our children will be successful on the
test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In those districts that have decided to expand their offerings
to younger children, the financial and staffing consequences have
been immense. In the Montclair Public School District in Essex
County, for example, the decision to provide foreign languages to
all of the districts' first- and second-graders has diminished the
program of one of its schools, which has been offering foreign
language to children as young as preschool for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Nishuane Elementary School, has long prided itself
on providing foreign language instruction four times a week as a
centerpiece of its magnet school philosophy, but now it will be
able to offer French and Spanish lessons only twice a week for some
students because two language teachers will have to divide their
time among more schools in the district as the program is expanded
to include all first- and second-graders.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say they know the program will be valuable only
if they continue the instruction for each child throughout the
child's schooling. Those districts that want to offer more than one
choice in foreign language are realizing they will need a dizzying
strategy to accommodate the choices.
</P>
<P>
   In Teaneck, Janice Dowd, the instruction leader for foreign
languages, said that in putting an elementary school foreign
language program in place, school officials feared that by offering
only Spanish, they would cause the French program now offered at
the high school level to eventually die out.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate both languages, they will offer Spanish to
first-graders and French to second-graders. In the third through
fifth grades, students will take both languages, alternating by
10-week grading periods. The school hopes to add Latin and Italian
in the sixth grade, and by the seventh grade, they will allow
students to pick one language to study in depth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Princeton schools, the plan is to eventually offer
Spanish to all students from kindergarten through fifth grade. By
the time students are in middle and high school, the foreign
language classes will involve more sophisticated topics, like the
study of another culture's literature, said Martin Smith, director
of foreign language instruction. This year they are offering
Spanish only to second- and fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   In Julie Rice's second-grade classroom, most of the students
eagerly raised their hands to answer all of Mrs. Alfaro's questions
during her short Spanish class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like learning a second language,'' said Ilana Sigal, who is
8. ``I like just knowing that if somebody knows Spanish, I can talk
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher said she appreciates the students' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect age to learn another language,'' said Mrs.
Alfaro, who was recruited by the school especially for the program.
``They're not afraid of anything new. They listen. If you wait
until they're in high school, they're too busy thinking about
boyfriends and girlfriends, or they think, `Oh, I'm going to make a
mistake and look stupid.'''

 &HT;    Chargers: Stay out of our room
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Chargers apparently haven't caught
baseball fever. The NFL club put up a chain and padlocks across the
doors to its locker room at Qualcomm Stadium this weekend, refusing
to let the Padres to use it as a media interview area. Instead, the
Padres are using the less spacious San Diego State locker room to
handle the media crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Padres GM Kevin Towers also took a shot at the Chargers, blaming
them in part for the chewed-up field at Qualcomm Stadium. ``If
there's a scheduling problem with the Chargers, they take
precedence over us. That's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   `The King' returns
</P>
<P>
   ``The King,'' as Jim Leyritz is known around the Padres
clubhouse, got the start at first base Saturday night. Not only had
Leyritz driven in three of the Padres' six runs in the opening two
games, but he provided a right-handed bat against lefty starter
Mike Hampton, and the swing of Stone Mountain native Wally Joyner,
the regular first baseman, is impaired by acute tendinitis in his
left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz picks up another start this afternoon, this time behind
the plate, as the personal catcher for ex-Yankees teammate and Game
4 pitcher Sterling Hitchcock, who will go against the Astros Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Money games
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros have to deal with Johnson ($6 million this
year) after the season, he's their only everyday player or starting
pitcher facing free agency. The Padres are a totally different
story. They have eight potential free agents, including key players
like pitcher Kevin Brown ($4.8 million), third baseman Ken Caminiti
($3.1 million), outfielder Steve Finley ($3.4 million), catcher
Carlos Hernandez ($650,000) and Joyner ($3.7 million).
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite, a straight shooter in his years as CBS News
anchor, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3. ...
Hitters have been coming to the plate with their theme song blaring
over the stadium PA system for years. Now, Padres closer Trevor
Hoffman has jumped into the act with AC/DC's ``Hells Bells''
playing when he trots in from the bullpen. ... How good are Hoffman
and the Padres at closing out games? During the last two-plus
seasons, they're 174-0 in the regular season when leading after the
eighth inning, including an 85-0 record in 1998.

 &HT;    Winning fuels Padres' dreams of new home
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It's that time of year when politics and baseball
step deeper into the media spotlight. Campaigns and playoff
baseball. Rare is it that the two feed off each other, but this
fall finds the Padres on the stump as they seek to play themselves
into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   By all reports, the future of baseball in San Diego likely rests
with a November referendum on whether to build a downtown ballpark.
If Proposition C meets with the locals favor, Padres' owner John
Moores will get the park he needs to compete with wealthier,
corporate-backed clubs up the interstate in Los Angeles (Fox) and
Anaheim (Disney). If not, the Padres might be headed for northern
Virginia or some other interested outpost.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Padres couldn't have gotten hot at a more
opportune time.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could they have opened their wallets wide enough to buy the
ad campaign being fueled by their winning baseball. A record crowd
in excess of 64,000 showed up at Qualcomm Stadium for Game 3 of the
NL Division Series Saturday night. And the Padres are hoping with
every postseason win comes more votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help if we keep winning, of course,'' said
Padres outfielder Greg Vaughn. ``Everybody recognizes that. We want
it, yeah. Hopefully, if we play well it'll happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I'm not thinking of a new stadium when I'm
playing. Who knows if I'll be here when it's done. Or who even
knows if I'll be here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are marketing their plan for a downtown stadium on
the promise of ``family-friendly'' restaurants and shops being
drawn to a trendy Ballpark District. Local neighborhood groups
oppose the 26-block redevelopment project, largely because
residents will be displaced and their contention that any economic
stimulus will be felt by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how the vote will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Padres all speak in favor of a new park. But
pitching ace Kevin Brown is also familiar with what happens when an
owner doesn't get his way. Brown was a member of the world
championship Florida Marlins that were broken up after last season
when south Florida politicians refused to help team owner Wayne
Huizenga build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes the issue,'' Brown said. ``But I can tell
you, it's not why I walk on the field. I play for my teammates, for
personal pride. A stadium vote is not a driving force. That's out
of my control.''

 &HT;    Funk's 1-shot lead looks big to rivals
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ According to the leaderboard, Fred Funk has
a mere one-shot lead at 18-under-par 198 in the Buick Challenge as
he tries to win today for the second time in four years at Callaway
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   According to PGA Tour habits, that should mean that players such
as Bill Glasson (17 under), J.L. Lewis (15 under) or Steve
Elkington and Steve Flesch (14 under) have a reasonable chance of
catching Funk.
</P>
<P>
   According to local knowledge, none of that stuff matters. His
competitors are speaking as through the place should be called
Funkaway Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all just playing to see who gets second place,''
Glasson said after moving into apparent contention with a 65.
``Honestly, I don't think we'll be able to catch Fred. It's like
it's his home field and the rest of us are on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you could have some hope, said David Duval, who shot a 70
and dropped six shots off the pace, ``if you didn't know Fred was
going to shoot 4 or 5 under every time he plays here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Funk, as much as he appreciates the praise, he
sensed someone trying to playfully lull him into complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a smokescreen,'' Funk, a Ponte Vedra, Fla.,
resident, said after a 68 that revised the 54-hole tournament
record at 18-under, a shot less than Davis Love III managed last
year. ``There's not one person out here that backs up or concedes
anything to anybody. ... It's great that he (Glasson) thinks that,
but all those guys at 12 or 13 under have a chance if any of the
leaders does a fold job. I need to keep making birdies. ... Billy
already caught me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk, a winner in July at the Deposit Guaranty Classic, has
either owned or shared the lead since Thursday, when he and Jim
Carter shot 63s. Funk led by as many as four shots Saturday, making
seven birdies against three bogeys and nearly hitting exactly his
third-round scoring average of 68.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I made seven birdies,'' he said, ``I made some
boo-boos.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his 72-hole record of 21 under par registered last year,
defending champion Davis Love III said Saturday, ``I think it's in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, of Briarcliff, Texas, a 38-year-old Nike Tour graduate
from last year, is 156th on the money list ($142,788) and has
missed the cut in 16 of 28 events.
</P>
<P>
   Carter (69) and Neal Lancaster (66) are at 13-under 203,
followed by Duval and D.A. Weibring (71) at 12 under. Atlanta's
Billy Andrade (67) is seven shots back at 11 under along with Texas
Open winner Hal Sutton (67) and J.P. Hayes (67).
</P>
<P>
   Both Elkington (66) and Glasson have overcome serious medical
problems to contend. Glasson is in only his 10th event of the year
after a third elbow operation. Elkington had two bouts of viral
meningitis this year and sinus problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four knee (operations), three elbows, a few back problems,
sinus, a little skin cancer _ you name it,'' Glasson said. ``I had
kind of a tough night. I think I'm passing around a little flu bug.
I'll try not to breathe on you too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he or anyone else can breathe down Funk's neck today is
the real issue.

 &HT;    Atlanta's Andrade misses mark in Buick tour
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Five dollars short of making the Tour
Championship last year, Atlanta resident Billy Andrade has taken
his current top 30 push to Callaway Gardens and the Buick
Challenge. A member at East Lake Golf Club, which hosts the Tour
Championship Oct. 29-Nov. 1, Andrade stands 41st on the money list
and requires some high finishes over these next four events.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the quest still lives. Andrade shot a second straight 67
Saturday to move to 11-under-par 205. Perhaps not in position to
snare another's winner's check after last month's surprise victory
at the Canadian Open -- Fred Funk has seven shots on him -- but
second place today earns $162,000 and Andrade also likes the venues
the next two weeks at Kingsmill and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 31st last year and missing the exclusive $4
million event, the 34-year-old Andrade is pumped for a change in
the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ''After I won (at Canada last month), my thought process was,
'Why don't I knock somebody out this time?''' Andrade said. ''Being
an East Lake member and living in Atlanta, it would be a dream come
true to play in the Tour Championship there.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade ignited his game Friday with a closing 30 on the back
nine for a 67, then came out Saturday and birdied his first four
holes. With a third-round front nine of 32, Andrade had gone
10-under par for the 18-hole stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade has earned $655,431 and probably needs about $925,000 to
make the top 30 list and qualify for the Tour Championship at East
Lake Oct. 29-Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a million dollars is a good goal,'' Andrade said. ''I
think that would be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pooped Kuchar ready for break
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech amateur Matt Kuchar struggled to a 73 Saturday to
stand at 4-under 212, attributing his inconsistent play mostly to
burnout from trying to balance his schoolwork and college
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really not playing well,'' he said. ''I've been playing
with my 'C' game for a month now. I've got enough for one more day.
I'll probably use everything tomorrow.'' After a solid 67 Friday to
make the cut, Kuchar made bogeys at 15,16 and 17, then birdied 18.
Tired or not, Kuchar led a junior clinic a few hours after his
round. . .Defending champion Davis Love said he was losing
concentration at times Saturday during a 2-under 70 that put him at
7-under. ''I'm following up a bad shot with another bad shot,''
Love said. ''Some things seem to be bothering me that don't usually
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Today's final round will be televised live from 1-4 p.m. on
ESPN. Players will play off the No. 1 and the No. 10 tees in
threesomes. . . . Glen Day shot a 7-under 65 Saturday to move to
10-under, but easily could have been better. He missed a 3-footer
for par at the 17th and another for birdie at the 18th. . . .
Columbus resident Larry Mize shot a 67 and is at 8-under. .
.Pronouncing his play as ''terrible,'' David Duval (70) started
Saturday with a double-bogey on the first hole, three birdies, then
two bogeys. ''I'm not in this golf tournament anymore,'' said the
tour's leading moneywinner.. . Former Marietta resident Bob Tway
(69) is at 9-under, three shots ahead of former Georgia player
Franklin Langham (72).

 &HT;    McLaughlin wins, barely
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ With nothing to lose, Mike McLaughlin defied
the odds Saturday and won the Busch Grand National Bumper To Bumper
Auto Parts 300, running the final 94 laps under green at Charlotte
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin won it riding away, taking the checkered flag 24.074
seconds ahead of Matt Kenseth. And after rolling into victory lane,
he climbed atop his Monte Carlo and executed a swan dive into the
arms of his pit crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys in the pits won it,'' McLaughlin said. ``I don't know
how we made it on fuel. I even questioned them when they left me
out there for track position. They had a different strategy (than I
did) and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth could hardly believe it. When he made his final stop, he
asked his crew if McLaughlin could go all the way without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what they told me? He said, `No way. He'll be 25 laps
short of making it.'''

 &HT;    Tracking down battle for fifth in Winston Cup
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ With the Winston Cup championship all but
decided between Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin, eyes have turned to
the battle for fifth place in the Winston Cup standings, where only
46 points separate Bobby Labonte, Jeremy Mayfield and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte holds the position, 40 points ahead of Mayfield, who
leads Jeff Burton by six. ``This really is a big race, a
springboard for all of us,'' said Mayfield, who has four top 10
finishes in the last six races. ``We've been right in the middle of
things all year, from leading the points (12 races ago at Pocono)
to where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's run since Pocono has been one of inconsistency. He
finished 18th, 30th, 18th, 42nd and 31st after falling from the
lead, and has gone seventh, eighth, 20th, fifth, 22nd and third in
the last six races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked over and there and seen the Winston Cup
championship ring on Rusty's finger,'' Mayfield said. ``I know what
it means. I think we can win Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   This track, however, hasn't been good to Mayfield. In four fall
outings here, his best finish is 27th, a year ago. Labonte's best
is a second last year and Burton's was 11th two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be good,'' Mayfield said. ``So is Rusty
(Wallace). We're working together like we always have. We always
qualify decent and run somewhere toward the front until something
happens, but we've learned a lot about Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're been working on getting both cars in the top five and
keeping them there in the points. Rusty is fourth and I think we've
got a good shot at getting there before the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace already has discovered something that will help him. A
broken spark plug wire. Those are the kind of things that hindered
him earlier when he was No. 1 on the points list. A blown engine at
Bristol, a wreck California and another engine failure at Pocono,
which, ironically, came on the day Mayfield moved to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me the other day if it was my turn, like Ricky
(Rudd) to extend my streak,'' Wallace said. ``I told 'em I've been
saying that all year long. I hope it. We keep knocking on the door.
Now, we need to knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The darkhorse may be Bobby Labonte. He was second here a year
ago and starts on the outside of the second row today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're run good at Charlotte time and time again it seems
like,'' Labonte said. ``If we finish, we finish good. What we raced
at Charlotte two or three years ago is similar to what we race
there today.''

 &HT;    Caswell-Herr in Nuveen Tour final
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND CHART
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Connors brought out the crowd Saturday
afternoon, and a pair of local heroes, Howard Herr and Ned Caswell,
sent the fans away happy by advancing to the doubles final of the
BTI Champions event at Atlanta Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Connors defeated Gene Mayer 6-0, 6-4 in the opening match before
a crowd of 2,162, setting up a 1 p.m. final today against the
winner of the late Mats Wilander-Mikael Pernfors match.
</P>
<P>
   Connors has won four of the seven Nuveen Tour events he's
entered this year, and two of his failures came after he withdrew
because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm hitting as well as I ever have,'' said Connors,
who is coming off a victory over John McEnroe in last week's final
in Dallas. ``Even though tennis isn't the most important thing in
my life anymore, it's still kind of what I do and as long as I do
I'm going to do it the absolute best that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's more intriguing match was the 6-3, 6-4 victory of
Herr and Caswell over second-seeded Gene Mayer and Mansour Bahrami
in the doubles semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Herr, the tennis director at the Falls of Autry Mill in
Alpharetta, and Caswell, a Roswell native who is a teaching pro in
Chattanooga, won a local qualifying tournament last month to get in
as wildcards. They beat Andres Gomez and Tim Wilkison in the first
round Thursday, and each had a small but vocal band of local
followers on hand Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to play week in and week out, so if we're ever
going to win one of these, it's got to be now,'' Caswell said.
``We're not playing just to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Caswell and Herr each played for a few years on the ATP Tour.
Each is a two-time national men's 30-and-over clay court singles
champion, and Caswell has won the national 30 clays six straight
times in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've played at that level _ I mean Ned's beaten Pete
Sampras _ you go out there ready to play,'' Herr said. ``That
doesn't mean you think you're gonna win, but we know we can play
with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Caswell, ``We definitely didn't come in thinking we had no
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, a two-time former French Open doubles champion, and
Bahrami, who made the 1989 French doubles final, were more
light-hearted about the match, though it was clear they didn't want
to lose. Bahrami clowned with the crowd, and Caswell said it was a
distraction but didn't annoy him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've if he'd aced me with that underhand serve,''
Caswell said. ``I didn't see that coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Herr and Caswell are the second local qualifiers ever to make a
Nuveen Tour doubles final. The others are Mike Fedderly and Greg
Nuehart. No local qualifiers have ever won in the final.

VAUGHN'S FUTURE HAS BOSTON ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His departure would be a disaster in every way. From
the standpoint of performance, it would cost the rejuvenated Boston
Red Sox their best hitter for average and power. From the
standpoint of morale, it would remove one of the team's most
respected and authoritative voices from the clubhouse. And from the
standpoint of public relations, it would infuriate the fans and
take away the most beloved black superstar baseball player this
city _ one long regarded as racially hostile toward
African-Americans _ has had.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the feeling here in Boston is that Mo Vaughn, a free agent
after this season, may have played one of his last games for the
Red Sox in Saturday's 4-3 defeat to the Cleveland Indians in the
American League division series.
</P>
<P>
   The most pessimistic observers point to General Manager Dan
Duquette's glaring omission of Vaughn during a spiel about Red Sox
players who would compete in the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park.
At a July news conference announcing that the annual classic would
be played in Boston next year, Duquette spoke about the joy it
would bring the city to see Red Sox such as pitchers Pedro Martinez
and Tom Gordon and shortstop Nomar Garciaparra play before the home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uhh, didn't you forget somebody?'' the local media asked. Only
then did Duquette mention Vaughn, a two-time All-Star with a career
batting average of .304.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Duquette is saying that Vaughn will be around next
year, pointing to his portrait in the team's 1999 schedule as
evidence. But the relationship between Vaughn and the franchise is
somewhat strained, partially because of two drunken driving
incidents that plagued the first baseman in the past year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and the Red Sox almost came to terms before the season
began, but when the club traded for Martinez and then signed him to
a six-year, $75 million deal, they no longer had the money to
immediately take care of Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Vaughn has said he wants to test the free-agent
market, a statement that frightens Boston fans who remember
longtime Red Sox hero Roger Clemens mouthing the same words before
signing with the Toronto Blue Jays a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday in Cleveland, Vaughn was asked if the Red Sox
performance in their division series against the Indians would
affect his decision to test his market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know,'' he said. ``We'll talk about that when
it's time. I haven't even really thought about leaving at this
point. I'm just trying to go out with the attitude to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty surrounding his future _ not to mention the
10-15 pounds he has lost _ has only strengthened his performance on
the field. A seven-year veteran, Vaughn enjoyed his finest season
to date, clubbing 40 homers, knocking in 115 runs and hitting a
career-best .337 to finish second in the American League batting
race.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like that, Vaughn could wind up fielding offers in
the $10 million range during the off-season. The question is, will
one of those offers be made by the Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   As for Cleveland, the most pressing issue facing the Indians
this off-season will be finding a second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Since trading fan favorite Carlos Baerga to the New York Mets in
July 1996, the club has had more than a dozen players at the
position, only to become dissatisfied with each one.
</P>
<P>
   Current starter Joey Cora, whom they acquired from Seattle in
August, is the latest tryout in an undistinguished list that has
included David Bell, Tony Fernandez, Shawon Dunston, Jeff Kent,
Jose Vizcaino and Julio Franco. A free agent this summer, Cora is
not likely to be re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, the Indians have fiddled with the idea
of bringing in Baltimore's Roberto Alomar to play alongside his
older brother Sandy, and talk of trading for the Orioles star will
certainly resurface in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   While the club's starting rotation is not among the league's
elite, it could be in the near future. So do not be surprised if
the Indians don't attempt to deal for an ace.
</P>
<P>
   Flame throwers Jaret Wright, 22, and Bartolo Colon, 23, combined
for 26 victories this season and should only get better, and
Charles Nagy, Dwight Gooden and Dave Burba are solid, if not
spectacular. &QL;

ONCE AGAIN, THE RED SOX COME UP SHORT IN THE POSTSEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The latest addition to Boston's baseball narrative was
supposed to be Pete Schourek, the lightly regarded pitcher who
Manager Jimy Williams decided to start over the sensational Pedro
Martinez Saturday in Game 4. But instead of Schourek, who pitched
five and one-third shutout innings before leaving the field with
the lead, it was All-Star Tom Gordon who put on the poor
performance that will be lamented by Red Sox fans for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the magnificent closer who finished the season with 43
straight saves, took the mound at the start of the eighth inning,
with the Red Sox clinging to a 1-0 lead. With 46 saves to his
credit, Gordon seemed like a lock to shut down the Indians and send
the series back to Cleveland for the fifth and deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   But the man whom nearly everyone in Boston affectionately calls
``Flash'' sputtered, giving up Cleveland's only runs in the
Indians' dramatic 2-1 victory, which earned them a spot opposite
the Yankees in the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians defeated the Yankees by three games to two in last
year's division series en route to their second World Series
appearance in three seasons. David Justice, the Game 2 hero for the
Indians, came through again Saturday, knocking in both Cleveland
runs with a line-drive double that, on one bounce, hit the
center-field wall 420 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's smash drove in Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel, both of
whom had singled. It was Vizquel's first hit in 15 at-bats this
series.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Williams to put in Gordon in the eighth was
questionable because the right-hander had not started in that
inning all season. He had gotten the final six outs in two games,
but never started the final two innings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just minutes before Gordon left the bullpen, the manager had
looked brilliant for his gutsy decision to stick with Schourek when
the local media and fans were calling for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   With Schourek holding the Indians scoreless on two hits through
five innings, the Red Sox seemed destined to head into the series
finale with their ace rested and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was not threatened until the fifth, when he began
having control problems. After Vaughn made a diving grab to rob Jim
Thome of a base hit, Schourek walked Richie Sexson and Sandy Alomar
Jr., and when his first pitch to the No. 9 batter, Enrique Wilson,
was off the plate, it marked the seventh straight ball he had
thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek managed to get Wilson out on a fly ball to center
field, but Sexson moved to third on the play to put men on the
corners with two out and Lofton at bat. Schourek ran the count full
before forcing the speedy leadoff batter to fly out to center for
the third straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had allowed only one hit, it was surprising to see
Schourek return for the sixth, if only for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He got Vizquel to pop out but was ripped for a double by
Justice. Williams called in reliever Derek Lowe, sending Schourek
out to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek's counterpart, Bartolo Colon, was just as strong. With
his fastball clocking nearly 100 miles per hour, he kept the Red
Sox off the scoreboard until Nomar Garciaparra tagged his first
pitch of the fourth inning an estimated 411 feet into the Boston
bullpen behind right-center field for the game's only run until
Gordon entered.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have now lost 16 of their last 17 postseason games,
starting with the infamous Bill Buckner game in the 1986 World
Series. ... Cleveland has lost the opener of its last seven playoff
series. But it has ended up winning four of them. ... Manny
Ramirez's two home runs in Game 3 gave him a franchise-record 11
over his 41-game postseason career and put him in first place in
the category among active players. His solo homer in the ninth off
reliever Dennis Eckersley was his second in two career at-bats
against the 24-year veteran, who turned 44 Saturday. ... Ramirez
and teammates Bartolo Colon and David Justice wore Darryl
Strawberry's No. 39 on their hats in honor of Yankee outfielder,
who Saturday had surgery for colon cancer.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very cool and unsettled weather will prevail from the
northwestern states to the northern Mississippi Valley as a series
of fast-moving disturbances circulate around a whirlpool of
high-level chill over western North America. Onshore winds will
promote light showers near the northwest coast, while the interior
will have breezy conditions with variable clouds and few showers.
</P>
<P>
   A jet-stream disturbance will bring widespread showers and some
high-elevation snow from Wyoming to the Bitterroot mountains of
Idaho and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of rain and drizzle will dampen the northern parts of
the Plains and Mississippi Valley as moist air flowing north from
the western Gulf of Mexico will be forced to rise over the chilly
air in place across the region. The steadiest rain is expected from
the eastern Dakotas to northern Iowa. Meanwhile, a few
thunderstorms will erupt in the warmer air over the central
Mississippi and western Ohio valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be warm and muggy under the influence
of a broad flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. A cluster of
heavy showers associated with a tropical disturbance will reach the
central Gulf of Mexico coast. Farther north, scattered
thundershowers will develop, especially along the east slopes of
the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The day will begin with low clouds and patchy light rain from
the southern New England coast to the Middle Atlantic States.
Gradual drying will develop during the middle of the day and the
afternoon. High pressure will keep northern New England dry and
cool with ample sun.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Season of Color
</P>
<P>
   From the middle of September to the end of October, the trees
throughout the northeastern states typically become a natural
palette of brilliant color. The usual burst of crimsons and yellows
during the period around the autumn equinox comes when leaves begin
to die, losing their green color as the hours of sunshine steadily
wane. The most vivid hidden pigments are revealed in years when
dry, cool weather hastens the hibernation of the trees. Sometimes
gusty winds and frequent rain defoliate trees too soon and dilute
the delicate color from the leaves that remain.

IN TIME OF NEED, UNITY PULSES TO A LATIN BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They came from all over Latin New York, looking to
glimpse a star, to dance, to help.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians obliged by giving speeches, as did radio deejays and
actors _ Jimmy Smits showed up, mingled with the crowd and talked
about his family. Musicians played, and by the end of the day,
``Ayuda a Los Pueblos'' (Help for the Towns) at Hostos Community
College in the Bronx had collected nearly $500,000 for the Hispanic
Federation to help residents of Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic still reeling from Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came back from the Dominican Republic, and between the
airport and Santo Domingo, there isn't a tree standing,'' said
Guillermo Linares, the city councilman from Washington Heights.
``We traveled in helicopter, and it's total destruction. When
people heard the helicopter coming, they ran to us thinking it's
food.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the audience echoed his observations. Nearly everyone
had a friend or relative on the islands, and had heard about the
shortages of water and food, the utter devastation.
</P>
<P>
   So a string of performers from New York and the Caribbean came
to sing and play for the crowd, which totaled about 3,000. The
Barrio Boyzz shuffled and sang, and by the time salsa legend Celia
Cruz showed up, people were ready for her form of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party,'' said Milly Quezada, a merengue singer.
``First we have all these people, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans
coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not a sad people. We're here to maintain solidarity
with the people in the islands, earn some money to help them. But
we're also here to help people have a good time. There's enough
misery around.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Miranda, the event's producer and the outgoing president of
the Hispanic Federation, said work began six days ago. ``We were
here at 3:30 a.m. working,'' he said. ``But it's for the good.
There are 100,000 people in need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here all share a sense of belonging,'' he said.
``The great thing about being bicultural is that you can love the
United States and love where you come from also.''
</P>
<P>
   As the string of performers filed on and off, they were met
backstage by reporters and friends. Radio and television crews were
interviewing the musicians and politicians, and the Hispanic
Federation was showing off the large checks that had been brought
by corporations. Anheuser-Busch, for example, gave $25,000;
Heineken gave $50,000. Money was also raised by the $10 admission
charge, and by a telethon that was part of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Louie Marrero, one of the Barrio Boyzz, looked a bit awestruck.
``It's an honor to perform,'' he said. ``We like to give back to
the community. Puerto Rican, Dominican, it doesn't matter, we're
all Latinos, and we thank God that we're all able to be responsible
and that we can help make a difference.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jimmy Smits was answering questions, then he headed out to talk
to the people outside, standing in line, waiting to pay their money
to enter. ``I have an aunt in Puerto Rico who lost part of her
house,'' Smits said. ``And where my family lives the phones were
out. We all have stories like that, and people are suffering.
That's why I'm here, to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the audience, people were dancing. They danced to
Fulanito, a local merengue group, and they danced to Oro Solido,
which performed its hit ``Baile de Beeper.'' They danced to Frankie
Negron, a young salsa singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to help,'' said Josefina Salas, who had come to the
show from her home a few blocks away with her sister. ``We donated
at the door, but this is a really good deal, lots of music.'' Ms.
Salas was dancing. ``But we have to be happy. It's a lot worse for
them there than it is for us, and we have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose ``El Canario'' Alberto and his salsa orchestra showed up to
play, and Johnny Pacheco came out and played flute with them.
Alberto and Pacheco were running through Pacheco's hits from the
1970s and a mother and daughter were running through their dance
routines to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Celia Cruz, to a standing ovation, to sing with
Alberto's orchestra. Dominicans danced to a Cuban woman singing a
Puerto Rican form of salsa played by the Dominican Alberto, just as
Puerto Ricans had danced to merengue, from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez said he saw a lot of good in the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious thing about this is that government
organizations can't make up for all the destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we can rebuild some houses, send some generators and
some food, that's great. But just as importantly, to bring
communities together, the Puerto Rican and Dominicans that
sometimes are separated by some nuances that aren't always
important. And that unity is a sight to see. Things like this bring
out the best in people.''

FOR RANGERS, ONE POSTSEASON SHOWER NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Their champagne-stained duds haven't even
come back from the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   And already, the Texas Rangers are done. Flattened like
roadkill. Whisked from the American League playoffs as if they
never belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard during the year, for 181 days,'' said a
somber general manager Doug Melvin, ``and then the playoffs seem to
go by so fast. It just seemed like we didn't even have a chance to
enjoy the victories we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, though, we've just got to find a way not to play the
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea, if a team can get away with it. For the second
time in three seasons, the Rangers were chased from baseball's
postseason by a Yankees team that pitched better, hit better and,
maybe more than anything, handled the bright lights of the playoffs
better.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it appears to be hard to hit when you've got a
baseball-sized lump in your throat.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with three nights of capable, if not dazzling, pitching
of their own, the Rangers couldn't overcome their futilities with
the bat. They never adjusted to umpires' roving strike zones. They
never really grasped what Yankee pitchers were doing to get them
out.
</P>
<P>
   They waved at baiting pitches inches out of the strike zone. And
when Yankee pitchers made the rare mistake, the Rangers only fouled
it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just feels bad,'' club president Tom Schieffer said in a
silent Rangers clubhouse Friday night. ``We've got a good team. I
really thought we had a chance to beat the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we just couldn't get it done. It's a shame, but I feel
like we just didn't get a chance to enjoy the good season we had
for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the attitudes. When the Rangers clinched the American
League West on Sept. 25, a rowdy, champagne-hosing celebration
ensued. Their goal, dating to spring training, had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Melvin admitted, it might be time to up the ante.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a reputation as a team that's going to be in
the postseason just about every year, and then build on that,'' he
said. ``Atlanta, Cleveland _ they pretty well have that reputation,
and that's what we want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it gets disappointing to be here, to be in the playoffs,
and not move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Rangers appeared awed by playing the Yankees will remain
a mystery. Maybe it was the three-hour din that serenaded them at
historic Yankee Stadium. Maybe it was the anticipation of facing
big-name starters David Wells, Andy Pettitte and David Cone
back-to-back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said, ``it was
kind of weird, just the way things transpired, the way we were
dominated offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you can't really explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight being razor sharp, it would be easy to suggest, upon
further review, the Rangers would have been better off trying to
catch the Cleveland Indians in the final week and thus avoid the
Yankees in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   But this team had six months to pass the Indians. It responded
with inconsistency. While manager Johnny Oates preached the virtues
of maintaining a steady keel, the Rangers couldn't stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the fire in the team's belly seemed to come from
pitchers Todd Stottlemyre and Rick Helling, from the newcomer
Clayton and from the club's self-appointed sheriff, Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need more of it. They already have enough Eagle
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take this ballclub we have now from Day 1,'' said
Melvin, who wheeled the deals that brought Stottlemyre, Clayton,
Todd Zeile and Esteban Loaiza. ``There's no doubt we would have
been much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the remorse, management can't let what happened in
three nights against the Yankees sway the master plan. Two years
ago, when the Rangers bullpen couldn't slam the playoff door
against the Yanks, management made the decision its money would be
best spent on acquiring a closer. That's how John Wetteland became
a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, though, argued the money would be better spent on
trying to lure Texas-born starting pitcher Roger Clemens. The
Rangers, instead, went after Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go out after what happened here,'' Melvin agreed,
``and think that we have to trade pitching for hitting, or
something stupid like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The club won't overreact, Melvin promised.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he assured, it will learn from what happened here
during these three Yankee-dominated nights.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to wake up the Eagle Scouts. From here on, one
champagne shower will not be enough.

NO. 15 COLORADO FINALLY SUBDUES OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ When Colorado's Marcus Washington scored on an
interception return with roughly 10 minutes remaining Saturday, the
faint of heart among the home crowd recognized the cue.
</P>
<P>
   They were soon marching out of Memorial Stadium and heading down
the block toward O'Connell's, a renowned local oasis where postgame
sorrows can be properly washed away.
</P>
<P>
   They missed a great finish.
</P>
<P>
   Thundering improbably down the stretch, Oklahoma (2-2, 0-1)
nearly pinned 15th-ranked Colorado (5-0, 2-0) to the mat before
astonished remnants of the original audience of 71,217. Finally,
the Buffaloes survived a 27-25 scare.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the man who ignited it _ sophomore walk-on Patrick
Fletcher _ uttered an abject apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to apologize to my coaches and teammates,'' said
Fletcher, whose interception Washington carried 40 yards for a
27-12 Colorado lead with 10:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope,'' said Fletcher, choking back tears, ``that they
don't lose faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely. Exactly 61 seconds after the interception,
De'Mond Parker (26 carries, 134 yards) ripped off a 49-yard scoring
run, and the Sooners' deficit was cut to nine. It stayed there, as
an attempted two-point conversion failed.
</P>
<P>
   But Fletcher, who threw for 130 yards in 10 minutes, was soon
back. Colorado's Mike Moschetti (13-of-25 186 yards, one
interception), drove the Buffaloes to the Sooners' 2-yard line, but
was pressured by Ontei Jones and threw a weak ball toward the goal
line that was intercepted by OU's Corey Ivy at the 2.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing out of his end zone, Fletcher threw for a first down,
then found Jarrail Jackson for 42 yards. When that threat ended in
a missed field goal attempt, OU seemed doomed. But the Sooners got
the ball back at their 31 with 1:41 remaining, and cut it to 27-25
in 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher threw first to Parker for 49, then to tight end Jason
Freeman for 25 yards and the score.
</P>
<P>
   The extra-point kick left OU in position to pull of a miracle,
but Colorado covered the ensuing onside kick and ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the win,'' Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel
said. ``Unfortunately, it came with a price _ we lost (wide
receiver) Cedric Cormier for the year with an ACL (anterior
cruciate ligament) injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the game, we gave up some big plays because we ran out
of gas because of the humidity. Unfortunately, we were unable to
deliver that knockout punch when we had the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Buffaloes stretched their record to 7-0-1
against the Sooners since 1989, getting three touchdown passes from
Moschetti and 135 yards on the ground from Marlon Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   OU coach John Blake lamented ``the little things, like missed
field goals and extra points _ that's what beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners missed two field-goal attempts, and each team missed
a 35-yard extra-point kick after a celebration penalty. The
Buffaloes also attempted a fake punt in which punter Nick Pietsch
threw the ball when no one was looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called a fake punt, but they lined up in a fake punt
defense,'' Neuheisel said. ``We called off the play and everyone
got the call but the punter.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the afternoon, Fletcher said, ``I thought we were
going to win _ I just wish I hadn't thrown that (interception).''

STARS HOPING THEY CAN BREAK WINGS' TITLE HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This might indeed be the Wing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manger Bob Gainey said the task of taking down the
two-time Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings might be so tough
that no team _ even his super-charged roster _ can do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen this in the past where a team has won so
consistently and become so competitive that it took the entire
league to beat it. And I believe Detroit is that way,'' Gainey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that a team like Detroit, a repeat champion,
becomes such a target for every team, that it faces a higher level
of competition every night. And that can wear on a team over an
82-game season.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, though. With that season scheduled to
begin Saturday night against Buffalo, the Stars are leading the
NHL's push to clip the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   With Detroit going for the first three-peat since the New York
Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980-84 and the
Stars holding the best regular-season record in the NHL the past
two seasons, the Red Wings-Stars axis could decide the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cup could go through Detroit or Dallas or Colorado,''
Phoenix Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said. ``Dallas has
really improved a great deal in the last two years, so you have to
say they're right up there with \RDetroit\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor takes it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as last season was concerned, yeah, I think the winner
of our series with \RDetroit\S was going to win the Cup,'' he said.
``No disrespect toward Washington, but I think it came down to that
\RWestern Conference finals\S series and we both probably knew
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock maintains a healthy respect for the
Red Wings and said the secret to their success is one that any team
in the league can learn from and even imitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have, more than anything, is a great commitment to
one another and a great commitment to the organization and their
coach,'' Hitchcock said. ``You can see it in their team, especially
at times when the pressure is the highest, they turn inside and
find strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Wings forward Darren McCarty said that helped carry the team
through Stanley Cup hangover last season and should help Detroit as
they pursue a three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to question our team about whether we're going
to be hungry or going to want to play,'' McCarty said. ``We know
what it's like to win. We know what it's like not to win. We want
to keep this winning feeling going.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the league is hoping to find that same strength.
While the Stars have loaded their roster with free-agent talent,
others have taken one or two choice free agents in hopes of
bringing the right element into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers have been trying to put together their
puzzle since being swept by the Red Wings in the 1997 Finals. This
season, the Flyers have reunited goalie John Vanbiesbrouck with
coach Roger Nielsen in hopes of getting a consistent defensive
performance. If the Flyers can do that, and get consistent offense
from Eric Lindros and John LeClair, they may have greater strength
than the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Capitals have added veteran talent to a hot young
goalie in Olaf Kolzig in hopes of proving last season's run to the
Finals wasn't a fluke. The Colorado Avalanche is trying to piece
together its broken dynasty-to-be, hiring rookie NHL coach Bob
Hartley. The Chicago Blackhawks finally spent some money in
acquiring center Doug Gilmour \Rthree years, $18 million\S. The
Toronto Maple Leafs bought goalie Curtis Joseph. The New York
Rangers upped their salaries in the hopes of keeping together a
team that greatly underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there was improvement throughout the NHL and everyone
is trying to take down the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams have won one. Some outstanding teams have won two
in a row. Very few have won three,'' Red Wings captain Steve
Yzerman said. ``It's a difficult thing to do because everybody's
got to stay healthy, and pucks bounce a lot of strange ways. You
can't control everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have done everything they can to control those
bounces, from hiring sniper Brett Hull for three years at $17
million to buying tough guy Brent Severyn for $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to face them sooner or later as far, as I'm
concerned,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We're thinking
about what we need to do to beat them, whether we can get the home
ice. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and I don't even like
talking about them, but, yeah, we think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, players and management won't go so far as to say the
Stars have been built to beat the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not specifically,'' Gainey said. ``Our team has been a pretty
good team throughout two seasons, but we had areas that were
exposed in the playoffs. We dedicated our attention to those
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time to see if that ``dedication'' pays off.

A MEMORABLE OVERTIME VICTORY FOR COACH'S HOME DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fordham's first home game for its new head coach, Ken
O'Keefe, was a memorable one Saturday as it defeated Princeton,
20-17. The winning points were scored on a 38-yard field goal by
the obscure freshman kicker Brian Colsant that ended the Rams'
first possession in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-yard field goal by Colsant, his first such attempt for the
Rams, had tied the game with 1 minute 37 seconds remaining in the
fourth quarter. Princeton had outplayed Fordham, thanks to its
defense, through three quarters, and the Rams gained only 65 yards
in the first half. The Tiger defenders, led by end David Ferrara,
had sacked Fordham quarterback Steve O'Hare 10 times.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the overtime rules, each team takes turns attempting to
score beginning 25 yards from the goal line. The turns cease when
one team fails to match the other's score. Princeton's first turn,
after Colsant's second field goal, ended, as did the game, when
Fordham safety Jon Piela intercepted a pass by John Burnham, the
Tigers' quarterback.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the second overtime game for each team. Princeton (1-2)
lost at Lehigh, 31-24, and Fordham (2-2) lost at Towson, 35-34,
both last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's defeat was the sixth in a row for the Tigers on the
road. The victory was the first for Fordham over Princeton in their
nine-game series, which began in 1907. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burnham blamed himself for the loss, for giving up the
interception. Princeton's intent had been to stay with running
plays to set up its crack place-kicker, Alex Sierk, whose three
field goals had beaten Fordham last season, 9-7. Sierk was expected
to kick a tying field goal that would have extended the overtime
session. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said he saw Fordham change its defensive scheme from
man-to-man pass defense to zone, so he changed the play call, from
run to pass, a pass he thought he could complete. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake at the scrimmage line,'' said Steve Tosches, the
Princeton coach.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe was asked why he turned to freshman Colsant under such
trying conditions rather than staying with the more experienced Dan
Lofrese. ``We wanted to see what he could do,'' the coach said with
an impish smile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' defensive unit was outstanding, giving up only two
big plays: O'Hare's passes to wide receiver Gerry McDermott. The
first, for 24 yards, was for Fordham's first touchdown in the third
period, the second for 54 yards setting up its second touchdown,
which gave the Rams their first lead, 14-10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tiger linebacker Dan Swingos said: ``We dominated
them. I don't understand what happened, how we lost.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare's retort to that was that the Rams were resilient. He
said, ``It feels great to beat an Ivy League team.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Princeton had scored first, near the end of a sluggish first
half, when Burnham completed a 9-yard pass to wide receiver Danny
Brian with 7 seconds left. Burnham had missed on seven straight
pass attempts earlier. ``I was terrible,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sierk's field goal gave Princeton a 10-0 lead in the third
period, and then Fordham's offense came alive with the first big
pass play to McDermott. The Rams' 14-10 lead lasted for 10 minutes,
and then the Tigers took the lead on a 66-yard drive that ended
with Burnham's 8-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Crowley with 5:13
remaining.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare's pass of 33 yards to Robert Davis brought on Colsant,
the freshman kicker from Vacaville, Calif., and he coolly scored.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Ken O'Keefe had a 79-10-1 record at Allegheny College, a western
Pennsylvania Division III power. At Fordham he succeeded Nick
Quartaro, who left to become the offensive coordinator at Iowa
State. O'Keefe's staff inherited 14 starters from last year's team,
which won five games, the most for Fordham since joining the
Patriot League in 1989. ... Fordham has two more Ivy opponents
coming up, Penn at home and then Brown away. The Tigers' next foe
will be Brown on Saturday in the new Princeton Stadium.

BRUINS THRIVE ON PLAYING IT `SAFE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about misnomers. UCLA blocked two punts Saturday using what
assistant coach Nick Aliotti called a ``safe'' alignment.
</P>
<P>
   In scouring film, Aliotti noticed that Washington State's Kareem
Anderson took extra time punting when he did not sense a furious
rush. So, Aliotti figured, why not lull Anderson to sleep with a
passive alignment _ one giving the impression UCLA was setting up a
return _ and then charge hard?
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a safe rush, and he eased up,'' Aliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   DuVal Hicks blocked Anderson's punt in the second quarter, which
Jason Stephens recovered at the Wazu 6. On the ensuing play,
Jermaine Lewis gave the Bruins a 28-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Azziz blocked an Anderson punt in the third quarter, but the
Bruins failed to convert.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA officials believe it's the first time the Bruins have
blocked two punts in a game in at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Tod McBride's block at Houston, UCLA has blocked
three punts in its last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``McBride was all individual effort. Today, they were designed
blocks,'' Aliotti said. ``The only two times we (rushed hard), we
blocked them. It worked well.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically well.
</P>
<P>
   High flying: Saturday's most memorable play _ and a sure bet to
make national highlights _ was Cade McNown's 6-yard first-quarter
touchdown run, in which he hurdled Cougars linebacker Steve Gleason
at the goal line and landed squarely on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take it in,'' McNown said. ``They broke when I broke.
I had to take it over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Which didn't thrill his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those situations, everything's instinctive,'' Bob Toledo
said. ``He got an `A' in gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   Late night in Tucson: ABC announced it will carry the Arizona
State-Notre Dame game at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, pushing the
UCLA-Arizona kickoff to 7:15 p.m. on Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Starting outside linebacker Michael Wiley did not
play after suffering a sprained right ankle in warmups. In his
place, Santi Hall had four tackles and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Starting inside linebacker Ramogi Huma aggravated a right hip
injury in the first half. Ryan Nece filled in nicely, with eight
tackles and a forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA scored touchdowns on seven of nine trips inside the red
zone (Washington State's 20).
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sailer had his only field-goal attempt blocked, leaving
him without a successful field goal for the third consecutive game.
``He's mad because we keep scoring touchdowns,'' Toledo quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Do-everything linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo had two tackles, a
sack, a fumble recovery and a pass deflected. &QL;

   BOSTON _ With the Boston Red Sox, the past is always present. If
it's not Babe Ruth being dealt to the Yankees, it's Bucky Dent's
home run. If it's not why Jim Willoughby wasn't pitching, it's why
Denny Galehouse was.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after Saturday night's 2-1 loss to the Cleveland
Indians that eliminated the Red Sox in their American League
division series, it's why third-base coach Wendell Kim waved John
Valentin to keep running in the sixth inning, only to be thrown out
at the plate by left fielder David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 1-0 lead,'' Kim was saying in the gloom of the Red
Sox clubhouse. ``Justice was going to his right, and he's a
left-handed thrower. It was my decision. It didn't turn out. So
it's basically my fault.'
</P>
<P>
   Had Kim held up Valentin, the Red Sox would have had the bases
loaded with one out. Instead, with two out and runners on first and
third, left-hander Jim Poole struck out left-handed-hitting Troy
O'Leary to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Sox, who haven't won the World Series since 1918,
this was another sad scenario. Just as Friday's 4-3 loss had been
after Nomar Garciaparra's two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth.
Manny Ramirez's homer, his second of the game, minutes earlier off
Dennis Eckersley turned out to be the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the homer that beat us,'' Eckersley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Reggie Jackson's homer,'' somebody said.
</P>
<P>
   That somebody could have been almost anybody in what is known as
the Red Sox nation. In their haunting heritage, Red Sox fans aren't
just fans, they're historians. They'll never forget Bucky Dent's
homer in the 5-4 loss to the Yankees in their 1978 AL East one-game
playoff, but they also remember that Mr. October's homer off Bob
Stanley in the top of the eighth made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For all their rivalry, that 1978 playoff has been the only
Yankee-Red Sox postseason game in a history that has been hallowed
for the Yankees, haunted for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the possibility of a Yankee-Red Sox duel in this
year's AL Championship Series was so compelling. If it developed,
there would be at least four chances and maybe as many as seven for
another Bucky Dent moment for the Yankees or, finally, for a moment
the Red Sox could cherish.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Red Sox confronted by elimination in Saturday's
fourth game with the Indians, the past again intruded on the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, the Red Sox ace with a 19-7 record and the
winner of the series opener, offered to start on three days' rest
instead of his usual four.
</P>
<P>
   But Red Sox manager, Jimy Williams, preferred to start
left-hander Pete Schourek, who was an erratic 8-9 this season _ 1-3
with the Red Sox after being obtained on Aug. 6 from Houston, where
he had been 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek more than justified Williams' confidence, pitching five
and two-thirds shutout innings before Tom ``Flash'' Gordon, who
hadn't blown a save since April 14, gave up Justice's two-run
double in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice hit a fastball away; he's a good hitter,'' Gordon
said. ``I stayed consistent, fastballs in and out. I wouldn't
second-guess myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's scenario recalled the 1948 one-game pennant
playoff with the Indians when Joe McCarthy, then the Red Sox
manager, started Denny Galehouse, with an 8-7 record, instead of
the 15-game winner Mel Parnell or Ellis Kinder. The Red Sox lost,
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   And every Red Sox historian worth a bowl of New England clam
chowder remembered a somewhat similar situation in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Yankees took the first three games of that big
series here at Fenway in September,'' one of those Red Sox
historians recalled, ``Luis Tiant told Don Zimmer he could pitch
the fourth game on only three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, then the Red Sox manager and now Joe Torre's bench coach
on the Yankees, preferred to start 22-year-old left-hander Bobby
Sprowl, up from Pawtucket of the International League, who had lost
his debut five days earlier in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sprowl walked four of the first six Yankees, Zimmer
yanked him. The Yankees won, 7-4, and suddenly they were tied for
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, in the seventh game of the World Series,
Red Sox manager, Darrell Johnson, made another haunting decision.
In a 3-3 tie, Johnson used a pinch-hitter for Jim Willoughby, who
had blanked the Cincinnati Reds in the eighth inning, and called in
Jim Burton to open the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds scored one run, the Red Sox lost, 4-3. Ever since, Red
Sox historians have wondered, ``Why did he take out Willoughby?''
</P>
<P>
   And when ESPN suddenly showed a flashback of Bucky Dent's homer
during Friday's game, another of those Red Sox historians reacted
with a growl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anybody got a gun?'' the historian asked.
</P>
<P>
   The historian wasn't laughing, wasn't even smiling. With the Red
Sox, the past is always present.

ACTORS TAKING ACTION TO DRAW LINE AGAINST PHONY SIGNATURES

(Fixing date of Babe Ruth's death in 6th graf of 2nd take.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While Agent Mulder battles black ooze and alien
takeovers on ``The X-Files,'' actor David Duchovny has been filing
lawsuits in Los Angeles, trying to unravel what may be a real-life
conspiracy:
</P>
<P>
   Who or what is behind a mysterious plot to put fake signatures
on the actor's photos and sell them for $50 -- and can they be
stopped?
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the case could be decided at a hearing Monday, in
which a judge will consider an Internet autograph company's request
to throw out the actor's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the case survives the legal challenge, the issue
seems no more likely to disappear than controversies over Roswell
aliens and crop circles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Duchovny and enough stars to open a
Planet Hollywood -- including Arnold Schwarzenegger and former
``Lois and Clark'' star Dean Cain -- have sued mail-order and
Internet autograph distributors, claiming the signatures they sell
are forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local memorabilia stores are growing more skeptical
of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa autographs, telling customers that a
black-market baseball or a photo with the sluggers' signatures more
likely was signed by someone else's little brother in the family
rec room.
</P>
<P>
   In the autograph capital of the world, Los Angeles memorabilia
experts say there are plenty of legitimate products out there, but
warn celebrity junkies and sports fans to watch closely for
counterfeits, especially online and at trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can be very dangerous,'' said Richard Khoury, who
has been working closely with signatures for 20 years at Sports
Memorabilia Etc. in suburban Studio City. ``Ninety-five percent of
the people will be thrilled. They won't even know it's a fake until
they try and sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether his lawsuit has merit, Duchovny has plenty
of reason to be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Truly Unique Collectibles was selling his photo on the Internet
for $50 -- well below the asking price of other A-list stars such
as Sean Connery ($95) and Mel Gibson ($110).
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes has-beens and never-weres at
bargain-basement prices -- actors Scott Baio and Linda Lavin each
sell for $20. And there is a staggering number of obscure actors
from ``Star Trek'' and other sci-fi franchises -- $30 buys a signed
photo from Peter Mayhew, who howled his way to fame as Chewbacca in
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny was the first celebrity to challenge the autograph
merchants, suing a now-defunct mail-order company called CPG Direct
in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1996. He eventually won a $364,000
judgment against the company, said his lawyer, Farhad Novian.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Duchovny and Cain filed separate lawsuits
against Truly Unique in federal court, claiming it is run by the
same people who owned CPG.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Truly Unique vehemently deny the allegations and
include authentication papers for their signed photos in court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Truly Unique attorney Ronald Drescher said in court papers that
the company adheres to standard industry practice, randomly
selecting photos and using outside firms to check their
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Drescher filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuits that are
scheduled to be heard by U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Novian, who is also Cain's lawyer, said both stars ordered
photos from the companies they are suing and determined that they
are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cain and Mr. Duchovny looked at the signatures and
immediately knew they were signed by someone else's hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Novian said Duchovny filed the lawsuits to protect his fans and
protect his name. He advised viewers to write directly to the
actor's publicist for a signed photo, because he'll never be able
to sue all the companies suspected of selling fake memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Mr. Duchovny's resources, at $70 a pop he can't go
after everybody,'' the attorney said.

(Fixing date of Babe Ruth's death in 6th graf of this take: 1948
sted 1941.) Los Angeles: the attorney said.

<P>
   As for sports stars, Khoury describes Michael Jordan as though
he's Michelangelo, with a signature that is the celebrity autograph
equivalent of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leaves his own special trademarks,'' Khoury said, pointing
out the subtle way the star turns the ``M'' in his name into his
jersey number, 23. ``If you know the business, you know all of his
loops and slashes. It can't be copied.''
</P>
<P>
   While fellow NBA All-Stars Dennis Rodman, Patrick Ewing and
Charles Barkley have inconsistent scribbles for signatures that are
difficult to authenticate, Khoury said an experienced dealer can
spot a fake Jordan from 3-point distance.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury gets most of his inventory directly from sports figures
or orders from reputable companies such as Upper Deck
Authenticated, which has contracts with the stars and uses devices
such as holographic seals to prevent forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI estimates that as much as 75 percent of the $750
million-per-year sports memorabilia market involves fraudulent
products, although Khoury and others in the business said that
figure is too hard on the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Khoury said some of the forgeries he's seen are so obvious it's
funny. For example, Babe Ruth died in 1948, when athletes were
still using fountain pens or pencils to sign autographs. Khoury
recently was presented a Babe Ruth item that was signed with a
ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   Other fakes can even deceive an expert's careful eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some that come through look good; they look really good,''
Khoury said. ``I tell people, `If you're in doubt, just walk away
from it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Autograph dealer David Rodriguez has a stern warning for those
looking for a piece of history: If a strange guy walks up carrying
a stack of bats with McGwire's name on them, they're probably
phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much bad McGwire out there because his signatures
are in high demand and he's terrible about signing,'' Rodriguez
said. ``He doesn't do shows. He'll sign one autograph per kid at
the ballpark, and that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who sells sports and celebrity autographs on the
Internet, said he's 100 percent certain that his product is
legitimate. His screening process is simple: ``We do everything in
person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he has a group of ``kids,'' ages 16 to 24, who go
to award shows, movie premieres and personal appearances to get
photos autographed by the stars and sports figures themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The best about signing are John Travolta and Jackie Chan.
``Jackie's walked out on the street and signed a dozen autographs
to one kid and been really good about it,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst are Barbra Streisand, The Artist Formerly Known as
Prince and Marlon Brando. ``I think I've had one kid in 10 years
who got two Brandos, but he's been turned down 10 times,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some stars, such as Tom Cruise and Michael Jackson, have
offered autographs to keep signature hunters from tailing their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's limo driver will stop and say, `Quit following us
and he'll sign one piece each,' '' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he includes as many autographed photos as
possible on his World Wide Web site, at signatures.com, so buyers
can inspect his product for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like Khoury, Rodriguez said certificates of authenticity are
less important than knowing who you do business with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost meaningless,'' he said. ``These authenticators
don't necessarily know any more than the people out getting
autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Novian is also skeptical of authentication papers. And the
lawyer said he has become even more cynical about autographs than
he was when he filed Duchovny's first lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go by a memorabilia store in a mall, I wonder: Is
any of this legitimate?''

JUSTICE LEADS INDIANS BACK INTO ALCS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a while, it was tempting to nickname Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams, ``Jimy Genius.'' Williams' much-questioned
decision to start journeyman Pete Schourek over ace Pedro Martinez
in Boston's win-or-go-home Game 4 had gone that well.
</P>
<P>
   When the veteran left-hander finally departed to a standing
ovation in the sixth inning, he had pitched two-hit shutout
baseball and the Red Sox were leading the Cleveland Indians 1-0 and
seemingly headed back to Jacobs Field for a decisive Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But then something intervened. Long-suffering Red Sox Nation
fans no doubt will chalk it up to fate: This sort of thing has
happened before. But the more objective observer would attribute
the Indians' 2-1 victory to two bad decisions _ one by Williams and
one by his third base coach, Wendell Kim _ plus one big-time play
after another by Cleveland designated hitter-turned-left fielder
David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The first bad decision came in the Red Sox's half of the sixth
inning with Boston leading by a run. John Valentin, who had doubled
to open the inning, tried to score on a one-out single to left by
Mike Stanley. But Justice, who nearly threw out Valentin at second
on the double, nailed him at the plate with a perfect throw to
Sandy Alomar. Kim had sent him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was the right call,'' Williams said of Kim's
decision to send Valentin. ``John got a good break on the ball, but
David Justice just made a perfect throw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be aggressive on that play,'' Valentin agreed,
``because \RJustice\S hasn't been out in left field a lot.''
Justice spent most of the season as the Indians' designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The second questionable move, by Williams, was his decision to
bring in closer Tom Gordon at the beginning of the eighth inning.
Gordon usally comes in to pitch the ninth inning and tries to get
three outs. This was going to be a stretch. Also, he was replacing
middle man Derek Lowe, who had easily retired five consecutive
Cleveland hitters in relief of Schourek and appeared unchallenged
by Indians batters.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon promptly gave up one-out singles to Kenny Lofton and Omar
Vizquel, then surrendered a monster double to center field by
Justice, which drove home both runners giving the Indians their
margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right man in the right spot,'' Williams said of his
early call for Gordon. ``He was a fresh arm and Lowe had done his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it was the Indians who did a job on the Red
Sox. For the second time in four years, Cleveland had eliminated
Boston in division series play.
</P>
<P>
   Justice did most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything you can ask him to do,'' said Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove. ``He made the throw to home plate to throw
out Valentin to prevent a two-run lead, then he came back two
innings later and hit the two-run double to give us the lead. He
showed you why David Justice is David Justice. He is able to do
things like that because he is a tremendous athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice said he wasn't surprised to see Valentin challenging his
arm, calling the Red Sox ``an aggressive club.'' He also wasn't
surprised to see Gordon enter early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great stuff. He's only showing that he's human,''
Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice reveled in his moment, which included a champagne shower
in the cramped visitors' clubhouse in the bowels of Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the fact that we are moving on'' to the American
League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, he said.
``So many good players who have played this game never got
champagne poured over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Justice, a world champion with Atlanta in 1995,
felt the spray of Verdi Spumante again.

COLUMBIA MAKES A LITTLE HISTORY OUT WEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAGA, Calif. _ When freshman tailback Jonathan Reese crossed
the goal line for Columbia's first score Saturday afternoon against
St. Mary's early in the second quarter, he displayed the jubilation
to be expected of a player scoring his first collegiate touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The play _ a 15-yard screen pass from reserve quarterback Ted
Schroeder with 8 minutes 55 seconds left in the first half _ was
also a historic one, of sorts, in the Lions' 20-17 victory. It was
Columbia's first score on the West Coast since halfback Al Barabas
ran for a touchdown on the deception play that victimized Stanford
in the 1934 Rose Bowl, a stunning 7-0 upset victory for the Lions.
Of course, Saturday's contest against St. Mary's was also
Columbia's first game in the Pacific time zone since that New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a limited athletic budget that is the norm in the Ivy
League, Columbia's football team had not ventured west of the
Mississippi River since that bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a long away trip,'' deadpanned Ray Tellier,
Columbia's head coach. ``Instead of getting on a bus for five and a
half hours, we got on a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Columbia (2-1) made its return engagement to
California a successful one as junior tailback Kirby Mack bulldozed
into the end zone from a yard out with 15 seconds to go to give the
Lions a dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's had taken the lead on a 47-yard touchdown pass from
reserve quarterback Joe Lilley to wide receiver Bruce Rhode with
6:04 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Columbia's last hope had faded with 3:40 to go
when Schroeder's fourth-down pass from the St. Mary's 37-yard line
fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   But on the following series, St. Mary's (0-5) elected to make a
quick kick on third and 17 from its 30-yard line. Lilley's mediocre
punt gave the Lions possession of the ball at their 47-yard line
with 2:37 left. A 15-yard personal foul penalty on St. Mary's
linebacker Danny Wilcox for hitting a scrambling Schroeder out of
bounds moved the ball to the 18. Five plays later, with the 4,967
fans in St. Mary's Stadium on their feet, Mack hit paydirt on third
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of a good call is one that works,'' said Mike
Rasmussen, St. Mary's head coach, referring to the decision to make
a quick kick. ``It's my responsibility, and in hindsight, I wish I
had it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilley said: ``There's no excuse. I just missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia generated 317 yards of total offense despite losing its
starting quarterback, Paris Childress, early in the second quarter
with a severely sprained right foot. Schroeder directed a
ball-control offense that produced 179 yards rushing and two
fourth-quarter touchdowns, both by Mack. The first one came on a
3-yard run with 9:44 to go that gave Columbia a 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although they moved the ball well, the Lions were unable to
generate any scoring in the first half aside from Reese's
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's scored just before halftime on a 5-yard pass from the
junior quarterback Chad Thomas to the senior flanker Marc Kleiman.
That play capped a 12-play, 90-yard drive and gave St. Mary's a 7-6
lead.

RAZORBACKS STUMBLE ONTO THE RIGHT NUTT FOR THE JOB

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Sometimes, the best hires are the ones you
don't make.
</P>
<P>
   When searching for its fifth coach of the decade, a coach to
restore some glory and glitter to a stumbling program, Arkansas set
its sights on Mississippi's Tommy Tuberville, Tulane's Tommy
Bowden, Southern Mississippi's Jeff Bower and Florida assistant
Bobby Stoops. Tuberville was the favorite, who waffled when the
search committee couldn't agree on an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Nutt, a native son with limited head coaching experience
(Division I-AA Murray State and Boise State), said he wanted the
job. He waited patiently for two days while Razorbacks fans spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Frank Broyles had trouble making phone calls;
there were too many incoming calls, the majority demanding that
they wanted a Nutt for a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night here in War Memorial Stadium, the No. 22
Razorbacks went to 4-0 with a scintillating 27-20 victory against
Kentucky. In the second half, Arkansas' defense made the big plays,
and junior quarterback Clint Stoerner snapped out of his trance to
outduel Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, this team would have rolled it up and took it on
home,'' Arkansas defensive back Jeromy Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt and his assistants made all the right moves in the second
half. They increased the pressure on Couch and they used Kentucky's
aggressiveness to isolate receivers in one-on-one situations.
</P>
<P>
   And all those Razorbacks who swamped the school with calls,
faxes and e-mails are smugly saying, ``We told you so.'' The
critics thought that Nutt and his staff were too small-time, too
young, too overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas trailed 20-7 with 9:35 left in the third quarter and
was being worn out by Couch and the Wildcats' Air Raid. All the
Razorbacks did was go on a Nolan Richardson-like, 24 Minutes of
Hell 20-point run.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks ``held'' Couch to 499 yards passing. Couch was
47-of-67. His only interception, though, turned the game around.
Junior David Barrett's pick and 62-yard return set up Arkansas'
game-tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Anthony Lucas scored that touchdown by fighting
his way through three defenders to reach the end zone. He played
much of the game with his injured right wrist heavily taped.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas admits that when Nutt was named the coach, his reaction
was, ``Say what?'' Running back Madre Hill said that at the first
team meeting, Nutt won the Razorbacks over with an enthusiastic
rendering of the school fight song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Nutt has come in here and preached to us about playing
as a family, playing together,'' Barrett said. ``And we've got
nowhere to go but up. Winning a game like this does nothing but
prove to us that this does work.''
</P>
<P>
   While favorite son Bill Clinton is playing prevent defense in
Washington, Houston Nutt, the people's choice for football coach,
is reviving the Razorbacks. The past three weeks, the Razorbacks
have exorcised their SMU demon, drubbed Alabama and rallied to beat
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kept hanging in there, hanging in there,'' said the
40-year-old Nutt, whose brother Dennis is a former TCU basketball
standout. ``I just love this team, love what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this team is growing and coming together because
this team is overcoming adversity. They're learning to trust each
other and play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Southwest Conference, Arkansas football has
faced an uphill battle in the Southeastern Conference. Nutt's
enthusiasm and drive is reducing the incline considerably.

GALAXY EXPECTS TO FEEL BURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Careful not to read too much into its destruction of
the Dallas Burn in Thursday's Western Conference semifinal opener,
the Galaxy head to the Cotton Bowl this afternoon with little of
the bravado one might expect.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is coming off a 6-1 romp in the first game of the
best-of-three series, but the team knows a second win, which would
put it one step from Major League Soccer's championship game, won't
come nearly so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to remember this,'' Galaxy midfielder Danny Pena
said after scoring twice at the Rose Bowl. ``No team likes to be
beaten, whether it's 1-0 or 6-1. I expect they'll come out fired
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been embarrassed,'' added defender Robin Fraser. ``We
expect them to come hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of maybe two chances the Burn has to extend the series
to a third game Wednesday in Pasadena. The other is to sit back,
play tight defense and try to steal a goal on a counterattack.
Those tactics worked a year ago, when the Burn swept L.A. in a
first-round series with two shutouts, but it didn't count for much
Thursday, the Galaxy shredding Dallas' defense for a 3-0 lead by
the 20th minute, then pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been through this,'' Burn coach Dave Dir said.
``This is the kind of season we have had. This team has come
through a lot of adversity, and this is only one game.... We'll
come to play Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Dallas fell victim to a Galaxy swarm that dictated
terms everywhere on the field. L.A. moved the ball like magicians,
creating opportunities at will, and with its midfield of Pena,
Mauricio Cienfuegos and Martin Machon in particular in superb form,
it cut down nearly every Dallas foray before it started.
</P>
<P>
   ``An abysmal performance from start to finish,'' assessed Burn
goalkeeper Mark Dodd. ``We really owe the Dallas fans an enormous
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the Galaxy's most impressive performances in what
has been a pretty incredible season. It was the eighth time the
Galaxy scored at least five goals in a match, and eight MLS playoff
records _ including goals and margin of victory _ fell before it
was through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first half of soccer,'' in which L.A. grabbed a 5-0 edge,
``was the best in MLS, I think,'' said Galaxy captain Dan
Calichman.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been the biggest story of the win, seeing an
unscheduled 13{ minutes of action, his first since suffering a
broken leg May 6. He doesn't anticipate another playoff appearance
_ he's not nearly 100 percent yet _ and coach Octavio Zambrano
isn't about to throw him in unless his squad is enjoying another
rout.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something anyone expects.
</P>
<P>
   Says Fraser: ``There's no way it'll happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Dallas) would be dangerous,'' said Zambrano. ``We
have to go there as if (the first game) never happened and take
care of business. They're still a dangerous team, a good team, and
we won't take them lightly.''

STRAWBERRY'S BUDDY STILL THERE FOR HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looks 20 years older now than he did in 1992, the season
Darryl Strawberry's career began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   But in the chaos of that 99-loss Dodgers season there was one
big boost he got that will help him through the next few months of
his battle to overcome colon cancer. Eric Davis.
</P>
<P>
   That year Strawberry ruptured a disk in his lower back that
robbed him of the majestic home run swing that made him a certain
Hall of Famer. He continued to struggle with the pressures of
playing in his home town, saying yes to every old crony who knew
him from way back when.
</P>
<P>
   It began a spiral downward that included drugs, a failed first
marriage, domestic violence and trouble with the IRS. One of the
only things that kept him from losing it all was Davis, who
Strawberry knew growing up in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They were buddies, one of those baseball friendships that pass
like a notice on the transaction wire. Strawberry might have been
the greatest high school prospect ever when he graduated from
Crenshaw High in 1980. Davis was a shortstop from Fremont who got a
tryout at Dodger Stadium but never was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   They never played together until 1992. Strawberry had gone on to
stardom with the New York Mets, and Davis, the Cincinnati Reds.
Davis, who had fought his own demons playing for Marge Schott,
became the quiet presence that was always there when things got a
little too hot for Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 season began with great promise, the addition of Davis
to the Dodgers outfield of Strawberry and Brett Butler. In the next
six years, all three would be stricken with cancer. But in that
spring of 1992, the possibilities seemed endless.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was coming off a turbulent first year in Los Angeles.
He had signed as a free agent in December 1990 for a whopping
$20.25 million. In 1991, Strawberry started sluggishly, but the
Dodgers took off, leading Atlanta at the All-Star break by eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Strawberry carried the team with 63 of his
99 RBI, but the Dodgers fell apart, losing to the Braves on the
second to last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1992, Strawberry ruptured a disk in his lower back
rounding the bases in Philadelphia. Davis had a ruptured disk in
his neck from previous seasons in Cincinnati. As Strawberry
attempted rehab, he fell back into bad habits with alcohol and
drugs. He became isolated from his teammates. Strawberry and Davis
had adjoining lockers and retreated into their own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates looked at the two and blamed them for the team's
decline. It only made their friendship stronger. Strawberry and
Davis once invited Rodney King to Dodger Stadium. That drew the
wrath of the LAPD and the two were told not to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was the collapse of 1992 was a result of the
late-season breakdown of 1991. If Mike Piazza had not arrived the
next season, it might have been quite a while longer before the
Dodgers started to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry and Davis ended their Dodgers careers the next year.
Both bounced around. But they stayed in touch. Davis, now with the
Baltimore Orioles, learned he had colon cancer in June 1997 and
came back with a season that should earn him American League
Comeback Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors seem to think Strawberry also will play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was nothing he did,'' Davis told reporters after
the Strawberry story broke. ``I told him that it's nothing that
anybody can control. I couldn't. He can't. I told him not to think,
`Why me?' That's just a waste of time. He's got to face it, accept
it, deal with it. The next step isn't feeling sorry for yourself,
it's getting this thing out of your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Better win now: The Padres have four top players who will become
eligible for free agency once their contracts expire at the end of
the season: 1B Wally Joyner, 3B Ken Caminiti, CF Steve Finley and
RH Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who'll turn 36 next April, has been hobbled by a
succession of injuries over the last few years and probably will be
allowed to walk to make room for former Angel George Arias, 26, who
batted .308 with 36 homers and a Pacific Coast League-high 119 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who'll turn 34 in March, still is great defensively but
tailed off offensively this season (.249 average, 14 HR, 67 RBI, 12
SB) after going .261 with 28 homers, 92 RBI and 15 steals in 1997,
when he batted mostly leadoff and scored over 100 runs for the
third year in a row. This year, he scored 91. The Padres have no
one to replace him and are expected to try to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner, 36, suffered several injuries this season but still
batted .298 with 12 homers and 80 RBI in only 439 at-bats. Again,
he proved to be a lifesaver defensively. The Padres have no
comparable first-base replacement and hope to re-sign Joyner at a
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who turns 34 in March, struck out 16 Astros on Tuesday in
the first game of the division playoffs and came back Saturday to
pitch on just three days of rest. He went 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA
during the regular season and made everyone around him better. The
Padres say they have to re-sign him to keep alive hopes of a new
stadium, but he's talking about $12 million a season in a
multi-year deal, way over the team's head.
</P>
<P>
   Nice run falls short: The Giants got rid of Rod Beck last year
because he faltered down the stretch and was rescued by Roberto
Hernandez. They replaced him with Robb Nen, who was 6-1 with 25
saves and a 0.98 ERA in the first half. But Nen was 1-6 with 15
saves in the second half, giving up the Neifi Perez homer Sunday
that deprived the Giants of the wild card. Beck, meanwhile,
finished with a career-high 51 saves, including one Monday in the
playoff clincher against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Robb when we were up there and he said his arm was
dead,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said. ``He said it was dragging on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the Giants' season, second baseman Jeff Kent was
the key element. The Giants were 77-57 with him in the lineup and
12-17 without him, including seven pivotal games with the
division-champion Padres in July. The Giants lost six of them,
dropping from a tie to 5{ games behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fell shy of their goal for two million in attendance,
finishing with 1,925,634, and club president Peter Magowan
indicated the club again will lose money _ perhaps as much as $15
million _ this season, meaning the 1999 payroll will remain in the
$40 million range, as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be $80 million,'' Magowan assured. ``My guess is it
will be where it ended up.'' More than half of that will go to four
players: Barry Bonds ($9.7 million), Kent ($5.7 million), Nen ($5
million) and Kirk Rueter ($2.75 million). The club also is likely
to pick up the options on J.T. Snow ($3 million), Charlie Hayes
($1.7 million) and Julian Tavarez ($1.2 million), for a total of
$29 million for seven players.
</P>
<P>
   That means cost-cutting is in order for the remaining 18 spots
on the roster, especially if a name free-agent pitcher or
outfielder is signed. Pitching is the top priority, according to GM
Brian Sabean, who says: ``I'm a firm believer that you never have
enough pitching. But we still had 89 victories without a No. 1 or a
No. 2 pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser (11-10) may not be kept after winning but once
the final six weeks. If he stays, he gets $3.2 million. If not,
it's a $200,000 buyout. ``No decisions have been made,'' Sabean
said. ``We will begin our organizational meetings and go over
everything. There are a lot of things to discuss.'' Injured Osvaldo
Fernandez will be bought out for $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation for next year: Shawn Estes, Kirk Rueter, Mark
Gardner and Russ Ortiz. Starting pitching collapsed in the second
half. After going 37-25 prior to the break, the rotation was a
horrible 22-26 over the final 2{ months. Minus Gardner, it was a
woeful 16-24.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion review: Arizona CF Devon White had 22 homers, 22
stolen bases and 85 RBI, but he is a free agent and will almost
certainly test the market. White makes his home in the Phoenix area
and wants to stay, but the Diamondbacks will offer him only a
one-year deal, or perhaps a deal with a year and an option based on
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   They hope LF Bernard Gilkey's laser eye surgery will improve his
vision enough that he can become the Gilkey of 1996 _ 27 homers and
117 RBI with the New York Mets. He had one extra-base hit, a homer,
in 101 at-bats with the D'backs after being acquired at the trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   As for free agents, Bernie Williams won't be coming despite
agent Scott Boras' strong relationship with owner Jerry Colangelo.
Same for Kevin Brown. Both want salaries in the $11-12 million
range. Randy Johnson has roots in the Phoenix area and Colangelo
might try to get him under market value, a strategy that has lately
worked with his Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza will not play where he will be naked in the lineup.
Finley will draw some attention. The big-money guys will not come
here. The D'backs are not going to spend a lot for a guy who will
take them to .500.
</P>
<P>
   News and notes: Cleveland's Charles Nagy raised his career mark
to 5-0 with a 1.27 ERA at Fenway Park on Friday when he defeated
the Boston Red Sox 4-3. He needed just 88 pitches in eight innings
to raise his overall record to 8-1 vs. Boston.... Toronto's Carlos
Delgado can expect a huge pay raise after hitting 38 homers and
driving in 115 runs. He is arbitration eligible and the Jays will
surely try to lock him up for four or five years at $5-$6 million a
year.... Teammate Shawn Green might be one of baseball's biggest
bargains next year. With 35 homers and 100 RBI in his first year as
an everyday player, Green already is signed through 1999 for $1.475
million.... Philadelphia right-hander Mark Leiter pulled off a rare
feat for futility, leading the majors in losses one year (17 in
1997) and blown saves (12 this season) the next. Like his brother
Al, who won 17 games with a 2.40 ERA for the Mets, Leiter is a free
agent. That's where the comparisons end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
Who was the NL RBI leader in the second half? Sammy Sosa with 77?
Mark McGwire? It was the Giants' Jeff Kent, who had 24 homers and
79 RBI after the All-Star break. Kent, who missed 28 games with an
injured right knee, finished with 31 homers and 128 RBI, joining
Rogers Hornsby as the only second baseman in history with at least
120 RBI in consecutive years. &QL; 
ROTISSERIE WATCH &QL; 
Pittsburgh second baseman Tony Womack has won two straight stolen
base titles but could be traded, especially with prospect Warren
Morris on the horizon. The Pirates are unhappy with his low on-base
percentage and shaky defense. Womack, however, is not yet eligible
for arbitration, critical for the cost-conscious Bucs. He also
started in center for the final five games of the season and could
wind up there if he's back next season. &QL; 
STAT OF THE WEEK &QL; 
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez went 5 for 10 with three homers in the
first three games of the American League Division Series against
Boston. In the last 12 games of the regular season, Ramirez had
eight homers and 17 RBI. The eight homers came in a five-game
stretch, which was followed by a 4-for-26 slump to end the season. &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
Again this year, one of the most popular players for offseason
trade talks will be Paul Konerko, the guy the Dodgers wouldn't give
up for closer Robb Nen last winter but did trade for Jeff Shaw at
the All-Star break. A bust at the plate this year, but still just
22. The Reds realize he can only play first but are committed to
Sean Casey. Might try left, but Dmitri Young batted .312 with 14
homers and 48 doubles. Could go to Arizona, but Travis Lee will
stay at first. &QL; 
QUOTABLE &QL; 
``Me and Darryl, we just knew we were going to have everything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Eric Davis, childhood friend and former teammate of Darryl
Strawberry, who like Strawberry has undergone surgery for colon
cancer.

GROWING UP IS TOP PRIORITY FOR ROENICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The poster boy has warts.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Roenick can admit it now. He finally can come clean. Even
if his legion of adoring fans isn't ready to hear it or believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is I was not being the type of person I
should have been,'' the Coyotes superstar center said. ``I was
screwing up in a lot of ways, and every part of me suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy to acknowledge one's faults. It isn't always
easy to say you're sorry, either. But during a lengthy interview
after a recent practice in Scottsdale, Ariz. Roenick did a lot of
both, offering a rare, critical look at his hockey career and his
personal life _ and his desire to turn each of them around.
</P>
<P>
   He revealed he spent most of his nine seasons in the NHL not
caring so much about winning, but rather scoring goals and making
money. He talked about how he became preoccupied with his image and
how others perceived him. He also said he spread himself so thin,
caddying to a litany of acquaintances and selfish schedules, that
he nearly lost his family.
</P>
<P>
   Reality finally reached up and smacked him in the face this
summer. He made amends with his wife, Tracey, their two children,
and then the 28-year-old made a promise to himself _ ``It's time
for me to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely let myself decrease to someone I should not have
been,'' Roenick said. ``I spent most of my time playing golf, going
out and having fun, always doing stuff the easy way. I was doing
all that _ and other things _ instead of being dedicated to the
things that are important and working hard at things that are
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to think about my wife caring if I'm going to be
here or there because she was my wife. But it just builds up,
builds up and . . . I just got caught up in the big trap of letting
too many people into my life and taking the easy way out of a lot
of things and not working hard enough at being a dad, at being a
husband and at being the hockey player that everybody expects me to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't make such a transformation overnight. It takes
commitment. It takes willpower. It takes dedication. None of which
Roenick said he exactly has excelled at throughout his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it for my own benefit,'' he said. ``I went
through a lot in the last year, professionally and personally, and
to tell you the truth, I'm trying to get my life back. I'm hoping
with those things being straightened out, it helps me
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already, there aren't as many distractions. I can focus on
playing hockey. And I can focus on the most important thing, and
that's my family. The other (expletive) doesn't matter. It's all my
business.''
</P>
<P>
   On the hockey front, things seem to be shaping up nicely for the
three-time 100-point scorer and two-time 50-goal man. Coyotes Coach
Jim Schoenfeld said he plans to pair Roenick on the same forward
line with left wing Keith Tkachuk, the team's leading scorer each
of the past three seasons. It could be a dynamite 1-2 scoring
punch, every bit as dangerous as the Philadelphia duo of Eric
Lindros and John LeClair, or the pair in Anaheim of Paul Kariya and
Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really going to try and make it work,'' Schoenfeld said
last week. ``I've got a hunch it's going to go well.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been constant speculation Tkachuk and Roenick can't
play together because both always want the puck. Some claim
Roenick's free-wheeling, one-on-one style isn't conducive to a
north-and-south skater like the power forward Tkachuk. Supposedly,
it's a complete mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Tkachuk said, ``we're going to have to alter our
games a little for it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick seems up to the task. He's changed just about everything
else in his life, lately. What can be so hard about playing a
little bit more under control? It's got to be easier than trying to
live up to his flamboyant personality, which he says makes him feel
``like a cartoon character'' at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think definitely my flamboyance is going to decrease a
little bit, anyway, because I want people to realize I am a team
guy and I only want what's best for the Phoenix Coyotes,'' he said.
``What's important to me is that my teammates know I'm dedicated to
them and I'm dedicated to winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always the case in the past.
</P>
<P>
   When he was flying down the ice for the Chicago Blackhawks, he
was more concerned with just trying to make a name for himself.
Winning, he said, was an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time in my career when I just cared about scoring
goals, scoring points and making money. I admit it,'' Roenick said.
``That's part of being immature and being a young player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the trap of professional sports, Roenick said. If you're
good at it, you get paid a king's ransom _ he's in the third year
of a five-year contract worth $20 million. Most athletes aren't
mature enough to handle the distractions that follow suit. They
feast on the perks but choke on the hangers-on who elbow in to
share some of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding he needed to make a change at home, Roenick
decided he'd better make one on the ice, too. For the first time in
his career, he spent all summer working out and getting in shape.
He took his family to southern California, rented a condo for a
couple months, and hit the weights daily with a group of other NHL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the biggest change I've seen in him since I've
known him,'' said teammate Oleg Tverdovsky, one of several Phoenix
players who trained with Roenick. ``He really worked his butt
off.''
</P>
<P>
   He got bigger and a lot stronger, which should make him all the
more dangerous when the 1998-99 season opens in another week. He
gained a solid six pounds of muscle, bringing him to 192 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was proud of me that I was making a commitment to
myself and my future,'' Roenick said. ``Plus, we got away from our
element. We had no distractions. We had very few people that
bothered us out there. It was just our family, and it was a great
month and a half or so of hard work and fun.

   ``I never did anything like that before. I've always had a lot
of natural talent, which probably was God-given, but I just used to
take it for granted, like a lot of things in my life. . . . It's
time for me to grow up.'' &QL; 
He desperately wants to return to form on the rink, when he
annually ranked among the NHL's scoring leaders. He doesn't want to
dwell on how his numbers have dropped, from 32 goals and 67 points
in 1995-96, to 29 and 69 in 1996-97, and to 24 and 56 last season.
</P>
<P>
   He just wants to come back this year with a bang. &QL;

AUNTIE MAME, A HORSE FOR A COURSE, WINS 5TH AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ For horses that like certain courses, consider
the filly Auntie Mame: She ran for the fifth time on the Belmont
Park grass Saturday, and for the fifth time she outran everybody
else, winning the $400,000 Flower Bowl Invitational by one length
and keeping her hometown winning streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old daughter of Theatrical won two straight this
summer before running third last month after a troubled trip in the
Diana Handicap at Saratoga. Auntie Mame was outrun that day by
Memories of Silver, who skipped Saturday's race, and B.A.
Valentine, who did not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, B.A. Valentine took the lead Saturday and held it to
the top of the homestretch. But then Auntie Mame, the queen of
Belmont, who had been stalking the pace every step of the way,
swept past the leader and made it five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really proved herself out there,'' said Angel Penna Jr.,
who trains Auntie Mame for Martha Gerry and her Lazy F Ranch. ``We
had a horrible trip in the Diana last time. But she proved today
that when she gets the chance to move, she'll win. With B.A.
Valentine in the race, we knew that we'd sit a stalking trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But Penna added that he probably would not press his luck in the
Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on Nov. 7 against some of the
world's best male runners. He said he would give ``a little
consideration'' to it but was more likely to run Auntie Mame in the
Matriarch or the Japan Cup on Nov. 29. The Breeders' Cup will add a
turf race for fillies next year, but by then Auntie Mame will be
retired to a new career as a broodmare.
</P>
<P>
   B.A. Valentine, who entered the race after Memories of Silver
bowed out, finished one length in front of Bahr, with Yokama fourth
and the favorite, Maxzene, fifth and last. The winner ran the mile
and a quarter on the inner turf course in 1:59 1/5, paid $5.90 for
a $2 bet to win and went home with $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skiffington, who trains Maxzene, reasoned that his beaten
favorite had raced only two weeks earlier in the Violet Handicap in
the Meadowlands, and added: ``This is the first time she's ever run
a bad race. I'm just kind of shocked. Throughout her career, she
has overcome everything that has been thrown at her.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   In a driving four-horse photo finish, Draw Shot won the Ashley
T. Cole Handicap by a neck over Abenaki, who had a neck on
Bellingham, who held off Plato's Love by a head for third. The
winner, trained by Angel Penna Jr., ran the mile in 1:33 2/5 on the
Belmont turf course, paid $4.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned
$34,000 under a smooth ride by Jerry Bailey. ``This horse runs best
when he comes with one sustained rally, and that's what he did,''
Bailey said. ... Pacificbounty, who stumbled and fell during a
workout on June 19 and caused Skip Away to unseat his jockey and
break loose, will again cross paths with Skip Away, the 5-year-old
superstar, next Saturday in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup.
Pacificbounty was not injured in the incident.

HALL SEEKS REDEMPTION WHILE CHALLENGING SWIMMING POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The heat gauge on the 1970 Chevy Nova indicated the
28-year-old engine was about to boil. Gary Hall, Jr., decided to
have a look. He pulled over and popped the hood.
</P>
<P>
   The old cooling system erupted into Hall's face and onto his
right arm like a worn-out pressure cooker. The boiling coolant
missed his eyes, but left him blistered with second-degree burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look like a Nordic explorer with a severe case of frost
bite,'' said Hall, who spent Tuesday night at Scottsdale Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's accident is just the latest in the turbulent waters
that have surrounded Hall, a Phoenix swimmer who won two gold and
two silver medals at the 1996 Olympics. A lot has blown up in his
face since.
</P>
<P>
   He blames himself for some of it. A suspension for a positive
marijuana test in May was lifted by swimming's international
governing body, FINA, in August, because of confusing rules about
drugs and inconsistency within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hall admits there would never have been a problem
had he not used pot in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm incredibly embarrassed that it happened,'' said Hall, who
paid with the loss of a lucrative endorsement deal with Speedo.
``It was a mistake. If you involve yourself in that type of
activity, sooner or later something bad is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   From the bad, Hall forsees change.
</P>
<P>
   In himself.
</P>
<P>
   And within his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, the first is a personal quest for vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely have incentive,'' said Hall, a Phoenix Swim Club
sprinter who had been training at the University of California
before returning home nine days ago for his 24th birthday. ``I feel
I need to redeem myself and my abilities. I don't want to be
remembered as the swimmer who got busted and that was the end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is part of his motivation. Hall is not happy with FINA's
methods and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming is being torn apart by performance-enhancing chemicals
such as steroids, yet, Hall argues, he was busted amid
international publicity for a drug that has no impact on
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I've never cheated in the sport,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether FINA used Hall in a public relations
attempt at saying it was active in the battle against drugs. But
what drugs?
</P>
<P>
   At the time of FINA's announced suspension of Hall, Phil
Whitten, editor of the Valley-based ``Swimming World,'' said the
sport should be more vigilant about performance-enhanching
substances than marijuana, or alcohol or over-the-counter medicine
for sinus problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that probably will be addressed at the Olympic
Congress, scheduled to begin next weekend in Phoenix. Hall says
he's willing to be the point man in a battle to tighten and
re-focus FINA's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role that could turn Hall into an unlikely ally for
impatient officials with United States Swimming, which often has
been infuriated by his off-beat, go-it-alone style that includes a
less-than diligent work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of awkward,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hall has mocked U.S. Swimming in both word and
deed. The sport is trying to shake its country-club reputation. But
the sight of Hall in leather motorcycle pants behind the starting
blocks at major meets is more than some of the tradition-bound
officials can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Hall went from being a subject of criticism to a real target at
the World Championships last January in Perth, Australia. U.S.
Swimming convened a disciplinary hearing on Hall for a variety of
what it regarded as offenses, all of which Whitten calls petty.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with a curfew violation. But Hall said he signed
the required check-out sheet.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a social function with dignitaries from the Australian
Olympic Committee for the 2000 Sydney Games. Hall said he was ill
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He also was charged with wearing a wig for the official team
photo. He admits to the wig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wearing the wig practically everyday I was down there,''
said Hall, who anchored two U.S. relays, one for a gold medal and
one for a silver, at the World Championships. ``It wasn't like it
just for the photo. I was having some fun, just being myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no law saying I can't wear a wig. Andy Warhol wore
one. Marv Albert, he wears one.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Swimming has not commented on the hearing. Hall believes it
is about to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, there are mounting signs that Hall has friends
within the organization. Even if he is disliked personally, his
talent is singular. Despite FINA's suspension and an inconsistent
year, Hall still has the world's fourth-fastest time in the 50
meters freestyle for 1998. He's eighth in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   At a U.S. Swimming convention last month, 1996 Olympic teammate
Josh Davis took the podium and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Gary Hall, Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, coaches continue to see him as America's only
legitimate threat in 2000 to Russia's powerful Alexander Popov, a
bitter rival who narrowly beat Hall in the 50 and 100 at the last
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take more than a car explosion to keep me from
doing that,'' he said. &QL;

WAKE US WHEN LOCKOUT'S OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Another day, another sport, another spat involving
money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and lockouts. Union heads and arbitrators. Billionaires
and millionaires feuding over the interpretation of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Rich men haggling with rich kids over how to divide the great
cash pie.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a surprise we don't give a damn anymore?
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA has reached the crossroads. If the current lockout
lingers a few days longer, the season will be delayed. A 52-year
streak will come to an end. They will no longer be the only major
sports league in America not to lose a game due to a labor dispute.
They will be like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric is getting worse, not better. The NBA wants to meet
now, to see if an agreement can get hammered out, to protect the
legacy of the league that never stops. The players' union, waiting
for an arbitrator's decision that could bust the whole thing wide
open, says they can't meet until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bowled over to hear that we can't meet for nine days
while Rome is burning,'' NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask him who struck the match,'' responded union director Billy
Hunter. ``They locked us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what, fellas? Nobody cares. Nobody is picking sides. And
nobody will pay attention until the balls start bouncing and the
sneakers start squeaking.
</P>
<P>
   If that means no hoops until 1999, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   People are simply fed up with labor issues. Even here, where
basketball is king, where more than 19,000 flock to every Suns
game. Thanks to Andre Wadsworth and Keith Tkachuk, people are sick
of being held hostage in a high-stakes game. Someone else's game,
where someone else benefits, where the loser is always a constant.
</P>
<P>
   You.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the nonsense, you must believe the unbelievable,
that as many as 15 of 29 teams are losing money. Of the $1.7
billion in revenue generated last season, almost $1 billion went to
the players.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are paying 57 percent of revenue towards labor. They
want a 50-50 split. And until the Larry Bird exemption is removed,
they claim that labor costs will continue to spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   It is the exemption that allows a team to pay its own free
agents as much as it likes without regard to the salary cap. It is
how the Bulls could pay Michael Jordan $33 million when the cap
figure was just over $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the owners want the players to lend a hand. To
protect the owners from themselves. Like the guy in Minnesota who
gave Kevin Garnett $126 million multiyear before he became a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The players are standing firm. Convinced in the ethics of
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one has missed a paycheck yet, either.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, an arbitrator named John Feerick _ the same
genius who reinstated Latrell Sprewell's $25 million contract _
must decide whether 230 guaranteed contracts must be honored by the
owners. After all, the players aren't on strike. So why shouldn't
they get paid?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, 25 exhibition games have been scrapped, and if there
isn't any significant movement this week, the regular season will
start taking a hit.
</P>
<P>
   This is good for no one. Not the league, which has probably lost
its pied piper in Jordan. And if they think nothing will change
without Superman around, well, they're idiots. Unless your idea of
a hero is the hemp-carrying Chris Webber or posse-toting Allen
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   It's not good for the Suns, who have three players under
contract and will have to scurry to fill a roster if this thing
ever gets settled. And it's not good for the continuity and
integrity of the league, not with 200 free agents waiting to be
signed when the madness comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   All because they can't figure out how to share a gold mine, a
windfall that will reach $2.6 billion next season thanks to a new
television contract with TNT and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   So whose to blame? Who cares.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Just wake us when it's over. &QL;

MIGHTY DUCKS DUO OBJECT TO SEPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX Don't look now, but  &UR; Craig Hartsburg, the new head coach
in Anaheim, is toying with the idea of splitting up linemates  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Kariya and  &UR; Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder this guy got fired last season in Chicago. If he
breaks up this dynamic duo, he'll probably get bounced again.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Hartsburg know what these guys have done together? In
only 115 games as linemates, they've amassed a staggering 328
points (79 goals, 167 points for Kariya; 75 goals, 161 points for
Selanne).
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks also are 57-41-17 (a .570 winning percentage)
in games in which Kariya and Selanne have played together. When one
or both players are missing from the lineup, Anaheim is 22-44-12
(.359).
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we'll do whatever Hartsburg wants,'' Selanne said.
``He's the coach. But if you find two guys who can play so well
together, I see no reason why those two guys should be split up.
That's why the game is so much easier, when you can do so much
damage because you read each other so well. That's the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think about Edmonton without  &UR; (Wayne) Gretzky and
 &UR; (Jari) Kurri together. Or Pittsburgh without  &UR; (Mario) Lemieux and
 &UR; (Jaromir) Jagr. . . . He tells us he likes to try different things.
That's just fine. But I think it's just wasting so much if we don't
play together.'' &QL; 
Eric the great &QL; 
Seems like all that public trashing Philadelphia Flyers General
Manager  &UR; Bobby Clarke put on captain  &UR; Eric Lindros may have done
the trick. After six preseason games, Lindros was leading the
league with a whopping 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, after Clarke agreed to give Lindros a one-year
extension worth $8.5 million, he said Lindros better be prepared to
live up to it. He has so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the difference, even in the little things he's
doing out there,'' linemate  &UR; John LeClair said. ``Even when there's
been no play there, he's in there trying to make something out of
it. He'll get a skate in, try to make something happen. He's really
been a leader. He's been intense, and the team has been following
his example.'' &QL; 
Last of the landmarks &QL; 
As you may have heard, storied Maple Leaf Gardens will be shutting
its doors after 68 years when the Toronto Maple Leafs play their
final home game there on Jan. 13 against Chicago. They will be
moving into a new building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the hottest ticket in town,'' said  &UR; Karen Petcoff,
manager of communications for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Word on the street has it that scalpers already are offering up
to $1,500 a pop to catch the grand finale. Expect that figure to
soar by January. &QL; 
Rumor city &QL; 
The talk in Buffalo is that the center-hungry Sabres might make a
pitch for disgruntled Czech star  &UR; Peter Nedved. The Penguins still
control his rights, so it would have to involve a trade, which
apparently has been discussed. Signing Nedved to an offer sheet
doesn't make too much sense for Buffalo. Especially at his
five-year, $20 million demand. More to the point, the Sabres aren't
willing to part with five first-round draft picks as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scotty Bowman probably won't return as coach of the Red Wings.
But it won't be just because of his health problems. The inside
skinny is that he's pushing associate coach  &UR; Barry Smith to be his
replacement, and the longer Bowman reflects on whether to retire or
coach again, the better chance Smith has to win management's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned free-agent center  &UR; Doug Weight and his agent,  &UR; Mike
Barnett, will ask the Edmonton Oilers to trade him in the next
couple of days if they don't agree to pay him $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four million? No way I can fit that into my budget,'' Oilers
GM
 &UR; Glen Sather said. ``You've got to win a lot of things or get a lot
of points to get $4 million. Doug had 70 points last year. I don't
think he's a $4 million player.''
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Felix Potvin trade probably will come down this week.
Squeezed out by the free-agent signing of  &UR; Curtis Joseph this
summer, Potvin is headed to Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal or the New
York Islanders. &QL; 
Life in the desert &QL; 
Several Coyotes got a scare the other day during practice at the
team's new training facility in Scottsdale when a tarantula crawled
into the building and was lurking around the Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
   After removing the hairy spider and returning it to the friendly
confines of the desert, a giant scorpion _ about the size of a fist
_ was spotted in about the same place. It didn't meet as kind a
fate as the tarantula, though. Someone squished it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this,'' equipment manager  &UR; Stan Wilson said.
``We've been out here for almost a year now, and I've never seen
anything crawl into this place. Now in two hours, I've seen a
tarantula and a scorpion. I can't wait to go home. I'm sure when I
open my car door today, I'll see a huge rattlesnake curled up
inside my front seat.'' &QL;

COYOTES' WAIVER LIST YIELDS NO SURPRISES

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As expected, the Coyotes didn't produce any major
surprises when submitting their protected list to the NHL for
Monday's waiver draft.
</P>
<P>
   The nine players they chose not to protect, who now become
available to any team who wants them, more or less figured to be
left exposed.
</P>
<P>
   They include left wings Andrei Vasilev, Barry Nieckar and Joe
Dzdiezic, center Rob Murray, right wingers Jocelyn Lemieux and J.F.
Jomphe, and defensemen Brad Tiley, Bryan Helmer and Sean Gagnon.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nine are expected to start the season in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnon, who has a chance to be one of the team's busiest
fighters if he cracks the lineup, was seen as a bit of a stretch
because of his uncanny toughness. But the fact he signed a one-way,
guaranteed $350,000 contract, a deal matched by the Coyotes after
Dallas made him an offer sheet, probably will scare away most clubs
from considering him.
</P>
<P>
   Each NHL team could protect 18 skaters and two goalies. Some of
the bigger names around the league left unprotected by their clubs
included: Warren Rychel (Colorado), Aaron Gavey and Dave Reid
(Dallas), Brent Gilchrist (Detroit), Ray Ferraro and Nathan
Lafayette (Los Angeles), Jeff Norton and Kirk Muller (Florida),
Bill Berg and Jeff Finley (Rangers), Ron Sutter (San Jose) and Glen
Healy (Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   Players who have since announced their retirement, such as the
Rangers' Pat LaFontaine and Carolina's Al Iafrate, also were among
those left unprotected. &QL;

   Anaheim Angels players, fresh off another September collapse,
were acting anything but heavenly after their season ended last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Angels drew 2.5 million fans to their refurbished
stadium. Yes, the Angels contended for a playoff spot until the
final weekend. But no, this club's players are anything but content
with what's going on in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get two studs here, one pitcher who is a force and one
bat that will give you 30 to 40 home runs and 120 to 130 RBIs,
we'll be ready to take off then,'' veteran left-hander  &UR; Chuck
Finley said. ``I guarantee you, we'd have a come-catch-me team
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Angels is relatively young. Players such as
 &UR; Darin
 &UR; Erstad,  &UR; Troy Glaus,  &UR; Todd Greene,  &UR; Garrett Anderson,  &UR; Troy
Percival and
 &UR; Tim Salmon are under 30. The problem, some players insist, is the
willingness of some unnamed players to accept losing so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot looser now,'' hitting coach  &UR; Rod Carew said
after the club whipped Oakland, 10-6, one day after being swept in
a three-game series at home against Texas. ``They're losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the players voiced their fury against teammates,
starting with the always competitive Erstad, who has future leader
written all over himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are happy we're going home,'' he said. ``It's
almost like a pressure has been taken off, and players are happy
now. Why that is, I don't know. But it makes me mad. I don't get
it. Maybe they handle losing better than I do. Maybe I'm going to
have to change. I'll tell you what, I'll never be happy with
losing.'' &QL; 
No fish for you &QL; 
Cleveland's  &UR; Dave Burba, who parachuted in from the bullpen to save
the Indians' hide in Game 2 after starter  &UR; Dwight Gooden and
Manager  &UR; Mike &UR; Hargrove were ejected in the first inning, was
supposed to be fishing in Alaska this week.
</P>
<P>
   Burba, who was with Cincinnati until Cleveland traded for him
one day before the season began, had planned a weeklong trip during
February, knowing his chances of advancing to the playoffs with the
Reds were practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the trade, Burba called his buddy who had organized
the expedition and told him, ``Count me out. I'm going to the
playoffs.'' &QL; 
What were you thinking? &QL; 
Houston outfielder  &UR; Carl Everett learned a valuable lesson after
sticking both his feet in his mouth last week, possibly firing up
San Diego, the Astros' first-round playoff opponent, and
infuriating his teammates in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to fire anybody up,'' Astros first baseman
 &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Bagwell said. ``It's like the old saying _ you want to let sleeping
giants lay.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett was quoted in Tuesday's ``Houston Chronicle'' with this
beauty:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give anybody credit until after they do something. So
right now, who is  &UR; Kevin Brown? Your past history doesn't do
nothing for you. He's nothing until he does something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown went out and struck out 16 batters, the second-highest
total in postseason history ( &UR; Bob Gibson struck out 17 in 1968).
Brown said he was unaware of the comments, which is highly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' San Diego pitching coach  &UR; Dave Stewart said, ``I guess
he's done something now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was dominant in beating Houston ace  &UR; Randy Johnson in the
2-1 victory, Johnson's first loss in the Astrodome since arriving
in a July 31 trade from Seattle. As for Everett, Brown struck him
out on three pitches his first time out. Everett also flied out and
struck out one more time against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he learned his lesson,'' Stewart said. ``A statement
like that is the sign of an ignorant man. Kevin Brown knows success
at a big level. What success has Carl Everett had?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing stuff like that, you don't even belong in the big
leagues. There's a saying that if you stand in the corner and keep
your mouth shut, nobody knows how stupid you are. I never knew he
was that stupid until he said that stuff.'' &QL; 
Truly a Big Mac attack &QL; 
Count the ``St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' as one of the biggest
beneficiaries of  &UR; Mark McGwire's record-breaking summer. St. Louis'
largest newspaper earned an extra $1 million from additional
advertising revenue and single-copy sales within three days of
McGwire's 62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like he hit the ball, and we caught it,'' said
 &UR; Terrance
 &UR; Egger, ``Post-Dispatch'' vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis believes McGwire's home run binge added around $60
million in gross revenue to the local economy. &QL; 
Mariners in the playoffs &QL; 
That's some playoff club the Seattle Mariners have put together
this season. A quick scan of the eight postseason rosters showed
that more than 30 former Mariners are participating in the 1998
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle Times'' baseball writer  &UR; Larry Stone compiled this
starting lineup: Catcher,  &UR; Jason Varitek; 1B,  &UR; Tino Martinez; 2B,
 &UR; Joey Cora; SS,
 &UR; Omar Vizquel; 3B,  &UR; Luis Sojo; OF,  &UR; Roberto Kelly; OF,  &UR; Darren
Bragg; OF,
 &UR; Mark Whiten; DH,  &UR; Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the pitching staff that is even more impressive.  &UR; Randy
 &UR; Johnson,  &UR; Mike Hampton,  &UR; Dave Burba and  &UR; Sterling Hitchcock could
start, with  &UR; Terry Mulholland,  &UR; Jeff Nelson,  &UR; Ron Villone and
closer  &UR; Mike Jackson in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   You want a bench? How about  &UR; Glenallen Hill,  &UR; Andy Sheets,
 &UR; Warren Newson and  &UR; Bill Haselman? &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So, exactly how did they lose 99 games?: The Tampa Bay Devil
Rays had the fourth-best ERA and second highest fielding percentage
in the American League. Of course, their club batting average
ranked 13th out of 14.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A very subtle difference between these two
 &UR; franchises: Atlanta's post-season media guide dedicated 36 pages to
the club's post-season history. The Cubs? Three pages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Bob Dernier.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does it mean anything? Not really, but what the heck: In 1941
 &UR; Stan Musial hit .426 with one home run and seven RBIs in 47
at-bats after a September call-up to St. Louis.  &UR; J.D. Drew hit .417
with five home runs and 13 RBIs in 36 at-bats after his call-up
last month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No, really, you shouldn't have: Cincinnati General Manager  &UR; Jim
Bowden, who has been angling for the same post in Baltimore,
probably wasn't too happy to have former Orioles Manager
 &UR; Davey Johnson endorse him. Johnson's opinion is not exactly
welcomed by owner  &UR; Peter Angelos, who fired Johnson last fall. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With five 16-game winners on its staff, Atlanta joined the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates as the only clubs this century who can boast
that claim. The Braves' big five of  &UR; Tom Glavine,  &UR; Greg Maddux,
 &UR; John Smoltz,
 &UR; Kevin Milwood and  &UR; Denny Neagle combined for 88 victories and 23
complete games. The '02 Pirates group won 100 games with 125
complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which lost 11 of its final 13 games, finished 35
games behind division champion New York. That's the Orioles'
largest deficit since the 1955 club finished 39 games behind the
AL-champion Yankees. It was also just two years after the Orioles
were known as the St. Louis Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's  &UR; Tom Kelly and Milwaukee's  &UR; Phil Garner joined
 &UR; Connie Mack (13 years and 10 years),  &UR; Gene Mauch (seven) and
 &UR; Bucky Harris (six) as the only managers to guide the same club to
at least six consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit reliever  &UR; Todd Jones, who suffered through a mostly
miserable season, called the Tigers dugout during last Sunday's
final game and asked for an opportunity to pitch if the situation
arose. Jones needed to retire one batter to get his ERA below 5.00.
He did and finished at 4.97.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marquis Grissom, a post-season staple the past three years (two
with Atlanta and one with Cleveland), is not playing in October for
the first time since 1993. ``I won't lie to you. It'll be nice just
to have time to rest and heal up my body a little bit,'' said
Grissom, now with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kevin Young, arguably the best player on Pittsburgh's roster,
is the first Pirates player to finish with at least 40 doubles and
25 home runs since  &UR; Dave Parker 19 seasons ago. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Los Angeles closer  &UR; Jeff Shaw, it's almost a done
deal that he will opt to be traded or become a free agent. Shaw can
force the move since he was traded in the middle of a multiyear
deal. ``Being this far away from (my family), for so long, was too
difficult. And it's not something I want to go through again,'' the
Ohio native said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it's almost a lock the Dodgers will buy out the
final year of  &UR; Ramon Martinez's contract for $600,000 rather than
pick up the $5.6 million option on a player who may not pitch
before June.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland will probably have to start looking for a No. 1 starter
very soon.  &UR; Kenny Rogers, who won 16 games this season, has made
little secret of his desire to be closer to his family in Florida
and of playing for a contender. Rogers can insist on a trade or
become a free agent by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes-beleaguered Oakland Manager  &UR; Art Howe suddenly has
some bargaining power as the Athletics insist they want him to
return. The club wants to offer him a one-year deal with a one-year
option. Howe, a candidate to take over in Colorado, wants at least
two guaranteed years.
</P>
<P>
   Now that  &UR; Don Baylor has been fired, Colorado has compiled a
short list of candidates. In order of preference, they are:
 &UR; Jim Leyland,  &UR; Felipe Alou and  &UR; Howe. The Rockies were also
interested in
 &UR; Phil Garner, but Milwaukee did not allow Colorado permission to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be completely surprised if  &UR; Davey Johnson winds up
interviewing for the managerial openings in Detroit and Los
Angeles. &QL;

ANOTHER CUBS SEASON ENDS IN DISAPPOINTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ First, Greg Maddux silenced Chicago's bats for seven
innings. Then a grand slam in the eighth inning by Eduardo Perez
silenced the fans at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Saturday night's game ended, the loudest noise at
the ball park came from the visiting clubhouse as the Atlanta
Braves celebrated making the National League Championship Series
for the fourth consecutive year with a 6-2 victory over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Using their great starting pitching, and getting timely power
hitting, the Braves completed a three-game sweep Saturday night
before 39,597, most of them Cubs fans who watched another season
end in disappointment. The Braves will open the NLCS
four-of-seven-game series Wednesday night at Turner Field against
the winner of the Houston-San Diego series. The Cubs, who have not
been to a World Series since 1945 and have not won one since 1908,
must wait at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took a commanding 6-0 lead with a five-run eighth
inning, capped by Perez's grand slam to left field against Cubs
closer Rod Beck, who entered the game in the eighth inning. It was
Beck's first appearance of the series, and it was a disaster. Beck
had not pitched since Monday's one-game tie breaker against San
Francisco, but he was worked too hard during Chicago's drive to the
postseason, and the Cubs paid the price Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart started the eighth inning with a leadoff single
off Terry Mulholland, who then walked Chipper Jones. At that point,
Beck entered the game and retired the next batter, Andres
Galarraga, on a fly ball to center field. But Gerald Williams hit a
hard liner to left field that was misjudged by Henry Rodriguez, who
leaped but watched the ball sail over his head for a base hit.
Lockhart scored as shortstop Jose Hernandez made a bad relay throw
that allowed Jones to move to third base, and Williams to second.
</P>
<P>
   After Andruw Jones was walked intentionally to load the bases,
Perez unloaded them with a blast over the left-field wall. Lopez
was mobbed by his teammates when he reached the dugout as the
Braves knew they were only six outs from advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago rallied in the eighth inning with two runs, starting the
surge with three consecutive singles that loaded the bases and
chased Maddux from the game. But reliever Kerry Ligtenberg escaped
the jam with minimal damage. Mickey Morandini's sacrifice fly
scored Hernandez, but Ligtenberg got a huge strikeout against Sammy
Sosa. A run-scoring single by Mark Grace scored Sandy Martinez, but
Rodriguez flew out to left field to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got the victory, pitching seven innings with four
strikeouts and no walks, while yielding seven hits. Chicago starter
Kerry Wood took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs entered the series with high hopes, riding momentum and
making their first postseason appearance since 1989. But it turned
out to be almost a cameo. The Cubs had no answer for Atlanta's
pitching, scoring just four runs in the series, and looked like a
team that had expended too much energy just to make the postseason.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Atlanta took a 1-0 lead into the eighth inning, riding its third
consecutive strong pitching performance, this time from Maddux, the
four-time Cy Young Award winner. It was a typical Maddux
performance, featuring pinpoint control, clever changes of speed
and an ability to pitch out of trouble whenever he encountered it.
</P>
<P>
   A passed ball by Cubs catcher Tyler Houston allowed Maddux to
score from third base for a 1-0 Atlanta lead in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs figured that Maddux might beat them with his arm. But
in this game, Maddux also hurt Chicago with his bat. A .240 hitter
during the season, Maddux led off the third inning with a line
drive into the left center-field gap. Instead of settling for a
single, Maddux hustled into second base and slid just ahead of
Lance Johnson's throw for a double.
</P>
<P>
   After advancing to third base on a one-out groundout by Keith
Lockhart, Maddux scored when Houston mishandled an ankle-high Wood
pitch, allowing the ball to bounce off of his mitt and roll to the
backstop. Maddux scored easily, and although Chipper Jones followed
with a single that would have scored Maddux anyway, the Cubs
continued to make fielding mistakes, just as they had in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's frustration continued, both at the plate and on the
base paths. The Cubs squandered a scoring chance in the second
inning when Rodriguez led off with a double off the ivy in left
field. Gary Gaetti moved Rodriguez to third base on a groundout to
second. But after the Braves moved their infield in, Houston hit a
high chopper to first base, and Rodriguez did not break for home
plate, although it would have been a close play if he had run on
contact. Instead, Andres Galarraga flipped the ball to Maddux, who
was covering first, to retire Houston. Maddux then ended the inning
by striking out Hernandez looking.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago threatened again in the fifth inning, only to fall
short. Singles by Gaetti and Hernandez gave the Cubs runners on
first and second with one out. Knowing he could not waste a scoring
opportunity, Manager Jim Riggleman pinch-hit for Wood. Brant Brown
hit a slow ground ball to shortstop, and Hernandez slid hard into
second base, breaking up the double play and leaving runners at the
corners with two outs. But with the crowd on its feet, Maddux
retired Johnson on an easy fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pre-game talk centered around Wood, and whether the
Cubs should risk using their 21-year-old rookie who had not pitched
since Aug. 31 because of a sore elbow. But the Cubs could not have
asked for much more than what Wood gave them. He threw 97 pitches,
struck out five, walked four and surrendered only three hits during
his five innings.

SEASON ENDS FOR METROSTARS IN A SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The soccer season came to an end for the
MetroStars Saturday night when they experienced their first loss in
four shootout games this season, while the Columbus Crew posted its
first shootout victory in six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-2 edge in the shootout after regulation had ended in a
1-1 deadlock, Columbus eliminated the MetroStars in two games in
their first-round Major League Soccer playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew will face the winner of the D.C. United-Miami series in
the Eastern Conference finals. United leads, 1-0, with Game 2 in
Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Stillitano, vice president and general manager of the
MetroStars, said after the game that he would soon start
negotiations with Coach Bora Milutinovic with the goal of signing
him to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here,'' Milutinovic said when asked about staying. ``My
experience here is very nice. I was happy to meet with the
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic coached four different countries to the second round
of the World Cup finals and agreed to coach the MetroStars on a
handshake with one game left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Under Milutinovic the MetroStars won the last game of the
regular season in a shootout but lost both encounters with Columbus
in the playoffs. Talking about Saturday night's game, Milutinovic
said: ``Everything is possible when you're in a shootout. I don't
like to say we weren't lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Tab Ramos and Mike Sorber were the only successful players in
the shootout for the MetroStars, while Billy Thompson, Thomas
Dooley and Stern John succeeded for the Crew. John made the score
in the shootout 3-1 when he drilled a shot just inside the right
post.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos and John were the goal scorers in regulation, where the
MetroStars had the territorial domination, especially in the first
half. But the home team had difficulty converting its
opportunities, to the disappointment of the 11,686 fans who braved
the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos displayed his experience on the goal that ended the
MetroStars' scoring drought on the artificial surface at 389
minutes. He stepped up to the ball to take a free kick that was
awarded to the MetroStars outside the penalty area on the left and
took it when he saw an opening and while the Columbus players were
setting up to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus scored on its first possession in the MetroStars'
penalty area, which came in the 22nd minute. John, who led the
league in scoring during the regular season, scored the goal on a
header after a free kick on the right by Andy Williams, who
assisted on two of the goals in the 5-3 victory in the first game
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus had only two other possessions near Tony Meola in the
first half. John had the best chance for another goal before
intermission, but he was denied by Meola in the last minute of the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars had three new starters following the loss in
Ohio. Mike Petke started at right fullback, Billy Walsh in midfield
and Miles Joseph on the attack. Walsh and Joseph played in the
second half in Ohio, and the MetroStars showed considerable
improvement by scoring three goals in the second half of that game.
</P>
<P>
   With Petke playing at right fullback, Diego Sonora was freed to
move to the right side of the midfield, giving the MetroStars more
speed and experience on that side, especially since Ramos spent a
great deal of time on that side during the course of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Petke, a rookie with plenty of promise, was the last man in the
shootout for the MetroStars, and his attempt was parried to the
right side by Juergen Sommer, ending the third season for the
MetroStars.

INDIANS RALLY, ELIMINATE RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last Red Sox player on the field at Fenway Park last night
did not turn off the lights before heading home for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, while the celebration was centered on the visitors'
side of the field at Fenway Park, where the Cleveland Indians were
making plans for a return trip to the American League Championship
Series after closing out the Red Sox, 2-1, Nomar Garciaparra popped
out of the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox shortstop waved his cap fiercely from Lansdowne Street
to Van Ness to Yawkey Way, extended his arms toward the crowd of
33,537, and put his hands together, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Even in defeat, Garciaparra, whose fourth-inning home run off
Bartolo Colon accounted for the team's only run Saturday and whose
11 RBIs set a Division Series record, felt it appropriate that this
season should end in applause. It was either that or face a
bleakness he was not yet prepared to face: no game today. Or
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Next game, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thanking the fans,'' he said after Boston was
closed out in the fourth game of the best-of-five series. ``Thank
you, thank you for being there all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who came within one out of winning the World Series
last season, will now meet the Yankees for the right to a return
engagement, but Garciaparra won't be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to watch,'' he said. ``We won't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be time later to reflect on how the Indians' David
Justice, who hit a game-winning two-run double in the eighth inning
off closer Tom Gordon with the Red Sox ahead, 1-0, detected a flaw
where most other teams had found near perfection. With one gorgeous
swing straight out of the Ted Williams school of hitting, Justice
rifled a one-hop laser to the center-field triangle, ending
Gordon's consecutive-save streak at 43 and dashing Red Sox designs
on extending their October. That had seemed so possible with
starter Pete Schourek _ the controversial choice as Saturday's
starter because manager Jimy Williams didn't want ace Pedro
Martinez working on three days' rest _ pitching nobly for 5 1/3
scoreless innings and reliever Derek Lowe setting down all five
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into the box,'' Justice recalled, ``I said,
`This may be my last at-bat of the evening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Justice didn't say anything about how his last at-bat would also
become the last stand for Williams, who has a World Series ring
because of the home run Justice hit in Game 6 of the 1995 World
Series but was deprived of the chance to win another this year
because of Justice's double last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to you guys,'' a red-eyed Williams said as he took a
call from Indians general manager John Hart. ``John, I'll tell you,
I'll be watching you. Thanks again for calling, Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be all winter to watch replays of Mike Stanley's
sixth-inning single and third base coach Wendell Kim waving John
Valentin home, where he was thrown out by that man Justice instead
of scoring the run that would have given the Sox a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played much left field,'' Valentin said of Justice,
who played just 21 games in the outfield this season, and hadn't
thrown out a runner all season until last night. ``In that
situation, you want to be aggressive. I'm just looking at my third
base coach, and he's waving me in. I can't make the decision
whether to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of nights to lie in bed wondering just how
close Mo Vaughn came to putting one in the net in what might have
been his last Fenway Park at-bat in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I thought I had it, but the damn wind was blowing
the wrong way,'' said Vaughn, who had to settle for a Wall-shot
double and was replaced by a pinch runner, Donnie Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind was blowing straight out, it would have been 2-2,
but the crosswind knocked it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler was still 90 feet away from scoring the tying run when
Troy O'Leary, whose 1-for-16 performance was the most conspicuous
failure by a front-line Sox starter, lofted a little fly ball into
short center field, where it was caught by Kenny Lofton, whose
broken-bat single off Gordon had touched off the Indians' winning
rally in the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say, `He should have done this, he should have done
that,''' Garciaparra said. ``I don't do that. Everybody did his
job. The results are the results, but we threw everything we had on
the field, gave our hearts out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And came up short, like every Red Sox team for the last 80
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty surprised it ended this way,'' Valentin said, his
uniform jersey streaked with clay for the final time this season.
``I anticipated that we'd go far.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're going home.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Baseball fans in an uproar over the Diamondbacks'
ticket price increases should know a few things before they take
the kids out to the ballgame next season and buy them some peanuts
and Cracker Jack:
</P>
<P>
   Sports business experts say the 12.1 percent increase is
typical.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a ticket probably will keep rising like a Mark
McGwire home run.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised by another increase next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like the stock market,'' said Sean Brenner,
editor of ``Team Marketing Report,'' &UR; a Chicago-based sports trade
publication that tracks costs for a family of four to attend
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't always predict the future based on past performance,
but typically professional sports franchises raise their ticket
prices by about 7 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball teams, according to our figures, went up
about 10 percent on average last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase hasn't set well with some fans because the
first-year expansion club compiled a record of 65-97, Maricopa
County collected $258 million in sales taxes that helped pay for
the ballpark, and fans spun the turnstiles 3.6 million times in
support of their new team. Attendance was third-highest in baseball
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, aren't these new baseball parks money-making
machines? Owners say they need parks that provide premium seating,
luxury suites, naming rights and extensive signage to compete, yet
the average fan still gets popped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fair question,'' said John Genzale, editor of
``Street and Smith's ''``''``SportsBusiness Journal,'' &UR; a national
publication that covers and investigates sports business issues.
</P>
<P>
   Genzale believes that while the 12 percent increase was near the
average, it is a little higher than the Diamondbacks needed because
of other revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three decades ago, the chief source of revenue, no
matter what the sport, was the gate,'' he said. ``Then clearly, TV
took over. Now we're in a time when the key thing is the stadium
because the TV revenue is shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ballpark is a money-making cow for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Team President Rich Dozer agrees that Bank One Ballpark is
generating tremendous revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a lot of money,'' he said. ``But we're spending
it to put the best product out there that we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that may be the only way the Diamondbacks satisfy
their paying public. Unless the club ponies up for a major free
agent, such as Astros pitcher Randy Johnson or Yankees outfielder
Bernie Williams, the grumbling is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't pleased when it reached the point of having to
consider a price increase, but after analyzing the entire
situation, we felt it was a necessity,'' said Jerry Colangelo,
managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   That situation, according to club sources, included about $9
million more in player payroll than expected. The team spent about
$32 million on player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some expenses also came in high, including the cost for
air-conditioning the ballpark. Ticket revenue came in about $1
million below projections.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks ranked third in attendance and 13th in average
ticket price, and 17th based on the average cost of tickets sold.
Dozer said baseball hasn't released final numbers, but he predicted
the club will end up about 11th in total ticket revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Dozer said the club doesn't expect an exodus of season-ticket
holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know more in about a month,'' he said. ``I don't think
that (a drop-off) will be the case. We might be mistaken there, but
we feel the experience (for fans at the ballpark) was good this
season, and we want to keep improving the product.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Diamondbacks had the most season-ticket holders in
baseball with 36,200. The club has a waiting list of 500 who have
paid deposits for season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get a charge out of raising ticket prices,'' Dozer
said. ``Looking at our situation, where we are next to the rest of
the teams in baseball, financially we needed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the facts, we're in the middle of the crowd.
And when all is said and done, most teams are going to go up and
we'll still be in the middle third.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming most teams increase ticket costs by about 10 percent
again, Arizona likely will remain near the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Increase projected &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on figures published in July by the ``SportsBusiness
Journal,'' the Diamondbacks' ticket increase is in line with
projections that were given to potential investors in a Preliminary
Limited Offering Memorandum prepared by Merrill Lynch and Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   That document, which was published in its entirety by
``SportsBusiness'' ``Journal,'' projected an increase of 12 percent
from 1998 to 1999 in the club's gate receipts. That is virtually
the same as the ticket price increase.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the projection for the year 2000 calls for another
increase of 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not gospel,'' Dozer said. ``Our ticket prices might
remain flat, they could go up 2 percent or 8.7 percent. We'll
re-adjust based on where we stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took seats that we thought maybe were priced a little low
and raised them. We priced them 2{ years ago because we needed to
start selling them. We didn't know then what the market would be
like. We tried to price them a little low.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest increases were in prime lower-level seats behind
home plate, which jumped from $25.50 to $35. A total of 69 seats in
the picnic overhang areas also proved to be more popular than
anticipated. Those jumped from $8 to $22.50. Seats in the
second-tier Diamond level rose by up to $4, those in the upper deck
rose by 50 cents to $2, and the $1 seats remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   Will fans see another increase next year? Genzale said the
Diamondbacks are likely to follow the projections set in their
limited offering, if possible. That would mean another increase
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you promise a bank or an investor to do that, you're sort
of committed to do that,'' Genzale said. ``They have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does it end? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, fans keep buying tickets even as they continue to
spiral upward in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies increased their ticket prices only slightly
after their first season in 1993. However, when the Rockies moved
into Coors Field for their third season, the prices jumped about 30
percent. After holding ticket prices firm for the 1996 season, the
Rockies bumped the average cost of a ticket by 24.3 percent to
$15.86 last season, the biggest bump in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the big increase, the Rockies still led the major
leagues in attendance, drawing more than 4 million fans to Coors
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets raised their average ticket price 23.3 percent
last season, and the St. Louis Cardinals raised theirs 18.5
percent, according to ``Team Marketing Report''.
</P>
<P>
   Every team trailed the Boston Red Sox, who charged an average of
$20.63 a ticket, highest in the majors. The Minnesota Twins had the
lowest average cost, $8.22.
</P>
<P>
   Four teams did not change their prices, and three _ the Cubs,
Giants and Phillies _ saw their average ticket prices go down
slightly in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' polled other National League West clubs
to determine whether their increases for 1999 are in line with the
Diamondbacks'. Most of the clubs have not announced their ticket
prices for next season, although several are expected to do so this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Arizona's expansion partners,
will announce early this week whether they will increase ticket
prices for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you I think the Diamondbacks' increase was
modest,'' said Debra Duncan, director of ticket operations for the
Los Angeles Dodgers, who expects the team to bump the average price
of a ticket by $2-$3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to find new sources of revenue. I didn't
think there was anything too shocking in what Arizona did. We're
one of the sports that is still marketed to families. Our tickets
are still relatively inexpensive when you compare us to other major
professional sports. But our payrolls are just as significant. It's
a real challenge for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Norelli, vice president of ticket sales for the San
Francisco Giants, said prices will increase 6 percent to 8 percent
for his club. And he said Giants fans will see a significant jump
when the club moves out of 3Com Park and into its new facility in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of (the increase) is a transition to the new stadium,''
Norelli said. ``We don't want them to go into shock. We'll still
have affordable seats for the general public, but the best seats,
the infield seats, the first-level seats, will see a significant
increase.'' &QL; 
Can I afford to go back? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a ticket at Bank One Ballpark to see the
Diamondbacks in their inaugural season was $14.69. Prices ranged
from $50 for 1,098 seats in The Clubhouse section to $1 for 344
seats in the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the average cost of a ticket jumps $1.79 to $16.48.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks report that 24,569 tickets still will be
available for $12.50 or less, and 17,893 for $10 or less. The club
also said 26,215 of the seats increased by $1 or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we usually see when a sports team raises its prices is
the higher-cost tickets increase more,'' said Brenner of ``Team
Marketing'' ``Report.'' ``They're paying more anyway, so they're
not going to feel the increase quite as much. Teams tend to try to
keep the low-priced tickets about the same so the game is still
accessible to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozer said that while talk radio shows may be buzzing about the
increase, Diamondbacks phone lines are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people call and say they wish we weren't raising the
ticket prices, but most of them have said they're going to renew,''
he said. ``We haven't had an outpouring at all. It's not like we've
gotten hundreds of calls. And I don't listen to talk radio.'' &QL;

ANOTHER SAD CHAPTER IN RED SOX SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the Red Sox. Good turns into bad. Victory dissolves
into defeat. Joy gives way to sadness. We go to the theater and
enjoy the performances, but the script never changes. In the end,
the Titanic sinks, Hamlet dies, and the Red Sox lose the last game
that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Time to bring the storm windows up from the cellar and peel the
tarp off the cordwood, sports fans. Boston's baseball summer is
over. Mo Vaughn's Red Sox career might be over. The Olde Towne Team
is not going to win the World Series. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost Game 4 of their American League Division Series
against the Indians, 2-1, at Fenway Park Saturday. It was an
excruciating defeat that gave the Tribe a 3-1 win in the
best-of-five series and sent the Sox home for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   After the final out, wonderboy shortstop Nomar Garciaparra (11
RBIs in the four games) stood in front of the Sox dugout and
implored the fans to cheer. They cheered for a while, then chanted,
``We want Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrill was gone. Maybe so is Mo. And it isn't easy being a
Sox fan. Since Bill Buckner's fateful error, your team has lost 16
of 17 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good things happened,'' said a reflective manager
Jimy Williams. ``But we lost our last game. In October. A lot of
kids left it out on that field. That's all we can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his lieutenant, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, were
vindicated when their controversial selection as starting pitcher,
Pete Schourek, excelled (5 1/3 innings, two hits, no runs). But the
brain trust still had some explaining to do when they then departed
from form and summoned closer Tom Gordon earlier than at any point
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who saved 46 games this year, including a major
league-record 43 straight leading into the playoffs, was never
called at the start of the eighth inning this season. But Saturday,
after Derek Lowe retired five straight batters in the sixth and
seventh, Kerrigan and Williams panicked and called for Gordon to
pitch the eighth and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It backfired. Gordon got the first batter he faced, then gave up
three straight hits, including a two-run double by David Justice.
That was the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right man, right spot,'' said the ever-obtuse Williams. ``He
was a fresh arm. Lowe had done his job. (Gordon) has been a starter
before. Maybe we hadn't started him in the eighth, but he'd
certainly gotten five outs before. It wasn't a situation that was
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan added, ``Lowe had thrown 58 pitches in three days and
19 pitches today. He did his job. Before the game, we said if we
can get to Flash for six outs, we would do it. Because he had two
days off.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it looked like the Sox were panicking when Gordon came in
so early. And the removal of Lowe is mildly reminiscent of Darrell
Johnson's lifting of Jim Willoughby for a pinch hitter (resulting
in rookie Jim Burton giving up the winning run) in the final game
of the 1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans could only moan about the anemic batting order.
Boston's best chance to score a second run came in the sixth, when
third base coach Wendell Kim, again running against season-long
form, sent John Valentin to home-plate death after Mike Stanley
singled to left with Valentin on second in the sixth. Valentin was
easily gunned down by Justice.
</P>
<P>
   It was totally uncharacteristic for the conservative Kim and
perhaps made a statement about the Sox' lack of confidence in their
lineup. But again, the Sox brass refused to second-guess itself.
It's a baseball thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was the right call,'' said Williams. ``Any time you
get a chance to score on a play like that, you go. You've got to
tip your cap. Justice made a perfect throw. To me, if we would do
it over again, we'd do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said, ``Were you watching the game? Justice was playing
toward center field. Val got a good jump and Justice had to make a
perfect throw, which he did. It was early in the game (sixth?). I
don't see you guys (reporters) hardly ever. Justice hasn't played
much left field and he'd been hurt. I felt we had a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox threatened in the bottom of the eighth when Vaughn _ in
what might have been his final at-bat as a Red Sox player, hit a
one-out double off the wall (``The damn wind was blowing the wrong
way'' _ Mo). Donnie Sadler ran for Vaughn, and after Nomar grounded
to third and Stanley walked, Troy O'Leary (1 for 16 in the series)
popped weakly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to the ninth, on toward another Red Sox winter.
</P>
<P>
   The hot stoves will glow again in November, December, and
January. We'll watch to see if Mo stays or goes and what the Sox do
to improve their anemic lineup. It'll be 1999 and there'll be some
new logs on that fire. Fans will discuss the decision to lift Lowe
for Flash, Wendell's folly, and all the other things that happened
in the four score and one year since the Red Sox last won a World
Series.

RED SOX DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GO FURTHER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Indians performed on the Red Sox Saturday.
David Justice administered the last rites with a laser-beam two-run
double in the eighth inning and Mike Jackson officially pulled the
plug at 7:30 EDT when he fogged a fastball by Darren Bragg to end
the game, series, and season for a Red Sox team that simply did not
deserve to go any further.
</P>
<P>
   This was never going to be The Year. In order to win the 1998
World Series, the Red Sox would have needed to figure out a way to
win three series in succession, the last two against teams that had
won in excess of 100 games and had far more top-to-bottom weaponry.
The Red Sox were an Ohio Valley Conference team trying to win the
NCAAs. Murray State is not going to win the NCAA tournament any
time soon, and the Red Sox, as constituted, aren't going to win the
World Series, either. Until further notice, their reward for a nice
season is going to be an invitation to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is for you and me to say. You won't hear them
say it. There is no room for the athlete to be objective. The
athlete has to believe in miracles. He figures if he's good enough
to be in the tournament, he's good enough to win it. The athlete
doesn't think about the fact that the Yankees, who won 114 games,
have no weaknesses, or that even if the Sox could have somehow
gotten by New York, an Atlanta, Houston, or San Diego _ all far
superior teams _ would be waiting. They don't think that way. They
think only positive thoughts. That's who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the shortstop. ``I went out there with the
same mind-set I had for 162 games,'' said Nomar Garciaparra.
``These playoffs weren't any different. I come out here to win.
That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn isn't quite as monomaniacal as Nomar _ no one is _ but
he honestly thought the team could have beaten the Yankees. ``I
think this team, if it played relaxed and played to its
capabilities, had the opportunity to beat anybody in the American
League,'' he declared. ``Who knows what would have happened against
the National League? The World Series is just blood and guts. I
really felt this team had the opportunity to get there _ no doubt
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar, Mo, and anyone else on the team harboring similar
thoughts, I respect your ability and I appreciate your position.
You have to prepare yourself to play and you can't do that if
you're already rolling a Greg Maddux-David Cone Game 1 matchup
around in your mind. I have no such shackles. I can go by what I
saw, and what I saw was a likable, hustling team with a lot of
heart that was able to camouflage some tremendous weaknesses during
the regular season. But when the serious games started, you were
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   All season long, people watching this team kept asking
themselves, ``How are they doing it with that lineup?'' Once anyone
got beyond Mo and Nomar, what did they have? I said it in May and
I'll say it once again: Troy O'Leary batting fifth for any length
of time was a frightening admission of offensive weakness. Start
with that. Then move through the rest of the order. Who was there
with the capability of scaring anybody?
</P>
<P>
   Every worst fear about the impotence of the lineup was justified
in this series. O'Leary, Scott Hatteberg, Jason Varitek, Mike
Benjamin, and Darren Bragg combined for five singles in 53 at-bats.
That's an .094 average, and that will not get it done. The entire
Red Sox offense consisted of John Valentin, Nomar, Mo, and, to some
extent, leadoff man Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did everything,'' confirmed Mike Stanley, whose bat had
at least a little life, ``but it would have been nice if someone
else would have been able to make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were a better team this year because they could
catch the ball, and that's fine. Pitching and defense are still the
most important components of a winning team. But there are people
out there who can both hit the ball and catch the ball, and it
might be nice if the Red Sox could find some of them and put them
in one of their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   And the best that could be said about the overall catching
situation is that it could have been worse. I think. As much as you
want to like Scott Hatteberg, he really does give up far too many
non-Wakefield passed balls. His bat is pesky, but he's not scary.
Some people think Jason Varitek might be the long-range answer, but
I think that depends on the question. Dan Duquette has to do
something about this position if the Red Sox are ever going to
advance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a given that they need another good starting pitcher, but
aside from the Braves and Yankees, who doesn't? Perhaps the Duke
will have a successful shopping expedition this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it was a fun year. April was magical. The team usually
went down hard, very often scoring a run or two in the late innings
when it was behind. There was usually a reason to stick around for
that final at-bat. We luxuriated in the wild-card race because,
well, what choice did we have? But it was the JV game to New York's
varsity, and any reasonable person knew it.
</P>
<P>
   The players invest their hearts and souls into the enterprise,
so they can be forgiven for being unrealistic. Not us. When there
are four teams as good as New York, Atlanta, Houston, and San Diego
out there, sooner or later, we here in Boston must sober up and
realize that the Red Sox are nothing but a lounge act. The only way
this was going to be The Year was if there were about five plane
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians? Who cares about the Indians? They're about to be
bludgeoned by the Yankees. If the Red Sox are Murray State,
somebody had better tell the Indians they are Austin Peay.
