WHOM WILL BUSH, GORE
 PICK?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 BY KRIS MAYES 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush had just swept the Republican
primaries on Super Tuesday and was about to make the speech of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a lectern with the network cameras rolling,
surrounded by a pack of cheering teenagers who had been invited
onstage by his daughters, Bush noticed that a fellow governor whom
he had invited to Austin to share the spotlight was being pushed
out of the camera shot.
</P>
<P>
   With the camera strobes flashing, Bush plucked Jane Hull from
the pack of teens standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that moment that a rumor was born.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that a certain red-haired governor from Arizona
might need to begin measuring the drapes in the Naval Observatory
in Washington, home of the vice president?
</P>
<P>
   This question was born a half-second later: If Hull was on
Bush's mind as a possible vice president, what other women might
also be dancing in his calculations?
</P>
<P>
   The national nominating conven tions are still more than four
months away, but speculation about who might be the actual
candidates in the Republican and Democratic veep stakes is hot and
won't cool down until the summer conventions. LOOKING FOR SOCCER
MOMS
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are actively push ing for a woman vice
presidential candidate because they think the party needs to
attract women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Potential female picks include New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd
Whit man, Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe, former GOP presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole, Washington Sen. Jennifer Dunn, Texas Sen.
Kay Bai ley Hutchison, Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Hull,
who has scored points with the Bush crowd for her willingness to
defy Arizona Sen. John McCain in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of columnists have even dropped the name of Lisa Graham
Keegan, Arizona superintendent of public instruction, though she is
mentioned more often as a possible Bush Education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, for one, is pleased at the mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very flattered that my name even comes up,'' Hull
said in an interview. ``But I love being governor of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who insists she is not interested in the No. 2 post and is
not considered by most observers to be a top-tier candidate,
nevertheless ex pects to play a role in Bush's selection process.
The advice she intends to offer Bush: Persuade Colin Powell to run,
and if he turns the post down, as expected, choose a woman as a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's time, and I think it would be a good pick, a
good balance,'' Hull said. ``And you've got more and more women
rising up to seniority. You've got three or four women Republican
senators.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political experts are less than enthusiastic about
the field of female candidates. According to Dennis Goldford, a
political scientist at Drake University, Hutchison is a redundant
choice because she is from Texas; Hull is out because she governs a
small state and is per ceived as McCain's enemy; Dole has never
held elective office and, thus, has no geographic constituency and
Dunn and Ros-Lehtinen are too new to the political scene. Snowe and
Whitman are more likely possibili ties, but they are both
abortion-rights supporters, which could give Bush heartburn among
party faithful at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the pickings are even slimmer if he wants a woman as
his running mate. Sen. Diane Feinstein is the most obvious choice,
an experi enced politician with the added benefit of hailing from
California. But other female candidates seem to require time to
mature politically or are from minuscule states, including Maryland
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Ken nedy Townsend and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen. MCCAIN LOOK-ALIKES
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates believe their tickets to ride could be punched
by Inde pendents. For Bush, that could be accomplished by
persuading McCain to join the ticket, or Powell, who declined to
run in 1996 and who is not expected to accede this year.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, the candidates may look for a suitable
substitute, what Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the
Claremont Graduate University in California, calls the search for a
``viable McCain clone.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the best option may be one of McCain's best friends,
Ten nessee Sen. Fred Thompson, a me dia-savvy early proponent of
campaign finance reform who took the lead in investigating the cam
paign funding scandals of the Clin ton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are Bush, it's as close as you can get to John McCain
without having the annoyance of having John McCain on the ticket,''
Bebitch Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore may be looking for a McCain-like candidate, which, ac
cording Bebitch Jeffe, could be ac complished by tapping McCain's
partner in campaign finance reform, Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin or Sen. Bob Kerry, an independent-minded Vietnam War hero
from Nebraska. BATTLEGROUND STATES
</P>
<P>
   Other potential contenders come from large battleground states,
in cluding Ohio, where Rep. John Kasich, an early GOP presidential
contender, and Sen. George Voinov ich have both been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Concern for big swing states could divert Bush's attention north
to New York Gov. George Pataki, a Catholic Republican and
abortion-rights sup porter. Also looming on the radar screen is
Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Ridge resides. Ridge, socially
moderate and a Vietnam War hero, has the added benefit of being a
McCain clone, according to Gold ford.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could aid his chances in New York by tapping someone as
young and fresh to the scene as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Andrew Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo and a Catholic Italian-American. Or the vice president could
focus on New Jersey, another key state, by mending fences with his
former rival, Sen. Bill Bradley, and placing him on the ticket,
though this is viewed as highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may also be looking to diver sify the ticket by choosing a
minority running mate. If that is his priority, the odds favor J.C.
Watts, an ener getic and youthful member of Con gress from Oklahoma
or Rep. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may be looking at several minority candidates, including En
ergy Secretary Bill Richardson from New Mexico, former HUD
Secretary Henry Cisneros from Texas or New Jersey Rep. Robert
Menendez, who has ties to the Cuban-American community in southern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But even those political experts who mention the possibility of
a minority candidate are skeptical. Cisneros was tinged by scandal
during his time with the Clinton administration and Richardson,
also a Latino, once offered Monica Lewinsky a job at the United
Nations and was criti cized for his handling of a security breach
at a U.S. nuclear lab in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see it. They are pandering on this one,'' Bebitch
Jeffe said. Moreover, she added, ``in the battleground states
(Ohio, New Jer sey and Pennsylvania) the Latino vote isn't
critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush would each like to force the other to pour
resources into territory they once took for granted. For Bush, this
could be accomplished by choosing a running mate from California or
a woman. For Gore, it could be accomplished by giving the nod to a
prominent politician from Florida, where Jeb Bush, the Sunshine
State's governor, is expected to lock things up for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head games may win out, and Gore may go with Senator Bob
Graham of Florida,'' Bebitch Jeffe said. COVERING THE BLEMISHES
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have glaring flaws they would like to paper
over, which could be done by choosing someone with the kind of
credentials they lack. For Bush, that may mean finding someone with
an unimpeach able record on foreign policy, such as Powell, McCain
or former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Or Bush could look no
further than his foreign-policy campaign adviser, Condoleeza Rice,
a Stanford Univer sity professor hired to help Bush overcome his
knowledge gap on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Gore's involvement in the campaign finance scandals
of 1996 may convince him of the need to tap someone with a
reputation for purity on that matter. Bradley would help, as would
Feingold. Gore may also want to choose someone with a little more
charm, such as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, to counterbalance his own
reputation for woodenness.
</P>
<P>
   Until the conventions, the candidates are expected to hold their
short lists close to the vest. But they also do not mind the months
of speculation about candidates that will occur between now and the
conventions, a process that rewards their friends and leaves the
impression that every swing group under the sun is impor tant to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that does is let each candi date enjoy all these trial
balloons for which they have to take no responsi bility; they can
just sit back and get a sense of how that plays,'' said Goldford of
Drake University. ``Ev erybody becomes a great mentioner.''

UNWANTED BOY BLOOMS IN THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's mid-May in the year 2019 and the smart-alecky columnist for
``The Arizona Republic'' (yeah, still me) has tracked down the
21-year-old son of Ruth Ann Burns to ask if he'll be sending his
mom flowers for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it to you, old-timer?'' asks the young man, whose name
is Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   It has to do with what happened in court back in 2000, he's
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get lost,'' Nicholas says.
</P>
<P>
   Kids these days. No respect. (I'm nearing retirement age by this
time. I'm supposed to spout off about youngsters.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been waiting for you to become a grown-up, Nicholas is
told. There are things no one could ask you back in 2000, when you
were only 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   Like, did the court case ruin your life?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Your mother sued her doctors for not diagnosing her pregnancy
sooner so she could have had an abortion. She claimed her life
would have been a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had nothing to do with me,'' Nicholas says.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it did, he's told. In Maricopa County Superior Court, your
mother's lawyer said, ``This is a major imposition.'' He meant you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just talk for the lawsuit,'' Nicholas says. ``It wasn't
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but he was speaking for your mother and father. A lot of
frustrated parents wonder if they'd have been better off without
kids. Some even say it out loud. But I don't recall anyone swearing
an oath to it in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 2{,'' he says. ``I don't remember any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good. You should have heard some of the things people
said about your mom. The trial brought up other abortions she'd
had, her lifestyle. I took calls at the paper from people who said
her children should be taken away from her. They couldn't believe a
mother would file such a lawsuit. They were sure it would destroy
your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What about when you were a kid? Back in 2000, people figured
you'd be scarred forever by all the teasing you'd take at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened once or twice. All kids get teased,'' Nicholas
says.
</P>
<P>
   But, your mother used you as a pawn in a sleazy money grab. Her
lawyer put an economist on the stand to say your life was worth
$143,214. Then, when the opposing lawyer asked your mother if she
was ``damaged'' by the fact you were born, she answered under oath,
``Yes.'' And she said so a week before Mother's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you hate her for that?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? I can't imagine a worse thing a parent could say about
her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 2000,'' Nicholas says, ``did anyone claim my mother
had abandoned me?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was she accused of physically abusing me?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she fail to give me clothes or food, or to put a roof over
my head?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she also say that, after I was born, she loved me?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what was your original question again?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Will you be sending your mom flowers next Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>

LAKERS TO FACE SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And now, one big exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen-starved a few days ago, replenished by a leave-no-doubts
dismantling of the Sacramento Kings on Friday, the Los Angeles
Lakers breathed easy once more. The moment of relaxation, of
course, passed quickly - the Phoenix Suns arrive at Staples Center
this afternoon to open the conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured - and Shaquille O'Neal's and Co. was assured of
no rest at all - the worst is behind the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns boast the league's most impressive backcourt tandem,
but they pose none of the matchup nightmares the Kings did.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a Webber or a Divac or a Pollard to blanket O'Neal.
There isn't an endless string of 3-point shooters coming off the
bench. And there certainly won't be cow bells clanging at America
West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   This is an opponent the Lakers swept 4-0 in the regular season,
a team they have beaten seven of the last eight meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A time to breathe easy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Things completely change in the playoffs,'' Kobe Bryant
warned. ``If you remember, last year we had our way with San
Antonio in the regular season, and in the playoffs it was a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a Spurs sweep. But the Suns are a different, much less
scary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   They are also a bit of a mystery, and that's where the Lakers'
worries begin.
</P>
<P>
   Only once this season did the Lakers see the vaunted Jason
Kidd-Penny Hardaway ``Backcourt 2000.'' Injuries to Kidd and
Hardaway, as well as starters Tom Gugliotta and Shawn Marion,
changed the complexion of the Suns from one meeting to the next.
</P>
<P>
   So, what to expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say,'' Bryant said, ``because we haven't faced
them with their two big guards in their lineup. So it's going to be
interesting to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers know for certain is that the soft-in-the-middle
Suns, with the likes of Luc Longley and Oliver Miller playing
center, are capable of withstanding a great post player. They
knocked off David Robinson and the defending champion San Antonio
Spurs in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the Lakers will learn as they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be a series right now where we're going to
feel each other out in this first game,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
``It's kind of like the first five rounds or three rounds of a
boxing match. ... And it's going to be feeling each other in the
first game of this series that is going to be the determinator as
to how we play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Phoenix has had an opportunity to scout us twice in the
last couple games, look at us and know who they're playing and kind
of prepare for it. And they've had some real good games against us
- although we won all the games, they've done well, and they have
the confidence and I think the belief they can come out and play
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That 4-0 record against the Suns is also a bit deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four victories, only one was a rout - 103-87 on Dec.
29 at Staples Center. And the fourth win was an 84-83 squeaker
April 4 at America West. Bryant was at home serving a suspension in
that game, but then, Kidd was also injured.
</P>
<P>
   The season sweep ``doesn't mean anything,'' Ron Harper said.
``That's the past. We are both at 0-0 now. The main thing we have
to understand is we have to go out and play our game and (use)
Shaq, use our size and play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to underestimate a team when you've just been
pushed to five games by an eighth seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have learned that it's going be tough,'' Harper
said. ``The first round, it was hard, so I don't expect (a
letdown).''
</P>
<P>
   On sheer star power alone, this will be an intriguing series.
Bryant, Kidd and Hardaway are three of the best young guards in the
league, each with All-Star resumes and in Bryant and Kidd's case,
All-Defensive team credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Today will be the first time that Bryant faces both Kidd and
Hardaway simultaneously, and he's likely to get a major dose of
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a challenge in general,'' Bryant said. ``I'm mostly
looking forward to guarding Jason, because he's such an all-around
great player, it's not all about scoring. It's about getting other
people involved, about rebounding and stealing the ball. I'm really
looking forward to that matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparation was, of course, short. The Lakers' prolonged series
against Sacramento robbed them of any down time to study and
recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how tough it is,'' Jackson said, ``but that's one of
the concerns, is the amount of energy that we have. ... We've got
to turn around and play really a tough team in a quick turnaround
situation, but we do have some momentum, fortunately for us, and we
feel good about the game. We're motivated.''

ISABEL JOHNSON HISS, 91, WIDOW OF ALGER HISS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isabel Johnson Hiss, Alger Hiss' widow, died
Wednesday at her home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Isabel'' was the dedication that Alger Hiss, a former State
Department official, put on his 1988 book, ``Recollections of a
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was long after he had served 44 months in prison after
being convicted of perjury for denying to a grand jury that he
passed secret State Department documents to Whittaker Chambers, an
admitted former courier for a Soviet spy ring.
</P>
<P>
   Hiss emerged from prison in 1954 and spent the rest of his life
trying to clear his name. A mutual friend introduced him to Isabel
Johnson in the 1960s in New York City. They were longtime friends
by the time they married after the death in 1984 of his first wife,
Priscilla, from whom he had been separated since 1959, 30 years
after they wed.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Hiss was born Isabel Dowden in Montclair, N.J. She became
a model in Paris, and when she returned to the United States,
worked as a model, a freelance writer and an editor.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage ended in divorce.

HAROLD LLOYD PATTON, 71, NOTED FOR HIS COLLECTION OF BOOKS BY BLACK
AUTHORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Lloyd Patton, a stage manager for Ray Charles who is said
to have amassed one of the largest private collections of black
literature in the United States, died April 19 at a hospital in
Burbank, Calif. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Emily.
</P>
<P>
   Patton assembled an archive of more than 20,000 rare books and
first-edition volumes by African-American authors like James
Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer and Langston Hughes. An
important aspect of the collection was its representation of
unknown authors, said Leon F. Litwack, the Pulitzer Prize winning
historian and author of books about the black experience in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not limited to the recognizable names in
African-American literature,'' said Litwack, who was Patton's high
school classmate. ``His decision to buy extensively from vanity
presses indicated his belief that these authors deserved to be
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   James Fugate, an owner of Eso Wan Books in Los Angeles, which
specializes in books by black authors, said, ``If we had a notable
author who was in town for a signing, Harold would stay until
everyone else had left, just to have a discussion with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton would have the author sign his or her book, then
autograph a scrapbook he had titled ``Authors I Have Known,'' which
included the signatures of James Baldwin, Alice Walker, Ossie Davis
and more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
   Patton was born in San Bernardino, Calif., and attended a
community college in Ventura, Calif. His father, Dave L. Patton,
who owned a general store and was politically active, encouraged
his devotion to books and collecting.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, Patton was stirred by the growing black
consciousness movement, and began collecting contemporary authors.
The 16 years he spent traveling the world with Ray Charles enabled
him to track down rare editions.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Patton expanded his property in Studio City to house
his collection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Patton is survived by seven children,
13 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said his family would try to establish a nonprofit entity
to keep the collection intact and maintain it as a research
resource for scholars and the public. &QL;

FUSAICHI PEGASUS WINS KENTUCKY DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ With stunning quickness Saturday, Fusaichi
Pegasus delivered a simple answer to the longest-unanswered
question in horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Why hadn't the favorite won the Kentucky Derby in 21 years?
Maybe because that's how often a 3-year-old like this comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus rewarded the faith of 153,204 bettors at
Churchill Downs, the second-biggest crowd in Kentucky Derby
history, by surging between and around a deeply contentious field
to win by 1 lengths over Aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Kent Desormeaux never had to use his whip as he rode his
second Derby winner in three years, rallying from an early
13-length deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Desormeaux said, ``is a brilliant horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree now.
</P>
<P>
   A son of the great stallion Mr. Prospector, a $4 million buy at
a yearling auction by Japan's Fusao Sekiguchi, trained in sometimes
unorthodox fashion by Hall of Famer Neil Drysdale, Fusaichi Pegasus
was thought to have an Achilles' heel in his own quirky
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   But Kentucky's favorite bucking bronco was on his best behavior
before the race, and ran the 1 miles in 2:01.12, matching the sixth
quickest Derby ever, on a day when 82-degree sunshine baked the
track hard and fast. He returned $6.60 on a $2 bet as the first
winning favorite since Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics weren't as impressive as Fusaichi Pegasus'
performance appeared to the binocular-toting fans and to beaten
jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the quarter (mile) pole it looked heavenly,'' said
Aptitude's jockey, Alex Solis, the Derby runner-up for the third
time in four years. ``I thought, s---, I'm going to win it. Then I
saw Kent galloping in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude also chased Fusaichi Pegasus to the wire last month in
New York's Wood Memorial after Drysdale decided to ship his horse
away from Santa Anita to avoid a clash with barnmate War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the jockeys' dressing room later, Corey
Nakatani, rider of 13th-place Anees, expressed his awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the next Triple Crown winner right there,'' Nakatani
said.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.
Unlike Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic, less-respected
colts who came up just short the past three years, Fusaichi Pegasus
will now be expected to complete the sweep. The Preakness is May 20
in Baltimore and the Belmont Stakes June 10 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He may have scared off most of the competition in Saturday's
19-horse field by winning his fifth race in a row following a
losing debut Dec. 11 at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Third-place Impeachment, the least-regarded of trainer Todd
Pletcher'sfoursome, finished 5 lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus.
More Than Ready gave Pletcher fourth place as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus' most accomplished opponents were no match in a
Derbythat was as cleanly run as last year's was bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy was never close and finished
14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never fired a jump,'' jockey Chris McCarron said of The
Deputy, who was trying to make Jenine Sahadi the first woman to
train a Derby winner. ``I don't understand why. He was
!ital!too!off! relaxed down the backstrtch. Normally he's pulling
hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Grass Stakes winner High Yield, the best of four-time
Derby- winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas' three horses, faded to 15th.
Florida Derby winner Hal's Hope, the Cinderella horse trained by
88-year-old Harold Rose, came in 16th after dueling Trippi for the
early lead through fast early quarter-miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just went too fast too early,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert-trained Captain Steve took the lead from Hal's Hope
near the top of the stretch but was cut off by Wheelaway with
three-sixteenths of a mile to go and dropped back to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's other horse, War Chant, was ninth. Jockey Jerry
Bailey claimed no excuses - like almost everybody who got dusted by
Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   The winner (whose name is a combination of the owner's name and
the Japanese word for ``No. 1'') was 15th going into the first turn
and in danger of being caught in traffic after Desormeaux dropped
to the rail from the post 15. He continued to race at the rail on
the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered Neil saying, `Just put him in a comfortable spot
and he'll do the rest,' '' Desormeaux said. He said ``some nudges''
on Fusaichi Pegasus' neck produced his charge to the front.
</P>
<P>
   The horse and rider angled away from the rail and were
seven-wide, losing a lot of ground, turning for home. Still sixth
at that point, but just two lengths off the lead, they roared down
the stretch and won going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need the racing gods to be smiling on you somewhat,''
Drysdale said of Fusaichi Pegasus' clear path to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck might have been to blame a few times as 20 consecutive
favorites lost the Derby. But good luck wasn't the reason this
favorite won. Fusaichi Pegasus won because he's the best.
</P>
<P>
   The best in 21 years, perhaps.

TERI THORNTON, 65, JAZZ SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teri Thornton, a jazz singer who had started to resurrect her
career after winning the Thelonious Monk International Jazz
Competition in 1998 and being signed to a major record label for
the first time in three decades, died on Tuesday at Englewood
Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey. She was 65 and lived at
the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the bladder, said her manager, Suzi
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton had a husky, keening voice with a muscly vibrato; she
was a vibrant performer with a caustic sense of humor, and she was
particularly gifted at coaxing harmonic complexity and emotion out
of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Detroit, where her parents, Robert Avery, a
Pullman porter, and Burniece Crews Avery, a choir director and
singer who was the host of a local radio show, encouraged her to
study classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, whose original name was Shirley Enid Avery, took up
jazz instead, learning to sing and play the piano. By the age of
19, she was a divorced mother of two and had not yet begun to sing
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   But she found a spot at the Ebony Club in Cleveland and within a
few years was living in Chicago and appearing with the saxophonists
Johnny Griffin and Cannonball Adderley and finding work as the
intermission pianist for strippers at the Red Garter nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Her career took off in 1961, with the release of her album
``Devil May Care,'' in which she sang in the company of the pianist
Wynton Kelly and the Count Basie sidemen Clark Terry and Freddie
Green. Her biggest hit, ``Somewhere in the Night,'' came a year
later; it had been the theme of the television series ``Naked
City,'' and she found herself singing it on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' and other variety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was signed by Columbia Records, and her exposure
increased. She took part in a television program celebrating Duke
Ellington's 40th anniversary in music, and Ella Fitzgerald told
Down Beat magazine that Thornton was her favorite singer.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, her career started to slide. She attributed
her downfall not only to the rise of rock 'n' roll but also to bad
management and her addiction to drugs and alcohol. She moved to Los
Angeles in the late 1960s and throughout the next decade took what
jobs were available, including driving a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she began her career again, playing and singing in piano
bars. After moving to New York in the early 1980s she became a
regular at small restaurant clubs like Zinno's and Cleopatra's
Needle.
</P>
<P>
   She was performing at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland in
1998 when she collapsed and underwent emergency surgery. Cancer was
diagnosed and she underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatments,
but she decided to compete in the Thelonious Monk competition in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of her performance was undeniable, Peter Watrous
wrote in The New York Times. She won the $20,000 prize ``by singing
well and digging into some of the best aspects of black
entertainment culture, the parts that make audience members and
performers join in the same experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Verve Records signed her, and she made an album called ``I'll Be
Easy to Find.'' In January she filled a weeklong engagement at the
Village Vanguard in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is survived by two sons, Kenneth Thornton of Detroit
and Kelly Glusovich of New York; a daughter, Rose McKinney-James of
Las Vegas; and six grandchildren.

CEDENO HAPPY BUT STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No boos, no cheers. Roger Cedeno is just another
visiting player.
</P>
<P>
   He once was the Los Angeles Dodgers' top prospect, but after two
years and two trades, Cedeno is the starting center fielder for the
Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in the Dodgers organization, Cedeno had a
breakout season for the New York Mets in 1999, batting .314 with 90
runs and 66 stolen bases. Last season, Cedeno was critical of the
Dodgers organization for its unreasonable expectations, but now he
says that all seems long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I've been traded again, and I look at it as one of the
things you can't control,'' Cedeno said. ``I enjoyed New York,
enjoyed the chance to play every day and not worry when I didn't
get a hit. But coming here has been great. We have a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won the NL Central the past three years but are
struggling this season. Cedeno, who was acquired with Saturday's
starter, Octavio Dotel, for 20-game winner Mike Hampton, also has
gotten off to a slow start. He entered Saturday's game batting
.202, although he does lead the league with 10 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cedeno's success last year was credited to nurturing by
Mets manager Bobby Valentine and coach Mookie Wilson. Valentine
refused to play Cedeno in center because of problems with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he hoped Cedeno would be his center fielder.
Astros manager Larry Dierker said Cedeno is still struggling
defensively, and it showed in the third inning when he misplayed
Mark Grudzielanek's catchable fly ball into an RBI ground-rule
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't always been good,'' said Dierker, who is batting
Cedeno second behind Craig Biggio. ``Maybe adequate. But he can
cover a lot of ground, and we expect him to improve. It's the same
with his hitting. He's gotten off to a slow start, but we project
him as a .280 hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lasorda: Former manager Tom Lasorda met Saturday with
heads of the U.S. Olympic baseball program, a day after being named
to coach the team at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The
team is run by former Yankees and Astros general manager Bob Watson
and ex-Angels GM Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, professional players will be used, although
major-leaguers will not participate because the Olympics will be
during the final two weeks of September.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers Triple-A outfielder Shawn Gilbert, who has 36 games of
big-league experience, was a member of last year's U.S. team at the
Pan Am games.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers GM Kevin Malone said he is not opposed to sending
players who might be involved in minor-league playoffs, but manager
Davey Johnson is a little skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great experience for any player,'' he said.
``But what happens if someone gets injured and you need him?''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Results of an MRI on the elbow of reliever Mike
Fetters were negative, and he could be back by Monday in Arizona.
Fetters has not pitched since Wednesday, when he experienced
inflammation in his elbow. ... Astros right fielder Richard Hidalgo
robbed Shawn Green of a home run in the second inning. He also was
hit by a pitch in the same inning after Ken Caminiti hit a home
run. Hidalgo tied a major-league record April 19 when he was hit
three times by Orel Hershiser. On the way to first, Hidalgo
exchanged words with Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort, who hit him
with an 0-2 fastball on the left forearm.

<P>
   Maurice Uchitel, a well-known Manhattan restaurant and nightclub
owner in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday at the Nathan Adelson
Hospice in Las Vegas. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Among his diversified business interests were El Morocco, the
legendary society nightclub, which he owned from 1964 to 1970, and,
in the mid-1950s, Voisin, a restaurant popular with social and
entertainment figures. Before taking over El Morocco, he owned the
Eden Roc Hotel in Miami Beach for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ukraine, Uchitel came to the United States in 1917. He
entered the garment business, and eventually had his own business
making shoulder pads before going into the restaurant trade.
</P>
<P>
   His 1945 marriage to Patricia Pollack, a singer, ended in
divorce in 1979. He is survived by two grandchildren.

HELEN BEARDSLEY, 70, WRITER ON HOW TO REAR 20 CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helen Beardsley, a mother of 20 who recounted the story of her
unusual family in a book that was later made into a popular movie,
died April 26 in Healdsburg, Calif. She was 70 and lived in Santa
Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her family
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda starred in the film
``Yours, Mine and Ours,'' based on Beardsley's 1964 book, ``Who
Gets the Drumstick?'' (Random House), which recounted the
logistical problems of raising 20 children in a modern middle-class
American family.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley's first husband, Lt. Richard Dale North, a Navy pilot,
died in a fighter-jet crash in 1960, when she was six months
pregnant with their eighth child. The next year, she married
another naval officer, Chief Warrant Officer Francis L. Beardsley,
whose wife had recently died of diabetes, leaving him with their 10
children. The 18 children ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years.
By 1964, the Beardsleys had two additional children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the oldest of the North boys,'' said Nicholas North, who
became a middle child when the families combined. ``I had lost a
father, but all of a sudden I had older brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Wyble, the youngest of the North children, said that when
the families joined, it was as if she had gained a twin. ``There is
only six months between my sister Joan and I, and there are several
of us like that,'' Wyble said. She said the household had at least
one birthday in every month but May.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, when Beardsley adopted his wife's eight children, it
was the largest mass adoption recorded in California.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beardleys were first married, they lived in a
two-story, four-bedroom house in Carmel, Calif. Later, using
proceeds from the book and movie, they added a floor, five bedrooms
and five bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A bread company used the children in its commercials in the
1960s and delivered 50 loaves to the Beardsleys every two weeks.
The Navy commissary listed the family as a restaurant so that the
Beardsleys could buy food at wholesale prices. Every month, a
commissary truck would arrive, and the children would carry the
food to the kitchen, Nicholas North remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born April 5, 1930, in Seattle. She
studied nursing at Seattle University. She was named Mother of the
Year by the National Campfire Girls in 1963 and was a member of the
California Advisory Commission on the Status of Women.
</P>
<P>
   When Beardsley retired from the Navy in 1968, the couple opened
three bakeries in Monterey, Calif. In 1973, Beardsley went to work
for the Carmel Community Hospital. She later worked as a
cardiovascular technologist at a hospital in Fresno, Calif. The
couple retired to Santa Rosa in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley is survived by her husband; 20 children; 44
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining once how she had managed to keep the house running
smoothly, Beardsley said, ``I think the military background
helped.''

   Growth is pushing communities ever closer to water crises:
</P>
<P>
   Prescott is running out. The rapidly growing city is depleting
its groundwater and has no long-term surface water supply. Without
another source, the increasing demand could begin to suck water
from the Verde River, which serves Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson has stretched its groundwater nearly to the limits and
still hasn't found a way to better use its share of the Colorado
River delivered by the Central Arizona Project Canal. The Old
Pueblo has stored most of its CAP share by pumping it into
underground aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinal County's expected residential growth will compete with
already hurting farmers, who hold onto a tenuous groundwater supply
and face the loss of CAP water.
</P>
<P>
   Even metropolitan Phoenix, with a remarkably stable long-term
water supply, still pumps too much groundwater and could run into
shortages because cities in parts of the Phoenix area haven't built
the infrastructure to use CAP water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very careful about getting water, hoarding water,
protecting water and fighting with other people about water. But
now, we have to face up to the reality that we're not going to get
any more,'' said Phoenix attorney Grady Gammage, a member of the
CAP governing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot, but it's finite. And now, we have to think
about how we're going to use it in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Gov. Jane Hull last week created a 20-member
water commission and charged it with studying Arizona's water
supplies, uses and what policy changes to recommend to the
Legislature by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members will find plenty to talk about:
</P>
<P>
   The state's groundwater basins are overdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rivers are tapped nearly to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona now uses all of its non-CAP Colorado River water and
will fully develop its CAP allocation by 2035.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Welsh, a Phoenix activist and author of ``How To Create a
Water Crisis,'' said the commission should not only consider water
supply, but water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that's more sophisticated than Arizona's ever
been,'' Welsh said. ``We don't worry about getting the best
drinking water for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation and better management of agricultural use, he said,
could improve the quality and safety of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Arizona shouldn't have a water problem. The state gets
enough water from the Colorado River alone to serve nearly three
times the state's current 5 million population.
</P>
<P>
   But moving water from the Colorado to every corner of the state
is expensive and impractical, which is why so many Arizonans get
their water from the ground or from local rivers and streams,
especially in rural areas. Groundwater has always been the cheapest
and most readily available source; but now, it's the most
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the population we have now, we are more than capable of
pumping out the supply faster than it can be recharged,'' said Rita
Pearson, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Overpumping not only depletes a natural resource that will be
needed by future generations, it leaves current users without a
backup during drought, and it can lead to land subsidence and poor
water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1980 Groundwater Management Act, the state closely
regulates groundwater in five mostly urban areas: Phoenix, Tucson,
Prescott and parts of Pinal and Santa Cruz counties.
</P>
<P>
   Each area has its own conservation goals and restrictions. In
Phoenix, developers must prove they have an assured water supply
for 100 years before they can build homes and businesses. By 2025,
Phoenix users should be recharging back into the ground as much
water as they take out.
</P>
<P>
   A system of canals, pipelines, reservoirs and underground
storage basins could allow the Phoenix area to support twice its
current 3 million population.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture still uses 53 percent of the Phoenix area's water,
and industry takes an additional 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's biggest cities rely mostly on the CAP and the
Salt River Project, which manages water from the Salt and Verde
rivers. But many smaller communities still use mostly groundwater
because it's what they can afford. Citizens Utilities will spend
more than $6 million just to bring a small amount of CAP water to
the Sun Cities. Peoria is spending $36 million to treat SRP and CAP
water.
</P>
<P>
   The CAP is the state's last and most expensive water frontier.
The $4.7 billion system, which carries 1.5 million acre-feet a year
from the Colorado River, was built to give Phoenix and Tucson a
reliable supply for the future.
</P>
<P>
   CAP officials say the water should be fully developed by 2035,
though that depends in part on how several Indian tribes manage the
nearly 600,000 acre-feet they will control through a series of
federal agreements. The tribes are expected to lease back as much
as one-third of the water to cities, expanding the available
supply, but again, at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger unknown is what will happen the next time drought
hits the Southwest. If the Colorado runs low, Arizona's CAP rights
fall behind California and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The SRP is already looking at two dry years and will supplement
its regular supply this year with excess CAP water. Salt River
officials also are watching Prescott, where growth is tugging at
the regional watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescott is affecting our watershed on the Verde River. And if
we lose that, we would have to use more groundwater,'' said John
Sullivan, the SRP's associate general manager for water.
</P>
<P>
   Most water officials agree the big decisions should be made
soon, before the remaining water supplies are committed. Gammage
believes water is the ideal tool to help create a long-term growth
blueprint, one that envisions how Phoenix will look when it
matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decisions about growth and then sent our
emissaries out on a jihad to get water,'' Gammage said. ``We should
say we have limits, and then use them.'' &QL;

ROSS LITTELL, 75, TEXTILE DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ross F. Littell, a furniture and textile designer, died on April
17 in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor, his sister, Janice Currey, of
Malibu, Calif., said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Littell's characteristic designs were practical, purposeful and
fun. ``The New Furniture'' collection, with its combination of
angularity and luxury, Belgian marble, shiny chrome and woven white
leather straps that he designed with William Katavolos and Douglas
Kelley for the Laverne Co. in 1952, is now considered an important
collectible from the period. The sling-leather and chrome-frame
T-Chair from that series is in the permanent design collection at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Franklin Littell was born on July 14, 1924, in Los Angeles.
After military service, he received a degree in industrial design
from Pratt Institute in New York. In 1949, when he was 25, he won
an award from the American Institute of Decorators for a low coffee
table on tubular steel legs with a top made of birch dowls strung
together inside a gumwood frame with handles. The judges praised
the table especially for its affordability _ its price tag was $19.
</P>
<P>
   Littell's work quickly attracted the attention of such prominent
manufacturers as Knoll and Herman Miller, for whom he worked
extensively in the 1950s and '60s. He moved to Copenhagen in 1960
and then to Italy, where he also worked on textile and furniture
designs for prominent European manufacturers, among them Unika Vaev
in Denmark and DePadova in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his fascination with geometry, nature and motion, he
experimented with making large-scale incised metal wall hangings
that he called luminars. He also developed innovative fabric
patterns based on the play of arithmetical combinations and a sense
of rhythmic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Littell continued to present new furniture and textile designs
while expanding his interests to designing art, carpets and tiles
for corporate settings. Le Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Montreal
included his textile work in the exhibition ``Design: What Modern
Was, 1935-65'' in 1991 at the IBM Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Littell moved to Santa Barbara in 1995. His marriage to Inger
Klingenberg, an interior designer with whom he also collaborated,
ended in divorce. In addition to his sister, he is survived by a
son, David, of Darien, Conn; two daughters, Louisa, of Denmark and
Hai-ja, of Italy; and six grandchildren.

RANGERS STAGE ANOTHER COMEBACK TO BEAT A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ After coming back from an eight-run deficit
on Friday, the five-run hole in the third inning last night looked
like nothing. Neither did the two-run one in the seventh. Or the
one-run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame them all, the final one on Luis Alicea's
one-out single off T.J. Mathews in the ninth to drive in Jason
McDonald, to defeat the Oakland Athletics, 11-10, at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game \RFriday\S night translated into confidence, and it
carried over into tonight,'' Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton said.
``Hopefully they won't all be like this, but it's good to know the
team's capable of putting together runs late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning run scored when Alicea hit a sharp grounder into
right field, foiling A's manager Art Howe's strategy of playing an
extra infielder.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and third and one out and Alicea batting
left-handed against Mathews, Howe brought right fielder Jeremy
Giambi in to play between first baseman Jason Giambi and second
baseman Frank Menechino in a drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea's grounder, though, got between the two Giambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate,'' Alicea said. ``That's not what I wanted to
do. I wanted to get the ball up in the air. But he was keeping the
ball down and fortunately enough, it got through a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The game ended much like the one on Friday did. The Rangers
players streamed out of the dugout to first congratulate the player
who scored the winning run _ Ivan Rodriguez on Friday, McDonald
last night _ and then went to first base to maul the player who
drove it in _ Mike Lamb on Friday, Alicea last night.
</P>
<P>
   The games differed in how the Rangers got to that point,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback on Friday was amazing in its magnitude. The one
last night was incredible because it actually was a series of
comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there's a feeling that they're never out of it, and
they keep battling,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle No. 1 came after the A's got to Rangers starter Kenny
Rogers early, forging a 6-1 lead after the top of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers erased that with McDonald's homer in the bottom of
the third and an opportunistic three-run fourth built on a hit, an
error and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Battle No. 2 came after the A's went ahead on Jason Giambi's
two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame that with three runs in the eighth. Lamb
started it with a leadoff single off reliever Jeff Tam, forcing
Howe to summon closer Jason Isringhausen into the game to attempt a
two-inning save.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen almost got out of the inning with the lead, but
David Segui lined a two-out, bases-loaded single past a diving
Menechino to give the Rangers a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers then gave the ball to closer John Wetteland, who had
a chance to grab a piece of baseball history. He was three outs
away from becoming the 12th reliever to save 300 games.
</P>
<P>
   The three outs didn't come, however, until the A's had scored
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi followed Miguel Tejada's leadoff single with a
mammoth, 421-foot homer to center field, and the A's led again,
10-9.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers these days, though, a one-run deficit is
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to get known as a team that's not going to give
up,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis got the inning started with a single, and after Lamb
struck out he went to third on a single by McDonald. Clayton
followed with a bouncer to third that Eric Chavez threw away.
Curtis scored and McDonald went to third.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea then singled to cap another comeback.

RICHARD BERTRAM, 84, BUILDER AND SAILOR OF RACING YACHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Bertram, a champion sailor on powerboats and racing
yachts and a leading boat builder and broker, died on April 28 at
his home in Stuart, Fla. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   When Bertram raced, he always looked for other boats to sell. In
a 1961 profile, The Saturday Evening Post said he sold $5 million
worth of used racing boats the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Among his clients were Aristotle Onassis, the Aga Khan, King
Hussein of Jordan and Prince Bertil of Sweden. Bertram appeared on
a Times Square billboard for Camel cigarettes and in a full-page
magazine ad for Hennessy Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   To an enterprise in which salesmen once dressed more for
picnicking or gardening, he brought glitz and a hard-nosed business
approach. One Miami rival said, ``His outfit has all the gimmicks _
big parties, big ads, big talk.'' Bertram was proud of his
aggressive sales methods and said 25 percent of his customers had
never owned a boat before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's economy may take a nose dive and people may go
broke,'' Bertram once explained, ``but the records show that even
in the worst financial crises there is always a man ready to buy a
boat. And I'll be there to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the banks of the Tamiami Canal near Miami International
Airport, he built what he called his boating supermarket. There, in
water in a steel and concrete shed 630 feet (two football fields)
long, he displayed more than 100 of his biggest cruisers and
sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Howard Bertram was born Feb. 4, 1916, in East Orange,
N.J. He began sailing with his parents on Barnegat Bay in New
Jersey. At 8, he owned his first boat, a 15-foot Sneakbox. At 10,
on the eve of his first race, he stayed up all night planning how
to win. There were 50 boats; he finished last. He would seldom
finish out of the money again.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell, he was skipper of the intercollegiate championship
boats in 1936 and 1937. His classroom success was not as good.
After failing French twice, he dropped out of college. In 1946, he
opened a one-room yacht brokerage office in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, when he was sailing on Vim in the America's Cup trials
off Newport, R.I., he was amazed when a powerboat cut through
6-foot seas at 30 knots. He traced down its designer, Raymond C.
Hunt, who said his boat could go that fast on choppy waters because
of a full deep-V bottom on its 23-foot hull. Bertram commissioned
Hunt to design a similar 31-foot powerboat for him. In 1960, with
the new boat, Bertram and Sam Griffith won the Miami-Nassau race,
two hours in front of the next boat.
</P>
<P>
   With that boat and successors, Bertram won many United States
and European offshore powerboat races, including the 1965 world
championship. To translate the virtues of the deep-V hull into
high-performance yachts at least 50 feet long, he founded Bertram
International. The yachts he built succeeded quickly, and in 1969,
aboard his 56-foot Bertram International yacht Envoy, he set a
Miami-New York nonstop record of 54 hours 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In yachting, he won the 1948 and 1949 international
championships in Lightning Class sloops. He won or placed high in
Miami-to-Nassau 13 times, Newport-to-Bermuda 10 times, Lipton Cup
six times, Trans-Atlantic four times and Buenos Aires-to-Rio de
Janeiro twice.
</P>
<P>
   His first two marriages, to Katherine Ivins and Pauline Meagher,
ended in divorce. His third wife, Lenore Lonergan, died. He is
survived by his fourth wife, the former Franchesca Morales; five
sons, Scott, Kim, Morgan, Colin and Digby; five daughters,
Charlotte, Gretchen, Anne, Caroline and Madelaine; a stepson, John
Holzman; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter, who was
born the day before he died. &QL;

COWBOYS PLAN TO SPREAD THEIR WINGS _ AND DEFENSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys receivers coach Wes Chandler played in
this offense under Don Coryell at San Diego in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Although the offense has evolved, and is still evolving, the
Cowboys are resuscitating the basic principles that helped win
three Super Bowls in the 1990s. After two seasons of Chan Gailey,
the Cowboys are returning to a system with roots stemming to Air
Coryell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just tweaked it,'' said Chandler, who played for the
high-powered Chargers of the '70s, with its multiple weapons of
Charlie Joiner, John Jefferson and Chandler at wide receiver,
Kellen Winslow at tight end and Dan Fouts at quarterback. All but
Jefferson and Chandler are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this offense is that you never know where the
ball is going to go,'' Chandler said. ``In fact, every eligible
receiver on the field is considered `alive' on every route. There's
no lax period. This is exciting for a receiver, because there's a
chance that the ball is coming to him on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has put a lot of faith in new
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly who, with the help of Ernie
Zampese in a consulting role, will add a few wrinkles and dust off
a few more aspects of the pre-Gailey offense, run by Norv Turner
(1991-93) under Jimmy Johnson and by Zampese (1994-97) under Barry
Switzer. Reilly previously served as Cowboys quarterbacks coach in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack is real imaginative, a good communicator, and, while he's
well-schooled in this offense, he doesn't limit himself to
\Rcopying\S one philosophy,'' Jones said. ``You can be sure that
Jack will put his own stamp on this offense. For one thing, he
understands that an offense is really a product of your
personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Reilly pointed out when asked how all the pieces will fit,
``No matter what different personnel groups we use, we must be able
to run and pass out of all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, all five \Religible receivers\S on the field, in some
way, should be involved in the passing game,'' Reilly said. ``It's
similar to basketball strategy. You have five different guys who
can do five different things out there. Each is a role player.''
</P>
<P>
   But this won't be Air Reilly. The Cowboys still have Emmitt
Smith, who is on track to break the NFL career rushing record in
2002, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to always have Emmitt in there, or else Chris
\RWarren\S ... that's a key to this offense,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly expects Smith's presence will force opposing defenses to
keep a minimum of two linebackers on the field, even when the
Cowboys go with their three- or four-receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt will be involved more in the passing game this year,''
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more pleased than Smith. He felt too one-dimensional
in Gailey's offense, catching only 27 passes each of the past two
seasons. During the Cowboys' Super Bowl years (1992-93, 95), Smith
caught 59, 57 and 62 passes. Those Turner/Zampese offenses provide
much of the blueprint for what Reilly is bringing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was utilized to my potential the last two
years,'' Smith said. ``Even when Chris was in there on third down
the last two years, he wasn't thrown the ball very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren had 13 (in nine games) and 34 catches in Gailey's offense
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Smith saw this as a license for opposing defenses to play
eight-man fronts on first and second downs, and to load up
secondaries on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has tried to find concepts being used in Washington and
St. Louis that may best fit his personnel in Dallas. The biggest
misconception about the return of Reilly and Zampese to the Cowboys
is that they are here to clone what was done in their first tour of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different from what we used to do, and it's not different
from what Norv \RTurner\S is doing in Washington or what Mike Martz
is doing in St. Louis,'' quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``The system
has evolved quite a bit since we last ran it. Those \RRedskins and
Rams\S teams have had tremendous success offensively over the past
couple of years, and we hope to duplicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampese said that because of Smith, the Cowboys more closely
resemble the Redskins with 1999 NFC rushing leader Stephen Davis, a
``downhill-style runner'' much like Smith, than they do the Rams
with Marshall Faulk, whose forte is getting the ball in ``space.''
Then again, the speed of Joey Galloway, Rocket Ismail, et al., make
the Cowboys' passing attack similar to the Rams'.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good offense for Troy,'' Zampese said. ``He's
so accurate. Plus, he's the most mechanically sound quarterback in
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense has the Cowboys already thinking about September ...
in May.

UCLA TOP USC AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA-USC men's dual meet was typically
untypical.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins upset USC, 88-75, to win their 22nd consecutive meet
over the Trojans before 5,463 at UCLA's Drake Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defeated USC in the women's competition, 86-68, to win for
the eighth consecutive year paced by Seilala Sua's victories in the
javelin, shot put and discus.
</P>
<P>
   After losing by a point last season in the closest score in the
67-meet history, the USC men were heavily favored to knock off the
Bruins for the first time since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The form chart for both squads, however, went awry.
</P>
<P>
   No event proved more pivotal than a 1-2 finish by Damian Allen
and Bryan Harrison in the 200 meters with UCLA behind 71-60 with
four events left.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a senior who had been battling knee injuries for the past
two seasons, won in 20.97 in his first 200 of the season with
Harrison in second in 20.98.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first career victory in the crosstown rivalry for
Allen, a former cornerback on the football team competing in his
last home meet.
</P>
<P>
   USC was projected to pick up big points from Andre Ammons and
Sultan McCullough, a decisive winner over Allen in the 100 in
10.25. McCullough, however, pulled up with a groin strain at the
top of the curve, and Ammons finished third in 21.01.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I have not really been happy in a race for two
years ,'' Allen said. ``Just to be healthy is a wonderful feeling.
To come out with a victory to keep the streak alive, I am elated. I
can stand here with scores written on paper and say how great their
team is but you show up to run on the day of the track meet.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1-3 finish by Scott Moser and Scott Wiegand in the discus to
put the Bruins to within 75-74. UCLA clinched the meet in the 5,000
meters with a 1-2-3 sweep by Paul Muite, Dan Brecht and Bryan Green
for an 83-75 advantage heading into the final event, the
1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Amid rhythmic clapping from a large group of teammates on the
homestretch, Muite, Brecht and Green pulled away from USC's Bryan
Livingston with three laps to go. Muite raised both arms as he
crossed the finish and into a waiting mob of teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team was the hero,'' said Muite, a junior from North
Hollywood High who also finished second in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sprinters got it done we just went out and did what we had
to do. It is great to have great times on paper but when it comes
down to it. Heart and team effort is what wins this kind of
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's prospects did not appear promising when Malachi Davis,
the Bruins' top 400-meter runner, strained a hamstring in the 400
relay, the meet's first running event, and 1-2-3 USC sweeps in the
hammer, triple jump and 110 high hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Art Venegas had already tabbed his team as a 15-point
underdog prior to Davis' injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to give them a battle,'' Venegas said.
``But could we win it? Every way I looked I did not see how. We
needed a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins received a break in the pole vault when Dennis
Kholev, the USC school-record holder and Pacific-10 leader at 18-3,
no heighted to pave the way for a 1-2 finish by Brian McLaughlin
(17-3) and Jared Drake (16-8).
</P>
<P>
   In the women's meet, UCLA's Sua and Tolson set meet records in
the discus (208-4) and hammer (206-2), respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Darnesha Griffith and Quartz Hill graduate Michelle Perry were
other notable Bruins winners with personal-best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, the niece of Jackie Joyner-Kersee and the late
Florence Griffth-Joyner, won the high jump at 6-0 for the
fourth-best mark in school history. Perry edged USC's Natasha
Danvers to win the 100 high hurdles. Both were credited with
identical times of 13.20.
</P>
<P>
   USC sophomore Angela Willians, the defending NCAA 100 champion,
turned back UCLA's Shakedia Jones, the 1998 World Junior 100
champion, to win the 100 (11.1) and 200 (23.32).

SUNS MUST COPE WITH SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Luc Longley is no Vlade Divac. Clifford Robinson
is a former All-Star, but certainly no Chris Webber. But could the
Phoenix Suns take a cue from the Sacramento Kings on how to
illegally double-team, er, defend Shaquille O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   Considering Longley was abused by O'Neal all season, giving up
33.3 points a game, and considering the Kings' strategy managed to
thoroughly fluster O'Neal for two games, and a pair of wins, it
wouldn't be surprising if the Suns at least tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to be able to do it, because I
don't think they have the bodies,'' the Los Angeles Lakers' Glen
Rice said. ``Their size really doesn't compare to the size that the
Kings had. And if we move the ball around the way we know we're
capable of doing, it's going to be pretty easy to get it inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper said the Lakers learned a bit in the Kings series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq needs to use his size and move around some,'' he said.
``So we know that we just can't tell Shaq to sit there on that same
damn side he likes to be sitting on. He has to move around more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also had athletic, 6-foot-11 Scot Pollard behind
Divac. The Suns have rotund Oliver Miller. Robinson, meanwhile,
lacks Webber's strength. Phoenix might just decide to use all of
its fouls, with Miller, Longley and ex-Laker Corie Blount taking
turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found some defensive resolve against San Antonio; they
fronted the post,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``They did some
things against David Robinson I think they might feel is effective
against us. And they help very well. They have good team defensive
help, so we have to honor that fact. But they have yet to really
figure out how to cope with Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Denied: It was subtle, but there was at least a hint of
disappointment among the Lakers that they didn't get a shot at the
Spurs, who the Suns defeated in four games. San Antonio swept the
Lakers out of the playoffs a year ago and was the only team to beat
them three times this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would have liked another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, because it would have been a nice challenge,'' Kobe
Bryant said. ``It would have been a nice payback to beat the
champions. But Phoenix is here, they deserve it, they beat the
world champs, so we have to try to take it out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Second best: When the Suns acquired Penny Hardaway last summer
and paired him with Jason Kidd, they marketed the pair as
``Backcourt 2000'' and started comparing them to the all-time great
guard tandems, including Jerry West and Gail Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said Kidd and Hardaway aren't even the best tandem of the
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His choice? New York's Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make a good case for that, I think,'' Harper said.
``Those two guys can shoot the ball. Those two guys have the ball
all the time. I mean, they've got two good guys on that team, the
Suns do. Yes, they may have two great All-Stars, as y'all say, but
when they step on that floor, they're going to have the same kind
of shoes that my shoes are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's opinion of Kidd-Hardaway as tops in the league: ``On
paper, it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   No time to be tired: The Lakers had just one day to recover from
their grueling five-game series against the Kings, but Bryant said
fatigue won't be a factor in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's playoff basketball,'' he said. ``We fought all year long
to have homecourt advantage, and we're not going to let it slip
away because of tired legs.''

HIGHEST-PRICED RUNNER PAYS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Fusao Sekiguchi, a Japanese venture capitalist
who cuts a cool profile in a ponytail and shades, paid $4 million
at a Keeneland yearling sale in 1998 for the colt who became
Fusaichi Pegasus. That made this the highest-priced Kentucky Derby
runner ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi said he would have gone higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I laid eyes on this colt, I knew he was going to be a
Derby winner,'' the winning owner said through an interpreter after
Fusaichi Pegasus' 1-length victory Saturday. ``I was ready to pay
$5 million or whatever it took.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest-priced Derby winner before this, amazingly, was the
filly Winning Colors (1988), who cost $575,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi, 64, also won England's Epsom Derby with Fusaichi
Concorde in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus rewarded him Saturday with total earnings of
$1,038,400, including a $150,000 bonus from the New York Racing
Association for winning both the Wood Memorial and the Derby.
Trainer Neil Drysdale earned a $100,000 Wood-Derby bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Like winning: Marlon St. Julien, the first African-American
since 1921 to ride in the Kentucky Derby, was proud of his
better-than-expected sixth-place finish aboard longshot Curule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to prove some things to a lot of people, and I got the
job done, as far as I'm concerned,'' St. Julien said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnstiles: The Derby-day crowd of 153,204 has been exceeded
only by the 163,628 fans who attended Cannonade's victory in the
centennial Derby in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Wagering from around the country was reported to total $65.3
million on the Derby and $101.4 million on the 10-race card, both
records for the 126-year-old event.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: Owners Bob and Beverly Lewis didn't win the
Kentucky Derby with High Yield (15th) and Commendable (17th), but
they might have found their Derby horse for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Unbridled Time won easily early on the Derby card in the
4-furlong WHAS-11 Stakes, the first notable 2-year-olds event of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this experience, in front of this crowd, will play into
his hands next year,'' said Pat Day, who rode for trainer D. Wayne
Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises paid $1.15 million at auction for Unbridled Time, by
Unbridled's Song out of a Halo mare.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later, the Lewises' 4-year-old Straight Man
edged Mula Gula in the Winnercomm Handicap sprint as Son of a
Pistol plodded home sixth. Jorge Chavez rode the winner for Bob
Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Fast times: The track played fast all day. Unbridled Time
matched the Churchill 4-furlong record with a :57 3/5, Straight Man
(1:21.53) came within a couple of lengths of the 7-furlong record,
and Ruby Surprise (1:21.25) was .07 off the same mark.

PRIORITIES CHANGE FOR DESORMEAUX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ As much as anything about the Kentucky Derby,
Kent Desormeaux says, he enjoys the sounds. The weighty rattle of
the starting gate as the doors slam shut behind the last horse to
line up. The gathering roar of the crowd in the moment before the
race begins.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied roar of the crowd as he rides a winner down the
long Churchill Downs stretch, something he has done twice now,
sounds pretty sweet, too.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux and his wife, Sonia, got some bad news a couple of
weeks ago. Their younger son, 14-month-old Jake, may never
experience the delight of those sounds or any others.
</P>
<P>
   Tests confirmed that Jake was born deaf. It's an affliction to
which the jockey can relate, having lost the hearing in his right
ear in a December 1992 racing accident at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing to think your child is going to grow up
without being able to hear music,'' Desormeaux said. Like ``My Old
Kentucky Home''?
</P>
<P>
   His family's tragedy put Desormeaux, 30, in a different mood as
he approached Saturday's Derby, in which he rode the favored
Fusaichi Pegasus to a convincing victory.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure that accompanied his 1998 Derby victory and Triple
Crown near-miss with Real Quiet seemed far away this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I was devastated, I was very sad, I was
depressed,'' Desormeaux said after becoming the 21st jockey to win
two or more Derbies. ``I think it helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Helped?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to come home and get into the books about sign
language,'' said Desormeaux, a Louisiana native who lives in
Bradbury, Calif., not far from Santa Anita. ``I wasn't dwelling on
this (riding the Derby favorite). When you think long, you think
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At Churchill Downs, in the days before the Derby, Desormeaux
``took time to slow down and look around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to slow down this year,'' he said. ``Maybe
because there were things to be more concerned about. We all get
enthralled with that oval that I ride around. It was time to think
about more important matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia attended the Derby while the couple's sons Joshua, 7, and
Jake stayed in California. Kent and Sonia are doting parents who
often bring their children to watch their father compete at the
West Coast tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Josh was at Churchill Downs when Desormeaux won the Derby with
Real Quiet. ``Dad,'' he asked, ``was this a really big one?''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Dowd, an entertainment promoter who is a friend and advisor
of Kent's, said a fellow jockey and his wife recently tried to buck
up the Desormeaux's by telling them, ``Special parents get special
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to find a way to make it a positive,''
Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   The Desormeauxs got the doctor's report four days after Kent and
Fusaichi Pegasus won the Wood Memorial in New York. They'd feared
Jake was deaf because he didn't respond to their voices.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope that the condition can be improved through
surgery. A ``cochlear implant'' will be attempted, inserting
electrodes that would simulate nerve endings.
</P>
<P>
   But the solution wouldn't be total.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the luxury, if you're in the middle of the street, of
being able to hear a car coming and get out of the way. He won't
have that,'' Desormeaux said. ``We'll have to change some things in
our lives to insure his safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Their other son, Josh, was born while Kent was in the hospital
in 1992, recovering from multiple skull fractures sustained when a
mount named Judge Hammer swerved and dropped him in the path of
other horses. Judge Hammer was trained by Neil Drysdale, same as
Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   Josh delighted his parents by making it clear he'll do his part
to make life normal for his little brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonia and I were crying, and Josh looked over and said, `Mom,
don't worry, Jacob and I will be able to have secrets nobody else
knows,' '' Kent said. ``This has brought the three of us - Sonia,
Josh and me - closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, who broke national records and won three Eclipse
Awards earlier in his career, will go to Baltimore to ride Fusaichi
Pegasus in the May 20 Preakness Stakes. If he wins there, it's on
to New York for the June 10 Belmont Stakes and a shot at the Triple
Crown that eluded Desormeaux by four inches with Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I could fly without an airplane,'' he said. ``I'm
sky high.''
</P>
<P>
   But matters at home will keep his feet on the ground.

NO MAGIC LEFT BETWEEN SHAQ, PENNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Theirs was an arranged marriage that everybody was
certain would go on happily ever after, as all fairy-tale unions
naturally do.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway, two very different
personalities bonded by a similar goal, were brought together by
the Orlando Magic in the early 1990s 'til retirement do them part.
</P>
<P>
   The union started out rocky, with Orlando fans booing Hardaway
when the Magic traded the rights to Chris Webber for Hardaway in
the 1993 NBA draft. But O'Neal, whom Orlando had drafted the
previous year, warmly embraced the 6-foot-7 point guard.
</P>
<P>
   And together, the two players quickly set about building a
legacy that would last.
</P>
<P>
   They were going to be the next Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic
Johnson. Largely because of Hardaway and O'Neal, Orlando looked
like the rightful heir to the dynastic Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The first ripe fruit of their union was a runner-up finish to
Houston in the 1995 NBA Finals. To everybody's surprise, it also
would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 season, O'Neal left the Magic in a lurch to take
up with the closest thing the NBA has to a trophy team.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the glittery, glamorous, coquettish Lakers, who
threw $120 million at O'Neal's feet in lieu of a lace handkerchief
and watched the 7-feet-1 center bolt across country, leaving behind
Hardaway, who felt helpless and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers brokered the union of O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the
latter a younger, more dashing version of Hardaway, and that became
the NBA's hot, high-profile ``It'' pairing; the Jennifer
Aniston/Brad Pitt of pro basketball, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, the Gwyneth Paltrow character in this triangle that
Tex Winter wouldn't touch, much less teach, fell on hard times. He
underwent two separate surgeries on his left knee and weathered a
couple of seasons of discontent in Orlando before he was sent to
Phoenix in a sign-and-trade deal last August.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix just happens to be the Lakers' second-round opponent in
the playoffs. So O'Neal is going to have to confront his past in
order to move forward, starting with Game 1 today at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   This, the Big Guy said, is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal claims to be cordial with Hardaway. He talked with his
former teammate last summer when Hardaway was trolling the
free-agent waters. Hardaway subsequently dined with Lakers
executive vice president Jerry West, but the Lakers didn't have the
cash to be a serious contender for his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a feud between me and Penny,'' O'Neal said.
``I went my way. Penny went his. We're still good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but don't look for O'Neal to make like Magic and kiss
Hardaway at midcourt before today's opening tip. About the only
thing they really share these days besides a history is a hint of
regret.
</P>
<P>
   They now know that in basketball, same as in life, the rarest
relationships sometimes are recognized as such only in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal has played like a man possessed this season, it's
because he knows his union with Bryant can't be counted on to last
forever (or even five years). Stuff happens.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of urgency O'Neal feels to win an NBA title now is the
surest sign that he has not only grown older, but wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Laker reserve Brian Shaw, who played with O'Neal and Hardaway in
Orlando, said, ``I think they both missed playing with each other
once they weren't on the same team. It's one of those things that
you take for granted. They probably did think they were going to be
together for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   After practice on Saturday, O'Neal admitted, ``At first, I had
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the obvious; that the Magic, with O'Neal and
Hardaway as fixtures, ``could have been something really special.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's as far as O'Neal will follow that story line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in ifs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooding is not in O'Neal's nature. He lives in the here and
now, not in the ifs and buts. The eighth-year veteran loves being
not just the NBA's best center but the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old is a human welcome mat, inviting everyone to
join him in the mother of all parties that is life.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, also 28, is more introverted. In temperament as well
as in talent, he is very similar to Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He is a screen door that swings open to only a precious few. So
you can see how O'Neal's ``strictly business'' decision to dump
Orlando for L.A. could have been processed differently by Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing four years have helped frame for O'Neal the bigger
picture of his ``strictly business'' decision. His perspective has
broadened so he can see the ripple effect it had on others and on
the league, in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bad thing about professional basketball,'' O'Neal
said Saturday, ``is the business side. We're all
mini-conglomerates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers loom over their competition like Microsoft. If the
scrappy Suns are going to topple the giant, Hardaway is going to
have to be a huge help. Indeed, to the victor of the mini-war
between Hardaway and Bryant will go the games' tone and tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, 21, studied Hardaway long before he knew O'Neal. When he
was in high school in Philadelphia, Bryant attended a couple of
Orlando games with his father Joe. He was so impressed by
Hardaway's skills, he bet on the Magic to beat Houston in the 1995
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets swept Orlando, costing Bryant $10.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, you can bet there's a lot more at stake for both
Bryant and O'Neal.

BASEBALL HAS DONE PEDRO WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is a special pitcher precisely because he knows
how to pitch. The Red Sox ace augments his impressive physical
talent with a remarkable knowledge of his craft.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how to change speeds, how to set up hitters, how to mix
his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   If a batter has success against him, he's smart enough to figure
out why and talented enough to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Usually it's simply a matter of changing his pitching pattern.
If a hitter is sitting on a fastball, he'll throw a changeup.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Indians catcher Einar Diaz, he took more drastic
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz had doubled in his first two at-bats against Martinez in a
game last Sunday. Both hits came on changeups on the outer part of
the plate that Diaz was able to hit with authority by doing what
batters typically do these days, leaning over the plate as eagerly
as a teen-ager after loading up at the CiCi's buffet.
</P>
<P>
   When Diaz next came up, Martinez did what pitchers used to do
with regularity. He busted him up and in with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was diving out and got me twice on the outside,'' Martinez
said. ``I had to try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball historians tell us this used to be called a brushback
or a knockdown pitch. It was an accepted part of the game, a weapon
in a pitcher's arsenal to keep the batter from getting too
comfortable or taking liberties at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The intent isn't to inflict pain; Martinez didn't hit Diaz. The
purpose is to keep the hitter from leaning over the plate to look
for the outside pitch, to send a message, and, yes, to intimidate.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, any pitch remotely close to a batter is seen as
an act of war. The benches cleared in a game Thursday between the
Mets and Giants when Mets reliever Dennis Cook hit Marvin Benard
with an 0-1 sinker. To load the bases. In the eighth inning. Of a
tie game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's getting to the point that every time you
pitch someone in, it's like you're testing their manhood,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez knocked down Diaz, the Indians, typically,
overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland starter Charles Nagy responded by throwing at Jose
Offerman in the eighth inning, hitting him in the hip.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation also used to be an accepted part of the game, and to
a certain extent _ benches-clearing incidents notwithstanding _ it
still is.
</P>
<P>
   But what was Nagy retaliating for? Martinez throwing a brushback
pitch? Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The benches cleared, naturally, although no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Now Martinez had to do some retaliating of his own. He hit the
first batter in the bottom of the inning, Robbie Alomar. Again, the
benches cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Red Sox manager Jimy Williams were ejected because
warnings were issued after Nagy hit Offerman. Three days later,
discipline czar Frank Robinson suspended Martinez for five days, a
punishment that's on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is understandable, given the warning as well as
Robinson's goal of doing what he can to put a stop to the silly
practice of milling around on the field at the slightest
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also misguided, because Robinson got the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   The way to exact revenge on a pitcher who knocks a batter off
the plate is to get a hit, preferably one that clears the fences.
The Indians have trouble doing that against Martinez, though. He's
7-0 in his career against them, including the playoffs, and hasn't
allowed them to score in 20 innings.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, Nagy blatantly threw at Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, who was fined but not suspended, escalated the incident.
He's the one who was out of bounds, and should be sitting for five
games.
48 wide, 36 vince has picture on dye Spotlight
Ed Zurga A healthy cut, after a siege of injuries, helps explain
why Kansas City outfielder Jermaine Dye is putting up big numbers.
With enchanted April, Dye cast as star, not fluke
</P>
<P>
   A short list of candidates to become the first player ever to
hit double figures in home runs and doubles before May 1 likely
would include the likes of Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Alex
Rodriguez and Vladimir Guerrero. Chances are, it wouldn't have
included Jermaine Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Dye had a nice season in '99, when he hit .294 with 44 doubles,
27 homers and 119 runs batted in. But there was the suspicion that
the Royals outfielder might have enjoyed his career year. After
all, there was nothing in his career to hint at such a season.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his '99 numbers look like a breakthrough season rather
than being a fluke or a career year.
</P>
<P>
   Dye did become the first player in major-league history to hit
double figures in homers (11) and doubles (12) in April. He went
into May leading the American League in homers, doubles, total
bases (83), slugging percentage (.847) and extra-base hits (23).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just confidence,'' Dye said. ``I played pretty good in
the minor leagues coming up. I always knew I could play this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Dye didn't play that well in the minors. He was
drafted by the Braves in the 17th round of the 1993 amateur draft
and batted .347 in the Gulf Coast League, but after that never
topped .300 or hit more than 15 homers.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded to the Royals for Michael Tucker before the '97
season, and while Tucker contributed to a couple of NL East
champions in Atlanta, Dye spent most of his time on the sidelines
nursing various injuries. He played in just 135 games in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ate him up inside,'' Royals general manager Herk Robinson
said. ``He even got to the point where he had freak \Rinjuries\S,
hurting his knee getting out of a car at a Wal-Mart parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dye finally was healthy last year, and showed what he's capable
of. In addition to the fine offensive numbers, he tied for the
league lead with 17 outfield assists.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really matured as a player,'' Robinson said. ``He's
really taken his job as a player and a leader in his own hands.
He's really risen and become a real fine, fine prototypical right
fielder that has been invaluable to this club.''
\Nsubheds: Short hops Clark hurt again Nothing much has changed for
Will Clark since leaving the Rangers and signing with the Orioles
as a free agent before the '99 season. Just as he was in Texas,
he's still effective when healthy. But he has trouble staying
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He went on the disabled list Wednesday because of a strained
left hamstring, his third trip to the injury list since signing
with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Clark appeared in only 77 games last season because of a broken
thumb and bone chips in his left elbow that required surgery on
Aug. 26. He reported to spring training early to make up for lost
time, and was encouraged by having full range of motion in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Before injuring his hamstring he was hitting .367 with a
league-leading .524 on-base percentage. He only had three RBI, but
had scored 18 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointing's not the word,'' Clark said. ``For as much work
as I put in this off-season and spring training, and to get off the
start I'm off to and the team's off to, disappointing's not near a
bad enough word.''
\Nsubheds:Suspensions slow Sox Frank Robinson accomplished
something AL pitchers had a difficult time doing, slowing down the
White Sox. They set a major league record with 181 runs in April,
but scored only 19 runs in their first six games after Robinson
levied his suspensions for the brawls with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee missed three games in Detroit last weekend, and
Magglio Ordonez began his five-game suspension Monday. At the same
time, Frank Thomas is hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.
</P>
<P>
   However, hitting instructor Von Joshua thinks there's more to
the power outage than absences and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the fight, I've watched a change,'' he said. ``That took
a little sting out of them. Some players aren't as aggressive. I
think we went into the Detroit series and several guys changed the
way they were playing. They were tentative. We have to get back to
being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:New Reds struggling When the Reds added Ken Griffey
Jr. and Dante Bichette in off-season trades, their lineup appeared
to be as strong as any in the majors. Instead, the team and the new
guys have struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Through Thursday, the Reds were a game under .500 and 41/2 games
behind the Cardinals in the NL Central. Griffey was hitting .198
(20-for-101) while Bichette was at .206 (21-for-102) with no homers
in his last 80 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   At least Griffey is driving in runs. He had 24 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he's a good ballplayer,'' manager Jack McKeon said.
``He's going to hit. I wish we had four or five guys with 24 RBI. I
think we'd be in good shape.`
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, on the other hand, has only six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hitter's nightmare, to dig yourself a hole early in the
season,'' he said. ``It takes so long to get your numbers back to
normal. What you have to do is grind, get your hits, try to get big
hits and help the team win. Don't even look up. Hold your breath,
go hard and keep working at it.`
\Nsubheds:Indians' offense missing The Indians found out over the
past five seasons that you can slug your way to a division title,
but not to a World Series championship. So they upgraded the
pitching staff by signing free-agent starter Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the pitching's just fine, but the offense is dragging them
down.
</P>
<P>
   They hit .219 (42-for-192) and scored 16 runs in losing four
times in a six-game homestand against the Red Sox and Yankees.
After leading the league with 1,009 runs last year, they're on pace
to score 836.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept saying, `We need pitching,' '' shortstop Omar Vizquel
said. ``Well, we got the pitching and now we can't hit.''
\Nsubheds:Injuries slow Gwynn Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn finally
went on the disabled list after having fluid drained from his left
knee for a fifth time since the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing they could do,'' Gwynn said. ``I couldn't
keep going out there for two days, then have it drained and sit for
three or four days, come back, have it drained again and sit again.
It's too hard on them and it's too hard on me. I can't play this
way, and \Rmanager Bruce Bochy\S can't make the moves he wants to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The best pure hitter of his generation is batting just .186 with
no homers and seven RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to fight my way through it but, offensively, I
can't do what I need to do,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury could cost him a lot of money. The contract extension
he signed in the spring guarantees him a $6 million salary in 2001
if he gets 502 plate appearances this year. But he has played in
just 13 games because of the knee problems and an elbow injury
after being hit with an Al Leiter pitch on Opening Day.
\Nsubheds:Around the NL Mike Hampton pitched like an ace for the
Astros last season, leading the league with 22 wins and posting
career bests in innings (239), strikeouts (177) and ERA (2.90). But
he has been a bust since his trade to the Mets. He leads the major
leagues with 36 walks, and walks-per-nine-innings (8.4). He
admitted he's suffering from ``a little lack of self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit the first ball completely out of Pac Bell Park
and into San Francisco Bay with a blast off Mets reliever Rich
Rodriguez on Monday night, but he doesn't expect there to be many
more. ``There's going to be some guys who can do it,'' he said.
``\RBut\S the ball doesn't carry here like everybody thought it
would. I hit that ball pretty good and it barely got in that
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive explosion hasn't reached Milwaukee. In their past
nine games going into a weekend series against the Expos, the
Brewers scored 22 runs (2.4 per game) and batted .176 (49 for 278).
``We haven't found an answer yet,'' rookie manager Davey Lopes
said. ``When you're not hitting, everything else is magnified. You
look like you are kind of dead, collectively.`
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs played perhaps their best game of the season in Kerry
Wood's first start. They scored 11 runs, with reserve infielder
Willie Greene getting four hits and driving in four runs. Sammy
Sosa made a diving catch. Reliever Brian Williams pitched three
scoreless innings for a save. ``It's not like we play better for
Kerry, but the emotion gets higher because of this kid,'' Mark
Grace said. ``He's special. You don't really elevate your skill,
but it does seem to work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Enron Field yields a lot of homers and runs, but it
still takes a back seat to Denver's Coors Field in the launching
pad category. In a six-game homestand that ended Wednesday, the
Rockies gave up 8.83 runs a game, yet went 4-2 by scoring 10.83
runs a game. The winning team never scored less than 12 runs in any
of the six games.
</P>
<P>
   The ``go figure'' game of the year: The Dodgers ended the
Braves' 15-game winning streak when troubled left-hander Carlos
Perez outdueled multiple Cy Young award winner Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks reliever Mike Morgan has saved for the cycle this
season, preserving victories by going four innings, three innings,
two innings and one inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds finished 12-12 in April, ending five consecutive years
in which they had posted a losing record in the season's opening
month.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Around the AL Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild has a
solution if baseball wants to curb the offensive explosion: widen
home plate from its current 17 inches. ``It would give the pitchers
more room to work with,'' Rothschild said. ``It would make hitters
more aggressive. And it would lead to quicker games.''
</P>
<P>
   White Sox manager Jerry Manuel, who was handed an eight-game
suspension after the brawl between his team and the Tigers, said a
uniform set of rules covering such incidents might cut down on
their frequency. ``Guidelines would be nice,'' he said. ``This is
what's going to happen if you pitch inside, this is what's going to
happen if you charge the mound. If you know what's going to happen,
it might eliminate some of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had a starting outfield of Brian Hunter, Ken
Griffey Jr. and Jay Buhner when Butch Huskey left Seattle last
August. When they played the Twins, Huskey's current team, last
week, the outfield was Mark McLemore, Mike Cameron and Stan Javier.
``I didn't play with any of those guys, and I've only been gone
since last August,'' Huskey said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade that sent Jaime Navarro and John Snyder from the White
Sox to the Brewers for Cal Eldred and Jose Valentin is looking
awfully one-sided. Navarro was released and Snyder has been on the
DL all season, while Eldred was 2-0 going into his start against
the Royals on Friday and Valentin was hitting .283 with five homers
and 18 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the best record in the league, even though they
have the lowest batting average and the lowest fielding percentage
in the East, one win out of David Cone and two RBI out of Chuck
Knoblauch. How? Perhaps because of a bullpen that was the first
ever to go through April without sustaining a loss, that leads the
AL with a 2.52 ERA and is first in saves (11) and fewest hits (67)
and homers (2) allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Twins president Jerry Bell met for two hours with commissioner
Bud Selig on Tuesday to discuss the club's concerns about being in
baseball's only six-team division if Selig's favored realignment
proposal is approved. The Twins are concerned that the addition of
the large-revenue Rangers further would damage their chances of
making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick not only led the league with 29 RBI in April, he
also set a club record. The previous mark was 24, set by Hall of
Famer Frank Robinson in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' Alex Rodriguez won't turn 25 until July 27 but
he's already sixth on the career home run list by shortstops with
156, 12 behind Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:The week ahead The Dodgers, second in the NL West,
could get an idea this week of whether they're really contenders or
just pretenders. They travel to West-leading Arizona for a
three-game series beginning tomorrow, then head to St. Louis for a
three-game series against the Central-leading Cardinals.
\Nsubheds:The final word ``I'm against everything he said. I don't
think they should throw him out of baseball, but he does deserve to
get booed and mooned. I think everyone should be allowed to speak
their mind, and that's what I did.'' _ Andrew Tellers, the Dodgers
fan who mooned Braves reliever John Rocker

GALAXY, WIZARDS BATTLE TO DRAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With all the anticipation of a championship
fight - two unbeaten teams, two scoring machines and defensive
weapons to make both teams complete - Kansas City and the Los
Angeles Galaxy did nothing to enhance or damage its reputations
after 90 minutes and two sudden-death overtime periods.
</P>
<P>
   No knockdowns, no big flurries, just a handful of
counter-punches that left the only two unbeaten teams in Major
League Soccer still unbeaten. As they say overseas, this was
nil-nil, which kind of describes the action of Saturday's 0-0 draw
in front of 17,098 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Wizards (6-0-2, 20 points) were on the road and
without Danish Striker Miklos Molnar (ankle strain), the
psychological edge goes to the Wizards for keeping a slight edge in
the Western Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was any advantage between the lines, the Galaxy
(5-0-3, 18 points) deserves credit for constantly challenging the
organized shape of Kansas City's 4-4-2 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   K.C. goalkeeper Tony Meola recorded his league-leading sixth
shutout of the season, making two big one-handed saves in the last
20 minutes to keep the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Clint Mathis nearly broke free in the 80th
minute, but was pulled down by Wizards defender Nick Garcia,
spoiling the Galaxy's last good scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City had its chances in the first half, but nothing as
dangerous as the Galaxy's scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Using plenty of give-and-go's to break K.C.'s flat four in the
back, Mauricio Cienfuegos left a pass wide for Roy Myers cutting
toward the goal in the 31st minute. Cienfuegos followed the play,
getting a pass back from Myers a few yards in front of the Wizards
net, but Cienfuegos couldn't hammer home the one-touch finish as a
Wizards defender slid to angle his shot wide.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the half, Danny Pena slipped behind Kansas City's
defense to the left side. With everyone shifting right, Simon
Elliott sent a pass the other direction to Pena, unmarked 10 yards
in front of Kansas City's net. Meola rushed out, hurrying Pena's
shot, which skidded of Meola's hand and away from the goal.

HUNDLEY LIFTS DODGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley was living right Saturday night.
About the only thing he couldn't control was his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hit his sixth career grand slam and threw out his first
baserunner of the season in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-6 victory
over the Houston Astros. But every time it appeared Hundley had
done enough, Darren Dreifort needed more.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's grand slam capped a six-run third inning and gave the
Dodgers a comfortable lead. But Dreifort opened the next inning by
allowing a leadoff double to Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   When Bagwell tried to steal third, Hundley threw him out, the
first time he has done that in 19 attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that play I turned to (home plate umpire) Gerry (Davis)
and said, `that's the first one all year,' ``He said, `You're
kidding.'' I wish I was. It felt great to finally get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next inning, Dreifort was back in trouble, allowing two
RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think he pitched that bad,'' Hundley said of
Dreifort, who allowed five hits and four runs in 5 innings. ``We
kind of got in a bad groove, throwing too many fastballs. I'm not
worried about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Eric Karros made it 8-3 with a two-run homer in the
bottom of the fifth, Dreifort opened the sixth by allowing a single
and a walk. Hundley didn't help the inning with a passed ball that
put runners at second and third. But Dreifort allowed both to score
and was pulled after walking Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you need to win a sloppy game when you don't have
your best stuff,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I've been
very pleased with him this year. You don't want to see your pitcher
let the other team back in, but sometimes it happens and you move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers held on to win for the sixth time in eight
games on the homestand, and Hundley hit the club's third grand slam
this season, Dreifort (2-1) remained a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start, Dreifort had took a 10-2 lead into the fifth
inning, but left with a no decision in the Dodgers 13-12 victory
over Florida. Errors by Adrian Beltre and Mark Grudzielanek led to
seven unearned runs in the fifth, but Dreifort also walked two and
gave up back-to-back homers to Mike Lowell and Derrek Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that game I just couldn't stop the bleeding,'' Dreifort
said. ``Tonight, I made some good pitches and some bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that seemed critical, even after a second-inning home
run by Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Houston starter Octavio Dotel (1-3) walked three,
hit a batter and gave up a double to Grudzielanek. But Hundley
dropped the big bomb, hitting a line drive into the lower stands on
a 2-2 fast ball.
</P>
<P>
   It was his sixth home run of the season. His last grand slam
came July 19 at Pittsburgh. Karros and Kevin Elster have the
Dodgers' other slams this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Hundley did something even more rare. He was 0
for 18 throwing out runners this season, although three runners
were picked off first, which counts as a caught stealing Backup
Chad Kreuter was 0 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who entered the game batting .333 with nine homers and
24 RBI, had 30 stolen bases last season. He was not in a running
situation. But with the Astros trailing 6-1 and struggling early
this season, Bagwell tried to shake things up against Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his first of the year, but actually he has done well,''
Johnson said. ``Our pitchers need to be better holding guys on.
Todd is having a hell of a year.''

WHERE WILL MOISO, RUSH GO IN DRAFT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As interpreted by the socially stalwart watchdogs of college
basketball, the NBA may be the scariest place outside the range of
Janet Reno's mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young men in this league are drafted, just like in
war.
</P>
<P>
   So if war is hell and the draft is like war, then it can be
concluded that the NBA Draft is hell.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask any UCLA fan. See, last week, the NBA Draft claimed two
promising Bruin sophomores - 6-foot-10 Jerome Moiso and 6-6 JaRon
Rush, whose name is scrawled in pencil on the NCAA's Most Wanted
List.
</P>
<P>
   But while USC baseball fans didn't burn precious cell phone
minutes waiting to howl with the gods of talk radio over Sean
Burrough's skipping from Wilson High to the minor leagues, the
departure of Moiso and Rush has become a scream.
</P>
<P>
   The counter scream should be ``Grow up!''
</P>
<P>
   For those who refuse to pass judgment and would gladly kiss off
academia for the chance to pocket $4 million in three years
(Moiso's estimated value), we offer the opportunity to accept it
and move on.
</P>
<P>
   When can you expect these rascals to be drafted?
</P>
<P>
   After browbeating five scouts and two NBA personnel executives,
we conclude Moiso could be selected anywhere from 10 to 16 in the
June 28 draft. Sure, he may get bruises and hemorrhoids next
season, but two semesters of NBA 101 will better prepare him for
NBA 2001-2002 than another college campaign with virtually any
coach you can name.
</P>
<P>
   Things are trickier for Rush, a small forward in a two-guard's
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to show something special in Chicago just to get
near the first round,'' said one scout, referring to the pre-draft
camp June 6-12. ``If he had stayed at UCLA another season, he might
have been top 20 next year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a $6,000 tab, based on his celebrated relationship
with a (sit down for this) shady AAU coach.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jason Kapono has admitted to kicking around the notion
of declaring for the draft, but the same talent snoops advise
against this. The former Artesia High standout is a longshot to go
in the first round, prime territory that includes the coveted prize
of a guaranteed three- year contract. &QL; 
Back on Planet Clipper
</P>
<P>
   Donald T. Sterling's little ship of horrors sails on with
interim coach Jim Todd still on board, while Mike Fratello's name
continues to be the favorite that's run up the mast.
</P>
<P>
   According to team sources, the Clips owner really digs the idea
of having his team mentioned in the same paragraph with Fratello,
the ex-Hawks and Cavaliers coach, who now makes a living as a game
analyst for TNT and studio guru for NBC. The cheerfully eccentric
Sterling even has gone as far as to seek opinions from members of
the team's support staff in regard to the possible hiring of
Fratello.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 seasons as an NBA head coach, the ``Czar of the
Telestrator'' has a .552 winning percentage with one division title
and nine playoff appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Contact has been made with the Clips by Fratello, who probably
is seeking a deal in the $5 million-per-year range. While it may
seem nutty to think Sterling would approach that figure, he did
throw some market-value loot at Larry Brown a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Todd, assistant coach No. 2 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
assistant coach No. 1 Dennis Johnson - considered a solid and
affordable candidate - have been reporting to their event-level
offices at Staples Center for draft and off-season preparation.
Just in case it involves them.
</P>
<P>
   As for free agent shooting guard Derek Anderson, don't bite on
any sign-and-trade stories involving the Clippers and free agent
Denver guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad. Sure, Anderson would like to play
in Denver, but his price tag (in the $6 million per year ballpark)
is about double the market value for Abdul-Wahad. For the Nuggets
to clear Anderson's contract under salary-cap rules, they'd have to
send back a players whose deals would be of equal value. Simply
put, they'd add a garbage-time all- star (or two) the Clippers
won't want. By the way, Clipper personnel man Elgin Baylor would
prefer a sign-and-keep deal with the eager-to-leave Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson still has a grip on San Antonio's interest, but if the
Spurs re-sign Tim Duncan (seems very likely now), they'd be capped
out and would need to offer the Clips a sign-and-trade deal
involving their own garage-sale bench warmers.
</P>
<P>
   On deck in this Clipper review is free agent power forward
Maurice Taylor, who - according to league sources - isn't exactly
as coveted by Orlando as he and agent David Falk had hoped. That
goes double for the hometown Detroit Pistons, who - thanks to the
rehiring of George Irvine and front-office rise of Joe Dumars may
be able to keep Grant Hill, severely limiting their spending money.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published rumor unveiling an interest in returning to
the Clips by Kings reserve point guard Darrick Martin (UCLA, St.
Anthony's High) was just plain silly. Darrick, that ship has
sailed.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations: Indiana assistant coach Rick Carlisle
remains a solid prospect to replace Larry Bird on the Pacers' hot
seat. Other teams interested in Carlisle should realize that one of
his coaching cronies is Miami assistant Mark Iavaroni. Iavaroni
wasn't much of a player, but the Pete Newell coaching disciple is
considered one of the best teachers of post play in the NBA. It's
no cinch that Iavaroni would leave the Heat to join Carlisle, but
teams with young, raw inside players should think about it. ...
After Darrell Walker left Rockford of the CBA to become interim
coach of the Wizards, ex-Detroit Bad Boy Rick Mahorn scooted over
one seat and did quite well with the Lightning. This doesn't figure
to yield an NBA head-coaching gig this year, but a source said
Larry Brown would like to have Mahorn as an assistant in Philly.
...
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has reported that high school quantum leaper Darius Miles
(East St. Louis, Ill.) will be represented by Falk. But a source in
Falk's office says the report was bogus. Miles, who could be
selected in the 5-8 range of the June 28 NBA Draft's first round,
has been wooed by rising agent star Bill Duffy, but he may be
leaning toward Eric Rudolph, who represents athletes on behalf of
an entertainment crossover group fronted by rap star Jay-Z. Worked
well for Master P, right? ... Missouri sophomore point guard Keyon
Dooling will stick with his decision to ride the draft - if
pre-draft buzz puts him in the top 20. According to three NBA
scouts, the swift Dooling will go in the 15-20 range. ... Despite
frequent demonstrations of limited court savvy, at least two league
personnel directors believe DeShawn Stevenson (Washington Union HS,
Fresno) has enough two-guard promise to be chosen midway through
the first round. ... An NBA assistant with head-coaching chops is
the Lakers' Jim Cleamons. According to a league source, Cleamons -
one of the hardest-working, no-nonsense coaches in the business -
is content as Phil Jackson's understudy and not interested in the
Clippers job. ... Shaquille O'Neal, proving his movie-watching
tastes are as sophisticated as those he stars in, recently added
his own personal copy of the Keith Closs beat-down film. O'Neal
used a portable DVD player to screen it with Chris Webber in a
Staples Center hallway after Game 1 of the Kings-Lakers series.
O'Neal, a source reports, enjoyed the action, but thought the Closs
premise was derivative. Working title? ``Closstrophobia.''

 &HT;    PUTIN SWORN IN AS RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT
 &HT;    550 words &AMP; ADD
 &HT;    By Margaret Coker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW -- Vowing to rebuild the country, safeguard human rights
and work ``openly and honestly'' to serve the people, Vladimir
Putin on Sunday became the second democratically elected president
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the 47-year-old former head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, the successor agency to the KGB, thereby assumed immense
and unrivalled authority as leader of the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Just three hours after the inauguration, Putin named 42-year-old
Mikhail Kasyanov as acting prime minister. Kasyanov, the outgoing
first deputy premier and finance minister, is almost certain to
gain parliamentary approval. He is well known in the West as a
financial expert and foreign debt negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The relative youth of the two top men also marks a clear move to
a new generation of Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute ceremony took place in sumptuous St. Andrew's
Hall, a wing of Grand Kremlin Palace, in the heart of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-minute acceptance speech marking his meteoric
eight-month rise to power, Putin promised to usher in a new era for
the nation impoverished by a decade of political upheaval,
corruption and botched economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that in my actions I will be guided only by
national interests,'' Putin said, flanked by a frail Boris Yeltsin,
the former president, and Marat Baglai, chairman of the
Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I will not avoid mistakes but what I promise, what I can
really promise, is that I will work openly and honestly,'' he said,
adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it my holy duty to consolidate Russian society, and
every day and every hour to remember that we have one nation, one
state, one common future together.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign message centered on the need to revive Russia,
what he calls a ``rich country of poor people.'' But he did not
disclose any details of his yet-unpublished economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Putin took over as acting president when Yeltsin, 69, abruptly
resigned on New Year's Eve. Since then, his detractors have accused
him of committing human rights abuses in the seven-month Chechen
conflict and have voiced concern over how a career KGB officer
could govern democratically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judo black-belt and avid swimmer who rose from
relative obscurity last summer to become prime minister and
Yeltsin's chosen successor as president has enjoyed approval rating
above 70 percent. He won the March 26 presidential election with a
clear 52 percent majority of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin spokesman said the symbolism behind the ornate
ceremony was aimed at highlighting the peaceful transfer of power
and the rise of a new era, as well as codify a sense of tradition.
For instance, Putin took his oath of office using the same red,
leather-covered copy of the constitution that Yeltsin once did.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, dressed in a dark gray suit and gray tie, spoke in the
Kremlin Throne Room, a spacious place with walls and pillars
covered in gold leaf and polished parquet floors in front of about
1,000 guests for the closely choreographed ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The palace's restoration was overseen by the former head of the
Presidential Property Management, Pavel Borodin, and is the subject
of an ongoing embezzlement scandal involving him and an estimated
80 other former Kremlin officials. Swiss authorities are currently
investigating the case. Putin served under Borodin before being
appointed FSB chairman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites interviewed Sunday on a bright but blustery day in
the Russian capital expressed a hopeful mood about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have such a young, energetic president. I hope
that he does everything that he promises. I want a better country,
like he says he does,''
</P>
<P>
   said Ludmila Vladimirova, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting Russia's young democratic tradition, the inauguration
ceremony took on weighty symbolic value. The final event schedule
was approved only on Friday, leaving a last minute rush for
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts judged the results as mixed at best, with some
television commentators likening the event to a Czarist coronation
and others discussing the irony of a president who ran on an
anti-corruption campaign standing in a room surrounded by more
wealth that most Russians could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the organizers) were trying not to imbue the event
with to much connection to (the past administration), which is
associated in the Russian public mind with corruption and mistakes,
then they didn't quite succeed,'' said Lilia Schvetsova, an analyst
at the Moscow Carnegie Endowment Center, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Cost-wise, the event itself was quite modest, with the Kremlin
spending only around $214,000, compared to nearly $30 million for
President Clinton's second inauguration in 1997. Putin said he
wanted less pomp than Yeltsin's inauguration so that it would not
overshadow the popular May 9 holiday to mark
</P>
<P>
   the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, of the regular people Putin thanked in his speech
for supporting him were in attendance. Putin did not make any
public appearances during the day.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Putin left the Kremlin Palace to a 30-gun
salute by soldiers flanking the palace grounds. He inspected a
squadron of troops, laid a wreath at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier and received a blessing by Russian Orthodox Church leader,
Patriarch Alexiy II.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the newly inaugurated president and his wife Ludmilla
attended a concert at the Kremlin's Soviet-era theater and presided
over a gala
</P>
<P>
   reception -- with an invitation list that was even more
selective than the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president is the formal head of state and
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, controls the government,
names most top officials and has the last word in most state
affairs. He can be impeached only with great difficulty.

case of Elian Gonzalez, as well as the three judges presiding over
the matter. One judge is considered the court's most conservative _

   WACO, Texas _ It's 7:30 p.m. on a weeknight and the usual
post-work crowd of customers at the H-E-B is lined up to check out.
</P>
<P>
   In Lane 6, parents entertain small children in baskets,
bachelors hold cases of brew and professionals loosen ties and
remove jackets while they thumb through magazines.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Lane 6 seems to mind that they're waiting in the
longest line in the store.
</P>
<P>
   That often happens when Jacklynn Adams is on the other side of
the register.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ya doin', ma'am? Is there anything else I can get you
before I get started?'' Adams asks, smiling, as a middle-age woman
steps up to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Adams quickly swipes the groceries across the scanner, paying
attention to nearly everything the woman buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh, Ben and Jerry's has it goin' on. I love that,'' she says
as she scans a carton of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   When she scans a package of frozen vegetables, she stops and
looks at the customer to offer her a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a coupon for this, honey? 'Cause if you don't, I
got one for you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She takes out a coupon from a zipper pouch next to the register,
scans it and puts it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you interested in some toothpaste for 99 cents? This is a
great deal,'' she says, pointing to a basket full of Colgate tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The woman politely declines and hands over a check for $89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, honey,'' Adams says and reaches across to shake the
customer's hand. ``Ma'am, you have a good day. Take care, ya hear?
God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman nods and walks out with a smile on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has once again accomplished two of the goals she sets
every day: She's made a customer happy and she's saved her money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother used to say, 'If you keep your fist closed, you
can't receive any blessings and you can't give anything out,'' the
46-year-old cashier says.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy has H-E-B customers asking for ``Miss Jackie''
by name, her bosses singing her praises and other grocery stores
trying to woo her away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people blend into the woodwork, and Jackie stands out,''
says H-E-B store manager Brent Ackors. ``I've been in the grocery
store business for 26 years, and I've never had (an employee) that
excited, that energetic. It's not normal. It's not anywhere close
to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a cashier, Adams is ``the coupon lady,'' a
responsibility she created herself and a title she works hard at
every day. After her ``graveyard'' shift as a cashier ends each
night, she spends two to three hours clipping coupons and taping
them to food displays. Then, when inspiration hits, she opens a
black book of jingles and pens a ditty or two about an upcoming
sale item.
</P>
<P>
   Adams uses her own sense of humor and musical talent to compose
her jingles. Every night on the hour, she clicks on the intercom
and serenades customers with one of her catchy songs. On a recent
night, her 9 p.m. jingle was ``Get Ready for H-E-B,'' which
advertised a program that lets customers earn money toward gas with
their groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never knew shoppers who make me feel the way that you do,
you're all right/You come in her each and every day, yes you do
dears, you're outta sight.'/So fe-fi-fo-fum, look out shoppers,
cause here we come/And we're bringing good sales to you/So get
ready, get ready for H-E-B.''
</P>
<P>
   After she announces the fuel rewards program, she signs off
with, ``As always, thanks for shopping your super-Texas friendly
H-E-B store.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if customers have never had Miss Jackie as a cashier, they
probably know her voice from the jingles she sings over the
intercom, Ackors says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are her regular customers, like Jerry Lassetter,
who gets a hug from Adams when she sees him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only live a couple blocks away, so I come in and see her
about every day,'' Lassetter says as Adams helps him find the
Cheese Nips.
</P>
<P>
   Adams says her natural tendency to help people and to save money
both come from her upbringing. She grew up in Philadelphia, the
youngest of seven children.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers playing ``grocery store'' with her siblings when
they were young. Her first real job at a supermarket came in
Philadelphia in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the manager, 'If you'll give me a chance, I'll be
the best worker you've got,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she attended Penn State in the early 1970s but cut
her academic career short when she married and had the first of six
children. Adams pursued her interests in music, entering vocal
contests, writing gospel songs and directing a local children's
choir in Philadelphia. She also worked as a seamstress, at a pizza
parlor and at a grocery store when her children were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving money and taking care of us was always important to
her,'' says Adams' 25-year-old daughter Kiante Davis. ``She loves
to work and loves working with people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was like my mom,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Adams decided to leave Philadelphia for a warmer
climate. She picked Phoenix first, but she says she wanted to live
in a place where the people were friendlier. So, in the spring of
that year, she went to the library, opened a map and picked Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she never wants to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waco's got the friendliest people in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she started working at a Save-a-Lot grocery store and
worked her way up to manager. After the store closed, she was
offered a management position at H-E-B in 1997. But she chose to
become a cashier instead to stay closer to her favorite people, the
customers, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a full calendar. Besides working full-time at H-E-B
at night, she delivers pizzas for Pizza Hut part-time during the
day. (She has to keep both her uniforms close by so she can change
quickly from one to the other.) In her spare time, she runs errands
for house-bound senior citizens, and she gives food to homeless and
needy people.
</P>
<P>
   Adams sometimes takes advantage of H-E-B sales to give food to
others. Recently, she bought $130 worth of Easter candy to
distribute to needy children. And last Christmas, she piled 120
jugs of holiday punch into her 1995 Corsica and gave them to
homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Her altruistic gestures extend to the animals in the community,
too. She takes in homeless dogs and cats, feeds them and gives them
shelter. Right now, she has 10 dogs and 12 cats, but she's had as
many as 22 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're my babies,'' she says. ``I go home and sing to them,
and they sing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   She says her motivation to work hard and to give to others comes
from her 16 grandchildren. Besides wanting to save money to help
them with college, she wants to set a good example for them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep our kids motivated, they keep us rejuvenated,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Her service at H-E-B and in the community has not gone
unnoticed. She has a cupful of customer service buttons, and she
was honored as the H-E-B Partner of the Year in 1998. She has also
received a Waco City Works Award.
</P>
<P>
   Several local grocery stores, including Wal-Mart and Winn Dixie,
have tried unsuccessfully to woo her away from H-E-B, Ackors said.
He wouldn't say whether he offered her more money to stay at the
store. But he acknowledges that when it's time to dole out raises
for merit, her name is high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say I would do whatever I needed to keep her
here,'' Ackors says. ``The best compliment I could give her is to
say that I have 340 (employees) at H-E-B, and I wish I had 340
people just like Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, Adams will leave H-E-B, she says. She wants
to open her own restaurant in Waco in the next five years or so.
The cuisine will consist of recipes _ from German to Mexican _ that
she has learned from her customers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success comes at all levels, but I won't feel successful until
I open my own restaurant,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And when she does, you can bet she'll offer coupon specials.

 &HT;    Governor is right to seek clarification on blind trust
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Warning: This column could be hazardous to people
infected with political cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   A politician in hot water for trying to do the right thing? It's
a rarity. But that's what happened to Gov. Roy Barnes recently.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes doesn't always do the right thing. Not on gun control.
Not on changing the state flag. Not so far, at least. But on
anything to do with openness in government, you can pretty much
count on Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with his legislative record on sunshine in
government, Barnes' first act as governor was to ask the General
Assembly to tighten requirements relating to open records and
meetings so the people's business can't be hidden from the people.
But when the governor and his lawyers asked the Secretary of State
how to report Barnes' blind trust for his annual financial
disclosure, Barnes looked at first as if he were trying to hide
something.
</P>
<P>
   If the governor had kept quiet and reported the blind trust in
the same manner former Gov. Zell Miller did, the issue might never
have arisen. It's a good thing he didn't because the law needs
fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and his wife Marie, who have a net worth estimated at
$9.6 million, created the blind trust shortly after the governor's
election. They released the trust document and a list of the assets
placed in it. Wealthy office holders, especially at the federal
level, often use blind trusts to prevent perceived or real
conflicts of interest. The idea is to keep public officials from
knowing how their assets are being managed. That prevents
politicians or their cronies from using inside information for
personal enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law is silent on reporting blind trusts, but demands
that an office holder disclose the ``name, address, and principal
activity'' of any ``business entity'' (including a trust) in which
he or she has more than a 10 percent ownership. But another section
of the state law says officials must disclose real estate holdings
in excess of $20,000 in which they have ``a direct ownership''
interest. The law also demands disclosure of annual payments in
excess of $20,000 from a business interest. If such reporting is
applied to a blind trust, however, the purpose of the trust would
be defeated and the legal requirements of the trust violated.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was so concerned about the muddle that he called on the
state's foremost legal ethics expert, Randolph Thrower, to help
him. Thrower is best known for having resigned as Commissioner of
the Internal Revenue Service when President Nixon tried to misuse
the agency for political purposes during Watergate. Thrower advised
Barnes that a blind trust legally removes the governor from a
``direct ownership'' interest in trust assets. So a literal
interpretation of the state law would only require disclosure of
the trust's existence, and the name and address of the trustee. But
Thrower asked Secretary of State Cathy Cox to request a formal
Attorney General's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Lee, a lawyer who heads the State Ethics Commission,
disagreed with Thrower's interpretation. He said it would render
the state's personal financial disclosure law ``impotent and
meaningless.'' Every asset in the trust which meets the threshold
amount or ownership percentage for reporting should be disclosed,
Lee said _ although he conceded that such an interpretation defeats
the purpose of a blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Barnes said simply that the public should
know everything he knows about the blind trust. Thrower said the
governor planned to disclose the trust's tax return, its annual
worth and any additional assets placed in it _ all of which could
probably be done without violating the terms of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the Attorney General decides about this legal
quagmire, two things are clear: State disclosure laws need to be
amended to address blind trusts; and the governor has tried to do
the right thing.

<P>
   EURO (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The euro was supposed to unify the
economies of 11 European nations and be a symbol of stability to
rival the dollar, the yen and even the British pound. But so far it
has been a boon to the very currencies with which it was supposed
to compete. Now Americans brandishing dollars are finding bargains

   CALIF-BOWLING-ALLEY (Los Angeles) _ For the last five years,
Jacqueline Sowell has loved to go to the Holiday Bowl, a faded
bowling alley on a faded street in a faded district of Los Angeles.
Walking into the Bowl renewed her faith. It showed her day after
day just how well people of diverse backgrounds and races can get
along. But early Saturday morning, after 42 years, the Holiday Bowl
was closed. And a few hours after the last balls thundered down the
lanes, a group of Sowell's neighbors, co-workers and friends were
standing outside, holding signs, declaring the Bowl ``A Landmark of
Diversity'' and urging the new owners and the city to ``Preserve
Not Destroy.'' By Don Terry.

   CLINTON-SCHEDULE (Washington) _ There are fewer than 6,000 hours
left in the Clinton presidency, a dwindling block of time that many
people want to share. Putting together Clinton's schedule in these
final months is a delicate balancing act that involves squeezing
together fund-raising dinners, presidential speeches and photo ops
with golf games, foreign trips and overnight stays in Chappaqua,
N.Y. By Marc Lacey.

<P>
   ECON-POLITICS (Washington) _ This week offered a stunning
contradiction in numbers: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the
lowest in 30 years, and two major national polls showing Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5
percentage points. To put that contrast in perspective, the last
time a president's party lost the White House in good times was
1920. So why isn't the booming economy blowing Bush away? By Adam
Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH-REPUBS (Salt Lake City) _ Utah is one of the most
Republican states in the country. But in Utah, there are
Republicans and there are Republicans. At the Republican state
party convention, even Sen. Orrin Hatch was greeted with a healthy
mix of boos and jeers. So was Gov. Michael Leavitt, who is running
for a third term against three challengers and failed to reach 60
percent in any of three ballots, putting him in a primary for the
first time since 1992. ``These conventions are the political
version of hazing,'' Leavitt said. ``You have to expect it as a
two-term incumbent.'' By Michael Janofsky.

BARRY ULANOV, SCHOLAR AND WRITER, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barry Ulanov, a professor and author or translator of
nearly 50 books whose interests included jazz, theater, Christian
humanism, visual art, Carl Jung and Catholic literature, died April
30 at his home in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan and
Woodbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Ulanov placed popular culture within the context of American art
rather than isolating it as mere entertainment, and wrote some of
America's first serious books on jazz. He taught at Princeton
University and Barnard College for almost four decades, covering
subjects as varied as literature, art, religion and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan to Nathan and Jeanette Ulanov, who had
immigrated from Russia. His father was concertmaster of Arturo
Toscanini's NBC Philharmonic and had a horror of jazz. He wanted
his son to become a classical violinist.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Ulanov, already smitten with jazz, broke both
his wrists in a car accident as a teen-ager; this served as a
convenient excuse to stop playing the violin. He chose Columbia
University over Harvard to be closer to Harlem's jazz scene. There
he studied with the anthropologist Franz Boas and the critic Lionel
Trilling; he edited the literary magazine, publishing some of the
first articles and cartoons by Thomas Merton; and began to write
about jazz for The Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1939 he became the editor of Metronome, a
classical music magazine that also covered white swing bands. He
remade the magazine, adding a focus on jazz, bebop and black
performers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s he planned a trilogy on the figures he considered
most important in American popular music: Duke Ellington, Bing
Crosby and Louis Armstrong. ``Duke Ellington,'' published in 1946,
was the first biography of Ellington. ``The Incredible Crosby'' was
published in 1948; the Armstrong book was never written. Ulanov
also wrote two overviews of jazz history, ``A History of Jazz in
America'' and ``A Handbook of Jazz,'' both in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, he wrote about music for Esquire, Vogue, and
Down Beat, as well as scripts for radio and television. He was
known for championing bebop performers, particularly Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker. He was also an early crusader for the
work of the pianist Lennie Tristano, who repaid the favor by
writing a tune called ``Coolin' Off With Ulanov.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Ulanov and his first wife, Joan Bel Geddes, daughter of
the stage designer Norman Bel Geddes, converted to Catholicism.
(They were divorced in 1968.) Much of his writing and teaching from
then on involved religion.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, as Ulanov began teaching, he wrote and translated
several books on religion and culture, as well as American art.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those teachers you either hated or you loved,''
said his daughter Anne.
</P>
<P>
   Ulanov, an imposing presence, was known for uniting disciplines
in his classes. He taught in the English department at Princeton
from 1951 to 1953 and at Barnard College from 1953 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the Catholic Renascence Society, a group
that included the author Flannery O'Connor; with Bel Geddes he
translated essays by the French Catholic writer Georges Bernanos;
and he created the St. Thomas More Society, an intellectual
discussion group. He was a member of the Vatican II Council,
helping to translate the Roman Catholic Mass into the vernacular
from Latin. He also supported amplified guitars and rock music in
the church.
</P>
<P>
   The last two decades of Ulanov's career were dedicated to a
combined exploration of religion and psychology. With his second
wife, Ann Belford Ulanov, a professor of psychiatry and religion at
Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, he published a dozen
books. After leaving Barnard, he taught one course each semester at
Union Theological Seminary on psychiatry and religion until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; his daughters, Anne, of
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Katherine, of the Bronx; a son, Nicholas,
of Princeton, N.J., London and Paris; and two grandchildren.

NEWS ANALYSIS: DIGITAL FUTURE UP FOR GRABS IN CABLE BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used
in the 11th graf instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable
to some newspaper systems.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pick up the remote control in most households and the odds are
that one of a half-dozen companies decided which channels would be
available. For years, squeezing a new network onto the limited
available lineup meant cutting deals with Tele-Communications Inc.
(now part of AT&AMP;T), Time Warner and a handful of other
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The giants' power was displayed in its raw form last week when
Time Warner cut off Disney's ABC network from its systems for a day
and a half. While that dispute was largely over the financial terms
of a cable deal, Disney said it was also concerned that Time
Warner, once merged with America Online, would take a similar
gatekeeping role in an ever-expanding array of media.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, in fact, America Online and Time Warner already
control 13 million cable households and more than 20 million
Internet accounts. And together they are in a strong position to
influence the evolution of high-speed Internet access over cable,
interactive television and possibly the digital distribution of
music as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the first major battles in which the parties
are talking about what the rules of the road will be in the digital
future,'' said Blair Levin, a former Federal Communications
Commission official. ``Broadcasting is heavily regulated, but the
government has a hands-off approach to the Internet. We don't know
which will apply to interactive television.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so clear that the AOL-Time Warner distribution
networks would always give it the upper hand. The limits on
channels that restrict traditional cable systems do not affect the
digital world. Moreover, the creators of popular programming have a
more direct relationship with consumers than the cable networks or
Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Look only at the outrage vented at Time Warner by its customers,
as well as regulators and lawmakers, when the public could not find
out who wanted to be a millionaire. With ABC disconnected for one
day, some 25,000 people took up Disney's offer of a free dish to
get satellite television, the death star that haunts cable's
future.
</P>
<P>
   As with any negotiation between producer and supplier, there is
high-stakes jockeying between television networks and the cable
systems. Cable companies have been able to rebuff broadcasters'
demands for cash payments for the right to use the signals of the
major over-the-air networks. But the cable systems have agreed to
carry new cable channels started by the broadcast networks, and to
pay the customary fees for any cable-only programming.
</P>
<P>
   These negotiations have given the broadcast networks an edge at
the moment that programmers are most vulnerable to cable systems:
when they are starting a network. Once programming becomes popular,
it is the networks that have the upper hand. ESPN, Disney's sports
network, for example, has regularly been able to force cable
operators to pay more to cover its rising costs for the broadcast
rights to sports events.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Time Warner, in fact, acknowledged this
balancing act in the post-merger organizational structure they
announced last week. They separated units that create music,
movies, television programs and books from those that distribute
programming on cable, on broadcast television and over the
Internet. This is meant to encourage the company's Home Box Office
network, for example, to buy movies from all studios, and its
Warner Brothers film division to sell the movies it produces to all
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The coming years will see battles like this multiply along with
the numbers of new communications platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Before its deal with Time Warner, America Online complained that
the cable systems were blocking it from offering high-speed
Internet access over cable wires. AT&AMP;T had granted exclusive rights
to Excite(at)Home and Time Warner had made a similar deal with Road
Runner, which it controls. Since the merger agreement, both sides
have given ground. And the cable operators seem to have agreed to
allow multiple high-speed services to coexist on their systems. But
the cable companies say the arrangements should be subject to
commercial negotiations, not regulations that would force them to
carry all high-speed services.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many people argue that the trend of modern
technology is away from closed systems to more open models. Perhaps
the extreme case is the technology that allows people to copy and
download music over the Internet, zooming past such details as
copyrights and royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like the 1960s writ large,'' said Gerald
Levin, Time Warner's chairman, who will be chief executive of AOL
Time Warner. ``It is deconstructing everything that existed because
of a zone of power and reconstructing things based on democratic
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest battleground in the struggle for control of
digital programming will be interactive television. Cable and
satellite systems are beginning to replace their set-top boxes with
new devices using digital technology. At first these will simply
allow more television channels and a fast Internet connection.
Later, the boxes will allow interactive services like chat, e-mail
and online shopping to be superimposed over television pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But those systems raise thorny questions. Who, for example, has
the right to run the chat room next to Monday Night Football _ ABC
or the cable system that provided the set-top box? And the stakes
rise when it comes to a remote-control button for ordering the
goods advertised in commercials, because the owner of the button
could receive a fee for every sale. The cable companies argue that
interactive television is no different from new channels and that
they have the right to decide what services are offered on their
systems. The networks say these services are extensions of their
existing programs and should be carried by the cable systems with
no additional payment.
</P>
<P>
   Such a fight has already erupted over a system that creates an
on-screen program guide available on some new television sets.
Gemstar Development, which created the service, transmits the
program information in an unused part of the signals of some
television stations. Time Warner's cable systems have blocked the
Gemstar signal, demanding separate payment for access. Gemstar has
sued Time Warner, saying it has no right to separate the data from
the rest of the broadcast signals.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not clear how the courts or the marketplace will
decide these fights. But there is no doubt that the distribution
networks and the programmers will be engaged in many such battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old model, it was easy to know what everybody did,''
said Saul Shapiro, chief executive of Gist, a company developing
interactive TV services. ``The networks ran programs and inserted
ads. And no one messed with that. In the future, there will be a
multiplicity of voices.''

RECONSTRUCTING THE GENESIS OF A BLUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, exactly, was Time Warner thinking?
</P>
<P>
   When the next history of public relations is written, the
company's decision to block the ABC television network in 3.5
million homes last Monday will surely be a prominent chapter.
</P>
<P>
   In just 39 hours _ the time it took for it to restore the ABC
signal _ Time Warner managed to anger many of its customers, rile
local and national politicians, provoke a tough editorial in The
New York Times, draw the ire of the Federal Communications
Commission, give its satellite competitors a rare opening to grab
customers and upset what had looked like smooth sailing on the way
to approval of its merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   And it made ABC's parent, Walt Disney, no media midget itself,
look, in many eyes, like a helpless victim.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives now acknowledge that they erred. This
came about, they say, through a legal miscalculation and a
conviction that Disney would back down. It is also clear that
judgments may have been clouded by emotion. For months, tension had
been building as negotiators tried to resolve how much Time Warner
should pay Disney for the use of three of its cable channels and
whether Disney would renew Time Warner's right to carry the ABC
network.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the atmosphere of the bargaining was
poisonous. Five months of negotiating had gone nowhere. Deadlines
were extended seven times. Time Warner accused Disney of blackmail
for threatening to pull its ABC signal if Time Warner did not meet
its demands. Disney accused Time Warner of shortchanging it on its
valuable ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, two Disney executives were asked to leave the Time
Warner offices, and by late April face-to-face talks had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Wednesday, April 26, five days before the latest
negotiating deadline, when Time Warner's rights to carry the ABC
network were to expire. ABC faxed a terse letter to Time Warner
notifying it that Disney expected Time Warner to continue carrying
the ABC signal through May 24, after the end of the sweeps period,
when stations measure audiences to determine what to charge
advertisers. Time Warner had been insisting on an eight-month
extension.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the fax set off the tempers of some Time Warner
executives, who felt ABC was negotiating by fiat. Previously,
before the other deadlines, ABC had faxed polite requests for
signatures on proposed extension agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, they were saying, `We give you the right to
carry our signal,' '' said Mike Luftman, spokesman for Time Warner
Cable. ``We felt that clearly things had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives began to prepare for the worst. They
ordered an advertising agency to create a blaring message to
replace the ABC signal, the dramatic sentence ``Disney has taken
ABC away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, they expected no Armageddon. For one thing, they
thought ABC would never allow its programming to be pulled during a
sweeps month, especially because it would jeopardize its chance to
finish the season as the No. 1 network for the first time in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, both sides were interpreting the law differently.
ABC maintained that an FCC regulation stipulated that its signal
could not be pulled in a sweeps month. Time Warner's lawyers argued
that, barring mutual agreement on an extension, it had to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Within Time Warner, executives debated what to do if Disney
stood its ground. Some saw blocking the network signal as a real
risk. A cable company _ an institution about as popular as a
parking violations bureau and often the target of accusations of
monopolistic practices _ was more likely to take the blame than a
network, these people argued.
</P>
<P>
   But others saw advantages. Assuming the law was on Time Warner's
side, ABC would potentially face big advertising revenue losses _
up to $3 million a day, according to some estimates. And perhaps
Disney, a huge conglomerate, would take just as much blame, if not
more, if Time Warner put its message out effectively. And then
there was also the resentment at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point you have to put your foot down and be a man and
stand up and say `Look,''' Fred Dressler, Time Warner's senior vice
president for programming, later told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, April 30, came, and still no agreement had been reached.
More terse faxes went back and forth that afternoon. Neither side
budged. By around 8:30 p.m., Disney executives began to sense that
Time Warner's threat to pull the ABC signal was real, though they
still found it hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Was Disney playing the bullfighter taunting the bull? There is
no evidence that this was the corporate plan, though pulling the
singal clearly played into Disney's strategy of painting Time
Warner as a monopolist that would become even bigger should its
merger with AOL win approval.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives were convinced, meanwhile, that they had
Disney cornered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear they didn't think we would drop, and we didn't
think they would let us drop,'' said Dressler, who led the Time
Warner negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Luftman, the Time Warner Cable spokesman, said, ``Right up until
the last minute, we were hoping to get something acceptable on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   But Preston R. Padden, the Washington lobbyist for Disney, who
had become increasingly involved in the negotiations, said: ``All
we could do was sit in front of the TV and wait until midnight to
see what they were going to do. I didn't think they were going to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With no compromise offer from Disney, Time Warner executives
felt there was no turning back. Not long before midnight, Time
Warner Cable's president, Joseph J. Collins, alerted Gerald M.
Levin, the Time Warner chairman, that he was about to order his
engineers to block the ABC signal. Levin supported the decision.
Executives said Stephen M. Case, the America Online chairman, was
also apprised of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m., the ABC screen went briefly to static before the
accusation against Disney appeared on a blue screen in bright
yellow letters. Padden was in his room at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Manhattan. ``I had a very sick feeling in the pit of my stomach,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where things stood for Time Warner were pretty clear within 24
hours. In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attacked Time Warner as
a predatory monopoly. ``This is an example of what happens when you
let a monopoly get too big,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney dispatched its lawyers to the Washington offices of the
FCC, where they requested that the commission force Time Warner to
transmit its signals based on the sweeps regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the same building, Time Warner representatives made their
case. They thought they were getting positive signals. But later in
the day, during a meeting with the commission's cable bureau, Time
Warner had a different feeling.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, The New York Times published an editorial that said
the threat to Disney by a combined America Online and Time Warner
was real.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10 a.m. that day, Dressler said, Time Warner executives
decided it was time to try a resolution. It was becoming rapidly
clear that Time Warner was badly losing the public relations war,
though both sides were suffering to some degree. ``We certainly
knew at that point that our customers weren't happy,'' Dressler
said. ``We thought it was in our interest, certainly in theirs as
well, to extend the olive branch.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference, Collins announced that he
had offered Disney an extension of the negotiations until October.
During the news conference, Robert Iger, the Disney president, sent
a fax to Time Warner officials proposing July 15 as the next
deadline. Collins accepted immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the FCC ruled that Time Warner had indeed violated
the law by blocking ABC from its systems during a sweeps month. The
company received a strong rebuke from FCC Chairman William E.
Kennard, who declared, ``No company should use consumers in a
private contract dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how much the dispute will hurt Time Warner
as it tries to conclude its merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we decide to take a stand now?'' Dressler said. ``We
thought it was the right time. They were just pushing us and
pushing us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kurt Przybilla was growing up in International Falls,
Minn., he and his three sisters looked forward every summer to the
day their father would put up the geodesic jungle gym in their back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   That jungle gym inspired a lifelong fascination with Buckminster
Fuller, the architect and futuristic thinker who invented the
geodesic dome, said Przybilla, who is now a 35-year-old English
teacher in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Przybilla was wandering around New York's
Chinatown when he stumbled upon some small acrylic balls at a store
called Industrial Plastics. it occurred to him that he could use
them to make models of the structures associated with Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla took the balls home, glued them together into
different configurations and set them on his desk. At first he
experimented with stacking them into towers. Then one day he picked
up one of his models and set it spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Though it had no pointed edge, it twirled like a top. Thus was
born Przybilla's newly patented invention, which he describes as an
omnidirectional top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have a single stem like a traditional top, which
spins on only one axis,'' Przybilla said. ``It can spin on any of
its spheres.''
</P>
<P>
   To many people, Przybilla's tops might look like molecular
models, or perhaps those clusters of blown-glass grapes in
grandmother's fruit bowl. But when Przybilla looks at one of his
tops, he sees its inner geometric configuration.
</P>
<P>
   When one imagines the centers of the spheres as dots connected
by lines, a cluster of four balls describes a tetrahedron, a
three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces. Przybilla's
tops also come in clusters of six (an octahedron, with eight
triangular faces when the imaginary dots are connected), 12 (an
icosahedron, with 20 faces) and 13 (a cube octahedron, which
despite its extra ball has only 14 faces).
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla says that his tops can help children develop an
intuitive understanding of physics or chemistry in much the same
way that an understanding of geometry can grow out of playing with
square, triangular and rectangular blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't have to be presented with the ideas or theories
behind the shapes to absorb the information that the shapes give
them,'' said Przybilla, who says that the tops illustrate the
primary structural systems of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taught to think in squares and cubes, even though
nature does not use blocks to build,'' he said. ``All stars and
planets and atoms are spherical. Understanding how spheres relate
helps to understand how nature builds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc. considered licensing his invention, Przybilla said,
but the big toymaker concluded that the tops would not fit in its
product line. So Przybilla created a company, Tetratops. He has
been demonstrating and selling the tops on New York streets as well
as through a Web site, www.tetratops.com.
</P>
<P>
   A basic set of four tops sells for $19.95. It comes with a set
of trading cards that offer statistical information on a given
top's structure, and such observations as the fact that the
icosahedron resembles a soccer ball and that an octahedron sliced
in half makes a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Trading cards? Does Przybilla really think that children will
trade Tetratops cards of octahedrons, icosahedrons and cube
octahedrons the way they trade Pokemon cards of Pikachu, Snorlax
and Charizard?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the educational aspect is exciting,'' Przybilla said.
``Companies sell kids short by giving them junk. If you give them
something good, they'll absorb it.''
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla, who continues to search for a financial backer,
received patent 5,996,998.
</P>
<P>
   A Church Playhouse With Sound System
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Sallee, a former day-care director, and her husband, the
Rev. Jack Sallee, have patented a playhouse that resembles a
miniature church.
</P>
<P>
   The Sallee church playhouse features a steeple, stained-glass
windows, pews and a sound system that plays hymns, sermons and
wedding music.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sallee is a minister in the Church of God of Prophecy,
the Sallees said their playhouse was nondenominational. ``It is a
toy that could be used in all Christian preschools,'' Sallee said.
The Sallees, who live in Wyandotte, Mich., hope to license their
invention to a manufacturer. They received patent 6,053,792.
</P>
<P>
   Vacuum Attachment Collects Tiny Toys
</P>
<P>
   Tony Vandenberg, a father of three in Charlotte, N.C., grew
tired of picking up tiny toys like Lego pieces and Barbie
accessories. So he invented a vacuum attachment that diverts such
treasures to an easy-to-empty box when they are sucked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the small dirt particles go up and into the vacuum through
vent holes in a vacuum draft panel,'' Vandenberg said. ``But the
big pieces hit the panel and drop into the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Vandenberg received patent 6,048,249.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another hot afternoon is expected from interior southern New
England to the Southeast coast. Readings will reach above 90
degrees in many urban areas from New York to Charlotte. Hazy
sunshine and balmy winds from the southwest will dominate this
region. The boundary with a cooler air mass over Quebec will become
active with afternoon thunderstorms developing over central New
York and the higher terrain of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of the disturbance that brought downpours from
Dallas to St. Louis last week will move into the central
Appalachians with considerable clouds and scattered thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, humid air from the southern Plains will reach into the
lower Great Lakes, aiding in the development of strong to severe
storms. Cooler air will cover most of the northwestern third of the
nation with patches of showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MILES AND YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa, Okla., was inundated on Saturday with a daily record 2.83
inches of rain falling in 24 hours. This amount occurs on a
frequency of once every five years at the airport where it was
measured. About 10 miles away at the Riverside airport in Jenks, a
total of 6.31 inches was measured on Saturday. While daily records
are not kept at this smaller airport, this quantity of rain only
falls once every 50 years during a 24-hour period. The frequency of
such rainfalls provides valuable information to engineers who
design water catchment systems for cities. &QL;

A NEW MAGAZINE CELEBRATES THE RITES OF SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lucky, a new magazine from Conde Nast Publications,
is _ there is no way around it _ a shoe fanatic's dream that
borders on the compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 editorial pages in the middle of the magazine,
introduced with the headline ``Shoes You Need! Shoes You'd Kill
For! And Then Even Still More Shoes!'' There are patent pumps, Mary
Janes, toe-ring platforms, satin wedges, metallic kid sandals,
python slingbacks and calf-hair slides, crocodile T-straps daubed
with rhinestones, and iguana-leather mules.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lucky is ``a New Magazine about Shopping'' (to use the
phrase running across the top of the magazine), each shoe comes
with a price and a telephone number or Web site through which
readers may buy the pony-skin pumps of their choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, magazines have long offered merchandise in their
editorial pages, increasingly blurring the lines between editorial
content and advertising. So while the core idea behind Lucky may
not be new, Lucky appears to break new ground for an American
magazine in so brazenly and nakedly looking and reading like, well,
a carefully created catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky is the apotheosis of a slow-building trend. In the last
few years, magazines have begun to engage in marketing and even
selling product lines. They have also begun to provide readers with
information on ordering, as catalogs do.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc.'s 5-year-old In Style, a magazine about shopping that
masquerades as a magazine about celebrities, features hundreds of
pages every month packed with merchandise, accompanied by ``800''
numbers and Web-site addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Claire, published jointly by Hearst Magazines and Marie
Claire Album, offers its own clothing line _ from inexpensive
leather pants to cashmere sweaters _ that is available through an
``800'' number. Next month, the magazine will send subscribers a
CD-ROM, on which they can view clothes and then buy them online
through Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines like Girl and Allure have set up boutiques in
Bloomingdale's, using their magazines' names as a marketing tool to
promote clothing lines and products. Martha Stewart Living spawned
the catalog line Martha by Mail, which readers can use to buy items
featured in the editorial pages of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And Stuff, the men's magazine from Dennis Publishing, is just
that _ stuff to buy, leavened with an occasional article about a
bear mauling or a semiconfessional interview with a starlet.
</P>
<P>
   Kim France, the editor in chief of Lucky, characterized Lucky as
a hobby magazine and shopping as a woman's abiding passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same way that you might look at a golf magazine and
see a spread of nine irons,'' she said. ``Lucky is addressing one
interest in women's lives, in a really obsessive, specific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the conceit that all women are interested in shopping
as an activity _ not as a means to an end but as an end in itself _
is not one to which every American consumer subscribes. But
executives at Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, appear
to.
</P>
<P>
   Steven T. Florio, the president and chief executive of Conde
Nast, said that the success of Lucky hinged on the American
obsession with shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it at all economic levels, whether it's 57th Street or
people doing the mall thing,'' Florio said. ``Shopping is
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director, who conceived the
idea of Lucky, said that the magazine should not be construed as
some sort of fetishistic warping of consumer culture, but as the
exuberant expression of a communal bonding experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk around SoHo or Madison Avenue on a Saturday, I do
not feel like I am in the middle of an acquisition frenzy, but a
social activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which will arrive on newsstands next week, is the
first new magazine from the company since Conde Nast Sports for
Women in 1996. Conde Nast plans to publish Lucky first as a
quarterly and then as a monthly,
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's audience is young women, whom France described as
``postemancipation, prefamily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is out of school and supporting herself and beginning to
make real money,'' France said. ``She buys most of her furniture at
Pottery Barn and most of her clothes at Banana Republic. But she
has an eye for style.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine itself is 202 pages of stuff, and 90 of those pages
are advertisements for more stuff. (The advertisements were free
for Conde Nast advertisers for the first issue.)
</P>
<P>
   There are a few feature articles, and they are accompanied by
information about products to buy. Two decanters are offered in an
article on wine. One costs $19.95 (Crate and Barrel) and the other
is $840 (Takashimaya). Most of the editorial pages consist of
pictures with descriptive captions; page after page dutifully lists
beauty products _ like toners, ``mattifiers'' and ``zit gels'' _
with prices and ways to acquire them.
</P>
<P>
   But the centerfold of the magazine is most telling. It is a
photograph not of a model in a slinky Pucci slip ($920) or a newly
stylish Burberrys raincoat, but of rows of makeup sponges. Which
leads to the inevitable question: Have we sunk to a level of
consumer obsession so craven and silly that women are expected to
be fascinated by a centerfold featuring cosmetic sponges, faux
alpaca powder puffs and makeup wedges?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any reasonable girl would not want to spend a lot of
time looking at a page full of makeup sponges, but she ought to be
able to look at that page and say `Yes, I need that,''' France
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Shasho Jones, the president of Shasho Jones Direct, a
company that creates catalogs for retailers, said consumers were
starting to conceive of magazines as catalogs, especially now that
magazines are becoming more and more crammed with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are using magazines not only for advice but for
direction,'' she said. ``In the old days, you would go through a
home magazine or a fashion magazine, and you would get ideas. Then
you would have to go out and do the work yourself. Now, you read In
Style, and you get the Web sites, the ``800'' numbers, the stores,
the availability. And the Internet is going to goose it up even
more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Magazines can act as an authority, Shasho Jones said, because
they are not selling the merchandise directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A catalog can only be an authority to a certain extent, and
after that consumers know that the catalog has a vested interest in
selling right off the page,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potential pitfall for magazines that act as catalogs,
Shasho Jones said, if a consumer has a bad experience with a
retailer whose merchandise is featured in the magazine and then
blames the magazine indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smarter the magazine, the smarter they will be about
keeping a kind of Good Housekeeping seal of approval,'' she said.
``They will learn that they have to ask questions when they are
promoting products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky tells readers only what to buy, not what not to buy.
Still, France and Florio emphasized that there would never be any
cooperation between advertisers and the editorial staff. France
said that advertisers and retailers had not even been sending her
many sample products, as they usually do with beauty and fashion
editors at Conde Nast, where makeup and fashion closets are stacked
to the rafters with lip liners and facial creams.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hear Christmas might be pretty nice,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   And why the title Lucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky had a sort of exuberant, unpretentious feel to it,''
France said. ``As in `Anybody can get lucky,' and the point of the
magazine is that anybody can have style. It is not a gene possessed
by a precious few.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a slight sexual connotation in the
magazine's title, as in the suggestive phrase ``to get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' France said. ``And we did not think that was a minus or
an asset. If that's one association people get when they see the
magazine, that is fine.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the Computer Age, microprocessors have
been transforming mankind's machines, endowing them with memory,
flexibility, precision and the ability to share information.
</P>
<P>
   Now, miniaturized machines, reduced to microchip dimensions, are
working alongside or in place of the processors.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny devices known as MEMS, for microelectromechanical
systems, include valves, levers, motors and microphones. In the
form of tiny sensors, millions of MEMS have already made their way
into products like automotive air bags, ink-jet printers and
disposable blood pressure analyzers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the MEMS spotlight is on minuscule mirrors
and the central role they may soon play in communications. Various
companies are introducing MEMS-based switches to control the paths
of lightwaves through the rapidly expanding networks of optical
fiber cables that make up the Internet's backbone. By bouncing the
lightwaves off MEMS mirrors instead of running them through
electronic switches, networks could improve Internet efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the true validation of the technology,'' said
Robert L. Bratter, president and chief executive of Cronos
Integrated Microsystems, a designer and maker of MEMS components
based in Morrisville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase, a rapidly growing telecommunications equipment
supplier in Nepean, Ontario, near Ottawa, is certainly betting on
it. In April, the company agreed to buy Cronos for $750 million in
stock _ a rich price for a start-up with annual sales of only about
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another MEMS player is Nortel Networks, one of North America's
largest and oldest makers of telecommunications gear. Nortel agreed
in March to pay $3.25 billion in stock for Xros Inc., a start-up in
Sunnyvale, Calif. Although Xros has no sales yet, it does have a
MEMS design for big network switches.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Nortel snapped up CoreTek, a start-up in
Wilmington, Mass., that uses MEMS in the design of lasers that can
be tuned to send signals of different wavelengths through optical
networks. CoreTek investors will get up to $1.43 billion in Nortel
shares if CoreTek meets certain development milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nortel's main rival, Lucent Technologies _ North
America's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment _
has announced commercial availability of its first large MEMS
switch. Last month, Lucent signed Global Crossing as its first
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Success for MEMS in the optical communications market would
finally dispel the aura of failed promise that settled over MEMS a
decade ago after early missteps and a naivete about how fast the
technology would take hold.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS advocates recall a surge of interest in the 1980s, which
they say brought a flood of publicity to brilliant, but useless,
creations. For example, Nippondenso, a Japanese affiliate of
Toyota, assembled several MEMS devices into a model car the size of
a grain of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Other heralded visions that have still not yielded real products
include fuel cells on a chip; minuscule implant pumps for extremely
accurate drug delivery; and battlefield surveillance systems small
enough to drift around like dust particles.
</P>
<P>
   But if some of the most dazzling visions have yet to
materialize, many technology experts continue to foresee a
revolutionary role for MEMS. MEMS have recently shown up in devices
as diverse as movie projectors, DNA analysis kits, braking systems
and airspeed indicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is diversifying very rapidly,'' said William
Trimmer, vice president of technology for Standard MEMS, a MEMS
maker in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if manufacturers of MEMS switches show they have
successfully met the telecommunications industry's demanding
standards for reliability, programs to develop other MEMS products
should encounter less skepticism, predicts David Honey, photonics
program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
of the Defense Department, which has been a major financer of MEMS
research.
</P>
<P>
   One big challenge for MEMS is that while the devices are often
made with the same equipment and methods as are microprocessors,
they have to be designed and packaged differently for every new
application. As a result, most of the scores of products already on
the market have been aimed at narrow niches. And only a handful are
currently profitable, according to Roger H. Grace, a San Francisco
consultant who has tracked MEMS businesses for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy path MEMS have taken from the laboratory to commerce
might have been predictable. Lasers and robots _ two other
inventions that inspired dreams of transforming the world _ took a
similar route.
</P>
<P>
   Even though lasers are now everywhere _ used in scanners,
medical equipment and home entertainment devices like CD players _
only a handful of the companies that made lasers managed to grow
into publicly held ventures, and none of them became household
names among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Robotics is commonplace today in industrial applications like
assembly, welding, painting and packaging, but most of the major
pioneers went bankrupt, or survive as small divisions or affiliates
of companies like General Electric or ThyssenKrupp of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS manufacturers see a potential home run in switches because
fiber optics has become the backbone of modern communications
networks, with pulses of light representing the off-and-on binary
code of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Without MEMS, directing those light pulses toward their
destination and balancing the traffic has required converting the
light to electrons at network junctions, routing the electrons
through switches, then translating them back into lightwaves to
continue down their new path. The new MEMS devices can eliminate
this double translation process by enabling the switching station
to simply bounce the light signals to their new network pathway.
</P>
<P>
   With companies talking about the need to keep up with Internet
traffic _ WorldCom says it must add the equivalent of its entire
1998 network every month by next year _ MEMS switches could become
a billion-dollar market by 2003, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies say MEMS switches are attractive not
just for their reduced power demands and compact size but for
``scalability.'' Currently, when a fiber optic cable carrying
dozens of different wavelengths of light reaches an electronic
switch, each wavelength must take a different path through the
switch. As optical cables evolve to handle more and more
wavelengths, which is crucial in expanding capacity, electronic
switches must be reconfigured or replaced. But the newest MEMS
switches, once installed, can redirect 10 wavelengths or hundreds
without needing to be changed or expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Grail has been to put something in the network that
has a long life span,'' said Jack Wimmer, vice president for
network technology and planning at WorldCom, adding that MEMS
devices could be widely deployed next year if they prove to be
reliable in testing this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The simplest MEMS switches are like gates. When the mirror is in
its open position, the signal passes through uninterrupted; when it
pivots or is pushed into the signal path, the signal is deflected.
</P>
<P>
   The limitation in such designs is that each mirror in the array
pivots on a single axis. That means everything must be switched to
destinations in a single plane. Picture a flat city grid with every
avenue having a pop-up barrier at each intersection, capable of
diverting traffic down any side streets. The traffic can be
rerouted, but only on the plane of the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   A newer, somewhat more expensive design uses arrays of
pinhead-size mirrors that can pivot on two axes simultaneously. The
forward-backward tilt can be controlled separately from the
left-right tilt. The tilting is controlled by electrical charges,
but the principle is the same as in the children's game in which
one tries to roll a ball past holes and through a maze by using two
knobs to control the pitch of the playing surface. Instead of a
mirror at every intersection, each avenue now has a single mirror
that can direct traffic to multiple destinations in more than one
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, such switches could be easily scaled up to direct
thousands of incoming signals to thousands of destinations. In
practice, since many signals at different wavelengths are traveling
simultaneously down each fiber, the MEMS package requires a device
that separates the arriving wavelengths and directs each to a
different mirror so that it can be switched to its specific
destination. The system also requires a similar device to intercept
and rebundle the switched signals so that each outgoing fiber also
carries as many different wavelengths as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The development challenges and the absence, so far, of a
successful track record mean that MEMS could once again fail to
live up to expectations. And the makers of MEMS optical switches
risk confusing customers with their competing designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three will emerge as the industry standard in time, but
I expect seven or eight to be out there next year,'' said Kathleen
C. Szelag, vice president for marketing for Lucent's Optical
Networking Group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, electronic processors continue to plummet in price
and increase in speed, which means that the electronic switching
technology that MEMS designers hope to supplant is far from
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS will also have to compete with other optical technologies.
Agilent Technologies, a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, surprised a
major optical products trade show in Baltimore in March with a new
system capable of switching wavelengths of light from one fiber to
another by bouncing them off bubbles in a grid of liquid. Tiny
changes in heat cause the bubbles to form or disappear in 5
milliseconds. The grid can handle 512 wavelengths simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS advocates say the bubble technology has several drawbacks,
including a need for much more power. But investors apparently
listened to the company's case that similar technology had proved
to be reliable for years in Hewlett-Packard's bubble-jet printers
and could be easily manufactured. Agilent's stock soared 47 percent
the day after the announcement. Alcatel of France, Europe's
second-largest telecommunications equipment company, has signed an
agreement to work on developing the bubble technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very interested in MEMS, but we are also talking with
vendors of about half a dozen other optical switching
technologies,'' said Wimmer of WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   If MEMS switches take over the market the next few years, it may
be just in time for their creators to start worrying about yet
another competitor for their flexible mirrors and other chip-based
machines. In the field of nanotechnology, researchers have already
begun exploring the theoretical advantages of far smaller devices
built from handfuls of atoms and molecules. If their work pans out,
the next step could be switches and other machines invisible to the
naked eye.

IN PUBLIC RELATIONS, 25 PERCENT ADMIT TO LYING  
 `MILLIONAIRE' MAKES SORTIE INTO `E.R.' ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the public relations industry. It has long battled its
image as a cadre of hired guns who distort the truth, exaggerate
and sometimes even lie.
</P>
<P>
   And that part about the lying _ it may actually be true for one
quarter of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Leyland, the editor in chief of PR Week, a trade journal of
the public relations industry, surveyed some 1,700 public relations
executives about ethics in their industry. The survey, which was
published in the May 1 edition of PR Week, revealed several things,
not least of which was the statistic that turned into the article's
doom-and-gloom headline: ``One of out of four pros admits to lying
on job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is deeply concerned with ethics and
truth-telling,'' Leyland said. ``And yet it has a reputation for
spinning and hype and straight out lying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 25 percent of the executives admitted they lied
on the job, 39 percent said they had exaggerated the truth, and 44
percent said they felt uncertain of the ethics of a task they were
asked to perform. And 62 percent said that they had felt
compromised in their work, either by being told a lie by their
client or by not having access to the full story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That statistic is the most significant contribution to
conflict with journalists,'' Leyland said. ``But I would really
like to survey the world of businesspeople, or the world of
journalists, and find out how many of them have lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of reactions from public relations executives to the
survey have poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them have said they just want to resign from the
industry and lie on a beach, examining their navel,'' he said. ``I
say, look at the bright side. If 25 percent told a lie, that means
75 percent did not.''

   `Millionaire' Makes Sortie Into `E.R.' Zone
</P>
<P>
   With a week of celebrity contestants, ABC had already found a
new way to use ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to hammer its
competitors in a sweep month. But then last Thursday the network
managed to pile on some additional torment for its main rival, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ABC quietly let the Thursday edition of ``Millionaire'' run
eight minutes long, just enough to blunt the start of NBC's
strongest series, ``E.R.'' It blunted it enough for ABC to beat
``E.R.'' in its first half-hour, something no regularly scheduled
ABC show had done in the seven-year run of the hit medical drama.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., ``E.R.'' flew into an air pocket as viewers remained
hooked into the actor Ray Romano's efforts to answer questions on
``Millionaire.'' The game show had a huge 40.6 million viewers
watching from 10 p.m. to 10:08 p.m. By the time the ABC news
magazine ``20/20 Downtown'' finished out the half-hour, that number
was down to 22.5 million. But ABC's average for the half-hour of
27.3 million easily beat the 24.6 million viewers tuned into
``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said it had not been a formal plan to run
``Millionaire'' long to damage ``E.R.'' But because the show had
committed to allowing every celebrity who participated in the week
of games to have a shot on the air, it had less editing flexibility
than normal. This was the case, ABC executives said, even though
the celebrity shows were taped about a month in advance.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, ABC's program executives were informed the
show would run long. They simply ordered the extra eight minutes to
be cut out of the coming news program.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen what a little extra ``Millionaire'' can do to the
previous prime-time ratings champ, will there be more occasions of
run over? One senior ABC executive said, ``It has not gone without
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   But another ABC program executive said, ``I really don't think
it's in the best interests of `Millionaire' to regularly tick off
fans of `E.R.'''

 &HT;    Student awarded scholarships to five U.S. military academies
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Maybe in these days of tech stocks and
teenage millionaires, it's not so unusual to hear about a kid worth
just over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But at Lake Worth High School, there's a senior who earned it in
the old-fashioned way. He studied his calculus, volunteered in the
town's parks, and applied to all five American military academies _
and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   There's $250,000 from West Point, the U.S. Army's academy;
another quarter-million from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md.; not to mention the money from the Air Force, Coast Guard and
Merchant Marines, and the Navy's scholarship to University of San
Diego _ worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Ron Spellman, a public affairs officer at the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy, didn't have specific numbers on how many
students get accepted into all five military academies. But, he
said, ``It's far from a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Tanguay will report to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy
in New London, Conn., for his new haircut and dress whites. He will
study naval architecture and prepare for a career as a Coast Guard
officer. It was his first choice all along, fulfilling his desire
to spend his life near the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Tanguay is as calm as a flat sea in the sunshine _
years and years of waiting for the right wave on a surfboard off
Lantana Beach will do that to you _ as he explained the work that
went into his recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sacrificed a lot of parties to work on school projects or
get my homework finished, but I think it'll work out in the long
run,'' said Tanguay, who has a career 3.9 grade point average. ``I
think most of my friends would say first that I'm a nerd. I like to
read, I like to do my homework, I'm happy when I'm doing my
calculus _ that's my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after they thought about it a little, I think they'd say _
Matt's a leader, because I'm the guy who's always making plans for
them, telling them where to go. And they'd say I have good morals,
I'm trustworthy, that I'm a good person. There was this day when
the soda machine was unlocked and everyone was saying _ Free Sodas!
_ and I said, 'That's all right. If I want a soda, I'll pay for
one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   There also was the night that Tanguay stopped a carful of
friends because an elderly woman on the sidewalk was getting
hassled by some kids, he said. They were on their way back from
``Fiddler on the Roof'' rehearsals two years ago _ Tanguay played
the rabbi's son, a minor part, he said modestly _ when they saw the
woman poking her cane at her antagonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be (upset) if I saw my grandmother getting hassled,''
Tanguay recalled. ``So I said 'Hey, stop the car' and we chased the
kids away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay is the perfect kid, Cotter said. He competed on the high
school's wrestling and golf teams; he's taking three advanced
classes this semester; and he's won the school's Most Spirited
award four years running. He also helped rebuild a local park and
rang a Salvation Army bell at Christmas, and he's held high-ranking
positions in ROTC since the summer after his freshman year. Back
then, Cotter asked him to take on public affairs duties for the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got everybody but Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw to show up,''
Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tanguay said ROTC has given him leadership skills,
taught him how to lead by example, and feel comfortable in a
uniform. And he said he knows it sounds corny, but it has made him
feel part of a team or brotherhood _ one where it's actually cool
to do well in school _ and he hopes he has the same feeling in the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   West Point is better known. Annapolis is right on the Chesapeake
Bay. But Tanguay doesn't want to spend his life preparing for war,
he said, and the Coast Guard has a peacetime mission. After a
summer at the Coast Guard's Academy Introductory Mission program,
which simulates the first few weeks of a typical freshman year,
Tanguay knew he wanted to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't walk away saying it was fun, but I said it was
something I want to be part of,'' he said. ``Honestly, I want to be
a Coast Guard officer. It's not like I just want the free
schooling, and then I'm going to ditch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay hopes one day, one perfect day, to be somewhere in
Hawaii, commanding a Coast Guard cutter making its way to yet
another spectacular rescue, or another day of environmental
clean-up, or just another day of sea and sun.

TWO STURDY COMPANIES ARE STRONG CANDIDATES TO BE THE NEXT CISCO  
 BY SETH SCHIESEL  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, Cisco Systems seems as close to perfect as a
technology company can be.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest maker of Internet communications equipment, Cisco is
also the second-most valuable company in the nation, after General
Electric. It has succeeded in elevating its chief executive, John
Chambers, to near-deity status in some quarters, and has even
managed to stay in the government's good graces, in contrast to
Microsoft, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Which all means that this is probably an excellent time to think
about which companies have a legitimate shot at eating Cisco's
lunch. After all, one of the canons of the technology business the
last two decades has been that it is at a company's moment of
maximum optimism that the seeds of trouble are most likely
germinating. (Think IBM. Or for that matter, Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the companies that appear best positioned to be the
next powerhouses in communications equipment do not want to eat
Cisco's lunch at all. Rather, moving in new economy time, they are
planning financial and technical smorgasbords of their own for the
next generation of digital networks.
</P>
<P>
   In an arboreal coincidence, the two leading candidates among the
many young companies vying to be the ``next Cisco'' are called
Juniper Networks and Sycamore Networks. Though they do very
different things, the two companies are remarkably similar in many
ways. They have innovative technologies, Juniper in high-capacity
Internet routers and Sycamore in optical networking. They are both
narrowly focused but forward-looking. They have the financial
resources to position themselves for growth. And perhaps most
important, each is led by an executive who has been there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about Juniper and Sycamore is that what you
have is that this is not just a category-killer but in many cases a
category-definer,'' said Steven D. Levy, a Lehman Bros.
communications equipment analyst. ``They're both hypergrowth
companies, and they have managements that have seen at least one or
two wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, Juniper and Sycamore are spoiling to sell equipment to
both established and upstart communications carriers for the next
generation of high-speed networks. Those networks will be necessary
to meet the growing demand for Internet and other data
communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it barely generated $100 million in revenue last
year, Juniper has already established its leadership in a sector
that Cisco wants to own: ultrahigh-capacity Internet switches. Put
simply, Juniper's systems can route more billions of digital bits
each second more reliably than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   With its almost ludicrously impressive financial strength, Cisco
is never to be discounted. But there are good reasons to believe
that Juniper will be able to go toe-to-toe with Cisco the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   First, Juniper is focused on high-end Internet routers for big
communications carriers. Cisco had its start selling relatively
low-capacity routers for use in corporate networks, and analysts
say it still derives two-thirds of its revenue from corporate
customers, though it is selling more to communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, as strong as Cisco may be in developing new
technologies, the company is best known for acquiring and
integrating other companies. But there are not many companies that
Cisco could acquire to help in its battle against Juniper. Nexabit
Networks, one company in the same sector, has been acquired by
Lucent Technologies, while Avici Systems, another high-end routing
company, has not yet announced big commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of backhand diplomacy, Scott Kriens, Juniper's chief
executive, said: ``Our success doesn't mean that the other will go
away. Cisco is' certainly not going to go away, just like IBM did
not go away. But they are not any more likely to dominate
networking in the future than IBM dominated computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kriens himself is well positioned to compete against Cisco.
Cisco's carrier-sales group essentially did not exist until Cisco
acquired Kriens' previous company, Stratacom, for about $4 billion
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Kriens is quite similar to Daniel Smith,
Sycamore's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore is at the forefront of the next generation of optical
networking, which is set to allow communications carriers to route
digital information from one point to another using lightwaves.
Cisco has tried to add optical networking gear to its offerings
with its acquisitions the last year of the Cerent Corp., Monterey
Networks and a unit of Pirelli of Italy, but it remains a minor
player in that market. Sycamore's main competition in optical
networking is not Cisco but the giants of the communications
industry, including Lucent, Nortel Networks of Canada and Fujitsu
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's previous company, Cascade Communications, was a
competitor of Stratacom for much of the 1990s and is now deep
inside Lucent (by way of its sale in 1997 to Ascend Communications,
which was subsequently acquired by Lucent).
</P>
<P>
   Like Kriens, Smith is betting that his company's focus on a
specific and potentially lucrative niche will allow it to
outmaneuver titans like Lucent and Cisco that are trying to span a
variety of communications sectors. And like any good entrepreneur,
Smith tempers his confidence with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly do respect Cisco,'' he said. ``They're very
aggressive, in every way. But I sure don't fear them. I know that
when I'm on the field with them I better have my chinstrap buckled
and be ready to hit. And I think they know that about me.''

ISRAELI CABINET APPROVES TAX-REFORM PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is also being filed in ``i'' category.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's Cabinet voted to overhaul the country's tax
system for the first time in a quarter century, backing a Finance
Ministry proposal for lower income tax rates balanced by new levies
on inheritances, foreign earnings and capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   The national labor federation staged a one-hour warning strike
Sunday to protest provisions in the proposed tax package, which
will be submitted to the parliament next month. But in a rare show
of cohesion, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition Cabinet endorsed
the long-awaited tax plan with a 17-0 vote with two ministers
abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Overall tax payments for most Israelis would decline under the
new rules, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest benefits, though, would accrue to those who earn the
most. The threshold for the highest tax rate _ 50 percent _ would
be raised from about $55,000 to slightly more than $100,000. The
prime minister blocked an effort Sunday by several of his ministers
to raise the highest tax rate to 60 percent, contending that level
of taxation would unfairly penalize ``people who are investing
their best resources in Israel and aiding in its development and
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in tax policy would be the
introduction of a 25 percent capital gains tax on local stock
sales. Currently, only earnings from stocks in foreign companies in
international markets are taxed. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rose 4
percent Sunday _ an indicator, analysts said, that investors were
resigned to the capital gains tax even though it would eliminate
one of the few advantages of listing shares locally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 25 percent capital gains tax would also apply to
earnings on interest from securities and savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The package eliminates other loopholes, among them long-standing
exemptions from taxes on rental income and the partial
classification of many salaries as ``training funds'' rather than
taxable earnings. All earnings from foreign sources would be taxed
for the first time, ending special treatment for recent immigrants
and international business consultants. Salaries earned by married
women would no longer be taxed half a percentage point less than
men's wages.
</P>
<P>
   Inheritance taxes would be reintroduced after a lapse of two
decades _ but would apply only to estates of $500,000 or more.
Corporate tax breaks for capital investments would be reduced or
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily overshadowing the constant preoccupation here with
peace talks and national security issues, the tax package
galvanized national attention last week. Thousands of Israelis
quickly tried to transfer funds abroad, deed gifts to children and
open untaxed long-term savings accounts in hopes of avoiding estate
taxes and capital gains assessments. All for naught, though. The
Cabinet said the new package, if passed, would apply retroactively
to last Thursday, the day the reform proposal was first officially
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Likud Party, sounding a populist note, vowed to
join the labor movement in fighting the tax initiative. ``We object
to the inheritance tax, to a tax on long-term savings, taxes on
pension funds and training funds and canceling the tax credit for a
working woman,'' said Ariel Sharon, the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the near-unanimous Cabinet endorsement appears to ensure the
passage of most of the complex package, which is widely considered
the Barak government's most significant economic policy measure.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the proposed changes would have a negligible
effect on the government's overall tax collections, with new taxes
compensating for a projected decline in income tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   David Klein, the governor of the central bank, suggested Sunday
that the reform initiative should seek to reduce the gross tax
burden here, which is comparable to that in Northern European
countries, which have average incomes nearly twice as high as in
Israel. In addition to income and social security taxes, Israelis
pay a 17 percent value-added sales tax on most goods and services.

   The proposed 25 percent capital gains tax would also apply to
earnings on interest from securities and savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The package eliminates other loopholes, among them long-standing
exemptions from taxes on rental income and the partial
classification of many salaries as ``training funds'' rather than
taxable earnings. All earnings from foreign sources would be taxed
for the first time, ending special treatment for recent immigrants
and international business consultants. Salaries earned by married
women would no longer be taxed half a percentage point less than
men's wages.
</P>
<P>
   Inheritance taxes would be reintroduced after a lapse of two
decades _ but would apply only to estates of $500,000 or more.
Corporate tax breaks for capital investments would be reduced or
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily overshadowing the constant preoccupation here with
peace talks and national security issues, the tax package
galvanized national attention last week. Thousands of Israelis
quickly tried to transfer funds abroad, deed gifts to children and
open untaxed long-term savings accounts in hopes of avoiding estate
taxes and capital gains assessments. All for naught, though. The
Cabinet said the new package, if passed, would apply retroactively
to last Thursday, the day the reform proposal was first officially
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Likud Party, sounding a populist note, vowed to
join the labor movement in fighting the tax initiative. ``We object
to the inheritance tax, to a tax on long-term savings, taxes on
pension funds and training funds and canceling the tax credit for a
working woman,'' said Ariel Sharon, the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the near-unanimous Cabinet endorsement appears to ensure the
passage of most of the complex package, which is widely considered
the Barak government's most significant economic policy measure.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the proposed changes would have a negligible
effect on the government's overall tax collections, with new taxes
compensating for a projected decline in income tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   David Klein, the governor of the central bank, suggested Sunday
that the reform initiative should seek to reduce the gross tax
burden here, which is comparable to that in Northern European
countries, which have average incomes nearly twice as high as in
Israel. In addition to income and social security taxes, Israelis
pay a 17 percent value-added sales tax on most goods and services.

`BALLAD OF LITTLE RIVER': FACING LIFE WITH A SIX-PACK  
 BY RICHARD BERNSTEIN  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a mournful ballad of rural life in the South that Paul
Hemphill chants in his new book, ``The Ballad of Little River.'' It
is a ballad that brings to mind many cultural references, James
Agee's ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' and Walker Evans' haunting
photographs of rural poverty and what Hemphill himself calls ``a
Faulknerian huddle of fairly exotic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Little River is an undistinguished place in southern Alabama
where in 1997 five local white youths, bored and drunk and, it
would seem, prone to racist incitement, burned down one small,
bedraggled black church, and some of them vandalized another one.
Hemphill rented a cabin in town and chronicled it for a year. His
purpose was to get to know the inhabitants, half of them black,
half white, to understand the place from which the five miscreants
had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The result of his investigation is a melancholy and savory story
of a kind of forgotten America where people face dead-end jobs and
despair with six-packs of beer, the occasional joint and a kind of
heedless self-justification. Almost nobody has a happy story in
Hemphill's instructive and finely tuned portrait, which serves as a
reminder that the world of Agee, Evans and Faulkner is not entirely
behind us.
</P>
<P>
   Hemphill structures his story along familiar narrative lines,
portraying Little River as the kind of place where nothing much had
happened since a famous Indian massacre of the early 19th century,
until things began to unravel publicly early in 1997. A young black
man was shot and killed breaking into a white-owned home late at
night. A white grocer liked by everybody, black and white, was
savagely beaten by a black ex-convict. Then a newcomer to town held
a Ku Klux Klan rally on his five-acre spread, and two days after
that the five white youths struck at the tiny St. Joe Baptist
Church and at the somewhat larger Tate Chapel just down the country
road.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the churches brought an unwelcome prominence to
Little River, which lies alongside Alabama Highway 59, running
through one of the poorest counties in the United States. The
church burnings, which reflected similar incidents taking place
elsewhere in the South, were aggressively prosecuted, with the
local district attorney trying to use new hate-crime legislation to
get enhanced sentences for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   What Hemphill succeeds in doing in his casual, understated,
almost aw-shucks way, is get under the skin of a troubled
community. And the images of American gothic life that emerge from
his piquant pages indicate that the phrase ``hate crime'' doesn't
quite explain things. A deeply rooted racial hostility certainly
existed in forlorn Little River, where one supposedly enlightened
white man accounted for the success of a local black woman by
explaining she had some white blood in her.
</P>
<P>
   But the relations between the races had always been peaceful, if
distant. The church-burning seemed more a consequence of a sort of
moral disintegration _ family violence, divorce, chronic feuding,
infidelity, heavy drinking and welfare cheating _ that was a good
deal more pronounced among Little River's whites than among its
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gaggle of about two dozen of them out there on the
20-mile stretch of road between Little River and Uriah: white kids
who were about to graduate from high school, sons and daughters of
dysfunctional families, kids with few hopes and dreams beyond
finding some menial job or marrying within the clan, kids who had
not even been given a road map about how to live a noble life,''
Hemphill writes.
</P>
<P>
   His narrative has as much to do with getting to know the
denizens of Little River as with tracing the course of the events
that took place there. He captures the minds and mentalities of men
whose entire lives have taken place in isolated trailers parked in
steamy, piney woods, or in jail. There were, to take one example
among many possible examples, Tommy and George Boone, members of
Little River's largest white clan who, as Hemphill puts it, ``were
in a competition to see which one could get the most ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy got 20 years for burglarizing fish camps and homes
throughout the area. George lived ``alone in an old trailer down a
dirt road behind the cafe run by his ex-wife and her common-law
husband, his brother Leroy.'' One morning he got taken to jail
after firing at the cafe because two other members of the Boone
clan who had denigrated him were in it. He told Hemphill:
``Attempted murder? Hell, I was just trying to get their
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemphill has a good ear for the vernacular, and he allows his
dramatis personae to reveal themselves without comment. But he
clearly has a good deal of sympathy for the struggling blacks of
Little River even as he avoids the temptation to sanctify them. The
pastor of St. Joe Baptist Church, Joe Dees, is the main black
figure portrayed in this book, and he is a complicated figure. He
was mentally disturbed for years; his behavior was erratic and
sometimes irresponsible, and his wrecked church, to tell the truth,
was in an advanced stage of dilapidation.
</P>
<P>
   But Dees raised five children who were doing well in life, and
his instability was a matter of chemical imbalance. An interesting
fact about Little River is that many of the town's black children
went to college while very few of the whites did. ``They had to try
harder, and they and their parents knew it,'' Hemphill concludes of
the blacks. Most of the white parents, by contrast, ``assumed that
everything would work out fine in their favor, just like it always
had, simply because of the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of 1997, which resulted in the imprisonment of five
white youths, showed the fatal flaw in that reasoning. Hemphill, in
demonstrating this, did not, by his own description of things, earn
great popularity among Little River's whites. Still, he has held up
a mirror to them, and to the rest of us in the complicated American
racial diorama, and it is well worth our attention.

`JOE DIMAGGIO: THE HERO'S LIFE': GLIDING IN CENTER FIELD, SLINKING
IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>

New York area. Check local listings.)

<P>
   Consider the life of Joe DiMaggio, who was such a graceful
success on the baseball field and such a miserable failure off it,
and you may wonder if he sold his soul for that 56-game hitting
streak. But after viewing the fascinating biography Monday night on
PBS' ``American Experience'' series, you might conclude that
DiMaggio had no soul to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zwonitzer's film ``Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life'' paints a
damning portrait of a man who was inarticulate, proud, vain and
cheap; a man who cheated at cards, took gifts from crooks and
failed miserably as a husband (twice) and father (once). But he was
most of all a thrilling performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strove for more than 60 years to give Joe DiMaggio the
hero's life,'' says the narrator, Richard Ben Cramer, who wrote the
film with Zwonitzer. ``From his debut at Yankee Stadium in 1936
until his death in 1999, DiMaggio was, at every turn, one man we
could look at who made us feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary may make you feel bad. But you'll be glad you
watched it, or rather, listened to it. With its newsreel clips,
file photos and talking heads, this film looks no different from
the historical fare offered nightly on a half-dozen cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But pay attention to the words, chiefly those spoken by Cramer
and Maury Allen, the veteran sportswriter and DiMaggio biographer,
and you'll be touched by an American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed he was walking on air,'' Allen says of DiMaggio.
``He would glide through a stadium. He would glide through a
restaurant.'' But despite appearances, he slinked darkly through
much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, the son of a San Francisco fisherman, found baseball
by a process of elimination. He didn't want to follow his father
onto the boat. An indifferent student, he dropped out of school at
15. From semipro ball he progressed to the minor league San
Francisco Seals. He was making money. This was worth an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe bent his life to the game,'' Cramer says. ``He'd never had
any coaching, but now he learned like Mozart learned the piano: all
at once and instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He tore up the Pacific Coast League; and the Yankees, at sea
since the departure of Babe Ruth, pinned their hopes on this
prospect. New York and DiMaggio took to each other. He became a
regular at Toots Shor's. And while the team never paid him what he
thought he was worth, he quickly learned that ``there was money in
just being Joe.'' He piled up endorsement fees and accepted favors,
including a Cadillac just for showing up at a Newark, N.J.,
banquet.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to the movie starlet Dorothy Arnold, brought
the couple pain and Joe DiMaggio Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son would never have any kind of relationship. But in
the summer of 1941, while Americans shuddered over news of a war
that was soon to envelop them, the public was happily diverted by
DiMaggio's record-setting hitting streak. ``The entire country
seemed to be emotionally involved,'' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, war trumped baseball. DiMaggio became a
reluctant volunteer and spent the duration safely playing ball for
an Army team. Back with the Yankees in '46 he was beginning to feel
his age. In 1951 he saw history repeated as a kid named Mickey
Mantle showed up to claim the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate Jerry Coleman recalls DiMaggio's pain at ``watching
this halo around his shoulders sort of slip away.'' He retired and
embarked on 48 years of living on his past glories.
</P>
<P>
   His second brief and tragic marriage, to Marilyn Monroe, almost
cost DiMaggio his standing with the public. He could not bear
living in her shadow, and when she left him, she had bruises on her
face.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio retreated, appearing now and then to sign autographs or
pitch products. He had no real friends and was estranged from his
family. But somehow his legend flourished in that vacuum. ``The
more he retreated, the more our hunger for him grew,'' Cramer says.
``His blankness allowed us to make him perfect in our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Joe is rendered most imperfect by this cold-eyed
documentary. But his tale is worth your attention. Despite his
flaws, he is still revered. To understand why, do two things. First
watch this film. Then talk to someone who remembers the summer of
'41.

ADVERTISING: THERMASILK COMMERCIALS ENTER THE BIG-BUDGET REALM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of advertising, the big budget commercials with
brand name directors and fancy special effects usually go to
products like automobiles, soft drinks and sneakers. Think Nike.
Think Pepsi. Think Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Now Unilever _ a company known for its household and personal
care products _is jumping into the fray with a multimillion-dollar
extravaganza for a shampoo line.
</P>
<P>
   The British-Dutch conglomerate is staking millions in production
costs and more than $40 million in media buys to promote the
two-year-old ThermaSilk shampoo, conditioner and hair care line.
The campaign goes on the air on network television beginning
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign follows a successful introduction for ThermaSilk,
which achieved more than $120 million in sales in its first year on
the market. The benchmark for a successful product line is about
$100 million in sales. Unilever says the brand was a major reason
the company was able to overtake Procter &AMP; Gamble's longtime
leadership in the $3.7 billion hair care market.
</P>
<P>
   Created by J. Walter Thompson USA, the three new commercials are
lush, dreamlike settings of mythical places: In each one, a
princess-like woman tames a dragon or beast, and in so doing also
transforms her hair into beautiful locks. To create the lush spots,
Thompson used some 90 special effects and animation experts, and
employed a digital artist on the set.
</P>
<P>
   The fantastical settings tap into the popularity of fantasy and
magic, as witnessed by books like the Harry Potter series; in TV
shows like ``Charmed'' and ``Queen of Swords''; and even in the
newest women's fashions, which have a ``princesslike prettiness''
about them, said Cathy Lennox, management director for ThermaSilk
at Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   But the settings also dramatize an insight into the 25- to
39-year-old female audience the company is trying to reach: that
each morning women undergo a transformation when blow-drying their
hair, Lennox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of advertising in this category talks at women; it's not
emotionally based,'' Lennox said of the campaign's approach. ``We
found heat-styling is an emotionally charged time, when a woman is
transformed. Another reason the campaign resonates with women is
that it recognizes the appeal of fantasy to escape the emotional
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials cost several million dollars to produce, said
Andrew Gross, hair care category director for Unilever Home and
Personal Care USA. The average national 30-second spot costs
$295,000 to produce, according to the American Association of
Advertising Agencies in New York, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, a young woman is lost in a forest in medieval times
and comes upon a huge fire-breathing dragon, which she embraces,
rather than fears; his flames make her hair gorgeous. That spot,
shot in a subtropical jungle in Mexico, required a flamethrower to
light the trees in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   In another spot, a snake-haired Medusa is seen in a celestial
ballroom amid other figures from Greek mythology. To the delight of
the crowd, she dances the tango with another creature and her
viper-filled tresses are transformed into beautiful hair. An
80-piece orchestra performed the tango from an original score.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was directed by Bruno Aveillan, known in France for
his Perrier and Galeries Lafayette commercials. Even though
Thompson used American-style special effects, the creative
directors in charge at Thompson _ Chris D'Rozario and Ed
Evangelista _ wanted the campaign to have a low-key, European
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a Hollywood feel, which is more obvious and
very packaged and canned,'' said D'Rozario. ``The Europeans have a
more artistic sensibility. With Bruno, each frame looks like a
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelista believes the less commercial feel of European-style
advertising is beginning to catch on here. ``The Europeans are less
literal and give the consumer more credit, and we're starting to
see more of that here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Unilever, what is significant about the campaign is that it
is based on the brand's main attribute, that its formula works with
heat to improve the hair, Gross said. Hence the campaign's slogan:
``Heat is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What intrigued us about the idea is that it linked with the
brand proposition, which is taking heat from bad to good in a
dramatic way,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   ThermaSilk's success, paired with a restaging of Unilever's
Suave brand, helped increase Unilever's market share last year to
23.9 percent of the $3.7 billion overall hair care market, edging
out P&AMP;G, which had a 22.5 percent share, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co., which tracks product sales in supermarkets, drugstores and
other outlets. This is the first time Unilever has led in the
category, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   ThermaSilk fits in with the trend in the industry toward premium
brands with product benefits beyond smelling nice, said Wendy
Nicholson, a personal care analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ThermaSilk retails for about $3.50 a bottle, a price that is
roughly 20 percent more than an average shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are more concerned about using products that are
good for them and have more therapeutic benefits,'' Nicholson said.
``No one is using the basic, just-smell-good stuff anymore;
consumers are willing to pay more for perceived product benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nicholson noted that while P&AMP;Gs market share has eroded a
bit, it remained the leader last year in the $2.7 billion market
that includes shampoo and conditioner only. P&AMP;G had a 27 percent
share last year compared with Unilever's 20 percent, according to
Information Resources Inc., which tracks sales of packaged goods.
P&AMP;Gs Pantene is the market leader, with a 14 percent share.
ThermaSilk has a 5 percent market share and is ranked fourth,
Nicholson said. The market is highly competitive, with dozens of
new products introduced every year.
</P>
<P>
   And P&AMP;G isn't standing still. Just this year it introduced
Physique, a premium styling line with formulas that are promoted as
helping women to get and keep their hairstyles. It's a complete
line of products from shampoo to gels, priced at about $7 each. P&AMP;G
is aggressively promoting Physique, which Nicholson said was
designed to reinvigorate P&AMP;Gs hair care business.

MICROSOFT PREPARING REPLY TO JUSTICE DEPT.'S BREAKUP PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it is Microsoft's turn to say what its future should be. On
Wednesday, the company must submit its reply to the government's
proposal to split the company in two and, at the prodding of a
federal judge, offer its own suggested remedies in the antitrust
case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will not say precisely what its remedy recommendations
will be. But they are expected to consist mainly of a reiteration
of proposals Microsoft has made repeatedly during on-again,
off-again settlement talks with the government over the last two
years. The Microsoft concessions, according to people close to the
talks, have covered opening up the company's pricing, contracts and
the sharing of technical information with industry partners and
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The specific steps have included allowing personal computer
makers greater freedom to modify Microsoft's Windows desktop
screen, ensuring that rival software makers get equal access to
technical information about the Windows operating system, and
curbing the company's ability to enter into contracts with computer
makers and Internet service providers that limit their ability to
use and promote competing software.
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft proposal, according to people close to the
talks, has been to offer standard prices, adjusted for the volume,
to PC makers licensing the company's industry-standard Windows
operating system _ addressing the allegation in the antitrust case
that Microsoft has used Windows pricing as a way to reward friendly
companies and punish companies that deal closely with Microsoft
foes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has little choice but to engage in what it regards as
the unpalatable exercise of recommending sanctions against itself.
At a scheduling hearing in early April, Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson told the Microsoft legal team that on May 10 it had to give
the court its answer to the government proposal including its
counterproposals.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft proposal has to be based on Jackson's findings of
fact and legal ruling, which found the company to be a monopolist
that repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to be sure, plans to appeal Jackson's ruling and
maintains, in the words of Bill Gates, the chairman, that the
company ``has done absolutely nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, Microsoft will swallow hard and suggest
some curbs on its behavior. ``As the court has requested,'' said
Mark Murray, a company spokesman, ``Microsoft will outline steps
that would be reasonable and appropriate recommendations to remedy
specific violations found by the court, recognizing that Microsoft
disagrees with the court's ruling and plans to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Justice Department and the 19 states suing
Microsoft had rejected the company's settlement offerings as too
limited and too easy for Microsoft to sidestep. And their stance
has not changed. ``This is nothing new,'' a government official
said Sunday. ``The Microsoft proposals are backward-looking and
filled with loopholes. They would be completely ineffective in
stopping Microsoft in the future from using its monopoly power to
squelch innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft, in its filing, will likely direct its strongest
fire at simply attacking the government plan to break the company
into two _ one with the Windows operating system business, and a
second company with the Office productivity programs like the Word
word processing and Excel spreadsheet software and other businesses
like the MSN Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan, Microsoft says, is ``extreme and radical''
_ an unjustified and dangerous gamble with a company that has
contributed greatly to America's high-technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not the first time the government has considered
breaking up Microsoft. In an earlier Justice Department
investigation, which led to a 1994 consent decree between Microsoft
and the government, ``we absolutely looked at a breakup,'' said
Robert E. Hall, a professor at Stanford University who was an
economic consultant to the Justice Department at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments for a breakup are not ridiculous,'' he said.
``There are good arguments for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Hall decided not to recommend a breakup
plan for two reasons. First, he said, the Justice Department then
did not have the kind of evidence or the legal findings they now
have. But second, Hall said, in 1994 he did not have enough
confidence that the ``tangible benefits would more than make up for
the efficiency losses to consumers from splitting up an integrated
company.''
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, the antitrust argument about economic
``efficiencies'' boils down to whether courts believe that the
potential benefits of a breakup plan will outweigh the possible
harm.
</P>
<P>
   That is the difficult judgment that Jackson _ and higher courts
on appeal _ will have to make, if Microsoft is to be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts predict that the danger to consumers of
breaking up the company will be a leading argument to be heard from
the Microsoft camp. ``I expect efficiencies to the major
battleground'' in the remedy phase of the case, said Carl Shapiro,
an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, who filed
a declaration in support of the government plan last month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about the antitrust debate over the
economic outcome from breaking up a company. ``If the defendant
raises serious doubts about efficiencies, judges tend to back away
from a breakup,'' observed William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that tradition dates back to 1916, when a federal court
deciding not to break up the American Can Co., despite its control
of can-making at the time, cited the potential loss to consumers.
The court declared that it was ``frankly reluctant to destroy so
finely adjusted an industrial machine as the record shows the
defendant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Microsoft is warning that consumers will suffer if the
company is split up. Gates has pointedly said that the government
plan could not have been drafted by anyone who knows anything about
the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal, Microsoft insists, would ban all kinds
of cooperation within the combined company. Such teamwork,
Microsoft says, has enabled programmers in the Windows division and
programmers in the Office division to jointly develop many software
features that make computers easier to use. .
</P>
<P>
   The government replies that its plan is not deeply regulatory at
all. The breakup, a government official said, is a prudent way for
the government to ``ensure that the monopoly Windows business has a
powerful incentive to deal with everybody equally.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's arguments, advocates for the government add, have a
familiar ring. ``Before the breakup of AT&AMP;T,'' Paul M. Romer, a
Stanford University economist, wrote in a declaration supporting
the government, ``engineers described the advantages of having a
single firm that produced all the telephone handsets that connected
to the telephone network. Since the breakup, consumers have
benefited from the wider range of choice and more rapid innovation
in the handsets that competition made possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lesson of the AT&AMP;T breakup in 1984 applies to
Microsoft is open to question. ``Breaking up AT&AMP;T into long
distance service and the regional Bell operating companies was an
exercise with much clearer boundaries than splitting up Microsoft
would be,'' said Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But, Hall added, ``It is really up to Microsoft to come forward
and explain how the Windows and Office sides of the business work
together in ways that help consumers and do not illegally
disadvantage competitors. Microsoft has to let that process be
subject to scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft will be asking for more time _ months
more _ to take depositions and present witnesses to try to show
that the government's split-up plan is misguided.

 &HT;    Former NASA chaplain named pastor of nation's largest
Presbyterian church
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Peachtree Presbyterian Church, the nation's largest
Presbyterian congregation, Sunday called as its new senior minister
a man whose influence has extended beyond the planet: the Rev.
Victor Pentz, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Houston and
chaplain for three NASA mission crews.
</P>
<P>
   An almost electric buzz crackled Sunday as a standing-room-only
crowd packed the sanctuary for the vote. The 11,000-member church
has been without a senior pastor since the death in March 1999 of
the Rev. Frank Harrington, who had held the job for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a photograph of Pentz projected onto large screens on both
sides of the sanctuary, Frank Skinner, chairman of the 11-member
pastor nominating committee, named Pentz as the committee's choice.
Pentz, 52, who goes by ``Vic,'' first caught the nominating
committee's attention because of the ``strength and vitality of his
sermons'' and impressed the panel with his record of community
service and his appreciation of music as a part of worship, Skinner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentz did not seek out the committee, Skinner said, ``we sought
him. Oh, how we sought him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of leading the Peachtree congregation takes my
breath away,'' Pentz said in a letter to the church. ``Any person
not in awe of following Dr. Harrington into the Peachtree pulpit is
not thinking clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentz was one of the founders of Presbyterians for Renewal, an
organization formed in 1989 with the mission of reinvigorating the
2.6-million-member mainline Presbyterian church. Among the group's
positions on social issues is support for maintaining the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ban on ordaining sexually active
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Pentz identifies his theology as ``ecumenical in its scope,
conservative in the sense that it is Biblically grounded, liberal
in the sense that it is open to fresh insights and new expressions.

ENDURING LESSONS, LEARNED IN THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never set out to write a whole book about my dog Colter, much
less two books, but he was such a force, such a marvelous animal
and taught me so much _ about hunting, certainly, but about barely
controllable and indomitable passion as well _ that in his absence
my pen has been moving and even now has not yet ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Ours was a complex relationship, certainly. I was 41 years old
before I was ever even asked the difference between caring for and
admiring, even loving, one animal, such as a dog, like Colter, and
hunting another animal, such as a grouse: using, in fact, that
first animal, Colter, to lead you to the second in order that the
two of you _ dog and man, or dog and woman _ might then endeavor to
take the bird's life.
</P>
<P>
   The why of the relationship is simple: a dog such as my great
Colter can find a hidden bird _ a pheasant, a sharp-tailed grouse,
a bobwhite quail _ where I cannot, where I would walk right on
past. The why is easy: using a great dog like Colter is the most
efficient, as well as most exhilarating, way to find the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The dog's talents and enthusiasm _ mania is perhaps the more
accurate word _ stretch your own tired and dull senses. When you
are hunting with the dog, pursuing the thing the dog has been
pursuing forever, the dog requires that you become more alert, more
alive: more engaged, not only to landscape and quarry but to the
dog's own responses to these things.
</P>
<P>
   If the question is, however, why, if one admires the dog's
talents and nearly as deeply admires the wild bird's qualities,
does one participate in the nurturing of one and yet the pursuit,
with the goal of rendering into food, the other _ well, I can't
answer for the dog. But I can tell what it is like for me, when I
am engaged fully in the hunt with a creature I've cared for and
known for each day of the year, hunting on my home ground, land I
live on or pass by almost every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps in the telling of what it is like, this other why
can be discovered, or seen. And even now considering the question,
it seems to me not so much that there is a difference between the
two _ caring for the dog, but not for the bird _ but rather the
opposite, particularly when in the field, when dog, bird and hunter
are braided together: converging, not separating.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gassett said that in the realm
of natural history (and what other kind is there?) the prey, with
its flight, fairly summons the predator; that, as paraphrased by
Thomas McIntyre, ``animals thought of as game are not hunted by
chance, but because in the instinctive depths of their natures,
they have already foreseen the hunter (before he even enters the
woods) and have, therefore, been shaped to be alert, suspicious,
and evasive. ... And again according to the philosopher, the only
adequate response to a being that lives obsessed with avoiding
capture is to try to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd agree with certain elements of this idea, particularly since
I've never felt any inkling to hunt other predators _ bears, lions,
etc. _ nor the largest mammals, like moose or elephants, which do
not flee.
</P>
<P>
   Each hunter, I think, has one particular species, or sort of
species, whose manner and flight and habits and native landscape
most speak to, and summon, him or her. (For me it is the upland
birds, which crouch and then whir away fast. For others it is the
white-tailed deer; for others, the elk. I think that each
combination of hunter, landscape and quarry sounds a slightly
different resonance in the heart of each individual hunter.)
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, then all variances of bad behavior from hunters _
or shooters, as I call them _ as well as all puzzlement or
disbelief or misunderstanding by nonhunters, as to why a hunter
hunts, with or without a dog (the dog in the best instances an
extension of the hunter's self, taking his or her senses a bit
further than where they could travel otherwise) might result from
the inability to reside, or understand what it is like to reside,
within that personal summons.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, I think, is the hunter or shooter who goes afield,
and persists afield without an examining of these things: who hunts
(or shoots) only to fill his or her bag, or to step outside him- or
herself in order to view the picture he or she makes in that
pursuit, rather than becoming lost in that summons, if indeed the
mysterious twinings of blood and landscape and quarry and hunger
and experience and dog and season and perhaps 10,000 other
variables do combine in that person, as it is said they do in
roughly 5 percent of our population, to elicit a summons in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   I like being alone in the field, or with one or two good
friends, keeping my eyes pretty much on the dog: shifting them from
the landscape, to the dog, to my friend, back to the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Can I really explain what it is like, to reside in that place?
Not really. I can only write about it. Another person without this
same blood and experience could stand on the same hillside, behind
the same dog pointing to the same hidden bird _ awaiting the
thunderous explosion of wings _ but that person would not be me,
would not be inside me.
</P>
<P>
   What the summons is like is a thing more ineluctable than scent
or any quarry. It is the essence of one's own blood imperative,
being called into the world. I don't end up taking many wild birds.
But the distance between their dark deep flesh, so hard-gotten, and
the blander hues of food, plant or animal gotten in some other
manner, known or unknown, is the distance that separates me from
much of the rest of the world. It is the distance that allows me to
fit, semi-smoothly, into my place in the world, and into the place
inside myself: the place where I'm most comfortable and where the
world makes the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   It happens in the autumn. I step into that place. I become more
myself and move toward, and after, the prey that was chosen for me
long before I was born. The wild landscape becomes the widened
boundaries of my life. The dog is my partner in this part of my
journey.

FORMER SOTHEBY'S OFFICIAL IS IN LIMBO INSTEAD OF IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  BY CAROL VOGEL and RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In other times, this would have been Diana D. Brooks'
moment.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the multimillion-dollar spring auctions of
Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in New York, it was
always Brooks' striking presence and booming voice that
predominated.
</P>
<P>
   As the auction house's president and chief executive, she
cropped up on ``Charlie Rose'' or ``Today,'' talking up the
forthcoming sales. She greeted the thousands of visitors who
thronged Sotheby's York Avenue galleries to view the art coming up
for auction. Brooks, six feet tall with distinctive curly blond
hair, presided over cocktail parties, dinners and brunches in the
United States and abroad for Sotheby's big-money collectors. When
the selling began, sometimes she even wielded the auction gavel
herself.
</P>
<P>
   But as experts finish preparing for the two weeks of auctions at
Sotheby's and Christie's that begin Monday night _ hundreds of
millions of dollars' worth of art will change hands _ there is an
uncomfortable silence on York Avenue. Brooks, who had become
something of a celebrity in the 13 years since Sotheby's made her
the first woman to head an auction house, resigned under fire on
Feb. 21, along with A. Alfred Taubman, the company's chairman and
its biggest shareholder, in connection with a federal antitrust
investigation. Allegations center on whether the two colluded with
their counterparts at Christie's, Sotheby's archrival, in setting
the commissions charged to buyers and sellers. Between them
Sotheby's and Christie's dominate the multibillion-dollar auction
market.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of financial ruin or even prison has taken a toll
on Brooks and her family, friends and associates say. ``She is
extraordinarily upset and terrified about the consequences,'' one
friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity. She recently cut
her hair short and straightened it to be less recognizable. But the
friend also described her as resilient and physically fit, still
devoted to morning runs of several miles.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one visit to Sotheby's since her resignation _
several hours that employees described as painful in their
awkwardness _ Brooks, 49, has kept to herself, spending
considerable time at her mother's house in Hobe Sound, Fla., but
returning periodically to a luxury apartment on the East Side of
Manhattan and a Connecticut home.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Michael C. Brooks, a venture capitalist,
recently bought a house in Jupiter, Fla.; Florida protects homes
from seizure in bankruptcy proceedings. The week she resigned from
Sotheby's, the couple put their 7,262-square-foot Colonial house in
Greenwich, Conn., on the market for $4 million, along with an
additional two-acre plot for $1.5 million. They also own a
residence in Lawrence, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks turned away numerous requests for interviews, made
through one of her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman, and Sotheby's chief
spokeswoman, Diana Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, a longtime confidante of Brooks, said that they had
spoken from time to time since Brooks' resignation and that ``she
sounded fine.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brooks' lawyers maneuver to negotiate a settlement with the
Justice Department, her life is in limbo. If charged and found
guilty, she could be heavily fined and sentenced to up to three
years in prison. But the Justice Department could still determine
that the evidence is insufficient to warrant prosecution, or it
might offer her lenience or even immunity in exchange for her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the case said she was prepared to testify that
Taubman had directed her to meet with her counterpart at
Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, to discuss price-fixing
arrangements. But they said she would give such testimony only in
exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors. Such a statement
would support one made by Davidge, who has told the government that
a former chairman of Christie's, Sir Anthony Tennant, devised the
price-fixing scheme in meetings with Taubman and then instructed
Davidge to carry it out on behalf of Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's turned over documentation from Davidge to the
government and has received immunity dependent on its continued
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Through their lawyers Taubman and Sir Anthony have disputed the
accounts and denied any wrongdoing. The chief Justice Department
antitrust prosecutor in New York, John J. Greene, has consistently
declined to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Life at Sotheby's is not going on entirely without Brooks.
Although she is no longer a company officer _ she and Taubman are
now listed only as board members in Sotheby's catalogs, and even
those references will soon disappear as neither is standing for
re-election _ she remains on her full salary of $600,000, people
close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's new chief executive, who joined
the company in 1980, confirmed only that she was still getting paid
for helping with what he called the transition. Art dealers say
that she has been calling their clients, hoping to win business for
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   So big was her role at Sotheby's that it was impossible for her
simply to walk away, officials at the company say. It was Brooks
who shaped relationships with the company's most important clients,
often pre-empting other Sotheby's specialists. It was Brooks who
brokered every important deal, whether for a highly valuable
Picasso or for a giant canary diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very smart, innovative thinker,'' said George Goldner,
chairman of the department of prints and drawings at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, who negotiated complicated deals with
Sotheby's while curator of paintings and drawings at the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Los Angeles. ``She was not restricted by the boring
ways most people buy and sell art.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and dealers say they do not believe the Justice
Department investigation will hamper a serious collector who covets
a Monet or a Matisse. But in an auction world governed by the
``three D's'' _ death, divorce and debt _ the robust economy is
such that collectors who don't have to part with their artworks are
holding on to them. Since no big collectors died this past winter,
experts at both Sotheby's and Christie's were left to scramble for
property.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was Sotheby's most powerful business getter.
</P>
<P>
   The first daughter of a family of six children, Brooks was
brought up comfortably on the North Shore of Long Island. She once
said she remembered her father, Martin, telling her she could do
anything her two older brothers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed him,'' she said years ago. ``When I was 8, I
announced I wanted to go to Yale.'' She graduated from Yale in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   The man she would marry, Brooks, was also a Yale graduate. Their
eldest child, a daughter, graduated from Yale last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her father controlled the only private water company covering a
part of New York City, the Jamaica Water Co. After he died in 1977,
Brooks' brother, Andrew, took over the company, then called Jamaica
Water Properties, and through rapid acquisitions built it into the
nation's largest computer reseller, a multibillion-dollar public
company renamed JWP Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks later joined the board of JWP but left before December
1993, when the company collapsed in bankruptcy and litigation
charging fraud in bookkeeping. JWP later re-emerged as the Emcor
Group. A lawsuit by insurance companies seeking to recover $148
million from Ernst &AMP; Young, JWP's accounting firm, was recently
reinstated by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
Brooks was not a defendant in the actions.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks got to Sotheby's by accident. In 1979, while taking a
leave from Citibank, where she was a lending officer, to spend more
time with her infant daughter, she was told by a friend that
Sotheby's was looking for a business person. She was hired part
time as director of financial planning and soon assumed the job
full time.
</P>
<P>
   For four years Brooks, who is known to her friends and
colleagues as Dede (pronounced DEE-Dee), concentrated on the
business side of the company. Then she moved into a more
administrative position. That was in 1982, when the company's
profits were down and its staff bloated. Through buyouts and pink
slips, Brooks reduced the staff by 90. The move earned her praise
from some outside financial analysts, but some inside the company
called her ``the hatchet woman.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boss Brooks was known for putting a premium on the
company's profitability and seeking out new business opportunities,
for instance, using the Internet and offering clients insurance.
She stressed that the company's future depended on reaching beyond
the traditional deep-pocketed buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But her management style lacked subtlety and got mixed reviews.
``Dede is an extremely smart person, effective in putting teams
together in every imaginable project and creative in bringing
people together, often outside their regular expertise,'' her
successor, Ruprecht, said. ``We had a full and frank relationship
with each other, and `warm' needs to get added to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But some colleagues and former Sotheby's employees, who signed
confidentiality agreements in exchange for lucrative financial
settlements but who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said
she displayed a temper and willfulness, sometimes directed even at
Taubman, the chairman, who himself is strong willed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happened without her knowledge or say-so,'' said one
former employee. ``She micromanaged everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ruprecht made light of such accounts, saying, ``She
deconstructed some things and put them back together.'' He called
her ``a conciliator and provocateur, as any boss needs to be,''
adding, ``We worked all the time in concert _ not all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, despite occasional frictions, Brooks won the
support and respect of Taubman. ``I think they worked closely with
each other for a long period of time,'' Ruprecht said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 she was elected to the board of the Yale Corp., on which
she still serves. She and her husband have contributed generously
to the university.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked to leave another board, however, that of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, after she resigned at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   She supports various charities, including a juvenile outreach
program in Baltimore that she and two friends started after Brooks'
godson, a 19-year-old high school student, committed suicide two
years ago. A sportswoman who runs nearly every day and was known to
have whipped male employees on company golf outings, Brooks
frequently spends vacations tackling challenging pursuits like
helicopter skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Her competitive side was just as visible in the office. When the
company arranged with Amazon.com last year to create a new Web site
called Sothebys.Amazon.com, which sells collectibles online, Brooks
was all over the airwaves once more. The company has poured tens of
millions of dollars into that site and a sister one, and once more
Brooks was not only Sotheby's champion, but also its
personification. Promotions for the Amazon venture featured a
picture of Jeff Bezos, chairman and founder of Amazon, and Brooks
posed together in a gilt frame.
</P>
<P>
   That was only last summer, but in many ways it was a long time
ago.

 &HT;    Student awarded scholarships to five U.S. military academies
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery

<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Maybe in these days of tech stocks and
teenage millionaires, it's not so unusual to hear about a kid worth
just over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But at Lake Worth High School, there's a senior who earned it in
the old-fashioned way. He studied his calculus, volunteered in the
town's parks, and applied to all five American military academies _
and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   There's $250,000 from West Point, the U.S. Army's academy;
another quarter-million from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md.; not to mention the money from the Air Force, Coast Guard and
Merchant Marines, and the Navy's scholarship to University of San
Diego _ worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Ron Spellman, a public affairs officer at the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy, didn't have specific numbers on how many
students get accepted into all five military academies. But, he
said, ``It's far from a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Matt Tanguay will report to the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn., for his new haircut and dress whites.
He will study naval architecture and prepare for a career as a
Coast Guard officer. It was his first choice all along, fulfilling
his desire to spend his life near the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Tanguay is as calm as a flat sea in the sunshine _
years and years of waiting for the right wave on a surfboard off
Lantana Beach will do that to you _ as he explained the work that
went into his recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sacrificed a lot of parties to work on school projects or
get my homework finished, but I think it'll work out in the long
run,'' said Tanguay, who has a career 3.9 grade point average. ``I
think most of my friends would say first that I'm a nerd. I like to
read, I like to do my homework, I'm happy when I'm doing my
calculus _ that's my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after they thought about it a little, I think they'd say _
Matt's a leader, because I'm the guy who's always making plans for
them, telling them where to go. And they'd say I have good morals,
I'm trustworthy, that I'm a good person. There was this day when
the soda machine was unlocked and everyone was saying _ Free Sodas!
_ and I said, 'That's all right. If I want a soda, I'll pay for
one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   There also was the night that Tanguay stopped a carful of
friends because an elderly woman on the sidewalk was getting
hassled by some kids, he said. They were on their way back from
``Fiddler on the Roof'' rehearsals two years ago _ Tanguay played
the rabbi's son, a minor part, he said modestly _ when they saw the
woman poking her cane at her antagonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be (upset) if I saw my grandmother getting hassled,''
Tanguay recalled. ``So I said 'Hey, stop the car' and we chased the
kids away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay is the perfect kid, Cotter said. He competed on the high
school's wrestling and golf teams; he's taking three advanced
classes this semester; and he's won the school's Most Spirited
award four years running. He also helped rebuild a local park and
rang a Salvation Army bell at Christmas, and he's held high-ranking
positions in ROTC since the summer after his freshman year. Back
then, Cotter asked him to take on public affairs duties for the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got everybody but Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw to show up,''
Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tanguay said ROTC has given him leadership skills,
taught him how to lead by example, and feel comfortable in a
uniform. And he said he knows it sounds corny, but it has made him
feel part of a team or brotherhood _ one where it's actually cool
to do well in school _ and he hopes he has the same feeling in the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   West Point is better known. Annapolis is right on the Chesapeake
Bay. But Tanguay doesn't want to spend his life preparing for war,
he said, and the Coast Guard has a peacetime mission. After a
summer at the Coast Guard's Academy Introductory Mission program,
which simulates the first few weeks of a typical freshman year,
Tanguay knew he wanted to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't walk away saying it was fun, but I said it was
something I want to be part of,'' he said. ``Honestly, I want to be
a Coast Guard officer. It's not like I just want the free
schooling, and then I'm going to ditch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay hopes one day, one perfect day, to be somewhere in
Hawaii, commanding a Coast Guard cutter making its way to yet
another spectacular rescue, or another day of environmental
clean-up, or just another day of sea and sun.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Cypress Hills Cemetery in Queens seemed quiet,
but Claudia Shear knew better. She waved her arm toward the
hundreds of gravestones that surrounded her and said: ``Aren't we
lucky? That's what everyone is telling us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck is very much on Shear's mind these days, and for good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Her new play, ``Dirty Blonde,'' about love, cross-dressing and
Mae West, has just opened on Broadway. (Ben Brantley of The New
York Times called it ``hands down the best new American play of the
season.'') The show has been nominated for five Drama Desk Awards,
including best actress for her own performance and best play. It is
based on an idea she developed at the New York Theater Workshop
with the show's director, James Lapine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the luckiest girl on Broadway,'' she said more than once.
And she was back at the cemetery to visit the girl who inspired
``Dirty Blonde,'' who may have been the last woman before Shear to
write her own Broadway play (not a one-woman show) and star in it:
``Sex'' in 1927. West is buried in the Cypress Hills Abbey, a
mausoleum built in 1926, with her parents and siblings. Shear set
one of the scenes of her play there.
</P>
<P>
   While her sense of luck and gratitude is touching, the fact
remains that she has made much of her own luck.
</P>
<P>
   No one was lining up to cast an overweight actress, but her
first play, ``Blown Sideways Through Life,'' won an Obie award in
1994, was published by Dial Press, was produced for television by
American Playhouse, and ran for a year off-Broadway. It chronicled
her own life as a runaway who took 64 menial jobs to support
herself _ everything from short-order cook to brothel receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   Being an outsider, Lapine says, is one of Shear's strengths; it
was also one of West's. ``Mae West came from left field in the same
way Claudia does,'' he says. ``It's a matter of finding the right
kind of persona for her talent instead of trying to be someone
else. Both are forces of nature. Claudia is unstoppable, and I
imagine Mae West was the same. You don't want to get in Claudia's
way when she's set her mind on something.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed not. After two hours in her company, first eating lunch
at Diner beneath the Williamsburg Bridge near her Brooklyn
apartment, and then driving to the cemetery, I had watched her
leave additional money with the 40 percent tip I had already left,
and listened to her barking instructions at her publicity agent via
cell phone (``This is what I want ...'') and at me (``Put your seat
belt on'').
</P>
<P>
   Her fingernails and toenails were painted the same shade of
shocking pink, her sunglasses were orange plastic to complement her
striped shirt, and she gleefully recalled meeting the Broadway
stagehands who would witness her many costume changes and saying:
``Hi! You're going to see me naked. Nice to meet you.'' She's the
kind of person who is ``on'' even when no one else is looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to come up with a downside to being an
outsider,'' she said at lunch, hungrily eating a BLT. ``Sure, I'd
love to be Jennifer Ehle and have Rosemary Harris as my mother. But
with `Blown Sideways,' the very things that were the trials of my
life _ that I was alone, that behind my heels was the abyss, that
the only thing I wanted to be was an actress, wanted it so badly
and no one thought I was good at it or right for it _ well, those
trials became the making of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of what it would be like to be young, beautiful, thin,
perceived as a serious actress. But when you have this edifice that
is your life, you think, `What would I remove to have those?' Not a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her success (she has been a guest star on ``Friends,''
written a screenplay for Meg Ryan and had a sitcom deal with
DreamWorks), she won't even consider moving to Manhattan. ``My
apartment costs nothing,'' she said, adding that by keeping it she
did not have to take work she did not like. ``I live my life my own
way,'' she said emphatically. ``It's like the house-guest thing.
I'd rather sleep in a box in the alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she always wanted to act, she came to writing later in
life. It was James C. Nicola, the artistic director of New York
Theater Workshop, who suggested she start what became ``Blown
Sideways,'' with the idea that her own material might suit her
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think because I write in the first person that I'm not
writing, not acting, and it's all about me,'' she said. When she
wrote ``Dirty Blonde,'' though, she continued, ``I would try on
clothes, put on makeup, dance to songs, walk around my apartment
for hours as Mae. Then I'd make a lot of phone calls, sit down, get
up, sit down and get up five hours later. With writing, it's as if
I woke up one morning with a piano in my house and I knew how to
play it.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was younger she was too busy supporting herself, first
while earning a degree at City University, and later as she tried
to become an actress. Her parents divorced when she was a child,
and her father, assistant chief of the New York Fire Department,
married another woman and adopted her children before he died,
which is all Shear will reveal about him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blown Sideways'' she referred to running away, though she
has since reconciled with her mother, a former account executive at
Helena Rubenstein, who, her daughter said, ``used to work 99 hours
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dirty Blonde'' Shear plays two characters, Mae West and Jo,
an overweight, ordinary New Yorker who meets a man who also
worships Mae West. It's about confidence, love and sex. And Shear,
as Mae, plays sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people didn't buy that, the play wouldn't work,'' she said,
acknowledging that plays and films with large women as sex symbols
are not a common sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, as a child I was tormented by sports,'' she said.
``Who wins? Who cares? But when I began to study dance, my body
ceased to matter. I accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked thoughtful. ``These are deep personal topics, and I
have a very dichotomous feeling about it. Part of me doesn't want
to refer to it. And the other side is you've got to tell the truth.
If I hide and say I'm ashamed of myself, it doesn't help anybody.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She smiled slyly. ``I also go to London, Paris and Rome, where I
have a huge amount of friends and I have handsome men kiss me on
terraces in front of the Eiffel Tower. That doesn't hurt. But love
is a whole different question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this play from a place of great heartbreak,'' she
went on, speaking of a failed relationship. ``That's how I
connected to Mae West. I'm not a big important white-guy
playwright. To me the play is about such profoundly personal
things. Who will love me if they know what I really am? Who will
truly love me?'' She cried and pressed a paper napkin to her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrote `Blown Sideways,' I just thought I'd get an
agent,'' she said. ``But to this day people come up to me and grab
my hand and say, `I'm you and you're me.' The really true stuff
becomes universal.'' Does she think about having children? She
nodded. Getting married? She half nodded. ``It's about finding a
kindred spirit,'' she said. ``I don't know what makes that happen.
I guess it depends on what you look like in pants.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cypress Hills, on her way into the mausoleum, she swamped
herself in an enormous cashmere sweater to keep warm and protect
her voice. It was frigid, as Bill Moloney, the assistant manager,
led us upstairs. (The Abbey is closed to the public.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Jackie Robinson here and Peter Luger,'' he said by way
of conversation. ``Here she is.'' He stopped in front of a wall
where the coffins are entombed behind panels of Italian marble.
``Mae West 1893-1980'' the top one says; the others are lined up
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Shear stepped toward the iron gate that stands in front of the
wall and placed a vial of pomegranate oil there that she had
brought back from Florence, Italy. She stepped back and her eyes
filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her birthday was August, right?'' Moloney asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shear nodded: ``August 17.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Every August we have a corrections officer _ at
Rikers, I think _ a young lady who brings her flowers. Every
August.''
</P>
<P>
   Shear stepped back from the wall and sighed. ``Thank you,'' she
said, turning to go. It wasn't clear to whom she was speaking.
</P>
<P>
   When we drove back to Manhattan, her mood lifted as she talked
about her co-stars, Kevin Chamberlin and Bob Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laugh onstage sometimes, I can't help it,'' she said. ``And
James calls me and says, `Absolutely no laughing onstage!' She
smiled. ``I always say Olivier had that problem, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mired in traffic, with a chiropractor, a hairdresser and a
rehearsal waiting, Shear refused to even consider being late. ``I
will be there,'' she said loudly, focusing on the other side of the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help but root for her. She's got to get there, keep
going, stay at it, because she's only at the beginning. And
besides, as West said, ``A dame that knows the ropes isn't likely
to get tied up.''

ONLINE RETAILERS SET THEIR SIGHTS ON PRIVATE-LABEL MERCHANDISE

<P>
   Internet retailers spent the latter half of the 1990s trumpeting
the differences between their business models and those of
traditional retailers. Now that Wall Street is holding the
e-tailers accountable and demanding signs of future profitability,
Web merchants have shown a new respect for their bricks-and-mortar
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: E-commerce companies have turned to an old
retailing standby, private-label manufacturing, to give them higher
profit margins and better control of inventory. Items like dog
food, cosmetics, diamonds, toys and golf clubs, to name a few, now
wear dot-com labels, and more are joining every week.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail executives say that by manufacturing their own
goods and selling them alongside well-known brands, they can hasten
the slow march toward profits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally agree, but caution that several obstacles
could slow or even stall the private-label effort online. And in an
environment in which Web merchants have decreasing room for error,
they are moving as gingerly as they can _ while maintaining
Internet speed _ into this corner of the retailing realm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest companies to announce a private-label effort is
Ashford.com, an online seller of jewelry, apparel and other goods.
Late last month, the company rolled out the Ashford Collection, an
assortment of jewelry manufactured exclusively for Ashford, and it
will add similar lines of pens, scarves and leather goods in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Kurtzman, the company's chief executive, said several
factors were behind the move, but none more important than profit
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``By purchasing directly from manufacturers, we can price 40 to
50 percent cheaper and still make 50 to 70 percent margins,'' he
said. ``If we can generate 20 percent of our sales from private
label, and have a 60 percent margin, while the other 80 percent of
sales generates a 35 percent margin, that's a definite contributor
to cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of private-label manufacturing, Kurtzman said,
is that his company ``can react to customer trends more quickly
because the turnaround time is much shorter.'' For instance, he
said, if a certain type of earring generates buzz among consumers,
the company could have that earring in stock within six weeks,
``whereas with some of the brands, it'd take a year or more to see
changes in the product lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Such goods are also less likely to collect dust in the
warehouse, Kurtzman said. ``And with faster inventory turns, you
have less cash tied up in your inventory,'' he added. ``Again, that
helps you reach profitability more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail
Federation, a trade group, said selling by private label ``has been
a very serious growth vehicle for many traditional
bricks-and-mortar retailers in the past seven or eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives retailers greater control of sales and marketing,''
he said, because brand manufacturers often dictate the terms of
pricing and advertising. ``And obviously, it's significantly more
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Kleeck said dot-com companies faced a greater challenge
in introducing private labels because online shoppers generally
have a brand name in mind before they visit a specific Web site.
Consumers may be more wary of unbranded goods like private label
clothing that they have never seen, felt or tried on. ``The
consumers who've bought into e-commerce have done so because they
know the merchant or the product,'' Van Kleeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting consumers to try the product of a newly created company,
he said, could require considerably more marketing. ``But getting
people to turn away from traditional brands also takes time,'' Van
Kleeck said. ``And in Internet time, who knows what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chipshot.com, one of the earliest proponents of
online private-label retailing, the answer is two years. The
company, which sells golfing merchandise, began manufacturing irons
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Brian Sroub, said Chipshot
generated a substantial portion of its revenues by selling its own
brand. ``It's been the basis of our business,'' Sroub said. He
added that the private-label approach ``allows us to offer superior
quality at a lower price, and retain higher margins for
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, with Chipshot irons, Sroub said, the company buys
the grips, shafts and club heads from the same manufacturers that
supply the traditional brands, so the quality is the same. But
because Chipshot assembles the clubs when the orders are taken, it
can customize the clubs to the customer's specifications and
deliver them within a week _ a service that can take several weeks
at offline retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers of private-label merchandise must balance such
benefits against potentially sizable pitfalls. Among them is the
possibility that well-known manufacturers will refuse to sell them
their goods if they sense that the retailer is competing too
fiercely against them. Such so-called channel conflict can doom
e-tailers that use the big brands to draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all retail categories are so dependent on brands, and
those that are not have generated some of the more aggressive
private-label efforts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the sales of Furniture.com, for instance, are
attributable to private-label brands. Andrew Brooks, the company's
chief executive, said the site began carrying private-label goods
in its early days partly because the brand-name manufacturers did
not want to alienate their traditional retailer partners by selling
through a Web merchant.
</P>
<P>
   But the company quickly learned that ``furniture buyers don't
shop for brand,'' but for style, Brooks said. As a result, the Web
site groups furniture into collections of similar styles, he said,
an approach that yielded $20 million in sales during the last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of well-known furniture brands is perhaps one reason
another high-profile e-tailer, eToys, is rolling out its
private-label effort with a collection of children's furnishings.
Jane Saltzman, vice president for merchandising at eToys, said the
company would begin selling 500 different products with the eToys
brand this fall, and branch out to other categories besides
furniture. ``We'll grow beyond that 500, but not to tens of
thousands,'' she said. ``I see this as a complement to our
assortment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kurtzman, of Ashford.com, said: ``It's important to
understand that this is about optimizing the balance between
branded and private-label goods. It's not a panacea for an Internet
retailer. It won't completely change the business model. But it's
certainly something we all need to do to generate cash and achieve
profitability more quickly. And the companies that don't do it will
have a harder time getting to where they need to be.''

SERMONS PUNCTUATE AN EVENING OF TAVENER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The concert of Sir John Tavener's music at the Church
of St. Ignatius Loyola last Thursday night included minisermons
from the composer. He spoke about the power of Jesus, about the
``metaphysical subtext'' of his own music and about summoning the
divine imagination to go ``beyond the realm of our contemporary
scientific mass-genocidal world.'' That same mixture of humility
and grandeur informs his compositions. Nearly every piece on the
program was an elegy or a prayer; the music quietly contemplated
death, then turned triumphal as it invoked resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Tavener's music has a neomedieval aura. He reaches back to the
modality of Renaissance music and outward to non-Western music,
particularly the sound of liturgical music from the Russian
Orthodox Church, which he has joined. Along with such mystical
minimalists as Arvo Paert, he stands aside from Europe's last 400
years, as if seeking purity through asceticism. The music rejects
the bustle and compromises of everyday life; it's a pristine
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The program was performed by the Tallis Scholars, a vocal
ensemble directed by Peter Phillips that usually sings Renaissance
music. Using a minimum of vibrato on Tavener's stately legato
phrases, they sustained the music's otherworldly calm.
</P>
<P>
   At its best Tavener's music projects simplicity without turning
simplistic. ``Song for Athene,'' which was sung at the funeral of
Diana, Princess of Wales, set out what could almost be a cozy
Anglican hymn, then moved through modernist dissonances before
resounding organ chords proclaimed an entrance into paradise. ``In
the Month of Athyr'' sets a poem by C.P. Cavafy, musing over a
worn, ancient tombstone. The chorus sings the few words _
``tears,'' ``grief'' _ that can be read in clear parallel lines
over a drone, while a narrator describes the scene. Last Thursday
night the somber narrator was Sir Paul McCartney, who drew some
Beatles fans to the sold-out concert.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pieces on the program were modeled after antiphonal
church music, with a chantlike solo voice answered by choral
polyphony in which Tavener takes modern liberties. Some chorales
had austere modal harmonies; in others, independent lines wandered
toward impassive dissonance. Occasionally women's voices floated
upward in chromatic harmonies out of Debussy, like sirens in a

   ``Lament of the Mother of God'' generated drama with an
elementary strategy: as Mary poured out her grief, the key moved
upward with every verse. Patricia Rozario sang the demanding part
with sorrowful concentration. She was also the soloist in ``A New
Beginning,'' commissioned for Britain's Year 2000 celebration. The
music ended gently after the inevitable trumpets and drums.
</P>
<P>
   When the Flux String Quartet performed ``The Hidden Treasure,''
a lengthy, episodic piece based on earnest cello melodies (with
some Slavic inflections) and ghostly high chords, the music grew
threadbare. It needed text, not subtext. But tied to human voices,
Alleluias and words about death and transcendence, Tavener's music
was filled with serene reverence.

WITH ITS E-MAIL INFECTED, HOW FORD SCRAMBLED AND CAUGHT UP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Kevin J. Timms, the Ford Motor Co.'s
37-year-old computer security manager, arrived at work here in his
metallic blue Mercury Cougar at 6:45 on Thursday morning, a
not-uncommon hour for managers at Midwest manufacturers. He was
just walking into his office when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Chapman, the manager of Ford's computer center in Warley,
England, had determined that a new, malignant computer program was
spreading swiftly across Ford's global e-mail network. He suggested
that the entire network be shut down for the first time. Timms
agreed, and told his staff to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision quickly reached LeRoy Boyd, a network administrator
here. He began shutting down the computer servers that he oversaw
in one of Ford's main computer labs, a high-ceiling room nearly
half the length of a football field and crammed with tall racks of
black metal laden with computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd usually needed just seven minutes to complete that task,
but it proved more time-consuming on Thursday morning because of
frequent interruptions. ``It took me about 20 minutes,'' he said
with a tinge of embarrassment. ``People were coming in and walking
up and saying, `I can't get on the network.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like companies and individuals around the world, Ford was caught
by surprise on Thursday by a rogue software program propagated by
e-mail messages with ``I love you'' in the subject field. People
who clicked on an attachment to the message accidentally forwarded
the message to everyone in their e-mail address book if they were
using Microsoft Outlook, a popular e-mail program. Those who opened
the attachment also risked losing some computer files.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue program was sent to as many as 45 million computers
worldwide, jamming electronic networks. Law enforcement officials
continued looking this weekend for the program's author, with the
search centering on the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was hit particularly hard, with up to 1,000 computers
directly infected and 30,000 salaried employees in Europe alone
receiving 140,000 contaminated e-mail messages in the three hours
before the network was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's difficulties with the program were exacerbated by the
sheer scale of its operations: 130,000 desktop computers in 46
countries spread across almost every time zone, and operated by
people speaking 14 languages. Not until Friday afternoon was Ford
able to turn its e-mail service back on for its North American
operations, while service did not resume in Latin America, Europe,
Asia and Africa until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even at Ford, the rogue program appears to have caused only
limited permanent damage. None of its 114 factories stopped,
according to the automaker. Computerized engineering blueprints and
other technical data were unaffected. Ford was still able to post
information for dealers and auto parts suppliers on Web sites that
it uses for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ford employees temporarily lost access to their personal
electronic calendars of meeting times. But the damage appears to
have been limited mainly to the erasing of some employees' files
with images and recordings, Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office here near the top of Ford's world
headquarters, with a view across miles of Ford office buildings and
factories, James Yost, the automaker's chief information officer,
concluded that the malignant program had in some ways resembled a
vandalism attack against the outside of an assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like someone breaking windows,'' he said.
``You've got to fix the windows so it won't get cold inside, but it
doesn't stop production.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the rogue program was particularly irritating for
Ford because the company's leaders have been trying to transform
their goliath of heavy manufacturing into more of a high-technology
company. Beginning later this month, Ford will offer desktop
computers with unlimited Internet access and color printers to each
of its 350,000 employees for just $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, sends an e-mail message
of company business developments to every salaried employee
worldwide each Friday, although the most recent message was not
sent until Sunday to avoid overloading the recovering mail system.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday afternoon it was not at all clear when Nasser
would be able to send his message. Timms and Boyd had called in
dozens of computer engineers, who filled Boyd's computer lab. But
when the Ford officials got the results of a quick analysis of the
virus they had commissioned from McAfee.com, an outside computer
security company, they found to their surprise that they recognized
large blocks of computer code in the rogue program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the script and we thought, `We've used this kind
of stuff,''' said Tom Truden, Ford's team leader for computer
emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the maliciously designed program turned out to be
very similar to software that the company uses to distribute
software updates _ including cures for security problems _ to Ford
computers around the world. The similarities between the malicious
program and Ford's software meant that computers already infected
with the program might not be able to execute cures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 3 or 4 o'clock when we realized we were staring at a
bit of a problem,'' Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's own computer engineers had designed the company's update
distribution software, but they used publicly available building
blocks, Timms continued. The rogue program uses some of the same
building blocks, though there is no sign that the rogue program was
developed from the software that Ford tailored to its own needs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 on Thursday evening, Timms and his staff at the computer
lab had agreed on an outline of new software to distribute as an
antidote for the malignant program, using different computer codes.
They ordered pizza and spent the night working with experts from
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, both of which have large staffs
living in Detroit to provide technical support for the automakers,
which are among their biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new software was written by 3 a.m. on Friday. The engineers
then spent nearly three hours testing the software on computers
designed to simulate Ford networks overseas. They made sure that
the software would work, for example, on Ford computers in China,
which use Chinese characters for the displays but the same
underlying programming as Ford computers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Timms had gone home for several hours of sleep. His engineers
paged him as he drove back to the computer lab before dawn and had
him pick up a couple of boxes of bagels and doughnuts for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ford began turning the computer servers back on for North
American e-mail users early Friday afternoon, and other regions'
servers were returned to service on Saturday. The first time each
desktop computer connected to the Ford network after it was
restored, it would automatically and immediately download a remedy
to eliminate the rogue program, because of the new software written
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To be cautious, the network's servers were turned on a few at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's starting to get tired, and you've got to slow down
so you don't make a mistake,'' said Boyd on Friday afternoon, after
working for 34 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Timms said that e-mail sent to the company while the servers
were off had been saved for later delivery, although technicians at
Ford's computer lab said that some mail, particularly attachments,
might have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ford financial officers had no immediate estimate of the cost to
the company from the rogue program, since employees carried out
other tasks instead of exchanging e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see the cost analysis that finance
does,'' Truden said.
</P>
<P>
   A few people even suggested facetiously that the delay or loss
of a few Powerpoint slide presentations and some e-mail might have
actually helped Ford, according to Dave Bent, the chief information
officer for the auto parts division. ``The joke is, `A day without
e-mail _ it's great,' '' he said.

`FRAU OHNE SCHATTEN': FREUDIAN OVERTONES FOR A SHADOWLESS BRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ In a highly charged political atmosphere, it
was the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on Sunday evening
at the site of a Nazi camp in Mauthausen that caught the attention
of the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet everything about this past weekend was unusual for the
Vienna Philharmonic: even the workload, substantial as that
typically is. The orchestra, which is drawn from forces of the
Vienna State Opera, played the Beethoven on Friday evening and
Saturday afternoon, with another performance to follow Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening most of the same players worked in the opera
pit for Strauss' ``Frau Ohne Schatten,'' beginning a second round
of Robert Carsen's new production _ the first production of the
work here in 35 years _ which played briefly in December. (Bizet's
``Carmen,'' on Sunday evening, was assigned to another contingent
of the opera orchestra.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet clearly nothing was held back in the Strauss opera, which
was given its premiere here in 1919 and depends heavily on
orchestral power and brilliance. Giuseppe Sinopoli conducted with
good pacing, generally giving sufficient quarter to singers who
needed relatively little.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Voigt was especially fine as the mythical Empress,
tortured by her lack of a shadow, not to say her inability to have
children. As at the Metropolitan Opera, Voigt's clear,
well-supported tone carried over the orchestra with apparent ease.
</P>
<P>
   Her effort was rivaled in strength and staying power, and at
times in sheer tonal beauty, by Falk Struckmann as Barak, the Dyer.
Ben Heppner, as the Emperor, appeared to be working harder to put
across his finely honed sound. And Gabriele Schnaut, as the Dyer's
Wife, though stentorian through two acts, seemed to weary in the
third, shading flat and sounding a bit stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all rose well to their big moments, as did Jane Henschel,
the Nurse, to hers at the end of Act 2.
</P>
<P>
   To two favorite sons of Vienna, Strauss and his librettist here,
Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Carsen's concept added a third: Freud. The
production made much not only of shadows but also of doors and
mirror images, and the program book followed course with essays
like ``Barak, Dyer and Psychotherapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The mythical realm went by the board _ or to stick to the
conceit, was sublimated _ in Carsen's set, which, centering on the
bedroom where the Empress spent so much time twisting and turning
in agony, resembled nothing so much as a hotel room left shortly
before, a block away on the city's famous Ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Dyer's lair, where couplings grew confused, was a recessed
version of same, disheveled as if in dream, with a place up front _
again, back in my hotel room, it sometimes seemed _ to sit around a
primitive fire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even by the standards of the subconscious, some images
proved ludicrous. Not soon will one forget the sight of Heppner,
stuffed into a three-piece suit, standing on the Empress' bed,
hovering precariously over Voigt while grasping for reasons not to
shoot her with his pretended bow and arrow.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for such oppressive drabness, Carsen supplied
lighting design that was often brilliant, if occasionally
self-consciously so. Aided by the costumes of Michael Levine, he
managed to leave the Empress largely shadowless in a world of
looming silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   And in Strauss' actual dream scene, in Act 2, he showed the
Empress in bed as if from above, superimposing film projections on
a scrim in front of her: an imaginative yet unobtrusive use of
technology to startling effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the image that proved most haunting on this occasion was a
hackneyed one: a sea of corpses surrounding the Empress as she was
coming to accept responsibility for human misery. For a viewer on
his way to Mauthausen, the scene, however stagy, was too literal
for comfort.

`SWEENY TODD': SPLENDID PERFORMANCE, POWERFUL THEATER

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question is boring, but one is obliged to ask it.
Is ``Sweeney Todd'' an opera? Here are three definitive answers: 1)
I don't care. 2) It doesn't matter. 3) No.
</P>
<P>
   No, at least as applied to Friday night's splendid performance
at Avery Fisher Hall. Maybe we are wrong to look for the label in
the garment. Maybe the name of the thing is in the eye of the
beholder: different onlooker, different measurements. (Einstein,
take note). Stephen Sondheim's grimly funny blood bath of a show,
which opened on Broadway in 1979 and has been much in our thoughts
ever since, is opera for those who expect it to be. But it was
certainly American musical theater for the wildly enthusiastic
audience that came to this, the second of the New York
Philharmonic's three performances.
</P>
<P>
   Describe Friday's event as ``semi-staged'' or an ``oratorio with
movement,'' a crisply managed version, directed by Lonny Price and
conducted by Andrew Litton. It was in the end a hybrid that drew
its elements from the place it was in and the materials with which
it was presented. The customary threat to operas-in-concert is an
orchestra not recessed in a theater pit but onstage, where its
members can cheerfully douse all but the mightiest singers in a
high tide of sound. Confronted by voice amplification, the mighty
Philharmonic offered only docile background to Sondheim's intricate
wordplay.
</P>
<P>
   To innocent ears this quasi-public-address system sounded
ghastly, but Broadway has found such electric tools useful in
combatting the challenged attention spans and hearing-impaired
spirits of the theater's new audiences. Amplification serves words,
and what separates Sondheim's art from grand opera is its literacy.
In ``Sweeney Todd'' words drive music. In Puccini music smothers
language, helpfully rescuing us from a lot of execrable melodrama.
Why else those printed librettos, supertitles and back-of-the-seat
television screens, bearing messages that in the end we wish we had
never read. (Ignorance can be bliss.)
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic's cast was evenly split between two art forms:
George Hearn, Patti LuPone, Audra McDonald, Davis Gaines and Neil
Patrick Harris drifting in and out of operatic voice but mainly
articulating texts as Broadway has taught them to do; Heidi Grant
Murphy, Paul Plishka, John Aler and Stanford Olsen working very
hard to make their big voices serve words.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Choral Artists, more accustomed to delivering Verdi
and Beethoven from a standing position, were prodded admirably by
their guest conductor, Grant Gershon, to march, writhe and
generally turn themselves into actors. They also sang very well.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway or opera? Again, the audience made that decision.
Murphy and Plishka, both first rate, received polite enthusiasm,
while Hearn and LuPone were engulfed in delirious ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Just as opera has its cults of the voice, musical theater
enthusiasts like those in Fisher Hall have their icons, too. Hearn
in the title role was splendid: self-possessed, clear of speech and
manipulating a cavernous voice to good effect. LuPone's Mrs. Lovett
exuded energetic charm but made this set of ears work very hard to
distinguish everything she said and sang.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's Beggar Woman was flat-out, concentrated emotion.
Harris' patter sounded admirably distinct. Gaines' throbbing
sentimentality bordered on overkill but was bearable in small
doses.
</P>
<P>
   At the end the original question comes back, and in reflection
it may not be so boring after all. Naming things _ opera, musical,
oratorio, symphony concert _ is after all how we make sense of the
world. One person walks through a forest or a flower bed and sees
masses of green, yellow, purple and white. Another identifies
spruce, oak, peonies and azaleas. The names are like eyeglasses;
they turn the vague into the specific; they sort out experience for
the senses.
</P>
<P>
   All this, I think, is true, but it still doesn't help me in
naming ``Sweeney Todd.'' I know that Sondheim has created powerful
and lasting theater, but that is about all I know.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DEAN OF DISCIPLINE IS ON THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One hundred and ninety eight times in his career,
Frank Robinson was either plugged, plunked, clipped, grazed,
drilled or beaned by a baseball, the third-highest total in Major
League Baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, says only once was he provoked to take a step
or two toward the mound, and that was against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a reputation, and there were circumstances,'' he
explained the other day, adding that the Giants had whacked him in
the same arm five days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when a pitcher throws the ball on the inside of the
plate, hitters see it as an insult that must be avenged on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of sorting all this out is Robinson, baseball's vice
president of on-field operations, who brings the instant
credibility of a Hall of Fame hitter who later managed three teams
and maybe, a time or two, ordered a knockdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamics have changed,'' Robinson said the other day.
``There was no warning rule when I played. You had to protect
yourself. If a pitcher wanted to hit you five times in a game, he
could. Today, if the umpire feels a pitcher deliberately hit
somebody, he can eject him from a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Robinson suspended Pedro Martinez, one of the best
pitchers in the universe, for five games for hitting a batter after
having been warned by an umpire not to retaliate for a previous hit
batter. Robinson will not discuss the specifics but will discuss
the nasty borderline between professional intimidation and flat-out
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   As a card-carrying member of the hitters union (586 homers, .294
career average), he gives the impression the hitters are even more
out of control than the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: The other day, Dennis Cook of the Mets hit Marvin
Benard of the Giants in the back _ tied score, eighth inning, one
out, runners on second and third. Benard stepped in front of home
and glared at Cook, long enough to empty both benches, just one
hothead short of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the score,'' Robinson said. ``Benard's a lefty, Cook's
a lefty, he wants to get him out. It's times like that when batters
should realize pitchers don't have perfect control.''
</P>
<P>
   In these expansion days, when many great athletes are out trying
to be the next Michael Jordan, baseball is stuck with untrained
pitchers who can't work inside and hitters who flail at everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an art to pitching inside,'' Robinson said. ``There
is an art of brushing back a hitter. There is also an art of
getting out of the way of a pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges the tradition of headhunters: ``There are always
guys who are not good enough to get people out. If you have to
resort to that, it's pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And he talks with reverence about Don Drysdale, who at least
smiled in a vicious sort of way, and Bob Gibson, who was downright
tetchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they call Sal Maglie the Barber?'' Robinson added, in
homage to the glowering New York presence of the 1950s. ``Because
he knew how to shave you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said today's hitters rarely think: ``Hey, it was my
fault. I didn't react.'' He added, ``The hitters today are all
looking for the ball away. The pitcher has the right to pitch
inside, but if they throw at the head or the shoulder, they should
be penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his theories on why tempers are up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole generation has come up,'' Robinson said. ``Maybe it's
the aluminum bats they use as kids. Pitchers don't get used to
pitching inside because they are not rewarded for it. Now you get
into pro ball and the pitchers try to reclaim the inside of the
plate and they don't know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he once managed a hitter who said, ``Hey, tell
them to get the ball over the plate.'' He had to explain to his
hitter that it was part of the game to run the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk like that, they look at you like you're from
another era,'' Robinson said, ``which maybe I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He set an example for Don Baylor, the career-leading hit batsman
with 267, who would take one on a meaty part of the body, smart
enough to know he had just made the equivalent of a single. Ron
Hunt, second with 243, had lesser talents and wore baggy uniforms,
hung over the plate, and smirked as he trotted down to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's just like the NBA,'' Robinson said, referring to
the sport that hangs around far too long into baseball weather.
``Today you have players dunking on people, jawing at people. It's
the same thing in baseball. The pitcher throws inside, he's staring
at the hitter, the hitter is jawing back at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to get across to pitchers is that they don't
have to retaliate,'' added Robinson, who took the feistiness of the
National League to the placid Brother-in-Law League back in 1966.
``There are other ways to settle things. You can slide hard into a
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players are hard to miss because of their lunging habits
and their miscellaneous armor, said Joe Torre, the manager of the
Yankees: ``Mo Vaughn, you can't pitch inside to him with all that
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mandatory helmets, players now wear elbow
guards, shin guards, wrist guards that theoretically protect
against injury but also bulge out a an inch or three, thereby
making it easier for them to get hit and escalate the cycle of
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of hit batsmen are up slightly from 278 to 300 in
the first 412 games of both 1999 to 2000, which may be
statistically meaningless. Home runs are surely up. The balls are
tightly wound _ and so are the players. &QL;

 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Maybe in these days of tech stocks and
teenage millionaires, it's not so unusual to hear about a kid worth
just over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But at Lake Worth High School, there's a senior who earned it in
the old-fashioned way. He studied his calculus, volunteered in the
town's parks, and applied to all five American military academies _
and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   There's $250,000 from West Point, the U.S. Army's academy;
another quarter-million from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md.; not to mention the money from the Air Force, Coast Guard and
Merchant Marines, and the Navy's scholarship to University of San
Diego _ worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Ron Spellman, a public affairs officer at the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy, didn't have specific numbers on how many
students get accepted into all five military academies. But, he
said, ``It's far from a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Tanguay will report to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy
in New London, Conn., for his new haircut and dress whites. He will
study naval architecture and prepare for a career as a Coast Guard
officer. It was his first choice all along, fulfilling his desire
to spend his life near the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Tanguay is as calm as a flat sea in the sunshine _
years and years of waiting for the right wave on a surfboard off
Lantana Beach will do that to you _ as he explained the work that
went into his recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sacrificed a lot of parties to work on school projects or
get my homework finished, but I think it'll work out in the long
run,'' said Tanguay, who has a career 3.9 grade point average. ``I
think most of my friends would say first that I'm a nerd. I like to
read, I like to do my homework, I'm happy when I'm doing my
calculus _ that's my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after they thought about it a little, I think they'd say _
Matt's a leader, because I'm the guy who's always making plans for
them, telling them where to go. And they'd say I have good morals,
I'm trustworthy, that I'm a good person. There was this day when
the soda machine was unlocked and everyone was saying _ Free Sodas!
_ and I said, 'That's all right. If I want a soda, I'll pay for
one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   There also was the night that Tanguay stopped a carful of
friends because an elderly woman on the sidewalk was getting
hassled by some kids, he said. They were on their way back from
``Fiddler on the Roof'' rehearsals two years ago _ Tanguay played
the rabbi's son, a minor part, he said modestly _ when they saw the
woman poking her cane at her antagonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be (upset) if I saw my grandmother getting hassled,''
Tanguay recalled. ``So I said 'Hey, stop the car' and we chased the
kids away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay is the perfect kid, Cotter said. He competed on the high
school's wrestling and golf teams; he's taking three advanced
classes this semester; and he's won the school's Most Spirited
award four years running. He also helped rebuild a local park and
rang a Salvation Army bell at Christmas, and he's held high-ranking
positions in ROTC since the summer after his freshman year. Back
then, Cotter asked him to take on public affairs duties for the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got everybody but Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw to show up,''
Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tanguay said ROTC has given him leadership skills,
taught him how to lead by example, and feel comfortable in a
uniform. And he said he knows it sounds corny, but it has made him
feel part of a team or brotherhood _ one where it's actually cool
to do well in school _ and he hopes he has the same feeling in the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   West Point is better known. Annapolis is right on the Chesapeake
Bay. But Tanguay doesn't want to spend his life preparing for war,
he said, and the Coast Guard has a peacetime mission. After a
summer at the Coast Guard's Academy Introductory Mission program,
which simulates the first few weeks of a typical freshman year,
Tanguay knew he wanted to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't walk away saying it was fun, but I said it was
something I want to be part of,'' he said. ``Honestly, I want to be
a Coast Guard officer. It's not like I just want the free
schooling, and then I'm going to ditch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay hopes one day, one perfect day, to be somewhere in
Hawaii, commanding a Coast Guard cutter making its way to yet
another spectacular rescue, or another day of environmental
clean-up, or just another day of sea and sun.

DECLINE OF EURO BRINGS BARGAINS BUT RAISES CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The pink roses with dashes of peach were
popular on a sunny spring afternoon at the downtown farmers'
market.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone thinking in terms of dollars, what was more
striking was the price for a dozen: 7.2 German marks, or $3.31. Not
long ago, they would have cost almost $5.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh-cut flowers have long been a bargain here, but something
else is at work now as well: The euro, Europe's fledgling single
currency, has plunged 24 percent since its debut on Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was supposed to unify the economies of 11 European
countries and be a symbol of stability to rival the dollar, the yen
and even the British pound. The idea was to be a European champion
just as Airbus aircraft took on Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But so far it has been a boon to the currencies with which it
was supposed to compete. Now Americans brandishing dollars or
Britons spending pounds are finding bargains from Amsterdam to
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in an extraordinary statement for a central banker,
the president of the European Central Bank, who is to the euro what
Alan Greenspan is to the dollar, all but apologized for its
descent, saying it could ``undermine the perception of the euro as
a stable currency.''
</P>
<P>
   He and another top official hinted, for the first time, that the
bank might reverse its policy and try to raise the value of the
euro by going into currency markets and using its reserve of
dollars to buy euros.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the euro, the price of a McDonald's Big Mac costs less
in Germany than in the United States. French wines, Belgian beers
and Italian shoes are all bargains when priced in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Euro bills and coins are not yet in circulation, but local
currencies like the German mark and French franc are locked to the
euro's value and controlled by the European Central Bank, in
Frankfurt. That means that euro weakness matters little for Germans
buying goods with marks or Italians with lire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I don't go on vacation in the United States, it
doesn't bother me.'' said Dagmar Hofmann, a rose cultivator who
brings her flowers into Frankfurt every Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that the euro is suffering a crisis of confidence.
Since its debut as the official monetary measure of Europe, used
mostly by banks, corporations and stock markets, it has fallen from
$1.17 to below $1 last year and to just 89 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decline has mystified analysts, mortified politicians,
alarmed central bankers and reignited suspicions among those who
never liked the idea of giving up their old currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will have to pay dearly for the euro,'' said
Rainer Foerster, a 37-year-old electrician. ``The British haven't
joined yet, and now it turns out that was pretty clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the central bank president, said in his written
statement on Friday, ``The euro's exchange rate has given rise to
questions from European citizens who are concerned about the value
of their currency.'' The implication that the bank might intervene
cheered euro speculators, and the currency's value rose slightly
against the dollar later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro
exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the
shops,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of the bank, Christian Noyer, was blunter,
saying that intervention in the markets was ``a tool in our hand,''
and that ``we may use it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, some Europeans have felt almost cheated.
``There is a general feeling of unfairness,'' the French newspaper
Le Monde said in an editorial. ``Does the United States deserve
such a strong currency? The dollar's superstar status demonstrates
how well Washington is able to steer the international financial
community into overlooking the weaknesses of the American
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe is hardly in an economic crisis. The euro countries are
growing at a rate of about 3.4 percent this year, the fastest clip
in years, and not that bad compared with the 4.5 percent expected
for the United States. While inflation is lower than in the United
States, unemployment is still high at 9.6 percent. Unemployment in
the United States was 3.9 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are volatile exchange rates anything new. But the fallout
from the euro's plunge is getting serious. It has greatly
strengthened the position of opponents in Britain, which will make
it more difficult for Britain to adopt the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response, conservative German politicians demanded
last week that Greece be barred from adopting the euro for several
years. The European Commission recommended last Wednesday that
Greece be allowed to join. But when the euro dropped to a low of
88.9 cents last Thursday, the Bavarian governor, Edmund Stoiber,
blamed the decline in part on the news about Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The economic consequences are beginning as well. With import
prices higher, inflation in the euro zone reached 2.1 percent in
March.
</P>
<P>
   By making European goods cheaper in American dollars, the euro
has fueled a boom in European exports, and that has propelled
German economic growth, which is expected to more than double from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has also created a deep economic wedge between
Britain and the Continent. The pound has risen just as sharply
against the euro as the dollar, with devastating results for
British manufacturers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the strong pound, British products are now expensive
in continental Europe, and Britain is being flooded with low-priced
imports from the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange rate problems were one reason for catastrophic losses
at Rover, the British maker of four-wheel-drive vehicles that
Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. bought and tried to export to Europe
and is desperately trying to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar, the luxury automaker, has absorbed what amounts to a
double-digit price decline in Germany to keep from losing market
share. So some Jaguar models in Germany cost less than in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   British consumers, furious, have started a campaign called
``Rip-Off Britain'' to put pressure on companies that charge more
for products in Britain than on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   But the big debate is about the reasons for the decline, which
has confounded currency strategists and economists.
</P>
<P>
   The most common explanation, is that the American economy's
remarkable boom has been an unprecedented magnet for money.
</P>
<P>
   One common criticism of the euro-zone economies is that they
have not yet deregulated their labor markets and reduced taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to conflicting signals from the European Central
Bank. ``I admit that we have not always been equally successful in
communicating our policy intentions to the public,'' Sirkka
Haemaelaeinen, a member of the bank's executive board, conceded in
a speech last week.
</P>
<P>
   The problems may go deeper. Economists note that the bank has
been following a surprisingly loose monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are interest rates substantially lower in Europe than
in the United States, but the supply of money has also consistently
expanded faster than the central bank's own targets, hurting the
euro's value.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ordinary citizens have remained fairly relaxed. Even
many Germans, who treated the mark with almost religious reverence,
seem patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro's image is pretty bad right now, but I think it has
been bad-mouthed,'' said Severin Fiebon, a 27-year-old bank worker
in Frankfurt. ``The euro is still very young.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Bocke, a retired teacher here, said he has lived through
big swings before. ``The exchange rate between the dollar and mark
has changed so often,'' Bocke said last Thursday. ``It goes up,
then it goes down. I don't really care about it as long as I don't
travel to America.''

DEHAVEN FINISHES FIRST ON AN OLYMPIC TRIALS SURVIVAL COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ In the brutal heat and humidity, legs cramped and
blisters bled through shoes and some of the runners left the finish
line on stretchers instead of on their feet. Rod DeHaven reached
the tape first Sunday after 26.2 miles at an Olympic trials that
became more about survival than speed. It also left American
marathoning at a state of utter depletion.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven's winning time was 2 hours 15 minutes 30 seconds,
respectable for a day in which the temperature on a hilly course
hit 77 degrees by mid-morning with 57 percent humidity. But because
he did not achieve the Olympic ``A'' qualifying standard of 2:14,
DeHaven will be the lone American representative in the men's
marathon at the Summer Games for the first time since 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Clark will also be the lone American in the women's
marathon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in
September. In the past, when stringent time requirements were not
imposed, the United States sent three male and female marathoners
to the Games. But the situation has grown dire as the rest of the
world has gotten faster and international Olympic officials have
begun to restrict the number of athletes competing in the
ever-growing Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race left even the winner curiously downcast, and left
track and field officials to contemplate significant changes in the
way the Olympic marathon trials are conducted, as well as the way
American marathoners are trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win is pretty significant,'' said DeHaven, who is a
33-year-old computer programmer from Madison, Wis., and who earned
$75,000 for his victory. ``But being the only one going doesn't
leave me with the best taste in my mouth. Maybe this is the low
point for marathoning in the country. Maybe we can go up from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh was awarded the 2000 trials in the spring of 1998
when it was the only city to offer to pay air fare, per diem and
prize money to the elite marathoners. Organizers could not have
known that the weather would be this awful. To prevent a recurrence
of unexpected heat, slow times and minimal representation in the
Olympics, officials and runners have suggested putting future
marathon trials on cooler, flatter courses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, officials said, ways must be found to make American
runners faster. The methods may include programs that identify
potential marathoners at an early age, group training camps and
financial support in the years between the end of college and the
late 20s, an age when many distance careers begin to blossom. Such
an assistance effort would cost $1 million a year, said Craig
Masback, the chief executive of USA Track and Field, the sport's
national governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been able to raise that money,'' Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   But, everyone agrees, something has to change if the Americans
are to regain their international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say we will never again have an Olympic
trials that will be this hot or this slow,'' said Danny Grimes,
chairman of USA Track and Field's long distance-running committee.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven's winning time was the slowest at the American Olympic
trials since 1972. Peter De La Cerda, who had been the pacemaker
the past two years at the Pittsburgh Marathon, took the lead
between Miles 12 and 13 and held it until the patient DeHaven took
the lead after 22.5 miles. On a slight downhill, DeHaven ran Mile
24 in 4:56 and put the race out of touch. De La Cerda finished
second in 2:16:18. Mark Coogan, a 1996 Olympian, took third in
2:17:04.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I had a grand plan, but it was totally a race
of attrition,'' DeHaven said.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine of the 99 starters ran under 2:20. Another 21 runners
dropped out during the race. David Morris, the American
record-holder in 2:09:36, began suffering from abdominal cramps at
Mile 2 and briefly stopped in the 15th mile. He finished 38th in
2:29:36. Morris said he had become anxious over the 2:14 Olympic
standard and uncertainty about whether Khalid Khannouchi, the
Moroccan-born world-record holder who got his American citizenship
last Wednesday, would compete. He did not because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep at all this week,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven, who was able to train more efficiently after reducing
his work in the computer business to part-time, said the heat and
humidity were not as bad as he had expected. The conditions were
worse at the 1999 world championships, held last August in Seville,
Spain, where DeHaven was the top American finisher in 24th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple areas, the cigarette smoke was so thick I could
hardly breathe,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DERBY WINNER FUELS GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ For the $4 million he spent to buy Fusaichi
Pegasus as a yearling, Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo is reaping racing's
richest rewards. His horse has won five straight races in four
months and he won the Kentucky Derby with an awesome display of
speed and power on Saturday while conquering one of the strongest
fields in Derby history. He also broke the ``jinx'' that for 20
years has kept the favorite from reaching the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Fusaichi Pegasus has endowed the sport of
thoroughbred racing with the thing it needs most: great
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The last three colts to win the Derby _ Silver Charm, Real Quiet
and Charismatic _ went on to win the Preakness. But, on the edge of
sweeping the Triple Crown, they lost the Belmont Stakes. Still,
they brought huge crowds to Churchill Downs, Pimlico and Belmont
Park to see if racing would unveil its 12th Triple Crown winner,
and the first since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep all three classics.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is a third of the way there, and rarely has a
Derby winner looked so imposing. Perhaps not since Secretariat in
1973 has any horse so captured the public's fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very talented horse,'' said his English trainer,
Neil Drysdale, still speaking conservatively from his pulpit
outside Barn 41 at Churchill Downs on the morning after the Derby.
``And he looks like he's got a very bright future in front of him.
So, it was very rewarding to watch the talent come through, and for
him to show that talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The jockeys and trainers who tried to outrun Drysdale's star
were less restrained. They sounded as though they had lost to sheer
brilliance on the race track, to an animal who lived up to his
name, Pegasus, the flying horse of mythology.
</P>
<P>
   With a quarter of a mile to go, Richard Migliore thought he was
riding a winner with Wheelaway, who had been first in the Tampa Bay
Derby but on Saturday finished fifth. ``The winner,'' Migliore
testified, ``might be a great horse.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eighth of a mile to go, John Velazquez thought he had
beaten the favorite with his mount, More Than Ready. But he
finished fourth, and Velazquez put it succinctly: ``The winner went
by me, and I knew I couldn't catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, who trained the Derby winner three times in the
last five years, tried to outrun Fusaichi Pegasus with three
horses, but they finished up the track: Exchange Rate (12th), High
Yield (15th), Commendable (17th). Lukas, the only trainer with
purse winnings of $200 million, got nothing for his labors in his
20th straight Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with Fusaichi Pegasus,'' he said. ``All the
fears about him were put to rest when he went over there, and he
did what he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fusaichi Pegasus had to do was win with command, something
that racing likes to remember in great horses and longs to see
again. He has regal breeding (son of Prospector, grandson of
Danzig), he has high spirits that were kept under control in the
Derby, he has horse sense _ he switches inside or outside, he flows
with the traffic, he closes with breathtaking drama.
</P>
<P>
   So, for his investment of $4 million, Sekiguchi has bought
himself a bundle of success, a mighty horse who is delivering the
kind of theater that racing has been searching for. And his
investment certainly looks more promising than the $60 million
spent so far by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association on its
cosmetic changes, its ``commissioner'' and his six vice presidents,
the television time they buy to increase public awareness of racing
and the cable television station they have established to send the
message.
</P>
<P>
   But they are sending a narrow message. They are serving the
hard-core bettors and handicappers who gamble on the product but
don't necessarily define it in terms of remarkable animals bred and
trained to race. The racing association is charged with
``marketing'' the business of racing. But it is traveling the low
road, trying to drum up people's interest in commercial solutions
like simulcasting and home betting.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry can't pay the bills, that's true. But when you have a
``product'' as classic as Fusaichi Pegasus, with a compelling story
line and rivals like 88-year-old Harold Rose and Jenine Sahadi and
the young Todd Pletcher with his four horses and Lukas with his
three and Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum with his pair _ why
try to manufacture drama when it's already there?
</P>
<P>
   How can you beat the flying horse winning the Kentucky Derby and
reviving the great expectations of a sport that desperately needs
them?

grams, or 3 pounds 4 ounces. Thousands of these children are now
well into their school years. The conventional medical wisdom had
been that those who were not seriously disabled physically would
catch up to other youngsters by age 5. Many do. But as the first
large group of tiny babies grows up, new research is showing that
academic and behavioral problems often surface in the school years.

SPORTS COLUMN: FUSAICHI PEGASUS TAKING ONE STEP AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ There was good reason to predict a Triple
Crown sweep for Fusaichi Pegasus after his seemingly effortless
performance in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday. But his trainer,
Neil Drysdale, will wait to see whether there may be a better
reason for not running him at all in the second leg of racing's
most coveted and grueling series.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the cautious and conservative horseman, Drysdale offered
only that his $4 million superstar is a possible entry in the
Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown, on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   After moving seven horses wide under the jockey Kent Desormeaux
and rocketing down the stretch to finish with the seventh-fastest
time in the 126-year history of the Derby, the strapping colt took
only a short walk Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fine this morning,'' said Drysdale, who capped a week
that included his induction into the Hall of Fame by winning the
Derby on his first try. ``Somebody dropped something and he
bounced. So he was nice and bright this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see how he comes out of this race first before we
go on to the next. As you well know, they're fragile animals and
sometimes things look easy and sometimes something shows up in the
wash, whatever it might be. So, literally, we'll just go one step
at a time. We've got to just see how he is the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearby barns along Churchill Downs' backside, Fusaichi
Pegasus' contemporaries _ most of them tired, a few bandaged _ were
being prepared to leave. They had come here considered one of the
deepest crop of 3-year-olds in years and carried the Triple Crown
aspirations of their trainers and owners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those have been run over by the $4 million colt with the
obstinate and rambunctious personality, leaving many of them unsure
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up, Aptitude, will bypass Baltimore and Pimlico Race
Course to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 10 in New York.
Aptitude's trainer, Bobby Frankel, certainly did not sound
overwhelmed by the winner's performance and said it might have made
a difference if his jockey, Alex Solis, had kept Aptitude on the
rail instead of taking the colt wide at the half-mile point. While
Solis and Aptitude swung four wide around the final turn,
Desormeaux crept up the inside and saved ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, Alex rode a good race,'' Frankel said.
``But Desormeaux took the gamble, and that was the difference of
maybe winning or losing. I'm not saying I would have beaten him,
but maybe that was the difference. I take my hat off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The third- and fourth-place finishers, Impeachment and More Than
Ready, are doubtful for the Preakness, though the trainer Todd
Pletcher will wait until the Tuesday before the race to make his
decision. The brawny, late-running Impeachment has a better shot at
winning the one-and-a-half-mile Belmont, said Pletcher, than
excelling over the shorter course in Baltimore that favors
speedsters with its tight turns.
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready may fit that profile, but the small, hard-trying
colt, who had the lead briefly in the stretch in the Derby, is
coming off two taxing efforts. He finished second by a head three
weeks ago in the Blue Grass; Sunday his legs were wrapped with
bandages to soothe a handful of minor cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries too hard and probably needs the rest,'' Pletcher said
of More Than Ready. ``I'm inclined to wait for the summer for him.
He has nothing left to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher saddled four horses in his Derby debut, and the other
two _ Trippi (11th) and Graeme Hall (19th and last) _ are off the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Only D. Wayne Lukas with High Yield and Bob Baffert with Captain
Steve seemed intent on trying Fusaichi Pegasus again in the
Preakness. High Yield finished a disappointing 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an explanation,'' Lukas, a four-time Derby
winner, said about High Yield. ``I wish I did, and I am seldom at a
loss for words. I never felt better about a horse three weeks prior
to the Derby since Winning Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas also finished 12th with Exchange Rate and 17th with
Commendable.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve's owner, Mike Pegram, said his colt would make the
trip to the Preakness after being bumped in the stretch by
Wheelaway and finishing eighth. The fifth-place finisher,
Wheelaway, lugged into Captain Steve in the stretch, but by then
both horses were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he stubs his toe,'' Pegram said of Fusaichi Pegasus.
``Maybe somebody will impede him before he takes off. He was real
impressive. But the thing about this business is that you can't be
afraid to get beat. If you're not willing to reload and fire again,
then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two new, speedy challengers will take a shot Fusaichi
Pegasus if he heads to Baltimore: Red Bullet and Snuck In.
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Orseno-trained Red Bullet finished second to Fusaichi
Pegasus in the Wood Memorial. Snuck In was the runner-up in the
Arkansas Derby and withdrew from the Derby late in the week after
the trainer Steve Asmussen decided the horse was too fractious to
relax in a big field. ``That Pegasus is a freak,'' said Scott
Blasi, Asmussen's assistant. ``He's just super, but our horse is
pretty fast, too.''
</P>
<P>
   New challengers or not, new surface or not, Drysdale says he
will wait to see if his colt's health coincides with his owner's
plan. Fusao Sekiguchi, a Japanese venture capitalist, says he wants
to pursue the Triple Crown but will leave it up to his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very talented horse and he looks like he's got a
very bright future in front of him,'' Drysdale said of a colt who
has won 5 of 6 races. ``So we'll keep our fingers crossed and go
from there.''

<P>
   It has been 11 years since Alex Martin was born, a 1-pound
2-ounce bundle of miniature bones and bright red skin, with fingers
no bigger than matchsticks and legs so thin they might have fit
inside his father's wedding band. His parents, Rick and Allison
Martin, waited four months to send birth announcements. ``The
doctors kept telling us we had to plan for his funeral,'' Allison
Martin explained.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alex is a blond-haired, fair-skinned fifth-grader with
clear brown eyes, gold-rimmed glasses and a collection of what his
mother calls labels: mild cerebral palsy, asthma, hyperactivity and
Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. At an age when most children
have conquered fractions, Alex wrestles with addition. He learned
to read about a year ago and is racing happily through the Hardy
Boys series. But speaking is a challenge; the words roll around
like marbles in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Alex cannot ride a bike. He still wears sneakers that fasten
with Velcro, because his fingers cannot master the intricacies of
laces. Often, he retreats into a private fantasy world. A recent
weekday afternoon found Alex sitting cross-legged in the backyard
of his family's home in Raleigh, N.C., spinning stories to an
audience of no one as he smashed rocks against the dirt. ``Life,''
his mother says, ``is overwhelming for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also overwhelming, at times, for his parents, who are
discovering firsthand what scientists are beginning to document
about babies born as tiny as Alex: Their lives often grow more
complicated over time. Long after their worries about simply
keeping Alex alive have faded, the Martins are faced with new and
no less daunting concerns: whether their son will ever be able to
make change at the grocery store, drive a car or maintain a job.
And who will care for him after they die?
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than 20 years since doctors began saving
extremely premature infants, and about a decade since advances in
neonatology vastly improved the survival of babies of very low
birth weight _ those weighing less than 1,500 grams, or 3 pounds 4
ounces. The tiniest of these babies _ micropreemies, they are
called _ are born as much as 14 weeks early and weigh less than 750
grams, or 1 pound 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of these children are now well into their school
years. The conventional medical wisdom had been that those like
Alex, who are not seriously physically disabled, would catch up to
other youngsters by age 5. And many do just fine. But as the first
large group of tiny babies grows up, new research is showing that
academic and behavioral problems often surface in the school years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to say if they got to 2 or 3 and they were doing fine,
they'd be OK,'' said Dr. Deborah E. Campbell, director of the
division of neonatology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
``Now we know that is not necessarily true.''
</P>
<P>
   In one recent study of 150 teen-agers who weighed 2 pounds or
less at birth, nearly one-third had significant physical disorders,
including cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Nearly half were
receiving special education assistance, compared with 10 percent in
a control group. But the study, which appeared in February in the
journal Pediatrics, also found that even those children with minor
physical problems scored significantly lower on achievement tests
than those in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can save tiny babies now, which we weren't able to save
before, but with the technology there is a price,'' said the
study's author, Dr. Saroj Saigal, a neonatologist at McMaster
University in Hamilton, Ontario. Saigal said she had been flooded
with letters, many with the same message: ``Behind the success, as
this child is called by the medical profession, there are lots of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast leaps in survival of extremely premature infants came
with the widespread use of a synthetic form of surfactant, a
chemical that helps babies' lungs absorb oxygen. Before surfactant,
about one-quarter of the smallest babies survived; today, about
one-half will live.
</P>
<P>
   Babies of very low birth weight make up only a tiny fraction of
all newborns. According to the National Center for Health
Statistics, of the 3.9 million infants born in the United States in
1998, 1.4 percent, or about 56,000, were considered in this
category. Of these, 16,647 were micropreemies.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for doctors to know if low-birth-weight babies
born today will fare any better than those born a decade ago. But
Dr. Maureen Hack, a neonatologist at Rainbow Babies and Childrens
Hospital in Cleveland, who has followed premature infants as they
grow, says she suspects the outcomes will be much the same.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hack said a recent study of infants born weighing less than
1,000 grams found slightly higher rates of cerebral palsy and
slightly lower IQs than in those of the same weight born in earlier
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though survival has improved, how the children are doing
later has at best stayed the same,'' she said. ``You are replacing
death with impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no thornier decision in medicine than the decision to
rescue a tiny baby. It is expensive, costing as much as $2,000 a
day, and wrenching for doctors and parents. Studies like Hack's and
Saigal's are intensifying the debate about the ethics of using
sophisticated technology to save children with uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the questions are hardly academic. They feel lucky
that their children are alive, although in quiet moments some will
confess that they wonder if they made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I count my blessings,'' said Raquel Bolden of
Cleveland, whose 8-year-old daughter, Mischa, was one of Hack's
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Mischa, who weighed a little more than 2 pounds at birth, has
mild cerebral palsy and severe hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Like most hospitals with neonatal intensive care units, Rainbow
Babies and Childrens has a follow-up clinic for premature babies,
and Mischa was seen there. But as is typical, the tracking at
Rainbow stops at age 3. After that, medical and educational
professionals lump disabled premature children with the estimated 6
million disabled youngsters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When Mischa was younger, Bolden said, she worried about her
daughter's physical condition. Hoping to improve Mischa's strength,
she signed her up for gymnastics and ice skating. ``Now,'' she
said, ``I'm more worried mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first grade, Mischa is having trouble with math. Bolden,
who until recently was a single mother, working and going to school
full time, is considering a tutor, though she is not certain how to
pay for one. Mischa has trouble filtering out background noise, and
Bolden said that she had been fighting with school officials to pay
for hearing-aid amplifiers. ``I read a few preemie books when she
was little,'' Bolden said, ``but there is no manual when they get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about rescuing children at birth play out every day in
neonatal intensive care units. The one at Montefiore Medical
Center, like all such wards, is a place of dreams and heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is in miniature. Tiny creatures, their eyes protected
by dark patches, their fragile bodies connected to a maze of
plastic tubes, sleep in plastic cases, many under the glow of
violet lights to cure jaundice. Diapers and pacifiers look as
though they were made for dolls. Feedings are measured in
half-teaspoons.
</P>
<P>
   As director of this unit, Campbell faces the delicate task of
answering the questions of new parents who inevitably want to know
what the future will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give hope, you want to encourage them,'' Campbell
said, ``but you've got to keep everybody reasoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for parents of premature children say that if
doctors were more forthright, parents might make different choices
about whether to rescue their babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are very rarely told about the long-term, so-called
minor disabilities,'' said Helen Harrison, author of ``The
Premature Baby Book'' (St. Martin's Press, 1983), a guidebook for
parents. ``These minor disabilities, of course, can keep children
from living independently, or ever having a social life or being
able to function in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they do routinely hold discussions with parents on
whether to withhold care. But they also say that making predictions
is difficult. How well premature infants fare depends on their
birth weight _ every extra ounce improves their chances _ and on
whether they suffer serious complications, like bleeding in the
brain. It also depends on socioeconomics.

<P>
   The Reyes family is a case in point. Jacqueline Reyes is a
single mother of two boys who lives in the Soundview section of the
Bronx. Her 8-year-old son, Duron, is healthy. But her 5-year-old,
Dominic, born weighing a little more than a pound, has severe
cerebral palsy. He still wears diapers and cannot sit by himself.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Reyes took Dominic to the Children's
Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center at the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in the Bronx, where doctors are evaluating the boy to
get him into kindergarten. As a child with disabilities, Dominic
was entitled by federal law to attend preschool at taxpayer
expense. But his mother was unaware of the law, and so he never
went.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic is also entitled to occupational and physical therapy,
and Reyes said therapists did visit him at home for a time, but
stopped coming a couple of years ago. Now the doctors at Einstein
are considering referring Dominic for surgery to correct a hip
problem that the center's director, Dr. Herbert J. Cohen, said
might not have developed had the boy's therapy continued.
</P>
<P>
   For Reyes, however, therapy and school are pushed to the back
burner by the tasks of daily living like grocery shopping and doing
the laundry. Until December, when she showed up at the Einstein
center, she did not have a wheelchair for Dominic and simply
carried him wherever she went. She lives on the second floor of an
apartment building with no elevator and no ramp. When she goes out,
she said, she takes her children to the bottom of the stairwell and
sits Dominic in his older brother's lap while she runs back up for
the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says the Reyes family is not unusual. Parents of disabled
children, particularly the poor, often miss out on services for
their children. Once, he said, his center had a program for
following infants at high risk of disabilities. But it was
disbanded two years ago after cuts in federal and state
reimbursements. For children like Dominic, Cohen said, the future
often depends ``on how good an advocate the parent is.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   And even knowledgeable advocates face challenges, as the Martins
can attest. Rick Martin runs the National Computer Center for the
federal Environmental Protection Agency and his wife is a former
EPA biologist. They have begun an Internet site,
www.comeunity.com/premature, to provide support for families like
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   When the Martins moved to North Carolina from the Washington
area nearly two years ago, Alex scored below normal on an IQ test.
Convinced the low score was the result of overmedication for his
hyperactivity, the Martins hired a psychologist to repeat the exam;
this time, the test scores were normal. Alex's special education
teacher, Jan Valletta, said that without the Martins' backing, Alex
would have been labeled mentally retarded.

</P>
<P>
   ``People misjudge Alex,'' Valletta said. ``They think from
seeing him in the hall that he's retarded, or there's not much
there. But Alex is really very intelligent; what makes him
different is that he is intelligent, but he cannot communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time that she has been teaching Alex, Valletta says, she
has seen vast improvement. She is trying to draw him out of his
fantasy world and kindle his interest in science instead. Alex
likes to write, but holding a pen is difficult, so he is getting
instruction in typing on the computer. Learning to read has given
him confidence, and his social skills are improving.
</P>
<P>
   In the school gym one recent morning, two girls from the regular
fifth-grade class took pains to pick Alex when the physical
education teacher told them to split up into teams. ``The girls,''
Valletta says, ``are crazy about Alex.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   To the Martins, there are encouraging signs. But if the past is
any predictor of the future, they know there is uncertainty ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What prematurity is about,'' Martin said, ``is risk. And that
risk never goes away.''

WHEN FISH PRICES SINK THE BUDGET, LEAN BEEF MAKES THE CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to read the recipe on the card because of the
splotches and food stains. You can barely make out my wife's
evaluation of the dish. Upon close scrutiny it reads,
``Marvelous!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not positive all of our guests agreed. It's also true that
``marvelous'' in those days meant a dish we could afford that was
also edible.
</P>
<P>
   Every young reporter on the staff of the Bismarck Tribune had
his or her ``marvelous'' recipe. More often than not it was a
hamburger-noodle casserole. A few sliced green olives in the
casserole raised it in rank to ``superb.''
</P>
<P>
   We weren't paid a lot, but employees of that small, North Dakota
daily were distinguished by history. One Bismarck Tribune reporter
accompanied Gen. Custer on an expense-paid cruise to the Little Big
Horn. Needless to say, the scribe was not killed by a casserole.
</P>
<P>
   But we thought ours was ``marvelous.'' It contained potatoes, a
package of frozen Brussels sprouts and a can of corned beef.
Sprouts are good for you, which is one reason most young Americans
today would rather eat rattlesnake eggs. But in our house, in that
day, you shut up and ate your Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   We had better corned beef than you are liable to find in cans
today. You could actually slice the meat. Open a can of corned beef
today and it collapses into a sodden pile of cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   So we made a quick adjustment when we recently pulled out the
recipe for old time's sake.
</P>
<P>
   A Marvelous Casserole
</P>
<P>
   slab of lean, deli corned beef
</P>
<P>
   4 medium potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 package frozen Brussels sprouts
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of marjoram
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beef bouillon
</P>
<P>
   Thaw the sprouts. Peel and quarter the potatoes then boil in
salted water until you can stick a fork in without the spud
hollering, ``Ouch!'' Cut the meat into bite-size hunks.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the meat, spuds and sprouts into a casserole. Sprinkle with
the salt, pepper and herbs. Pour bouillon over all. Cover the
casserole and shove into a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes. This
serves two to three but is easily doubled in case Bill Gates and
Paul Allen are coming for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we can afford a slightly better company meal today.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, one of the quickest and cheapest meals you
can serve today is a steak dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In the rookie-reporter days, beef steak was an unattainable
delicacy. Fish was cheap, but nobody bought it or served it unless
it came out of a tuna can. Recently I bought a nice top sirloin for
two and it cost me $2.29. The same day halibut was going for eight
bucks a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The trick in serving steak is to avoid the expensive cuts that
are marbled with fat. Choose a lean slab of meat and marinate it
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Marinade for Steaks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon marjoram
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 splats of Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   You can use anything from a round bone chuck roast to thick-cut
top sirloin. Lift the meat from the marinade, drain, then broil or
barbecue. When done, top with:
</P>
<P>
   Beefsteak Mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   8 large mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fennel seed
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Mash together in a mortar the garlic, fennel, oregano and salt.
Stir in the olive oil and let this potent puddle sit for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe but do not wash the mushrooms. Cut them in half and lay out
flat-side down in an oven pan or dish. Spoon the olive oil mixture
over the top and bake for 20 minutes in a 400-degree oven. This is
enough for two servings.
</P>
<P>
   After a splurge like that, you'll be back to the tuna casserole
by Friday. If you add a few sliced almonds, it'll be marvelous.

PUTIN INAUGURATED IN RUSSIA'S FIRST DEMOCRATIC TRANSFER OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Beneath a gilded sunburst in a gilded palace, his hand
on a red leather-bound copy of the constitution, Vladimir Putin
swore an oath Sunday to ``respect and guard the human and civil
rights'' of Russia and became, officially at last, its second
president.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Russia _ and the world _ now waits to see what he will
do with the title. Many expect a quick push to overhaul Russia's
inscrutable tax code and economy and to reassert Kremlin rule over
its 89 provinces _ goals supposedly too risky to chase when he was
but an acting leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, who has dropped only the broadest hints of an agenda
since he abruptly succeeded President Boris Yeltsin last New Year's
Eve, revealed nothing more Sunday. Predictably, he reappointed as
acting prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, a financial expert
known to the West for his dealings on rescheduling Russia's foreign
debt who is widely expected to be Putin's nominee to head the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech after his swearing-in, Putin said he would
perform his duties openly, ``guided only by the interests of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it my sacred duty to unite the people of Russia, to
gather citizens around clearly defined tasks and aims and to
remember, every minute of every day, that we are one nation and one
people,'' he said. ``We have one common future.''
</P>
<P>
   Although known as prosecutor of a war in Chechnya that has
brought fresh accusations of Russian trampling on human rights,
Putin on Sunday made much, oratorically and symbolically, of the
step toward democracy that his inauguration represented. The
ceremony, he noted, completed the first legal and democratic
transfer of executive power in Russia's 1,100-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that, Yeltsin stood beside him, on a
flower-bedecked podium in the Kremlin Grand Palace, throughout the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be proud that this is being done peacefully, without
revolutions and putsches, in a respectful and free way,'' Yeltsin
said in remarks to the crowd. ``This is possible only in a new
Russia, one in which people have learned to live and think
freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after his stunning early resignation, Yeltsin
appeared healthy but spoke slowly and with one pause so long that a
handful in the audience applauded, thinking his speech was over.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly scripted ceremony called for Yeltsin to hand over to
Putin the symbol of Russian leadership, a gold medal and chain
called the Order of Service to the Fatherland, First Degree. Either
by deliberate omission or forgetfulness, the transfer did not take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from a VIP seat was the former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, a bitter Yeltsin enemy who was barred from the 1996
inauguration. He was invited this time, officials said, as a
gesture to his role in creating a democratic Russia and to stress
the continuity of Russian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Also present was Vladimir Kryuchkov, Gorbachev's KGB chief and
one of the leading conspirators in a 1991 coup against Gorbachev
that sought to return the Soviet Union to hard-line Communist rule.
That coup helped to speed the break-up of the Soviet empire by the
end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only audience of legislators, jurists and
diplomats _ heads of state were not invited _ also included Putin's
favorite schoolteacher and his judo instructor.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bittersweet and, for Putin and many in the audience of
1,500 people, a largely unexpected moment. When Yeltsin began his
second term in office four years ago, most people would have
considered it unthinkable that any head of Russia's long-feared
espionage apparatus would be freely elected president in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin plucked Putin from the relative anonymity of a
senior Kremlin post last August and named him prime minister and
preferred successor, still others snickered. Putin had no political
experience. Worse still, he was so bland in appearance and demeanor
that at many gatherings he seemed almost to fade into the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, 47, a former KGB agent who rose to head its domestic
successor, the Federal Security Service, surprised almost everyone.
His war against secessionist rebels in Chechnya _ and his
well-advertised fondness for judo, jet fighter rides and submarine
trips _ made him a symbol of Russian patriotism and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Russians have soured slightly on the war in
Chechnya as the fighting against rebels there drags on, Putin's
victory in the presidential election in March proved a foregone
conclusion. And in polls last week, 60 percent of respondents said
they viewed him positively.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials had said they wanted an inauguration that
would be muted in character and that would emphasize the continuity
of government. They succeeded in stressing continuity.
</P>
<P>
   But the proceedings Sunday may even have exceeded in splashiness
Yeltsin's own 1996 inauguration, where the crowd was twice as
large.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably impossible to stage anything muted in the Grand
Palace, a massive, 162-year-old edifice whose halls were restored
and thoroughly gilded at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars
during Yeltsin's tenure. Nor was it clear that anyone tried.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Yeltsin, Putin did not bring the patriarch of the Russian
Orthodox Church onstage to certify his installation, a tradition
that reminded many of the crowning of a new czar. On the other
hand, Yeltsin's inauguration lasted only 15 minutes, and he was too
stricken by heart trouble even to make a speech.

MMM-BOP: HANSON BROTHERS ACTION-FIGURE VICTORY TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd McFarlane, the creator of that creepy
``Spawn'' comic book series, showed he wasn't a complete dweeb when
he outbid everyone for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball from the
1998 season for a cool $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   As if that's really a normal thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   At least, he has a love for sport. And one of the latest things
he's spawned shows his appreciation for cult sport goes even
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   McFarlane Toys has created a unique tribute to the movie ``Slap
Shot'' with action-figure replicas of the three Hanson brothers -
Jack, Steve and Jeff - in such haunting detail that you almost
expect them to come alive and start gooning your GI Joe collection
when you're not looking.
</P>
<P>
   The three figures (sold separately) are made to be displayed
together in an hilarious diorama. Each comes with a section of ice
as a base to stand on, and the sections clip together along with
boards and glass to form the corner of a hockey rink.
</P>
<P>
   From the dull expressions on their face - complete with cracked
black-rimmed glasses and long flowing hair - to the hockey stick
they hold, these are must-haves for anyone with an appreciation of
the classic movie that came out some 20 years ago. If only it came
with a Coke machine for the guys to beat up on.
</P>
<P>
   While McFarlane has been putting out dolls celebrating ``Austin
Powers'' and the Beatles' ``Yellow Submarine,'' he has plans for
more sports-related action figures - including all 12
major-leaguers (like McGwire and Shawn Green) who participated in
the recent Big League Challenge home-run hitting contest. Those are
scheduled to come out in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanson figures can be purchased at most major toy and hobby
stores (suggested price: $12.99 apiece) and can be viewed on
McFarlane's Web sites at www.mcfarlane.com or www.spawn.com.

MOSCOW: a speech.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putin's ceremony, broadcast on all major television networks,
was run with military precision and Hollywood style, down to the
aerial camera that tracked his entourage down a deserted riverside
highway and through the Kremlin gates.
</P>
<P>
   A covey of cameras watched as Putin's midnight-blue Mercedes
limousine pulled up at the palace and he emerged, alone. And,
through two or three long minutes, still more cameras followed
Putin through the palace, striding alone down an endless red
carpet, up the 57 steps of the famous Red Staircase and through two
palace rooms packed with applauding guests.
</P>
<P>
   He entered St. Andrew's Hall, where the installation took place,
precisely as the Kremlin clock struck noon. As the ceremony ended,
a choir sang the ``Glory'' aria from an 1836 opera by Mikhail
Glinka, ``Life of the Czar,'' about a peasant who dies to save the
czar from Polish invaders. Outside the Kremlin walls, 30 artillery
pieces fired a booming 30-shot salute.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kremlin ceremony and a blessing from the patriarch,
Aleksei II, Putin reviewed a parade by a regiment of Kremlin guards
and paid tribute to Russia's military by laying a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier just outside the Kremlin walls. He then
spoke at a Kremlin ceremony commemorating the anniversary Tuesday
of the Allies' triumph over Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Putin started work, holding a cabinet meeting and
reappointing Kasyanov.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov, like all senior officials in Putin's government,
submitted his resignation after the inauguration as required by
law. Putin said later that he expects to reappoint most of them to
permanent positions.
</P>
<P>
   Although his appointments may offer clues, there is real
uncertainty as to where Putin intends to take Russia next.
</P>
<P>
   He has proclaimed himself a democrat and a capitalist, and some
of his top advisers reflect those views. The head of his strategy
center, German Gref, strongly advocates pro-market reforms. His new
economic adviser, Andrei Illarionov, is viewed by some as a radical
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, an expert on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, said he believes a ``radical
liberalization'' of the Putin program is occurring. Its first
fruits, he said, may be a plan to replace Russia's graduated income
tax with a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether it will amount to 12 percent or 20
percent,'' he said in an interview. ``Even the Communists are all
in favor of a cap on taxes now. It's an amazing change that has
come about.'' Still, he said, ``there's a substantial worry that he
won't do very much'' beyond tax reform, despite an economic
situation that _ thanks in part to high prices for Russia's oil
exports _ is stronger than many experts might have predicted a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``His situation is good. The economy and political support are
good,'' Aslund said. ``The need for action doesn't seem to be
apparent, and he will have to consolidate his power. And that takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Aslund's counterpart at Carnegie's Moscow offices, Lilia
Shevtsova, agreed. Putin, she said, is at his core a bureaucrat who
wants to make the system work and not to revolutionize it. Nor does
he have the political clout to carry off a revolution, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get all the Chicago boys in the world as his
advisers,'' she said, referring to the so-called Chicago school of
free-market economic theory. ``But it means nothing when it comes
to implementing his decisions. Then he has to deal with the
regional governors, these conservative guys who don't want to move,
who will fight him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the considerable powers that the governors have
developed in their own regions as central authority withered in
Yeltsin's last years, she added: ``If he proceeds with a radical
agenda on the economy, then he's going to put the stick into a
very, very unpleasant ants' nest.''

HENDERSON SAYS BEWILDERED METS ARE USING A HEADS-OR-TAILS
STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Mets are so uncertain how to deal with their present
slump, left-fielder Rickey Henderson said Sunday in the glare of
the team's ninth loss in 12 games, that ``they're flipping a coin
and hoping to find an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, replaced in Sunday's lineup by Jon Nunnally, talked
like a man who had just lost the coin flip as he sat steaming in
the locker-room after the Mets were held to one hit in a 3-0 loss
to the Florida Marlins at Pro Player Stadium. The Mets' record has
slipped to 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe in your players,'' Henderson said. ``Once
you don't believe in them, it's tough for us to go out there and
play to win. We're trying to do so many things. How about getting
back to the basics? How about pulling for one another to start?''
</P>
<P>
   Is he saying the Mets have some conflict in their clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on a lot of clubs, and I've been on clubs that
win,'' he said. ``If it ain't a family, it's tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the 41-year-old intimated, the Mets' brain trust does
not appear to know what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of I-don't-knows, a lot of switching, a lot of
everything,'' Henderson said. ``When you're doing all that, it's
tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who is hitting .205 while having played in 26 of the
Mets' 33 games, said he needed to play more regularly to develop a
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to play every day, but spot-playing is tough for
anybody, not just Rickey,'' he said. ``I thought I was getting
close to developing a rhythm _but whoever gets out there, let
somebody get in a rhythm. You need a day off, you ask for it. But
the way I see it, if I played two days and needed a rest, I'd hang
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who had the Mets' only hit _ a two-out,
sixth-inning double _ said the team's problems were nothing that
could not be fixed, as the Mets did after a similar slump last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't detect any sign of finger-pointing,'' Piazza said.
``Most of the guys here have been through this before. It's a
matter of riding the storm out and everybody staying focused to
hustle as hard as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said his team looked tired Sunday after
playing 20 games in the past 20 days. The Mets have a day off
Monday before going to Pittsburgh for a three-game series to
complete a 13-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Mets made Friday's one-run performance look like an
explosion. The Marlins' Ryan Dempster, a 23-year-old right-hander,
walked four in addition to allowing Piazza's hit in a masterly
eight-strikeout complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza broke up the no-hit bid by hitting the first pitch to him
in the sixth, a slider, off the left-field wall. Cliff Floyd jumped
for the line drive, but missed it by several inches.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Mets came to another hit was Derek Bell's liner
to left in the eighth that Floyd caught with a timely lunge.
Center-fielder Preston Wilson saved Edgardo Alfonzo's try for a hit
in the ninth with a diving catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mixed a slider and changeup with his fastball and he had
real good location,'' Alfonzo said. ``He deserved to win this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch, under normal
conditions. The Marlins touched him for a run in the first inning
on three straight hits, but he worked out of trouble by getting
Wilson to hit into a double play and prompting Mike Lowell to fly
out. Rusch also allowed two hits in the second with one out, but
retired the next two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Rusch (1-3) allowed only two base runners before he
departed following the seventh inning. He retired the last seven
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't let what's happening around him bother him at
all,'' Valentine said. ``He makes good pitch after good pitch. He
looks like a guy who can help us win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such a well-pitched game, Rusch, who lowered his earned
run average to 3.28, found himself deferring to Dempster's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tip your hat to him,'' he said. ``We've got a
great-hitting team and he constantly stayed ahead in the count to
them and made some great pitches. This was one of those days where
he pretty much controlled the game by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets were held to one hit came in 1994 by Andy
Benes, then of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll swing the bats better,'' Valentine said. ``And we'll
pitch as well as we did today. That'll be the sign of a good
team.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Elian drama moves to Atlanta court this week
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Five simple words will transform a quiet, staid
courthouse in downtown Atlanta on Thursday: Elian Gonzalez v. Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly charged atmosphere with worldwide media attention,
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear argument on to
whether the 6-year-old Cuban boy should be able to apply for
political asylum against the wishes of his father.
</P>
<P>
   If the court's past rulings on immigration can serve as a
guidepost, there is cause for concern by the Miami relatives who
want Elian to be granted political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit, one step below the U.S. Supreme Court, has
come to be regarded as one of the nation's most predictable when
deciding immigration disputes. It typically sides with federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In immigration, the 11th Circuit is known as one of the more
government-friendly courts,'' said David Martin, a University of
Virginia law school professor who was U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service general counsel from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who has written a book on
immigration law, said it is hard to peg the court as either liberal
or conservative in terms of its immigration rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd say the court is generally considered to be
deferential, and maybe the most deferential in the county, to the
government on immigration matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, cases before the court arouse the public's
interest. But nothing compares to the Elian Gonzalez case. An
onslaught of requests from the international news media forced the
court last week to hold a lottery for the 12 seats set aside for
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three judges who will hear the case, two are among the
court's longest-serving members and the third is the court's most
recent addition:
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Edmondson, 52, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in
1986, is perhaps the court's most conservative jurist and one of
its most influential. During oral argument, Edmondson speaks
frankly, rarely allows attorneys to fudge their positions and often
indicates which way he's leaning.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he wrote the majority ruling that found former
Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers was within his rights when he
withdrew a job offer to lesbian lawyer Robin Shahar. It was
Edmondson who issued the court's initial ruling in the Elian
Gonzalez case, saying he ``decided to act alone'' in approving a
temporary injunction, ordering that Elian remain in the United
States and that no one assist in his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Dubina, 52, of Montgomery, Ala., also is regarded as one of
the court's conservative, law-and-order judges. He was in private
practice when Reagan appointed him in 1986 to be a U.S. district
court judge. Four years later, President George Bush elevated him
to the federal appeals court to fill the seat left by Judge Robert
Vance, who was killed in a mail-bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gonzalez case, Dubina dissented from the order granting
the motion from Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to intervene.
The father's motion was ``untimely filed,'' Dubina said, adding
that he believed ``the INS adequately represents (Elian's)
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wilson, 45, of Tampa, Fla., is the court's most recent
appointee and only African-American. Before being placed on the
court last year by President Clinton, Wilson was the U.S. attorney
for the Middle District of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, while Wilson was serving as a federal magistrate, U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno asked if he would consider applying to
be Tampa's top federal prosecutor. He did, and Clinton appointed
him. Wilson does not appear to be a liberal jurist. In fact, in an
interview last year, he expressed his admiration for the late U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, a renowned centrist.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain the 11th Circuit's leanings on
immigration, most lawyers and scholars point to the case of Ralph
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who ran a commercial cleaning firm and coached his
church soccer team in suburban Atlanta, was detained on Oct. 26,
1997, upon his return from a weekend trip to his native Haiti.
Richardson, a lawful permanent U.S. resident, had to go through
immigration when he returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, INS officials discovered
Richardson had a 7-year-old cocaine trafficking conviction.
Authorities decided that this prior offense fell under the
definition of an ``aggravated felony,'' which under immigration law
requires the INS to move for detention and deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for Richardson were sweeping immigration reforms passed by
Congress in 1996. They prohibit anyone in his predicament from
applying for a waiver, which in the past had been allowed if they
could prove they were rehabilitated and living productive lives.
And the reforms also greatly restrict the ability of these
detainees to obtain bail.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of rulings, the 11th Circuit upheld the law,
rejecting Richardson's due process claims. He is still being
detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely disappointed and felt that the decision was
out of line with the decisions by other circuits across the
country,'' said Kurzban, the Miami lawyer widely known for his
advocacy of immigration rights.
</P>
<P>
   In another immigration decision, the 11th Circuit last year
upheld the INS' deportation of a West African immigrant whose
lawyer had failed to notify him of important immigration hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected Alexis Anin's claims that he should not be
faulted for the malpractice of his lawyer, who had received notice
of the hearings and had neither told Anin about them nor attended
them on his behalf, prompting a judge's order for Anin's
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the 11th Circuit said the law ``holds Anin
responsible for his lawyer's actions and omissions.'' Anin also
missed the 180-day deadline for filing his appeal, the court said,
noting that no other circuit had allowed such an exception.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the 11th Circuit issued its July 14, 1999,
ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
granted such an exception. That case was filed by a Mexican
immigrant who missed important immigration hearings and interviews
after his legal representative failed to notify him.

 &HT;    Student awarded scholarships to five U.S. military academies
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Maybe in these days of tech stocks and
teenage millionaires, it's not so unusual to hear about a kid worth
just over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But at Lake Worth High School, there's a senior who earned it in
the old-fashioned way. He studied his calculus, volunteered in the
town's parks, and applied to all five American military academies _
and was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   There's $250,000 from West Point, the U.S. Army's academy;
another quarter-million from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md.; not to mention the money from the Air Force, Coast Guard and
Merchant Marines, and the Navy's scholarship to University of San
Diego _ worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Ron Spellman, a public affairs officer at the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy, didn't have specific numbers on how many
students get accepted into all five military academies. But, he
said, ``It's far from a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Matt Tanguay will report to the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn., for his new haircut and dress whites.
He will study naval architecture and prepare for a career as a
Coast Guard officer. It was his first choice all along, fulfilling
his desire to spend his life near the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Tanguay is as calm as a flat sea in the sunshine _
years and years of waiting for the right wave on a surfboard off
Lantana Beach will do that to you _ as he explained the work that
went into his recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sacrificed a lot of parties to work on school projects or
get my homework finished, but I think it'll work out in the long
run,'' said Tanguay, who has a career 3.9 grade point average. ``I
think most of my friends would say first that I'm a nerd. I like to
read, I like to do my homework, I'm happy when I'm doing my
calculus _ that's my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after they thought about it a little, I think they'd say _
Matt's a leader, because I'm the guy who's always making plans for
them, telling them where to go. And they'd say I have good morals,
I'm trustworthy, that I'm a good person. There was this day when
the soda machine was unlocked and everyone was saying _ Free Sodas!
_ and I said, 'That's all right. If I want a soda, I'll pay for
one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   There also was the night that Tanguay stopped a carful of
friends because an elderly woman on the sidewalk was getting
hassled by some kids, he said. They were on their way back from
``Fiddler on the Roof'' rehearsals two years ago _ Tanguay played
the rabbi's son, a minor part, he said modestly _ when they saw the
woman poking her cane at her antagonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be (upset) if I saw my grandmother getting hassled,''
Tanguay recalled. ``So I said 'Hey, stop the car' and we chased the
kids away.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tanguay's ROTC instructor, Cpl. Steve Cotter, he is
the perfect kid, Cotter said. He competed on the high school's
wrestling and golf teams; he's taking three advanced classes this
semester; and he's won the school's Most Spirited award four years
running. He also helped rebuild a local park and rang a Salvation
Army bell at Christmas, and he's held high-ranking positions in
ROTC since the summer after his freshman year. Back then, Cotter
asked him to take on public affairs duties for the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got everybody but Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw to show up,''
Cotter said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tanguay said ROTC has given him leadership skills,
taught him how to lead by example, and feel comfortable in a
uniform. And he said he knows it sounds corny, but it has made him
feel part of a team or brotherhood _ one where it's actually cool
to do well in school _ and he hopes he has the same feeling in the
Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   West Point is better known. Annapolis is right on the Chesapeake
Bay. But Tanguay doesn't want to spend his life preparing for war,
he said, and the Coast Guard has a peacetime mission. After a
summer at the Coast Guard's Academy Introductory Mission program,
which simulates the first few weeks of a typical freshman year,
Tanguay knew he wanted to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't walk away saying it was fun, but I said it was
something I want to be part of,'' he said. ``Honestly, I want to be
a Coast Guard officer. It's not like I just want the free
schooling, and then I'm going to ditch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanguay hopes one day, one perfect day, to be somewhere in
Hawaii, commanding a Coast Guard cutter making its way to yet
another spectacular rescue, or another day of environmental
clean-up, or just another day of sea and sun.

IN SPAIN, AN INFLUX OF MOROCCANS LEADS TO TENSIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL EJIDO, Spain _ The newly planted orange trees on the quaint
Plaza de la Colonizacion suggest a certain civic pride in this
southern Spanish town, but the rubble and charred remains of
Afrolatino Comunicacion demonstrate how civility has gone up in
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 telephone cabins in the burned establishment were used by
immigrants, mainly Moroccans, to call home. That was until the
place was set alight on the night of April 20, two days after the
newspaper kiosk of a Moroccan immigrant in nearby Almeria was
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure racism _ $12,000 of investment up in smoke
because some Spaniards can't stand Africans,'' said Armon Elia
Mejia, the owner, who is an immigrant from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents are the latest spasms in anti-immigrant violence
in this region of southern Spain. After a Spanish woman was killed
in a local market by a Moroccan in early February, there was a
three-day rampage directed against the tens of thousands of North
African laborers here.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst, now known simply as ``la guerra,'' or ``the war,''
was the worst recent case of racial violence in a Europe
increasingly uneasy about immigrants. ``When a people rises up, it
is because they are tired,'' said Alejandro Fernandez, the fiance
of the woman who was killed. ``I tell you, this place is a time
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   In some senses, that bomb is of purely local manufacture. A lot
happened suddenly to El Ejido, creating a rootless culture in which
sparks flare easily. It became rich through the production of
winter fruits; it became mixed through a massive influx of
Moroccans to pick them; it became angry because its identity was
suddenly unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, the quandary of El Ejido is that of all of
Europe. Spain, like many of its partners in the European Union, is
a rich country with a fast-aging population, a low birthrate, a
growing aversion to menial jobs and an uneasy proximity to lands of
poverty. It needs immigrants from poorer places, even as its
national psyche resists them.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Continent, young laborers are being lured from poorer
places, whether in Africa or eastern Europe, only to meet
resistance from wealthy countries afraid that their national
identities will be diluted or their generous welfare systems
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, the party of Joerg Haider rails against
``overforeignerization.'' In Germany, conservatives urge people to
have more children rather than accept immigrants. In France, riots
erupt after an Algerian is shot by police. In Britain, drastic laws
are introduced to curb the growing number of asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe requires immigrants today because of simple
demographics,'' said Kirsty Hughes, a senior European Union
official. ``But try telling that to people. The political
atmosphere is one of fortress Europe, even if immigrants are doing
the jobs nobody else wants to do and are needed to ensure that we
don't end up as a continent of old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain is growing older fast. Without an influx of young
immigrants, or a radical change in the birthrate of 1.2 children
per woman, it will have the highest percentage of old people in the
world by 2050, U.N. projections show. People over 65 will account
for 37 percent of the population, compared with 17 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will have to support these people under Europe's
taxpayer-financed pension systems, just as somebody on the Costa
del Sol today has to be ready to do the hot, back-breaking work of
picking the cherry tomatoes and basil that the baby boomers of
Hamburg and Helsinki now want on their tables year-round.
</P>
<P>
   But suggest that immigration from Africa or Romania is one
answer, and Western Europe tends to rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, these old nations do not readily see
themselves as ``lands of immigration,'' nor do they readily indulge
the idea that newcomers may be catalysts to innovation rather than
threats to jobs. In Spain, long a poor country that sent emigrants
abroad, the cultural leap required to invert that self-image is
huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought of ourselves as racist _ until the invasion
of the 1990s,'' said Tomas Calvo Buezas, a sociologist. ``Even
today, we deny it publicly, and a successful anti-immigrant
politician like Austria's Haider or France's Le Pen is unthinkable.
But look at our language. We call the rich `Arabs'; we deride poor
North Africans as `Moors.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many North Africans eking out an existence in the
vast sea of plastic-covered hothouses that surrounds El Ejido is
Ilhami Elhoussin, 24. In 1998 he paid $500 for an illegal passage
in a small boat from his native Morocco across the narrow strait to
Spain. The other 19 passengers were caught on arrival; he ran and
slipped through.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, his immigrant's dream consists of a hovel
without water or electricity, roofed with sheets of plastic that
are anchored by rocks, set in the middle of an arid field where
garbage skitters in the enervating wind out of Africa. A cousin
shares the tiny shanty; 50 other Moroccan laborers live in abutting
structures on the outskirts of El Ejido.
</P>
<P>
   Some have done slightly better. Eljabiry Salah, 29, has
electricity and running water in his shack. But his bed is a foam
mattress perched on the green plastic crates that serve by day to
collect fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is a home for animals, not for humans,'' Elhoussin said.
But he would not return to Africa. Here he can earn $25 a day
picking produce. In Morocco, he said, there is no work for young
people, unless a man wants to go into the army for $6 a day.
</P>
<P>
   So most days, carrying his knife and pliers, this young African
in Europe sets out to work ``under the plastic,'' where
temperatures can reach 113 degrees in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Human ingenuity has not yet conceived a machine to pick
tomatoes. So Elhoussin picks them, filling buckets at a rate of
over 28 pounds an hour. The next day, the plump fruit will be in
Perpignan, France, or Rotterdam, Netherlands, ready to adorn the
Insalata Caprese at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Such exports, which have risen to over 1.5 million tons
annually, from 100,000 tons in the early 1980s, have turned a
dirt-poor corner of Spain into a boom town. The sun, pouring into
75,000 acres of plastic-covered hothouses, has proved as valuable
as oil.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is ubiquitous in El Ejido, whose population has
almost doubled to 55,000, from 29,000 in 1981. Modern shopping
malls are the rage. But this ``New Spain,'' chic and confident,
remains utterly foreign to Elhoussin and the North Africans whose
labor helped transform the region.
</P>
<P>
   The birthrate in Morocco is two and a half times that of Spain.
Elhoussin is one of eight children _ his youngest sister is 10 _
from a village near Casablanca, and he sends about $350 a month to
his father to help him raise the family. With the remaining $150,
Elhoussin lives simply, seldom going out, especially since ``la
guerra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bars don't want us Moroccans at night,'' he said.
``We came here in the same way as Spaniards once went overseas to
work. Young Moroccans today want a house, a car, and the money is
better here. But the majority in El Ejido is racist. They don't
want us to rent their property, they don't want us to look at their
girls, they don't want us to build mosques.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in February, in which more than 500 North
Africans lost homes, astonished this young Moroccan. As shanties
and cars burned, and a marauding mob wielded clubs, Elhoussin fled
in terror to the snow-capped mountains behind El Ejido, where he
and a group of fellow Moroccans survived for four days without
food.
</P>
<P>
   At last he returned _ but to a changed place where unstated
grievances had become open wounds. The uneasy truce that has
followed is partial, marked by the averted gazes of divided
communities, and punctuated by violence.
</P>
<P>
   In every war there are two realities, seemingly unbridgeable.
People talk past each other, entrenched in their opposing worlds.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Spanish officials and businessmen tell it, the Moroccans
largely brought the cataclysm on themselves. There was the death of
Encarnacion Lopez, the woman who was killed in the market, but also
two other slayings by Moroccans in the 10 days before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 4,000 North Africans here with no fixed
work,'' said Antonio Martin, the official in charge of regional
security. ``If they don't work, they can't eat. So they rob, they
deal drugs, they cause trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints go beyond crime. If the Moroccans live in
shanties, it is because they do not want to pay rent, the Spaniards
say. If they do not want to pay rent, it is because they want to
send all their money home. If ever they do rent, they want to put
20 people in a room, and who in Europe can accept that?
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards, the arguments continue, went to Argentina or Germany
to find work when the country was poor, but were culturally
compatible, unlike these ``Moors'' who expect to be presented with
everything their own government will not give them, even as they
refuse to invest anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we need their labor, so we are going to have to
learn to live together,'' said Antonio Escobar, the director of an
exporter called Agroponiente. ``Our mental attitude must improve.
But they must also learn to assimilate. Why is it that we have to
adapt to their Ramadan?''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, 25, the bereaved hotelier who had planned to marry
Lopez, 26, before her slaying set off the violence, still wears a
gold engagement ring, and his blue eyes glisten with tears when he
speaks of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was humble, she was hard-working, she was loving _ she was
right for me,'' he said, fingering a gold crucifix that nestled on
his chest. ``But a woman is worth nothing to a Moroccan. He'd
exchange her for a goat or a sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   As in all such situations, truth hovers somewhere between the
two sides. The Moors were the eighth-century Arab and Berber
conquerors of Spain who remained until 1492, so history imbues the
tensions with a particular charge. Newspapers in Morocco have been
denouncing Spain's ``new anti-Islamic Crusades.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, after a period of heady expansion, the produce
industry here has entered a period of consolidation. Jobs are
scarcer. The wages of pickers, around $500 a month, do not attract
Spaniards, who expect at least double that, even with unemployment
at over 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of North Africans in the region vary
wildly: 45,000, says Ali Blidan, the leader of an immigrant rights
group; less than half that, according to the police. Most of them
came in the last decade, and the squares of El Ejido are full of
idle young Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   On the square in the San Agustin district where Afrolatino
Comunicacion was burned down, there are two bars _ one frequented
by Spaniards, the other by Moroccans. The two groups even sit on
separate benches, eyeing each other suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjacent police headquarters, Paco Ruiz, the local chief,
offered a different explanation of the recent violence _ which, he
ventured, was caused by rivalry between Moroccans and Algerians
``who cannot stand each other.'' Because they were not allowed to
drink in their own countries, ``they are out of control when they
drink here,'' Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked a visitor in the eye and continued: ``The fire may be
out here, but the embers are still burning. This place is going to
explode again.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ensure that it does not, Spanish authorities
have brought in several hundred extra police officers since
February. The government has also introduced legislation allowing
illegal immigrants to regularize their situation if they arrived
before June 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Elhoussin is not interested. As soon as he can save enough
money, he said, he wants to head north to a ``more civilized place,
like France,'' where he hopes to work in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The reception there may not be much warmer. The mood of
``fortress Europe'' tends to vary little from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The march from the south to the north is inevitable,'' said
Jean-Claude Chesnais, a French demographer. ``Africa's population
is growing by 20 million a year, while ours declines rapidly. The
problem is we are afraid of the immigration we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The grieving Fernandez sees every reason for such fear. The
stabbing of his fiancee was an aberration, the work of one man. But
emotion is irrational, and Fernandez insists on drawing a general
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who,'' he asked, ``wants to risk living with a neighbor who is
a complete stranger?''

DESPITE PLAYING THEIR BEST, MAPLE LEAFS FACE ELIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Maple Leafs played their best game of their
Eastern Conference semifinal series with the Devils on Saturday
night. Because it was not good enough, the Leafs are facing playoff
elimination in New Jersey on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Leafs turn in their best all-around effort, a
4-3 loss that gave the Devils a 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game
series, but their top line, led by center Mats Sundin, also
dictated play for the first time in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The result at the Air Canada Center was a familiar one, however.
The Sundin line was held without a point for the fourth time in
five games and the Leafs played the last two periods without
defenseman Aleksandr Karpovtsev, who was hit in the chest with a
stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably played our best game,'' said Sundin, who combined
with Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund for seven shots on goal. ``We
created a lot of chances. And still we have nothing to show for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the line has to show for the series so far is one
Hoglund goal, with assists from Sundin and Thomas, in Game 4. One
goal. Two assists. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Farkas, the 22-year-old rookie from Boston College, matched
that total with his first goal as a professional on Saturday night.
Farkas, who was inserted into the Toronto lineup for Game 4 to
charge a moribund offense, has done everything Leafs coach Pat
Quinn could have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Quinn said. ``Here's a guy who was in no man's
land. He certainly has not embarrassed himself at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While his classmates at Boston College have been taking final
exams, and while his roommate and best friend, Mike Mottau, the
Rangers draft choice, plays defense for Team USA at the world
hockey championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, Farkas has been
taking his National Hockey League entrance exams. He has teamed
with left wing Sergei Berezin and center Igor Korolev to give the
Leafs a blazingly quick line.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas' line was the Leafs' most productive one on Saturday
night. He and Berezin each scored a goal. But if the Sundin line
does not produce soon, Farkas soon will be back at Boston College
finishing the work on his degree.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has played just two professional games, Farkas is
just one goal off the team lead for the series. Darcy Tucker has
two this series to lead the Leafs. And he may have sparked a feud
that will carry into Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker had not one, but two, run-ins with Devils goalie Martin
Brodeur on Saturday, including one that sparked a postgame fracas.
Tucker, who is not known for his restraint, promised there would be
more to come in Game 6. The Devils responded by saying they would
welcome all the power plays they can get. That brings up another
sore spot for Toronto: the Maple Leafs are 0 for 18 on the power
play in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had eight power plays in the last two games compared
to three for Toronto, which is one reason why the officiating crew
was showered with debris after it left the ice on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking about our power play,'' said Quinn, after
the Leafs were 0 for 2 on Saturday and the Devils were 2 for 5. But
the power play does not work, he explained, if you never get on it.

WARDING OFF THE `I LOVE NOMAR' VIRUS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Security for the online version of voting for
Major League Baseball's All-Star Game begins today with greatly
stepped up measures, the league says, trying to downplay the
incident last year when one fan voted 25,000 times for Boston
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra on the last day to get him in the
starting lineup over New York's Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be dead sure there can't be any fraud in the
voting,'' Tim Brosnan, MLB's executive vice president for business
affairs, told Bloomberg News. ``Without those assurances, the
procedure goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 900,000 of the 12 million votes placed last year came via
the Internet, and MLB expects to triple that this year.
</P>
<P>
   Voting can be found at the sport's official site
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com) as well as a yet-to-launch site
called www.seasonticket.com, an on-demand sports highlight
broadband video service. Balloting ends July 1.
</P>
<P>
   -The first Spanish-language fantasy beisbol game has been
launched at Fox Sports Latin America (www.foxsportsla.com), known
as Grandes Ligas Interactivas 2000 and powered by Stats, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Manager de Ano'' grand prize is (hold your breath) a trip
for two to L.A. and two tickets to a Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   -Those involved in athletic fund-raising should watch how an
online auction conducted by Cal's athletic department comes off,
called the Cal CyBear Auction (www.cybear-auction.org.)
</P>
<P>
   The auction, which started Sunday and runs through May 18,
should generate as much as $200,000 to reduce the department's
debt, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200 donated items up for bid are access to play on
Haas Pavilion's basketball court for 10 minutes during halftime at
a Bears game, two tickets to agent Leigh Steinberg's annual Super
Bowl party, and a program from the 1982 Cal-Stanford football game
signed by all five Bears players who touched the ball during ``The
Play.''
</P>
<P>
   -Lou Holtz, cyberticket scalper?
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site for the current South Carolina football coach
(!bold!www.coachholtz.com!off!), which primarily is a calling card
for anyone who wants him for personal appearances, a link has been
added to E-Ticketboard.com, which specializes in hooking up people
to buy and sell tickets to thousands of sporting events around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The site claims it is not a ticket broker - just a place for
buyers and sellers to meet. There's a $30 annual membership fee or
$6 single-event cost to use the service.

ROYAL KPN IS SAID TO PURSUE A DEAL WITH JAPAN'S DOCOMO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Just days after the Dutch telecommunications company
Royal KPN called off merger talks with Telefonica SA of Spain, KPN
returned to the bargaining table with a third possible partner,
DoCoMo Inc. of Japan, according to executives close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Royal KPN, the largest telephone operator in the Netherlands,
and DoCoMo, the mobile operation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
have been negotiating in fits and starts for over a month now. They
are hoping to reach an agreement that could include an alliance
between the two companies' mobile telephone operations. If they do
form an alliance, each company might take a small ownership stake
in the other, the executives said. Both companies have also
discussed a joint bid for Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest
mobile telephone operator, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Orange is expected to be put up for sale by Vodafone AirTouch
PLC, which has to dispose of Orange as a condition of its $183
billion acquisition of Mannesmann AG. Analysts expect a fierce
bidding war for Orange, which is expected to sell for about $50
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While no agreement between Royal KPN and DoCoMo has been
reached, executives close to the negotiations said they hoped to
complete a deal by the end of the week. The executives stressed
that, as with any negotiation, either side could still decide to
abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between Royal KPN and DoCoMo come as Royal KPN weighs
its next move after the collapse of talks between Royal KPN and
Telefonica on Friday. If that deal had been completed, it would
have catapulted the companies, both of them formerly state-owned
telephone operators, into the ranks of the major players in
Europe's telecommunications race. The stocks of both companies were
expected to drop Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The failed deal with Telefonica puts Royal KPN, which has an
alliance with Qwest Communications International of the United
States and which is partly owned by BellSouth Corp., in play as a
potential takeover target, according to analysts. A bevy of other
European telephone operators and several U.S. telecommunications
companies are looking to establish footholds in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point to Vivendi and Bouyges Telecom, both from France,
as well as the German mobile phone company Debitel, a unit of
DaimlerChrysler, as possible suitors for Royal KPN.

AIRLINES IN A PUSH FOR SHORTER LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich., Minn., Alaska, Ore.)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A traveler prints a boarding pass and luggage tags from her
office computer, drives to the airport and walks straight past the
snaking line at the main counter. She drops her bags on a conveyer
belt and dashes to the gate, where the bar code on her boarding
pass causes her photograph to appear on the gate agent's computer
screen. Her entire time in the airport, from curb to gate: less
than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this scenario is little more than a dream for all
but a few elite passengers. Airports are more crowded than ever,
and lines are much longer than they were even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in a competition to attract the business travelers who are
responsible for most of the carriers' revenue, major airlines are
spending tens of millions of dollars on new technology.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to whisk passengers through terminals more quickly,
redefining what industry executives glumly call ``the airport
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Continental Airlines plans to have 300
ATM-like computers across the United States that allow people to
print their own boarding passes and baggage tags. Delta Air Lines
has spent $750 million over the last two years wiring airports and
preparing to introduce similar gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds
to canceled flights at its hubs by rolling out banks of wireless
phones with direct connections to its reservations desk.
</P>
<P>
   And Alaska Airlines, the most aggressive recently in using
technology, allows people with electronic tickets to print boarding
passes from their home or office computers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a pilot program, it has also scanned the driver's
licenses of about 500 frequent fliers into its computer system. The
bar code on the boarding pass retrieves both the driver's license
and a larger photo, so travelers never have to reach into their
wallets before boarding the plane.
</P>
<P>
   For now, business travelers are the main beneficiaries of the
improvements. Some of the initiatives, such as calling passengers'
cell phones to tell them about a late flight, are available only to
the top tier of frequent fliers, and others, like the kiosks,
appeal mainly to travelers who do not check bags.
</P>
<P>
   Continental has even installed a kiosk in the lobby of AT&AMP;T's
corporate headquarters in New Jersey, so travelers there can get
boarding passes before they arrive at the airport. And Northwest is
testing a program that allows employees of 10 Midwestern companies
to print their own passes off the airline's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some other recent perks for corporate road warriors _
like expanded first-class sections or the installation of double
beds on overnight flights _ much of the new technology will
eventually be available for all passengers to use, industry experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airports weren't designed for the volumes they're now
getting,'' said Michael L. Zea, a vice president in Mercer
Management Consulting's airline practice. ``There's a lot of strain
on the system, and technology can be very helpful in easing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, automated systems are not always reliable. During a
threatened strike by US Airways employees in March, passengers
holding electronic tickets needed old-fashioned paper tickets to
have any hope of getting a seat on another carrier. And if the
airlines eventually replace agents with the machines, they could
both anger their unions and force passengers to do more work in
order to board a plane, travel experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year in which consumer complaints more than doubled
from their 1998 level, industry executives say that shortening the
lines at their airport counters is a sure-fire way to boost their
carriers' images.
</P>
<P>
   As air travel has surged during the long economic expansion, and
the size of airports and airline staffs has failed to keep up, the
average amount of time that travelers spend on line at the main
counter has reached 16 minutes, up 20 percent from three years ago,
according to Airport Interviewing and Research, a White Plains,
N.Y., company that surveys passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter security standards that the government has adopted
in recent years have added to the lines, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no matter what travelers think of folding
themselves into a middle seat or drinking the airlines' mediocre
coffee, they will generally be happy if their trips take less time
than they have come to expect, airline executives say. ``You can
make up for a lot of coffee sins by having a line that's been
reduced,'' said Dirk C. McMahon, the senior vice president for
ground operations at Northwest Airlines. And at $10,000 apiece, the
machines cost much less than additional employees.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high enough to have led to two recent lawsuits
between airlines with different views about how best to move
passengers through airports. Continental has sued both Delta and
United to force them to remove metal templates on baggage X-ray
machines that prevent passengers, including Continental's, from
carrying large bags onto airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Continental says that its planes' overhead compartments are
large enough to hold the bags and that allowing customers to carry
on luggage instead of checking it reduces delays. Delta and United
say the big bags result in overstuffed bins that cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unclear which argument holds the most sway with
passengers, they clearly care deeply about the issue. Bill Harsh, a
management consultant who flies over 200,000 miles a year, said he
has stopped flying United, once his main carrier, because he could
no longer carry on his luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bag that fit in every overhead compartment in America
but did not fit through their template,'' said Harsh, who lives in
a Maryland suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for United said the airline has received few
complaints about the templates.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the biggest attempts to reduce lines involve
technology. Delta and other carriers are putting up computer
screens near gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions,
such as the reason for a delay, that often clog lines. Northwest's
agents in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to
print boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation of
the ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska, Continental
and Northwest have put them in dozens of airports across the
country, and British Airways and Alitalia, among others, use them
in Europe. Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and
Washington for shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version
in Aspen, Colo.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of the
machines but probably would have had to hire more new agents
without the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Typically about 6 feet tall, the machines allow passengers with
electronic tickets to insert a credit card, print a boarding pass
and sometimes change their seats or get a ticket on an earlier
flight. The machines pose, in text form, the security questions
that gate agents ask passengers who check in in the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one, at
the kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, N.J., used one of them
last week at Newark International Airport before boarding a
Continental flight on a business trip. ``They're quicker even than
when there are no lines'' at the counters, she said. ``I don't have
to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no bags
to check and no questions to ask a gate agent.
</P>
<P>
   Only Alaska Airlines, in Anchorage, Alaska, and Portland, Ore.,
now permits passengers to print their own tags and then drop them
onto a conveyer belt from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on
the plane. The other carriers make passengers using the kiosks wait
in a line _ usually separate from the main one and shorter _ to
check their bags.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have also not fully explained the policies to
travelers, analysts said. Smith, for example, said she believed she
could not have used the kiosk at all if she had wanted to check a
bag.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the kiosks do not yet give fliers the same control
that talking to an agent does, particularly for frequent travelers
whose requests the airlines often meet, noted Samuel C. Buttrick,
an airline analyst at PaineWebber. ``I can't ask that the seat next
to me be left open. I can't ask about upgrade wait lists. I can't
ask questions about the status of a connecting flight,'' Buttrick
said, adding that he rarely uses the kiosks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda _ Rwanda said Sunday that it was ready to begin a
gradual withdrawal of its troops from Congo, a step that members of
the U.N. Security Council say could be the first real opening for
negotiations to end a two-year war that now involves six African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the breakthrough will be tested on Monday, when
council members on a peace mission in Africa will meet the last _
and now perhaps most crucial _ player in the Congolese war,
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The war has made enemies of the Congo's president, Laurent
Kabila, and his erstwhile allies, Rwanda and Uganda, who first
helped him oust Congo's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, then
attacked Kabila's forces in 1998. He has responded by drawing in
12,000 troops from Zimbabwe and smaller contingents from Angola and
Namibia in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Besides consulting with the leaders of countries embroiled in
Congo's tangled conflict, the council mission will attempt to quell
another African war _ between Ethiopia and Eritrea _ by visiting
both those nations later on Monday, officials with the group said
late Sunday. Peace talks between those two countries collapsed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of talks on Sunday, Rwanda's president, Paul
Kagame, and the visiting council team led by Richard C. Holbrooke,
the American ambassador to the United Nations, released a joint
statement in which Rwanda said it was ``prepared to move quickly to
implement a phased withdrawal.'' The Rwandan government also said
that it was willing to discuss the release of prisoners of war
through the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which also includes commitments to intensify
efforts toward a political solution to the Congo war, does not
specify the target of the first withdrawal discussed Sunday, from
the town of Kisangani in eastern Congo. The Ugandans and Rwandans
exchanged artillery and small-arms fire there last week, leaving as
many as 10 people dead and 100 wounded, and complicating the Congo
conflict even more. Both countries have troops in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Using the sudden outbreak of fighting between allies, council
members are trying to parlay an end to that dispute into a pledge
by both sides to pull their troops out of Kisangani, the capital of
Orientale Province, a potentially rich diamond-producing area.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the U.N. officials, Kisangani could then be
declared the first ``neutral'' town, occupied by neither the
Congolese army nor the Rwandans, Ugandans and the Congolese rebels
they support.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, the United Nations hopes to send about
nine additional cease-fire monitors into Kisangani, to bolster a
few already there in preparation for deployment of a broader U.N.
group of about 5,500 officials and peacekeepers across Congo, a
country the size of western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Museveni, Uganda's leader, are critical because they
could provide the final string in a net of mutually beneficial
moves that Security Council members are trying to weave around the
combatants in the Congo war.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni is, to some extent, on the defensive because the United
States has publicly blamed Uganda for the unexpected fighting in
Kisangani. And since Uganda is the last stop on this Congo mission,
the delegation will arrive with the rest of a package, however
flimsy, in place.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kagame's pledges of troop pullouts, the council
has in hand an agreement from Kabila to allow U.N. peacekeepers a
certain level of access _ yet to be tested _ in regions of Congo
that he controls.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, the council
mission was told by President Robert Mugabe that he would not block
the withdrawal of foreign forces from Congo _ but he insisted that
the Rwandans go first. Mugabe, whose generals are widely believed
to be profiting from the trade in Congolese diamonds but who faces
mounting disgruntlement about the war at home, told council members
for the first time that he had indeed agreed to accept payment in
Congolese resources in return for military support, but that so far
he had yet to receive a single diamond.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, a Zimbabwean officer said in an interview that there
was ``not one Zimbabwean soldier who does not want to go home
now.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in the region, who are mindful of the current chaos in
Sierra Leone and have seen many U.N. ventures collapse are very
wary of the optimism of the diplomats from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But this Security Council mission is an unusually strong team.
Apart from Holbrooke, who began his career negotiating with the
Vietnamese in the 1970s and is well known for the 1995 Dayton
accord that ended the Bosnian war, there is Jean-David Levitte, the
French ambassador, a policy strategist and analyst who was
President Jacques Chirac's security adviser until he was assigned
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are also three experienced African diplomats: Martin
Andjaba of Namibia, Said ben Mustapha of Tunisia and Moctar Ouane,
who until recently was the diplomatic adviser to the president of
Mali. On the U.N. secretariat side, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has appointed Kamel Morjane, a skilled Tunisian relief and
emergency expert who studied in Switzerland and the United States,
as his special representative.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Levitte said that he _ and the French
government _ were particularly concerned that Congo not slide into
a situation like that in Cyprus, where the cease-fire line became a
de facto boundary and people gave up on political solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Levitte, who will be the Security Council president for June,
said in an interview that he would concentrate on two steps to
augment military moves in Congo: a proposed meeting in New York of
major political figures involved in the Congo conflict and a plan
to establish a panel of outside experts to look into the
exploitation of Congolese resources, not only diamonds, but also
gold, timber and agricultural wealth. It will be modeled on a
report on the illegal trade in diamonds from Angola, a project of
Canada's U.N. representative, Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody considers that in Africa, diamonds and other
resources are food for war,'' Levitte said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crisis in Sierra Leone has overshadowed the Congo
peace mission in recent days, the effects have been largely
confined to the Security Council mission, not African leaders.
There is scant coverage of the crisis in the press and almost no
discussion of it, except in Zambia. Hundreds of that country's
soldiers have apparently been taken hostage by rebels in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to send peacekeepers to Congo has already been made
by the Security Council. It is now up to Annan to recommend when to
send them. The council mission will issue a report on its return
that is expected to be critical to the United Nations' next moves.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE RIGHT TIME FOR ALONZO MOURNING  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For almost 45 minutes of another classic Knicks-Miami
playoff scrum that the Heat would ultimately survive more than win,
there was no definitive answer to the riddle in the middle. There
were even a few moments when there was the temptation to say that
Patrick Ewing was right, and that Alonzo Mourning was the best
center in the Eastern Conference, next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes 35 seconds from the finish of Game 1 Sunday, Ewing
lumbered off the bench and back onto the court with the Knicks
leading by 81-79 and looking as if they were ready to stretch out
on the sofa, make themselves at home in Miami's new digs.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had to this point played Georgetown Junior to a
statistical draw, and, remarkably, on a day when his 37-year-old
body was still recovering from recent back spasms and early on
looked as if he had arrived at American Airlines Arena in need of
assembly and a long extension cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to get loose,'' Ewing said after the Heat's
87-83 victory. ``I was just trying to clog the middle and play some
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks, after taking a few figurative punches, had the
Heat in its usual early-series quandary, fighting for a home-court
advantage it worked all season for but not knowing where its next
basket was coming from. The game Tim Hardaway was in no condition
to create a shot for himself. After rising high from his playoff
past, Jamal Mashburn was beginning to fade from fourth-quarter
view. Mourning himself had minutes before ruined one possession by
holding the ball too long on the right side, then blown a dunk and
missed two free throws that helped the Knicks to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forcing the issue, instead of being patient,'' Mourning
said, nothing we hadn't heard before from him at this stage of the
season, against this particular opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning would rather be president of the Larry Johnson Fan Club
than admit he's ever been affected by the presence of big brother
Ewing. It's a news media fabrication, ``the one-on-one thing,'' he
said, dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the judge, for in order to compensate for the
injuries that have reduced Hardaway to offensive caretaker, the
Heat can simply no longer afford Mourning battling Ewing to a draw.
The last 3:35 Sunday was an excellent start.
</P>
<P>
   First Mourning worked hard for position, drew Ewing's fourth
foul and tied the score by converting two free throws. After the
Knicks turned the ball over, Mourning isolated Ewing on the right
side, a few feet from the baseline, and his body language shouting
that he had no intention of settling for the jumper.
</P>
<P>
   He has done that too often because Mourning has never been a
comfortable post player, never a center at all, in the classic
back-to-the-basket mold. He doesn't have the true go-to shot, the
reliable hook or turnaround jumper. His signature moves have been
bullish drives, though less crude than they used to be, or the
catch deep in the lane predicated again on brute strength.
</P>
<P>
   On the baseline, though on the left side, was where we had left
Mourning and Ewing in their last close playoff encounter a year
ago. Mourning failed to get around Ewing on a possession that could
have iced the Knicks in the dying moments of Game 5. This time,
Mourning got the step and the benefit of a call. Maybe this was the
law of averages. Maybe it was Ewing's back, or another year off his
reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning made the two free throws, but then Latrell Sprewell
tied the score from the line with 55.6 seconds left. Once more, you
got the idea that Miami was a single missed shot from coughing up
Game 1. Pat Riley called it the ``need play,'' and as the ball
swung in misdirection, Mourning happened to notice Ewing cheating
in the lane as P.J. Brown rolled through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Patrick playing deeper,'' he said. ``I attacked, turned
and sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Majerle made the precise entry pass, into the left post. All
Mourning had to do was turn and drop the ball in the basket, off
glass. Allan Houston would counter with a sloppy entry pass to
Ewing that Brown slapped away. Jeff Van Gundy would let Miami run
the clock down inside 10 seconds, a gamble he lost when Mourning
faced Ewing up on the right side and nailed his jumper with 5.6
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning had 26 points, the last 8 and the realization that
Ewing and the Knicks would be back to try to undo all his effort
Tuesday night for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep hearing people say, `Zo, you won the battle today,'''
he said. ``We got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks missed their last eight shots and still weren't put
away until 5.6 seconds were left. The Heat, for its part, looked
more like a team staggering to the end of Game 7 than one bursting
from Game 1. Hardaway limped off to have his ailing foot retaped in
the second quarter. Mashburn tripped over the foot of the official
Mike Mathis and rolled his ankle. Even Mourning took a
third-quarter blow to the temple from a scrambling Charlie Ward and
dropped briefly to the floor like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman Trophy winner had some flashbacks,'' Mourning
said. ``I didn't play much football.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he'd get a few arguments on that one. Mourning will
never be poetry. He will never be pretty. He doesn't have to be
against Ewing. He just needs to play like the man in his prime
against a proud friend whose bones and muscles get crankier by the
month. He needs to substantially win the middle for the Heat to win
the war.

SEEKING ITS FIRST VISIT BY CLINTON, NEBRASKA HAILS THE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ark., S.D., Ind.)  (Eds: Streett in 7th graf cq.) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It will be eight stories tall, a huge contraption
of steel and rocks and timber that will span a major highway in
central Nebraska. The ribbon cutting for this unusual monument will
be in July, and organizers are planning a grand affair with hordes
of people, a mock buffalo stampede and, just possibly, but probably
not, a speech by the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven-plus years of his presidency, President Clinton has
been to Colorado and Wyoming. He has visited South Dakota and Iowa.
Kansas and Missouri together have been hosts to the president a
combined 20 times. But poor Nebraska is the lone state in the union
that Clinton has snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official reaction we've gotten from the White House is
that the president's schedule has not been finalized and they'll
get back to us,'' said Jeff Smith, an advertising executive from
Omaha who is leading the uphill effort to lure Clinton to the
dedication ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to be realistic,'' Smith added. ``Nebraska is
not a heavily populated state and it's not known as a Democratic
swing vote in presidential elections. We'll probably have to book
the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   There are less than 6,000 hours left in the Clinton presidency,
a dwindling block of time that many people _ the organizers of the
Great Platte River Road Archway Monument among them _ want to
share. (The monument commemorates a transcontinental route used
after the Louisiana Purchase to open up the West.)
</P>
<P>
   Putting together Clinton's schedule in these final months is a
delicate balancing act that involves squeezing together
fund-raising dinners, presidential speeches and photo opportunities
with golf games, foreign trips and overnight stays in Chappaqua,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There are also weddings. Stephanie Streett, the woman who
controls Clinton's day as assistant to the president and director
of presidential scheduling, got married on Saturday in
Fayetteville, Ark., and was able to pencil in her wedding onto
Clinton's schedule. It conveniently coincided with a fund-raiser in
Little Rock on Sunday for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign in New
York for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every minute of the president's day is scripted, from
his first meeting of the morning (usually around 9) until what the
official schedule calls ``good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of what occurs in the White House revolves
around politics, last week's education tour to Iowa, Ohio,
Minnesota and Kentucky included. In his political role, Clinton has
five Democratic National Committee fund-raisers on his schedule
through June and several benefits for congressional candidates.
Other appearances will be added around those occasions, whether it
is a ``message event'' on a topic, or if the fund-raiser is in
California, a side trip to visit his daughter, Chelsea, in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Some days can be a mishmash of disconnected events _ like last
Tuesday's speech to insurance agents, which was followed by a
conference on raising teen-agers and a talk to a roomful of experts
on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes of every day are set aside to brief Clinton on the
schedule. Time is also reserved daily for briefings by John
Podesta, the chief of staff, and Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser. There is also a bit of wiggle room to respond to
the day's news.
</P>
<P>
   In White House lingo, aides refer to ``toppers'' as brief asides
that the president makes at the top of a speech on an important
news development. But reacting to breaking news can be risky.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, when Clinton heard about one 6-year-old shooting
another in Michigan, he mentioned it at a fund-raiser in West Palm
Beach, Fla., but flubbed the facts about how the youngster got the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are ``departure statements,'' remarks Clinton makes
as he is heading off somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on my way to North Carolina for another leg of our New
Markets tour to close the digital divide,'' Clinton said at one
event. ``But before I leave I want to say a few words about an
important study that Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt and I
have just been briefed on regarding the growing cost of
prescription drugs and the burden these costs are placing on
seniors and on disabled Americans.'' He was referring to Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's influence may be diminishing but his aides say
invitations from childhood friends, political allies and others
continue to flow into the White House at a rate of about 250 a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I know how busy you are so please try to come,'''
said George Frazier, an insurance agent from Hope, Ark., who made
his pitch on Clinton's private fax line. ``I said, `We've invited
you each year for seven years, and this is your last chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who has known Clinton since the president was a
teen-ager, invited him for a meeting of insurance agents in
Washington last week. But the chances looked grim at first because
Clinton had been scheduled to visit France while the insurance
agents were convening at the Grand Hyatt.
</P>
<P>
   When the trip to Europe fell through, the insurance group
received an advance tip from a White House official, prompting the
association to renew its lobbying effort. Eventually, the trade
group received the good news from a presidential aide, days before
its opening session. ``You got him,'' the aide said. ``You got him
for half an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But the timing was not ideal. The aide asked if the group could
switch its meeting to the evening because the president dislikes
early morning events. That was impossible, so Clinton showed up
about 8:30 a.m. His scheduled half-hour appearance stretched on
almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
   There are other idiosyncrasies that come with scheduling
Clinton. He likes one day off a week. He routinely runs late. And
he insists upon regular ``OTRs,'' which is off-the-record time
during trips. These visits, which could be a golf game or a stop at
a local restaurant, are not announced ahead of time but are far
from spontaneous. Secret Service agents inspect the fairways, or
the restaurant kitchen, well before his motorcade pulls up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up the schedule to match his personality,'' said an
official who has helped set up the president's days. ``He hates
superficial, two-second conversations. He doesn't like late nights
or early mornings. He likes events with real people who are doing
things that are relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Nebraska consider themselves in that category, and
Clinton has hinted that, along with trips to the Middle East,
Vietnam, Northern Ireland and Africa, he would like to accept
Nebraska's invitation before Jan. 20, 2001, arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a standing invitation,'' said Anne Boyle, chairwoman of
the Nebraska Democratic Party. ``It's been delivered by letter,
more than one letter, and by Nebraskans who have visited the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is not upset that Nebraska has yet to appear on Clinton's
schedule. ``Sometimes when a president visits a state it's because
of a natural disaster,'' she said. ``If you look at it that way,
we're lucky.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MASHBURN A LARGER THREAT TO SPREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A few months ago, Latrell Sprewell referred to himself
as ``not a morning person.'' He admitted he does not like to get up
early to play basketball, especially those ungodly 12:30 p.m.
Eastern tipoffs mandated by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That's what, 6:30 in Hawaii?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't like playing at that time,'' the Knicks forward
said Sunday afternoon. ``But that doesn't make a difference. This
is the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is right. This is the playoffs. And if he doesn't arise
from his Game 1 slumber and counter Jamal Mashburn over the next
week, the Knicks can sleep in until November.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's a reach for one Heat-Knick scrum. After all,
Sprewell and his teammates are resilient, resourceful, able to find
ways to come back to Madison Square Garden on Friday with
home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there had to be something disturbing about the way he
was outscored and outplayed by Mashburn, something that said so
much about the perception surrounding this series _ the one about
New York having such a huge advantage over Miami in the mythical
matchup department.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to work like this: Alonzo Mourning and Tim
Hardaway are locks at center and point guard. P.J. Brown vs. Larry
Johnson is almost a toss-up at power forward. But if Allan Houston
had a clear edge over Dan Majerle at shooting guard going in,
Sprewell was easily the choice over Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   In a series that can hinge on so many different people and
plays, whoever gets the better of that duel most likely moves his
team forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matchup that can go either way,'' Sprewell said after
he missed 8 of 12 shots and got to the free throw line only four
times in the 87-83 Knick loss. ``He has advantages and I have
advantages. Today, he was able to get off and play a pretty good
game for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn was short of unstoppable. But many of his 21 points
came at crucial moments, with the Knicks a possession or two away
from distancing themselves from the Heat. He made nine of nine free
throws, going hard to the basket through mounds of muscle when he
didn't have an open jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   And he played big. It's a basketball cliche. but with Mashburn
it is apropos. At 6 feet 8 inches and 241 pounds, he is 3 inches
taller and 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell. Physically, he is not a
small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Mashburn has made a habit of nullifying
his size and height advantages by playing smaller, taking fadeaway
jump shots instead of going straight up, settling for short runners
instead of strong layups. He literally shrank himself around the
basket, relying only on his natural finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he made a clutch 19-footer with 6 minutes left to tie
the game. He scored six straight points at the end of the third
quarter, punctuating the run with an incredibly difficult driving
layup that gave Miami an eight-point lead. He maneuvered his way
through the lane like a bumper car, hitting every Knick before
putting the shot high up on the glass with his body in a jack-knife
position.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes his new-found accuracy and aggressiveness to being
healthy after nursing so many nagging injuries in playoffs past.
But there is a mindset involved, too. He reads those monotonous
matchup graphics, in which one guy is ranked over the other, one
team favored to win the series in so many games.
</P>
<P>
   The three largest South Florida newspapers that cover the Heat
all picked New York in six games or less. In a series of weapons,
Sprewell over Mashburn was a cinch. But when you get beyond the
who-has-the-better-weapon-at-what-position game, Miami is in much
better shape than people realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a lot of hype going on,'' Marcus Camby
said afterward. ``People were saying we were going to sweep 'em or
we're going to handle them well. They forget they came back on us
when we had like a 20-point lead. We're so evenly matched.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may indeed come down to Sprewell-Mashburn, the
after-effects of their matchup reverberating throughout the series.
</P>
<P>
   With Hardaway relatively healthy and directing traffic, Mashburn
doesn't have to bring the ball up the court. He can do less
dribbling and more catching and shooting. And if Sprewell is not in
an offensive rhythm, Houston has to shoulder that much more of the
scoring burden.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Heat defended him differently than Toronto in the
first round, Sprewell candidly admitted how Miami double-teamed in
the low post every time he received the ball. ``Toronto didn't do
that until the third game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell reaffirmed how special he can be in the postseason
against Toronto, shutting down Vince Carter and shooting that
picturesque step-back jumper over the Raptor wunderkind to win Game
2 of the series. At the apex of the shot's release, you can see the
incredible focus in his form and on his face. Nothing in the world
meant more to him at that moment than making sure the ball went
through the net.
</P>
<P>
   He went up against a player as determined as himself Sunday, a
player no longer invisible when the game matters _ a small forward
who played larger than himself in Game 1.

ORIOLES' LOOK OF LOSERS TURNS TO RELIEF AGAINST RIVERA  

</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter knew the game was over. And he knew that
the Orioles knew it was over, too.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen that look on the faces of Yankees' opponents before
when they had to face the supreme closer, Mariano Rivera. The look
of losers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Rivera reflected later, ``This is a game, and things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to Rivera, who ended last season successfully converting 22
straight save opportunities and had saved a major league-leading 11
games this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles did the unthinkable at Yankee Stadium Sunday _
they swatted Rivera for three runs in the ninth inning and salvaged
the final game of their three-game series with a 7-6 victory. It
was Rivera's second blown save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles did not do it easily. Their 4-2 lead had disappeared
in the eighth inning when Scott Brosius tagged a grand slam off
Mike Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rivera came on for what is usually the opposition's final,
flailing at-bats. He gave up singles to Charles Johnson and Brady
Anderson, yielded a run on another soft single, to Delino
DeShields, to make it 6-5, and had runners on first and second with
one out. Rivera was not mowing them down. But to Jeter, the
Orioles' had that losers' look.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff then hit a problematic grounder to Wilson Delgado
at second base. Manager Joe Torre thought Delgado, who is filling
in for the injured Chuck Knoblauch, would throw to second to try to
get the force. Instead, Delgado told him later, he was concerned
that Anderson had passed him, and he wanted to make sure to get at
least the out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with runners on second and third, Albert Belle faced
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera got two strikes on him and the crowd of 52,559 was
standing for this confrontation, the Orioles' most dangerous big
hitter against baseball's best closer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle drilled a solid single to center that sent home two runs,
produced a 7-6 lead and heralded the end of the Yankees' six-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert had big power swings early in the count to go to two
strikes, then he cut down his swing to attack the ball well,''
Baltimore Manager Mike Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Belle, who declines to discuss much with the news media,
made two obscene gestures to a reporter who asked him for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was asked whether he has lost something this season, or
if this was merely a day in the life of a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm throwing exactly the same,'' he said. ``I know how I'm
doing out there, and I felt just as good as I did all of last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He will not think about the pitch that Belle hit or the other
three singles he gave up in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work if you think about it,'' Rivera said. ``It
makes no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And Torre, whose club has a 13-2 record in games decided by two
runs or less, said, ``I'll take my chances with Mariano coming in
with a one-run lead every night of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Orioles, Sidney Ponson looked good early _ no Yankee
reached base or hit a ball to the outfield the first three innings,
and he allowed only two runs in his six innings. Eventually, Mike
Timlin got the save.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore also heroics at the plate (home run) and in the field
(a diving stop to end an inning with runners in scoring position)
from 39-year-old Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the guys were thinking about the streak now that
it's over,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss like this,'' he said, ``leaves a bitter taste in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially, he did not have to add, when the Yankees knew they
had it won.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A VICTORY MAKES FOR HARGROVE  

</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees were obviously teasing the Orioles. All
nine batters in their lineup went down in their first swings
against Sidney Ponson, the Baltimore starting pitcher, then they
left the bases loaded in the sixth inning and squandered a leadoff
double in the fifth and a leadoff triple in the seventh. When the
Yankees took their turn at bat in the eighth inning, they had the
Orioles where they wanted them. The Orioles were winning, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   They had been there before. Only two days earlier the Orioles
led the Yankees by 8-5 after six innings, and by 10-8 after eight.
But they lost, 12-10. Bernie Williams hit a game-tying three-run
home run in the seventh inning; Jorge Posada cracked a game-winning
three-run home run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   So when Scott Brosius unleashed a grand slam in the eighth
inning Sunday, the Orioles knew the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're almost sick to your stomach,'' said Mike Hargrove, the
Orioles' manager, who had endured similar experiences as manager of
the Cleveland Indians. ``But it's not despair. It's a little bit of
anger that it's happened. You've got to have something to give you
a little bit of an edge, and usually anger will do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees have made a habit of winning close games
in the late innings, members of other teams try not to sit around,
when they have a lead, wondering when it will happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think about it until it starts happening to you,''
Hargrove said. ``Then you get a little shellshocked. Somebody claps
their hands and you jump four inches. You understand they've been
doing that. The Indians dropped a couple of fly balls to allow them
to win games, stuff like that. You're certainly aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no mistaking it when an opposing player or manager
sees it happening. ``You sure do get the feeling,'' Hargrove said.
``If I'm chewing gum, I just spit it out because I know I'm going
to bite my tongue or the side of my mouth because I'll chew it too
hard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the Brosius blast against Mike Trombley gave the Yankees a
6-4 lead, the Baltimore outfielders gathered together while the
team was making yet another pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just commented on how amazing it is they come up with such
clutch home runs,'' Brady Anderson said. ``It is amazing. You think
of Bernie's home run the other day, and Posada hit a home run when
we have the wheel play on, thinking he's going to bunt, and he hits
the ball 400 feet. They have an amazing team. They've proven
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Orioles talked, too, about how Mariano Rivera makes the
Yankees even more amazing, how after the Yankees snatch the
late-inning lead Rivera comes in and closes out the game, putting
another notch in the win-column belt.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, the Baltimore catcher, acknowledges that Rivera
has made it unlikely that teams will come back against him. ``He's
tough,'' Johnson said. ``He's probably the best closer in the game.
He showed over the years that once he gets the lead, he pretty much
comes in and shuts the door.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hargrove refused to ascribe supernatural qualities to
Rivera. ``You realize he isn't Superman, that he is vulnerable like
anybody else,'' the manager said. Sure enough, Rivera arrived at
the mound for the ninth inning wearing a pinstriped uniform, not
red-and-blue tights with cape.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, however, was also realistic. ``I don't think you ever
think today is the day you're going to get to him,'' he said. ``You
just take it an at-bat at a time and try to build something. Catch
a break along the way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson laid the foundation with a leadoff single to center
field. Mike Bordick hit a fly ball to deep center, but then came
the break Hargrove talked about. Anderson, as so many batters do
against Rivera, broke his bat _ ``In 12 pieces,'' he said _ but hit
the ball just out of Derek Jeter's reach for a single on which
Johnson scooted to third.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields followed with another single that drove in
Johnson, and after B.J. Surhoff moved the runners to second and
third with a groundout, Albert Belle rapped a single that brought
both home for a 7-6 lead and an eventual improbable victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've seen that happen to Rivera since
Cleveland did it to him in the '97 playoffs,'' said Hargrove, who
managed the Indians to a division series victory over the Yankees
after Sandy Alomar Jr. turned the series around with a home run
against Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, in the flush of victory, thought they could have
won two games in the series, if not all three. They were happy to
leave Yankee Stadium with one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very good club,'' Hargrove said. ``It's always
interesting and fun to play them.'' Everything about it is fun?
``The whole experience,'' he said, ``from the ride from the hotel
to the ride to the airport and everything in between. It's a great
city.''

PEGASUS' WIN LEAVES NUMEROUS QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A day after Fusaichi Pegasus made the Kentucky
Derby look easy, some were left to think of what might have been.
Others can afford to think cautiously of what is yet to come. And
others have just had enough of all this.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas remembered that he might be training Fusaichi
Pegasus right now if his clients would have been willing to bid
past $4 million when the colt sold as a yearling two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the auction with Coolmore Farm representative Demi
O'Byrne, Lukas said he looked over and saw whom he was bidding
against when the price went past $2 million. It was Japanese
venture capitalist Fusao Sekiguchi, a man for whom Lukas had once
trained some horses.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' skill in training racehorses may be] exceeded only by his
knowledge of someone's bank account, and he knew Sekiguchi
possessed many yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the horse,'' Lukas said. ``But when I saw who we were
bidding against, I nudged Demi and told him `We're in for a
dogfight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi owns him, Neil Drysdale trains him, and it's no slam
dunk that Fusaichi Pegasus will race in the Preakness Stakes _ the
next race in the Triple Crown, on May 20 in Baltimore. Drysdale
would only say it's possible, not probable, that Fusaichi Pegasus
would make the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only a matter of semantics, because Drysdale said
there's only one consideration that would keep him from sending
Fusaichi Pegasus to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if he doesn't bounce right back,'' Drysdale said. ``They
always look good the next couple of days \Rafter a race\S. It's
that third day when they resume training. He resumes training
Tuesday \Rtomorrow at Churchill\S. We have to see how he comes out
of the race. As you know, they're fragile animals.''
</P>
<P>
   If he goes, he won't have 18 other horses to contend with as] he
did in the Derby. A loose count on the Churchill Downs backside
yesterday produced a possible field of no more than 10 horses, if
that many. It could end up being the smallest Preakness field since
Spectacular Bid faced four others in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, who finish second by a non-threatening 1 1/2 lengths
in the Derby, is being aimed at the Belmont instead of the
Preakness by trainer Bobby Frankel. Todd Pletcher, who trains
third-place Impeachment, said that colt might try the Peter Pan
Stakes two weeks before the Belmont rather than the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Horses who might come out of the Derby and go to the Preakness
include fourth-place More Than Ready (if he doesn't go to the Met
Mile instead), eighth-place Captain Steve (provided a slight hoof
injury heals), 15th-place High Yield and 16th-place Hal's Hope
(provided two cuts on his legs heal).
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers could include Gotham Stakes winner Red Bullet (he
finished second, 4 1/2 lengths behind Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood
Memorial) and Snuck In (trained by Steve Asmussen).
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was upbeat even though the three horses he had in the
Derby (Exchange Rate, High Yield and Commendable) finished 12th,
15th and 17th. That's the worst Lukas has done with a
multiple-horse group in the Derby since he finished 10th, 13th and
``did not finish'' with On the Line, War and Capote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done well in the Preakness with horses that haven't done
well here,'' said Lukas, who won the Preakness with Tank's Prospect
after a seventh-place Derby finish in 1985 and with Tabasco Cat
after a sixth-place Derby finish in '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not watering down \RFusaichi Pegasus'\S performance,''
Lukas said. ``I'm just saying off of four races, you don't need to
bronze him yet. There's five grueling weeks left \Rin the Triple
Crown\S. We've all been there and we've seen what can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foolish to think the rest of the Triple Crown will be a
walkover. He will be tested again. You just don't run up the white
flag after the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Jenine Sahadi is doing. She trains The
Deputy, the 9-2 second choice in the Derby wagering, who finished
23 1/2 lengths back in 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scoped clean \Rin his breathing passage after the race\S,''
Sahadi said. ``He just didn't run. Chris \RMcCarron, The Deputy's
jockey\S said he never felt comfortable. I'm going to give him a
month to kick back.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most trainers with horses from the Derby, Sahadi would
rather watch than race against Fusaichi Pegasus.

THOUGH A BEAUTIFUL STADIUM, ENRON FIELD A NIGHTMARE FOR PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There is no truth to the rumor that the
Astros pitchers had to be dragged kicking and screaming onto the
team's charter plane from Los Angeles to Houston last night.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, though, did they go skipping and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Astros pitchers celebrated the end of a road trip.
That meant they could go back to the Astrodome, a pitcher's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Now they work in Enron Field, a pitcher's nightmare that,
because of its tiny dimensions down the foul lines and in the power
alleys, yields home runs in staggering amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we couldn't wait to get home,'' Astros pitcher Jose
Lima said. ``This year, we don't want to come home. It's just scary
when you see the ball going so fast and so far. I've never seen
anything like that. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being a dream home, the new ballpark has been a house
of horrors. The Astros won just three of their first 12 games at
Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros return home today for a seven-game homestand, trying
to figure out how to turn the haunted house into a home sweet home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 60-something games left in Enron Field, and we've
got to play a lot better there,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell
said. ``We've got to start to make that place a home-field
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been so far, mostly because Astros pitchers have
struggled at home. The staff had a 7.51 earned-run average in the
first 12 games at Enron. Opponents hit .309, and swatted 23 home
runs in 109 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Balls flew out of the park at a rate of 3.83 per game, compared
with 1.44 at the Astrodome last year and even surpassing the 3.74 a
game hit at high-altitude Coors Field in '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't making good pitches,'' Astros pitcher Chris Holt
said. ``It didn't matter what field we were playing on, we were
going to get beat. There's little adjustments they can make to the
field, grow the grass a little higher, things that could help us a
little bit. But when you're not making good pitches, which we
weren't doing, you're going to get beat. If you make good pitches,
it doesn't matter what park you're in, you'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   They showed what they're capable of on the 10-game road trip
that ended in LA yesterday, holding the opposition to four runs or
less seven times in the first nine games, including two shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the good pitching on this road trip means they can go
home with a little more confidence,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence could help the pitchers turn things around at Enron.
So could a couple of adjustments, both physical and one mental.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker suggested his staff emulate Cubs pitcher Jon Lieber, who
pitched a complete-game five-hitter and yielded just one earned run
in a 12-3 victory at Houston on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he did was throw hard pitches around the knees, sinkers
and sliders, and made us hit the ball on the ground,'' Dierker
said. ``We can do that just like he can. We haven't, but there is
the evidence it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt said the pitchers need to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can't do is get behind,'' he said. ``You've got
to get strike one there. You can't nibble on the corners, because
if they're not called, you're behind. At the Dome, you could lay
that cookie fastball in there and get a popup usually. At Enron,
you can't. Jam shots go out, and balls off the end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The mental adjustment involves the realization that Enron is not
the Astrodome. Pitchers need to forget about shutouts and low ERAs,
and concentrate on minimizing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't such an issue with us anymore, because we know the
way the stadium is,'' Lima said. ``It's a beautiful stadium, but
we've got a short porch. We have to say, `Go seven innings and give
up five runs, give your ballclub a chance to win.' ''

MORE TREES, LONGER HOLES TO PRESENT CHALLENGE AT NELSON CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ A birdie sanctuary on the front nine has been
eliminated. A forest-in-waiting has been planted on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder, then, that Loren Roberts feels a bit like a
ruler exiled from his kingdom as he ponders his title defense at
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic. Roberts will tee off in Thursday's
opening round at the Four Seasons Resort facing a TPC-Las Colinas
course that is home to 781 new trees, two enlarged greens, two new
tee boxes and several reconstructed bunkers since he set a
tournament scoring record (18-under-par, 262) there last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll certainly make things interesting. And different,''
Roberts said. ``I'm anxious to see how it affects play.''
</P>
<P>
   So are Nelson officials, who estimate the daily scoring average
for competitors could climb by anywhere from three-tenths of a
stroke to a full stroke per day on the TPC layout. The Cottonwood
Valley course, where golfers play one of their four rounds during
the tournament, has not changed since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The primary changes on the TPC course boil down to alterations
at six holes. Of those, the ones most likely to impact scoring
include new tee boxes that lengthen the sixth and 15th holes, a new
green at No. 12 and a major overhaul of No. 10. In addition,
strategic tree plantings at No. 1 and No. 16 make it imprudent for
some golfers to play from familiar divot locations.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious change is at No. 10, where the tee has been
moved roughly 50 yards to the left, forcing players to hit their
drives over a canal. Four additional fairway bunkers have been
added near the landing area, and the green has been expanded by
1,700 square feet. A pair of greenfront bunkers were also added,
which could make for some well-tucked hole locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get some pins there that these guys never dreamed of
before,'' said Scott Miller, golf course superintendent at the Four
Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not one of the holes Miller will be monitoring
closely in anticipation of a shift in scoring average from the 1999
Nelson. The major movement, in Miller's estimation, should occur at
a pair of par-4s that were lengthened by new tee boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth hole has been stretched by 50 yards, to 436. Instead
of pitching wedge approaches, most players now will hit 7-irons or
8-irons. Miller estimated that would translate to an increase of .2
or .3 from last year's scoring average of 3.957.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more interesting hole,'' said Paul Pulliam, Nelson
tournament vice chairman. ``It had been a slam dunk for the pros.
It was a birdie hole. But not any more. Now, it's got some
character.''
</P>
<P>
   But the alterations most likely to test a player's character _
and patience _ occurred at No. 15. Lengthened by 30 yards, the hole
is now the second-longest par-4 on the course. It plays at 475
yards, usually into a prevailing south wind. In addition, the 15th
fairway has been raised and 72 trees have been added, eliminating
an option of favoring the left side and allowing drives to roll
back to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, most of the balls funnel left there, instead of right,''
said Southlake resident and tour pro Brandt Jobe, who practices
regularly at the TPC course. ``I think that'll be the biggest
change for us. You need a bigger drive now, especially on windy
days. And it's got to be straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impact of the trees in the left rough, Jobe
chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'd never noticed the trees there before,'' Jobe
said. ``But now, if you hit it in the trees, you're dead. You've
got no shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional trees, combined with the likelihood of approach
shots with 3-irons, prompted Miller to predict the scoring average
would rise by at least a tenth of a stroke per day. That would
allow No. 15, the second-toughest hole in last year's Nelson
(4.216), to eclipse the par-4 14th (4.252) as the toughest hole on
the TPC layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it definitely will be,'' Pulliam said. ``You'll see
the pros hitting in more long irons instead of 7-, 8- or 9-irons.
That will make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the biggest change may be felt at No. 16, where 18
percent of the new trees (137 total) are concentrated. Most,
however, are saplings and will have little impact on play this
year. But there is one large live oak in the right rough,
approximately 310 yards from the tee box. It has no name but could
be dubbed the Tiger Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out there for the long hitters. If they lose it right,
they pay a penalty,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The only new tree that has been named is the ``Peggy Nelson
Tree,'' located in the right rough at No. 1. The live oak is 32
feet high, with a span of 25 feet. It sits 130 yards short of the
green, near the turn of the dogleg at the 385-yard par-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make them rethink their club selection. Most guys, if
they lose it right, now you're under a tree,'' Miller said. ``Your
choices now are to fly everything and go for the green, like Tiger
Woods, or to lay back with a 3-iron and hit a pitching wedge
\Rapproach\S.''
</P>
<P>
   One other alteration may impact scoring, in Miller's estimation.
The 12th green has been enlarged by 800 square feet, with more
swale added to the putting surface. The combination may result in
some trickier pin placements and more three-putts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Miller estimated the scoring average on the TPC layout
would increase by .3 to .4] per day because of the changes. Pulliam
offered a higher number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if it doesn't go up by a stroke this year,''
Pulliam said. ``As this course matures, it'll go up more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not as convinced. Art Barnes, a member of the Nelson
tournament committee, predicted players would make another run at
Roberts' scoring record unless blustery conditions prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind's not blowing, they'll tear it up,'' Barnes said.
``The new trees aren't really a factor for this year. They're not
tall enough. This is still a forgiving course. If you spray the
ball, you can't get in that much trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe agreed that the course changes, while aesthetically
pleasing, should not hamper the touring pros with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some problems if you wind up in the wrong
place, but I don't think it will change the scoring much,'' Jobe
said. ``Most of the changes are stuff you can adjust to in a
practice round or two. It's like anything else in golf. The guys
who are playing well will benefit. And it will hurt the guys who
are playing poorly.''

 &HT;    Jefferson, Hemings feud still lacking resolution
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ Thomas Jefferson's descendants concluded
their family reunion Sunday without deciding whether to acknowledge
kinship to Sally Hemings, Jefferson's alleged slave mistress.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a year that two dozen of Hemings' kin
left Charlottesville without an invitation to join the all-white
Monticello Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association's 700 members are entitled to burial in the
Monticello cemetery where Jefferson, the nation's third president,
is buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing that we can take back with us that has made a
difference,'' said Hemings descendant Shay Banks-Young of Columbus,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's meeting in the downtown Charlottesville Omni hotel
lacked the rancor of last year's, the first time Hemings' kin
attended the Jefferson family's reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several people who've been outspoken on both sides said
Sunday they're confident that the association is trying to resolve
a controversial question that has proved complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general terms, the issue is, how does the association
determine who is, or is not, a descendant of Thomas Jefferson?''
the association's president, James Truscott, told reporters. ``We
must be able to apply the criteria to anyone, not just Hemings
descendants.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some Jefferson relatives are skeptical of the
Hemings family's oral histories that link Hemings and Jefferson.
Those Jefferson relatives insist that Hemings' kin provide DNA or
some other substantial proof of their kinship to Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But if the association adopted DNA as a requirement, some of its
current members couldn't pass the test, Truscott said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because scientists are not able to trace DNA through a
female line. So those Jefferson relatives descended from his
daughters, Martha and Maria, could not prove a relationship by DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we have a complex task,'' said V.R. Shackleford,
chairman of the association's committee studying membership
requirements. ``We are deciding whether we can make a
recommendation that accounts for the unknowns and moves this
process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting did have some contentious moments revolving
around Jefferson's disputed paternity of Hemings' six children.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of a new organization, the Thomas Jefferson
Foundation, sharply questioned historians from the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation, which owns Monticello and serves as caretaker
of Jefferson's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after decades of silence on the questions, the
Memorial Foundation sided with the Hemings' claim of kinship. In
concluding that Jefferson was ``most likely'' the father of
Hemings' six children born at Monticello, the foundation embraced
1998 DNA evidence, written records about Jefferson's life at
Monticello, and the Hemings family's oral histories.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization said the Memorial Foundation overlooked
historical evidence that made a strong case against Jefferson's
paternity. It also noted that the only positive DNA test showed
that Thomas Jefferson could have been one of eight Jefferson males
to have fathered children by Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides made presentations Sunday. Over the next year, the
association's membership requirements committee hopes to prepare
recommendations for the association's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not certain, Truscott said, that the association will
vote next year on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hemings' relatives said they're taking the association at its
word to seek a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people seem to want to be fair, but they've got an angry
and vociferous element,'' said Dorothy Westerinen, 42, of Staten
Island, N.Y. She is descended from Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest
son.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hemings' descendant, Shay Banks-Young, of Columbus,
Ohio, said she is more interested in the right to be buried in the
Monticello cemetery, than to actually be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like saying I must sit at the back of the bus,''
Banks-Young said. ''I may like sitting at the back of the bus, but
don't tell me that's what I've got to do.''

   ``We have to assume if there is a shadow of a possibility
through the DNA and the oral histories that they are a part of our
family,'' said Jefferson descendant Isabella Gardner Coolidge of
Washington. ''And then we must welcome them with open as a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanita Balthazar-Boettcher, a descendant of Madison Hemings, one
of Sally's sons, said she believes a resolution of the paternity
dispute is at least five years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the finger pointing has to stop,'' said
Balthazar-Boettcher, 39, of Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is convinced by 1998 DNA evidence and her family's
oral history that she is descended from Jefferson and Hemings. She
and her husband, Rusty, named their 15-month-old son, Madison,
after Madison Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Someday Balthazar-Boettcher hopes to sprinkle the ashes of her
deceased grandmother, in the Monticello cemetery, where Jefferson
is buried.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ''I don't think that is as important as it being
known that there was more to Thomas Jefferson that has been
reported over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Andrews, the screenwriter and co-executive producer of the
recent CBS miniseries, ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' said
the tension between the Jeffersons and the Hemings is like that of
an interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parents of the white guy tell him it is OK to have her as
a friend, but you cannot bring her into the family,'' said Andrews,
who attended Sunday's meeting, as well as last year's.

   EDMONTON, Alberta _ With dolphins making arcs through an
artificial lagoon, submarines taking children on a ``deep sea
adventure,'' and golfers driving balls on the roof, the West
Edmonton Mall proclaims itself the world's largest shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, shoppers bored with the casino, the six night clubs,
the 40 restaurants, or the triple loop roller coaster will be able
to try a new diversion: blasting away at targets in the mall's new
pistol range, the Wild West Family Shooting Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it will be the first range in a family shopping
mall in North America,'' Ken Kupsch, the range owner, said as an
employee sorted empty brass cartridges at a sales counter.
</P>
<P>
   While Canada's central government tries to carry out the
strictest gun control legislation ever seen in North America,
western Canada is marching to a more laissez-faire beat on
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has had a handgun registration program for decades, and a
system of registering purchases of other guns for several years.
But under the new national law, each of Canada's estimated 3
million owners of long-barreled guns, including shotguns, is to
register with the federal government by the end of this year as a
gun owner and to apply for a license to own the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   The owner will also be required to register the gun itself, by
the end of 2002. But, 18 months after the licensing system opened,
licenses have been issued to only 150,000 people, about 5 percent
of the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next January, any Canadian found with a gun and without
a license would face penalties that go as high as 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In a country built on respect for authority, the majority of gun
owners seem to be taking a very un-Canadian path: civil
disobedience. One new group, the Law-abiding Unregistered Firearms
Association, already boasts 15,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting and shooting groups, many based in the West, are urging
their members to boycott the licensing program. They are waiting
for a decision by Canada's Supreme Court on a legal challenge filed
by a group of provinces led by Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been speculation that many of the gun owners who
have applied for licenses may be trying to sabotage the
computerized data base. Last fall, the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police complained that there were errors in 90 percent of license
applications and in 99 percent of gun registration applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``People opposed to it may be trying to sabotage it,'' said
Garry Breitkreuz, a Saskatchewan member of Parliament from the
Canadian Alliance, a conservative, Western-based party. ``They are
so far behind schedule they can't possibly register all the gun
owners they are required to by law.''
</P>
<P>
   With Alberta and other provinces refusing to have local law
enforcement officials register gun owners and their guns, the
federal government has hired or reassigned almost 1,500 employees
to carry out the program, which has cost $230 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say the government's financial commitment makes sense
only if the ultimate goal is the disarming of Canada,'' The Alberta
Report, a conservative publication edited here in the provincial
capital, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, reflecting the government's growing
desperation, the Canadian Firearms Center, the Justice Ministry
agency in charge of registration, treated 40 leaders of Canada's
largest hunting and shooting clubs to a free weekend at an Ontario
resort to try to persuade them to take part in the licensing
system. Breitkreuz said the club leaders refused to help out the
government as long as criminal penalties are attached to
noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobbying war, a famous American visitor, Charlton Heston,
president of National Rifle Association, outmaneuvered the
government last month. In a speech at the annual meeting of the
British Columbia Wildlife Federation, a hunting group, Heston said
that Canadians' surrender to gun controls started in 1934, when
handgun registration went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you gave in on handguns, then you compromised on long
guns, then came registration, next comes confiscation,'' he told a
packed ballroom decorated with deer, elk and sheep trophies. ``Can
this be the Canada of old, carved out of the wilderness by
independent men and women of uncommon valor?''
</P>
<P>
   As a warning to American gun owners, Heston said, his group has
started distributing a video about Canada's new gun laws. Heston's
foray into western Canada was roundly criticized by eastern
Canadian newspapers and by federal officials in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to regain the initiative, Justice Ministry officials
stressed their determination to meet the goal of universal gun
owner registration by the end of this year. Jean Valin, spokesman
for the Firearms Center, said, ``We are planning to get all of them
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as an investment in public safety,'' he
continued, crediting the computerized firearms databank for recent
crime fighting successes. ``Yesterday it was a smuggling ring, the
day before a wife beater.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittling down the numbers, he predicted that about one quarter
of Canadian gun owners will sell or destroy their guns rather than
take the trouble of applying for a license. Of the remaining 2.2
million, about 250,000 gun owners have applied for licenses, and
263,000 more have the older ``acquisition certificates'' that now
are valid as licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But, no matter how the numbers are shaved, if Canada is to
register even 1.7 million gun owners by the end of this year, it
will have to issue more owner licenses each month than have been
issued in all of the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Canadian gun owners seem to be ignoring the
appeals for registration made daily in government ads in western
newspapers: ``Don't Delay! Apply Now!''
</P>
<P>
   While a Gallup Poll taken last fall indicated that about three
quarters of Canadians supported the new gun control laws, support
in the prairie west dropped to about one half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody that is registering them,'' said Kupsch,
the gun range owner. ``I just won't register until I have to.''

 &HT;    11TH U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
 &HT;    Compiled by Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Jurisdiction: The court, headquartered in Atlanta, considers
thousands of appeals a year from U.S. District Courts in Georgia,
Alabama and Florida. The court's decisions can be appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Cases: A wide variety of cases are considered by the court.
These include appeals of criminal convictions and sentences. And
they include appeals involving civil lawsuits alleging sexual
harassment, job discrimination, antitrust violations, copyright
infringement and voting rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Caseload: The court is the nation's busiest and most efficient
in the numbers of cases considered. Each judge, on average, wrote
267 decisions last year.
</P>
<P>
   Judges: The court has 12 _ five from Florida, four from Georgia
and three from Alabama. The judges have lifetime tenure, and must
be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The
court has three women judges and one African-American judge. Seven
were nominated by a Republican president, five by a Democratic
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rulings: Panels made up of three judges decide most of the
cases. The full court can be asked to review a panel's ruling and,
in limited circumstances, the 12 judges sit as a whole to hear the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   History: Until 1981, the court was known as the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals and had jurisdiction from Texas to Georgia. But a
mounting caseload led Congress to split up that court and create
the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. Before the court was broken up, the
5th Circuit was noted for its landmark rulings in desegregation.

RANGERS' OUTFIELDERS GAINING EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ If the names of outfielders Chad Curtis and
Jason McDonald sound foreign in the Rangers' starting lineup, there
is one solution: Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   With starting left fielder Rusty Greer (left hamstring) and
starting right fielder Gabe Kapler (partially torn hip flexor) both
on the 15-day disabled list, Curtis starts in left field and
McDonald in right for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great to get the opportunity to help out the
team,'' McDonald said. ``I've been give the chance to do something;
hopefully, I'll make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald started his fourth consecutive game yesterday in a 7-6
loss to Oakland and hit his second home run of the season. He did,
however, hit into an inning-ending double play in the fourth inning
with the bases loaded and the Rangers trailing 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, with Oakland leading 7-6, he struck out
with Curtis on third base and Mike Lamb on first to end the inning.
He finished the day 1-for-4 with two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come through when they needed me,'' McDonald said.
``\ROakland reliever Doug Jones\S made some good pitches and got
me, but overall, I think I'm doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In Curtis' 14th consecutive start yesterday, he went 2-for-3
with a single, a double, and a walk. He is 25-for-83 in the past 21
games since taking over for Greer with 10 of his past 17 hits going
for extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier when you get in there every day,'' Curtis
said. ``It's nice to show what I am capable of doing, and
hopefully, the fans will get some confidence in me when I get in
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am good enough to play every day, and when Rusty
comes back that will be a big boost to our team. But I am a pretty
good player myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been looking for another outfielder, and last
week, Rangers general manager Doug Melvin asked about acquiring
Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Ron Gant and Los Angeles
outfielder Todd Hollingsworth. Neither deal materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is play the best I can,'' McDonald said. ``I
can't worry about if they get another outfielder or not. If they do
get another, I can't think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he's no longer seeking another outfielder and is
confident of the play of Curtis and McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to believe these guys can do just as good of job
as anybody who is out there,'' Melvin said.

DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR., 90, FILM STAR AND PRODUCER 
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a debonair actor, producer,
administrator, bon vivant and Anglo-American ambassador without
portfolio, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, 6 feet tall with dashing good looks, struggled to
carve a distinctive acting career in the shadow of his superstar
father, who was the unrivaled swashbuckler of silent films. The son
was not the gymnast that his father was, but he was a versatile
actor who easily played a wide variety of roles.
</P>
<P>
   He was a young lover (only 15) in ``Stella Dallas'' (1925), a
wastrel in ``A Woman of Affairs'' (1928), a heroic pilot in ``The
Dawn Patrol'' (1930), a suicidal romantic in ``Outward Bound''
(1930), a gigolo in ``Little Caesar'' (1931), an actor in ``Morning
Glory'' (1933) and a mad czar in ``Catherine the Great'' (1934).
</P>
<P>
   He refused most swashbuckling roles in his youth to avoid
comparisons with his father, but he was superb as a caddish rogue,
Rupert of Hentzau, in ``The Prisoner of Zenda.'' That 1937
performance led to a string of successes, including four 1938
comedies (``Joy of Living,'' ``The Rage of Paris,'' ``Having
Wonderful Time'' and ``The Young in Heart''); the action-adventure
classic ``Gunga Din'' (1939); an offbeat black comedy, ``Angels
Over Broadway'' (1940); and ``The Corsican Brothers'' (1941), in
which he played both title roles.
</P>
<P>
   As World War II approached, Fairbanks, an Anglophile, generated
controversy as an outspoken opponent of the America First
isolationists and as a fervent backer of a third term for President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. In early 1941, amid concern that the Axis
powers were subverting governments in Latin America, the president
sent him on an 11-week goodwill and intelligence mission to Brazil,
Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the war he served in the U.S. Navy in the Atlantic
and Mediterranean, rising from lieutenant (junior grade) to
commander and, after the war, to captain. His decorations included
the Silver Star, the British Distinguished Service Cross and the
French Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first American officer to command a British
flotilla of raiding craft during a commando operation in World War
II. He served under Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, who later
introduced him to his nephew, Prince Philip, the husband of Queen
Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks and his wife, Mary Lee, maintained a home in London,
where they became close friends of the royal family and of
government, social and cultural leaders. ``I prefer,'' he said in
1988, ``being a fly on the wall in the corridors of power.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly lent his prestige and administrative skills as a
volunteer for the United Nations and many organizations and
projects aiding refugees and other war victims. His contributions
won him many honors, including Knight Commander of the Order of the
British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks appeared in only a half dozen movies after the war _
``Sinbad the Sailor'' (1947), ``The Exile'' (1947), ``That Lady in
Ermine'' (1948), ``The Fighting O'Flynn'' (1949), ``State Secret''
(1950), `` Drake's Duck'' (1951) and, after a three-decade hiatus,
``Ghost Story'' (1981). He produced and was a co-writer of several
of those films and was also the executive producer and host of a
popular 1950s television anthology show, ``Douglas Fairbanks
Presents,'' filmed in Britain. He starred in about a quarter of the
117 half-hour episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Elton Fairbanks Jr. was born in Manhattan on Dec. 9,
1909, the only child of Douglas Fairbanks and the former Anna Beth
Sully. His parents were divorced when he was 9, and he lived with
his mother. During the next decade he saw his father only
occasionally, remarking in his 1988 autobiography, ``The Salad
Days,'' that in his youth his father showed him ``no real
affection.'' But in the early 1930s they became close friends.
</P>
<P>
   The young Fairbanks attended a string of expensive private
schools, most of them Episcopal, many of them military, in
Manhattan and the Los Angeles area, and he had private tutors for
two years while living in Paris and London. He said his father had
given his mother $500,000 in a divorce settlement, and she spent
nearly all of it within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse L. Lasky, seeking to exploit the Fairbanks name, sponsored
the son's acting debut at the age of 13, in the movie ``Stephen
Steps Out.'' The 1923 film failed, and young Douglas had to
struggle to earn a living, partly by writing silent-film titles,
partly by acting and doubling as a cameraman and prop mover, partly
by appearing occasionally on the Los Angeles stage in plays like
``Young Woodley'' and ``Saturday's Children.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was a teen-ager money was a continuous problem. From
the ages of 13 to 20, he wrote in his memoir, he was the main
breadwinner for six to 13 people, most of them in his mother's
family. His maternal grandfather, Daniel J. Sully, had been a
cotton financier but went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the young actor became a frequent guest at Pickfair,
the Hollywood estate owned by his father and his wife, Mary
Pickford, where the young Fairbanks began to mingle with many
prominent and soon-to-be prominent cultural and political figures.
He became a celebrity in his own right with his 1929 marriage to
Joan Crawford. Their separation and 1933 divorce gained even more
publicity than their courtship and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Fairbanks married Mary Lee Epling Hartford, a former
wife of the sportsman Huntington Hartford. The couple had three
daughters: Daphne, Victoria and Melissa. They had homes in Palm
Beach, Fla., and Manhattan as well as in London. Mary Fairbanks
died in 1988, and Fairbanks married Vera Shelton in 1991. She, his
three daughters, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren
survive.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s Fairbanks decided he preferred producing to
acting. ``Knight Errant,'' a 1955 biography by Brian Connell,
quoted him on the frustrations of acting: ``I began to be
embarrassed that the interpretation was really someone else's
creation. Realizing my own limitations, I became aware that I could
never be a creative actor. I would only be an interpretative one or
an imitator.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years he was also a chairman, director or consultant on
the boards of a wide range of companies, and kept offices in New
York and London. He also acted occasionally _ in tours of plays
like ``My Fair Lady'' and ``The Pleasure of His Company'' _ but his
proudest achievements were articles he wrote for magazines like
Esquire, Vanity Fair and McCall's. ``It is more satisfying to be
creative than to be a player,'' he said.

 &HT;    Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a man of many talents
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a star of stage,
screen and television, a friend to royalty, a real-life war hero
who spent many years in Palm Beach, died Sunday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks died from natural causes at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for
years, said his former personal assistant, Kay Hutchins of West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was a relative, friend or lover to some of the biggest
names in entertainment _ his father was the swashbuckling star of
silent film, Douglas Fairbanks Sr.; Joan Crawford at one time was
his wife; and Sir Laurence Olivier was a close friend. But Mr.
Fairbanks was a man of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in some 75 movies, served as consultant to
presidents, and earned a chestful of war decorations, including the
U.S. Silver Star for his service as a Naval commander in World War
II. And King George VI gave him an honorary knighthood in 1949.
``Always, always thoughtful and appreciative,'' said Hutchins, 81,
who worked with Fairbanks for 15 years through the '80s and early
'90s. ``Women and men liked him. Women, of course, threw themselves
at him.'' Longtime resident Herbert Swope, one of Fairbanks'
closest friends locally, said the actor's congeniality and charm
would captivate guests at the parties they frequently attended in
Palm Beach. Fairbanks did everything gracefully, whether it was
writing about his many romances with leading ladies like Marlene
Dietrich or answering a question he'd been asked a thousand times,
Swope said. Fairbanks was a frequent visitor to Palm Beach since
the 1930s and finally purchased his historic home, the Vicarage, in
1971. There he led a quiet life and maintained a low profile
devoting much time to charities. Fairbanks sold the pink lakefront
mansion in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of socialite Anna Beth Sully Fairbanks, daughter
of a cotton financier, and silent screen star Douglas Fairbanks
Sr., he was born Dec. 9, 1909. He attended schools in London, Paris
and the United States including Harvard Military School in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many movies Mr. Fairbanks made, he once told a reporter
he only liked a few.
</P>
<P>
   One time he said his most fulfilling roles were in such films as
``State Secret,'' ``The Exile,'' ``The Corsican Brothers,'' ``Gunga
Din,'' ``The Prisoner of Zenda,'' ``The Amateur Gentlemen,''
``Catherine The Great'' and ``The Dawn Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   He performed on stage in such productions as ``My Fair Lady,''
``Saturday's Children,'' ``The Pleasure of His Company,'' ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' ``The Secretary Bird'' and ``Present Laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like acting that much,'' he said in 1976. ``Actually,
in my lifetime, I've done only about a dozen things I've really
enjoyed and it was always in the area of writing or producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take all this celebrity stuff too seriously ... I'm
easily embarrassed,'' he said during a 1978 interview. ``I'm shy
about being the center of attention so I've developed an armor
against it _ a protective aura.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up surrounded by stardom in ``Pickfair,'' the Hollywood
mansion named in honor of his father and his stepmother, Mary
Pickford, the golden-haired silent film star.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy trying to succeed in an industry his father had
conquered in the days of silent films.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was one of those lucky people who began to be
successful the day he was born,'' Mr. Fairbanks said during a 1984
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks Jr. was a better actor than Fairbanks Sr., but not as
physically graceful. Blithe and debonair, he always seemed vaguely
English, even though he was American by birth and training. His
first real success came in the early years of sound, in the
back-to-back hits ``The Dawn Patrol'' and ``Little Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   After an early estrangement from his father _ the elder
Fairbanks felt his son to be unfairly capitalizing on his name _
the two men reconciled and became quite close long before Fairbanks
Sr.'s death in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The younger actor sought career advice from his father, which
led him to one of his greatest successes, Rupert of Hentzau in the
1937 version of ``The Prisoner of Zenda.'' Fairbanks Jr. was
doubtful about playing the part because of its comparatively small
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it,'' his father advised. ``It's the best part in the
script. Rin-Tin-Tin could play and make a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The years on either side of World War II were the peak of Mr.
Fairbanks' film career, with ``Gunga Din'' just before the war, and
``Sinbad the Sailor'' afterwards. He then started his own
production company, which resulted in very good pictures such as
``The Exile'' (for which Mr. Fairbanks wrote the screenplay) and
``The Fighting O'Flynn.''
</P>
<P>
   His last major movie was ``Mr. Drake's Duck'' in 1951 although
he was killed off in the first 20 minutes of ``Ghost Story,''
released in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Mr. Fairbanks lived many years in
England. In April 1939 he married Mary Lee Epling Hartford, former
wife of an heir to the A&AMP;P grocery chain fortune, whom he met at a
party at Swope's house.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks' first marriage, at age 19, to the late Joan
Crawford, ended in divorce after four years in 1933. When he was
just 20 years old, he appeared opposite Greta Garbo in ``A Woman of
Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioned lieutenant (j.g.) in the Naval Reserve in
1941 and proceeded through the ranks to full commander in the Navy
during World War II. He trained and led commando units, served on a
destroyer providing convoy escort in the North Atlantic, served on
minesweeper patrol and eventually was assigned to Admiral Lord
Louis Mountbatten's Combined Operations headquarters, at first in
planning, then in special weapons and camouflage sections.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks earned the British Distinguished Service Cross,
Crois de Guerre with Palm from France, the War Cross for Military
Valor (Italy), and an American Silver Star. The French commendation
said in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``With electric power gone, radio shot away, with German shells
continually straddling or near-missing his ships, he successfully
deployed the (naval) unit behind a smoke screen and emerged in a
new and tactfully superior position. Then he closed with the enemy
and, after an intense exchange of fire, both German ships were
sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks devised a plan to end the war with Japan that so
impressed President Franklin D. Roosevelt that he made an
appointment to talk it over. But Roosevelt died the day before the
scheduled conference and some of Mr. Fairbanks' superiors scotched
the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly the plan was to try, through secret neutral channels, to
influence the dowager Empress of Japan to intercede with Emperor
Hirohito to bring about a coup d'etat that would lead to an end of
the fighting. His father had had a close relationship with the
Japanese royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was the first U.S. naval officer ever assigned to lead
a crack British commando unit across the English Channel. King
George gave him an honorary knighthood for his work in connection
with Anglo-American affairs and also in recognition of his
chairmanship for a fund-raising committee that sent more than $150
million worth of food parcels and other goods to European countries
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Had Mr. Fairbanks been a British citizen, the honor would have
entitled him to be called ``Sir Douglas.'' He was well liked by
British royalty and for many years maintained a home in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 he was appointed chairman of American Relief for Korea
by the State Department, serving in that position until 1955.
Between 1948 and 1963 he was national vice president for the
American Association for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks also wrote two volumes of autobiography: ``Salad
Days'' and ``A Hell of a War.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fame, he didn't take himself or his movie career too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He had an impressive list of public service appointments and
associations including membership on the U.S. Military Delegation
to the SEATO Conference _ representing the Navy _ in London in
1971, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations Inc., and a
trustee of the Pacific War Memorial. He served as President
Roosevelt's envoy to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru and
Panama in 1940-41 and was a part-time consultant to President Harry
Truman on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Douglas Fairbanks Presents,'' which played two years each on
NBC and ABC, produced 160 half-hour television plays in the 1950s.
He acted in 50 of them. He also enjoyed collecting rare books,
letters and documents. His hobbies were photography and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fairbanks, who was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, never was nominated for an Oscar. But it didn't
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never got one, John Barrymore never got one, (Greta)
Garbo never got one and Charlie Chaplin didn't get one until two
years before he died,'' he said in March 1987 after mailing his
Academy Awards selections. ``So those of us who never have are in
very good company.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife of almost 50 years, Mary Lee Fairbanks, died in 1988.
Three years later, Fairbanks married his third wife, Vera Shelton
Fairbanks, a merchandiser for the Home Shopping Network. He is
survived by her and three daughters, Daphne, Victoria and Melissa,
as well as eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Shelton Fairbanks said Sunday that Mr. Fairbanks will be
buried next to his father in a Los Angeles cemetery. Memorial
service plans had not been finalized Sunday afternoon, but she said
the family would likely hold services in both New York and London.

COMMENTARY: OUT OF OUR WITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One great cultural divide in our nation's capital
is between the ostensibly off-the-record white-tie Gridiron dinner,
which has been roasting presidents for 115 years, and the
star-studded, made-for-TV affair of the White House Correspondents
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Gridiron, run by 60 of the Washington newspaper elite, is
steeped in a bipartisan tradition of good-humored satire; it
``singes but never burns.'' The much larger WHCA affair, which
properly includes electronic media, has been known to get out of
hand, not only in oratorical taste but in the hot-tickety
competition of its follow-up parties.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few singers are pros, the pencil fogies of the Gridiron
dress in outrageous costumes and put on an amateur-theatrical set
of skits and songs. (In this, my rookie year as a member, I
appeared in a bunny suit, grimly determined to demonstrate
good-sportsmanship.) The WHCA features instead a performance by a
celebrated emcee. At both dinners, the highlight is the response of
the main satiric target, who is frequently the president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where a difference in the cultural style of Washington
audiences illustrates the difference between political wit and
political humor.
</P>
<P>
   In olden times, roasted pols responded with witty speeches
replete with self-deprecating ``in'' jokes, often written by Liz
Carpenter or Paul Keyes, a Gridiron tradition continued this year
as Democrat Bob Strauss showed how political wit could sting
without overstepping. Sometimes an unexpected performance
substituted for wit: Nixon and Agnew plonked out a duet on the
piano, or Nancy Reagan stole the show with a song. This year, a
quintet of women Cabinet members, starring Janet Reno, stopped the
show with ``Thank Heaven for Grown-Up Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside-the-establishment stuff works because of the intimacy of
a live performance directly in front of a usually adversarial
audience. But broadcasting does not lend itself to
inside-the-brainwaves wit; as the physicist Werner Heisenberg
ncertainly theorized, the wide observation of the comic performance
changes the stimulus to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performances this year of Clinton and Gore. If you
watched TV last week _ from interviews with emcee Jay Leno to
televised excerpts released by the White House on news programs
everywhere _ you saw highlights of the undeniably boffo show put on
at the WHCA dinner by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stimulated sympathy for his pangs of departure with
well-produced outside stuff. His production culminated in a filmed
scene of an abandoned Clinton running after the campaigning first
lady's car, holding up a bag and shouting ``You forgot your
lunch!'' Thus did the White House effectively use the forum
provided by the convulsed press to show the general public that the
Clintons were adept at poking fun at themselves. The humor was
broad and professional, in the sure-fire style of Lucy and Desi.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast (and both are Democrats, so this is a nonpartisan
analysis), Gore at the Gridiron emulated a style perfected two
generations ago by John Kennedy at a memorable Al Smith memorial
dinner in New York. Hard to believe, but Gore, like JFK, played to
the people in the room with an unexpectedly light touch, using
lines attuned to his politically sensitive audience.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone present knew that Gore's greatest campaign
vulnerability is his denial of prior knowledge about illegal
fund-raising. Many in the audience were aware he had claimed to
have been out of the room when his aides were discussing this; he
had even suggested he may have been off to the john after drinking
a lot of iced tea. Few accept this.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore reportedly stepped to the lectern and asked for a glass
of iced tea. Small laugh. He took the glass and slowly drained it
all the way to the bottom, as the tittering grew. Then he carefully
returned the glass to the waiter and delivered the punch line: ``I
can't stay long.''
</P>
<P>
   That went over as nicely suggestive but clean, topically pointed
and disarmingly self-directed. Just as Clinton's ``You forgot your
lunch!'' was designed to elicit a belly laugh from a national
audience, Gore's ``I can't stay long'' was intended to induce a
grudgingly appreciative chuckle from an opinion-molding audience.
</P>
<P>
   One was broadcast humor, the other political wit. That's the
difference in responses at two press dinners that seem cultural
worlds apart.

 &HT;    For testers, it's how you play the game
 &HT;    By Jen Sansbury
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It doesn't take a genius to know when a game's not
worth playing, but if even geniuses can't make heads or tails of
it, it may be time to go back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 brainy types, members of American Mensa, spent most of
this weekend in Atlanta evaluating 40 new games.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no solemn chess match for the high IQ'ed. The
Mensans played games on boards, cards and computer chips. They
tried their hands at games with pegs, of plastic and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Mensa in Georgia, one of the largest regional groups in the
country, hosted Mind Games 2000. About half the testers came from
out of state to play games submitted by mid-sized and mom-and-pop
game companies competing for only five Mensa Select seals of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The judges say they attended because they love games and yearn
for a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have people to play,'' said Robyn Dixon, who drove five
hours from Tallahassee, Fla. ``They won't play with me because I
win.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the competition, the games had to have been
released on the market or significantly changed since March 1999.
The judges ranked each game on appearance, clarity of the
instructions, interest, originality and how much fun it was to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are stupid _ you can tell from the beginning _ or
too complex,'' said Joy Glucksman, an Atlanta attorney. ``It's not
going to be a 'game' if there's 20 pages of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel meeting room-turned-gameroom stayed open around the
clock for diehards like Amy Whinston of Portland, Ore., who played
until 6 a.m. one morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mensans said most of the other games also were good, but
could use better packaging, pieces or directions. Their comments
will be forwarded to the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them don't necessarily care if they win. They look at
it as a way to get feedback on their game,'' said Mark Witter,
marketing director for American Mensa, based in Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Trivial Pursuit received one of the first Mensa Select seals in
1990. Though all the winners may not have become household words
over the years, Witter said, some have met with solid success,
including Magic _ The Gathering, a fantasy card game, and Set, an
educational game.
</P>
<P>
   This year's top five picks were 3 Stones by Enginuity Games,
Finish Lines by Games for All Reasons, iMAgiNiff by Buffalo Games,
Time's Up by R&AMP;R Games and Zertz by Schmidt International.
</P>
<P>
   Like every year, there were a few duds. Dixon dismissed one game
that required players to use all five senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refused to play when it said 'smell someone else's dirty
laundry,''' she said.

TUA PACKS PINT-SIZED POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The best hope of bringing some life to a comatose
heavyweight division is a Western Samoan living in New Zealand who
says he wants to bring the championship back home to America.
</P>
<P>
   David Tua is a fight fan's fighter. He's built almost exactly
like Mike Tyson and fights like him. He seeks to end his bouts with
terrifying aggression and big punches rather than finesse.
</P>
<P>
   And he's almost always successful: He's 35-1, with 30 knockouts
and eight consecutive victories since he lost a controversial
decision to Ike Ibeabuchi in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tua, the IBF's No. 1 contender, believes Lennox Lewis will be
only another victim if the champion agrees to honor his mandatory
title defense later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-5, I'm 5-10. That's an advantage for me,'' Tua said
last week. ``Lewis for many years has looked good against taller
and bigger guys. All he's had to do is punch straight. With me,
he'll have to punch down. I'll slip punches, hit him in the body,
hit him in the chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He's tailor-made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua, 28, has the punch to take anyone out. Think Tyson, circa
1988, and you'll get an idea of this man's power. He also has Julio
Cesar Chavez-like ability to take a punch; it seems he can't be
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's somewhat lost against top competition if he can't
land the big punch. He was behind on points against David Izon,
Oleg Maskaev and Hasim Rahman before finally taking each out in the
12th, 11th and 10th rounds, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   He won those fights when it counted, which shouldn't be
downplayed. At the same time, each of these opponents - as well as
Ibeabuchi - outboxed him until he finally was able to land
meaningful blows late in each fight.
</P>
<P>
   A good, tough boxer is going to have a good chance against Tua
if he jabs, moves and throws enough power punches to keep Tua
honest.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis not only is good and tough, he's a (begin ital)very(end
ital) good boxer, he can take a punch and he has as much power as
Tua. Plus, in spite of Tua's take on the height difference, Lewis
is the much bigger man. He's seven inches taller than the
challenger and would outweigh him by about 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, Lewis would keep Tua at bay with his jab,
follow with perhaps the best right in the business and move, move,
move. He couldn't take Tua out with one punch, but an accumulation
of them could end the fight early or make for a one-sided decision.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, the division would be left with no one
deemed worthy enough to be Lewis' opponent. The champ's next
big-name opponent could be Tyson, who's given even less chance than
Tua of beating the big Briton.
</P>
<P>
   Tua's best chance - only chance? - against Lewis would be to
hurt him with one big punch and then quickly finish the job, which
would make him a major star with monumental earning power and
resuscitate the division.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants is a chance to make that happen. Lewis has agreed
to fight Francois Botha on July 15 in London. After that ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more I can say,'' he said. ``I just want to go
out there and knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Tua: Tua, who hasn't fought since he knocked out
journeyman Shane Sutcliffe in October, is expected to get back into
the ring in July.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent hasn't been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Tua-Tyson? A can't-miss thriller and pay-per-view gold mine
would be a Tua-Tyson matchup, which could take place as early as
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Again, they're the same size and both can fight only one way -
with abandon. If Tua fights and beats Lewis, Tua-Tyson would be a
(begin ital)huge(end ital) event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fight should be on Independence Day because it would be
fireworks,'' Tua said. ``It'd be an exciting fight, the fans
deserve to see that fight, the whole world deserves to see that
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both strong guys, one from a different era, one from the
present era, a must-see fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua and Tyson have the same promoter, America Presents.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed loyalties: Tua is from Western Samoa but lives in New
Zealand, as does his family.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has spent so much time in the United States since he
turned pro in 1992 that he feels an affinity for this country, or
so he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title belongs in the United States,'' he said. ``I
appreciate the way America has given me the opportunities to live
here and fight here. I want to thank America. I will bring the
title back to America.''
</P>
<P>
   How would the Samoans and Kiwis feel about that?
</P>
<P>
   More Lewis: Knowledgeable observers interpreted last week's
column as a knock on Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Lewis is a fine fighter and fine man. He has a
very unusual combination of size, ability and power. Certainly,
he's one of the best heavyweights of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Many have suggested he could rule the division for three, four
more years, and no one will be surprised if he does.
</P>
<P>
   The only criticism (or observation) is this: He's not as
compelling as some of his predecessors. No one clamors to see Lewis
fight because he has neither a brawling style - to which fans are
drawn - nor a magnetic personality.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he's very good but not terribly special.
</P>
<P>
   Much work ahead: Doctors Evander Holyfield and John Ruiz have a
lot of spinning to do if the public is to take their June 10 WBA
``title'' fight seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, universally recognized as the heavyweight champ, was
stripped of the belt because he chose to fight Michael Grant on
April 29 rather than Ruiz, the WBA's top contender.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and Holyfield, the No. 2 contender, will fight for the
vacant championship even though Holyfield has lost twice to Lewis
(once unofficially) and Ruiz was knocked out in 19 seconds by Tua
and has beaten no one of note.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's integrity took a hit when he lobbied to have Lewis
stripped of the title, then had the nerve to say ``everyone knows I
won'' in reference to his second bout with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Those associated with the fight have reached far in their
efforts to legitimize it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's manager, Norman Stone, pointed out that Lewis first
became champ when he picked up the WBC belt Riddick Bowe dumped
into a trash can, implying that that somehow diminishes his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is fighting the real heavyweight champion anyway,'' Stone
said.
</P>
<P>
   They're desperate and the public won't buy it. &QL;

 &HT;    Irwin shoots for another turnaround
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He has won three U.S. Opens and they comprise the
highlight reel of his professional life. Vast as his post-50
riches, nothing accomplished on the Senior Tour will ever compare.
</P>
<P>
   But say this about Hale Irwin's victory in the Nationwide
Championship last year at The Golf Club of Georgia. What the story
lacked in career impact, it made up for in closing drama. The
thrilling, 74-yard sand wedge shot at the par-5, 18th hole landed
on the front of the green, bounced twice and trickled into the cup
for an eagle, instantaneously winning the tournament for Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Observing it all after finishing at 8-under, Bob Murphy felt
like a man who had turned a corner and walked into a car door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done anything like that before,'' Irwin said. ``I
knocked in a long putt to get into a playoff in the (1990) U.S.
Open, but I've never holed a shot like that and then been handed a
trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever claimed it wasn't a strange or unpredictable game.
Odds on Irwin completing the tournament with such an exacting shot
a few days before bordered on laughable. The same Hale Irwin _
three-time U.S. Open champion and long-time Senior Tour dominator _
fiddled in the locker room with a new putter, searching for lost
magic. Positioned an unfamiliar 25th on the money list, Irwin
decided that after 16 victories in two years, it was simply a case
of, ``paying my dues a little bit now.'' Clearly, he was prepared
for a rough summer ride of watching newcomers Allen Doyle and Bruce
Fleisher dice him on the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bob Duval made the most foretelling comment
early in Nationwide week. ``Don't say anything,'' Duval warned when
asked the Irwin slump. ``You know what they say about sleeping
bears. Just let him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the wedge at 18 would provide a scary catalyst
for Irwin; he won four more times in the next seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the type shot I was struggling with,'' Irwin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the minute things that separate playing in the
middle of the pack from accepting a winner's check. Irwin decided
on a return to the original Titleist Professional, 90-compression
ball he had used during his 1997-98 tear prior to last year's
Nationwide. He said the old ball gave him a slightly different ball
flight. On Sunday afternoon, the trajectory became, well, two
bounces and into the cup on the 54th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little bit of a change was all I needed to make,'' said
Irwin, long regarded as one of golf's finest iron players. ``The
new ball seemed like it came off the club a little quicker and
produced a little different flight. The old one seemed like it
stayed on the club a little longer and I could get my old
trajectory. ... I've been playing it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   By season's end, Irwin was bothered by shoulder problems and
failed in a late run to catch Fleisher. But Irwin set a Senior Tour
record with at least $2 million in winnings and five victories for
a third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin returns to Atlanta this year hoping to find a similar
switch. Although fifth on the money list ($539,768) he has three
seconds and no victories. Each runner-up week has included at least
one penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been making one or two mistakes along the way that I
shouldn't,'' Irwin said. ``Ultimately, most of the mistakes you
make are mental. If you hit a ball in the water, generally you
shouldn't have been aiming so close in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golf Club of Georgia, with its undulating greens, can get a
player doing exactly that in an attempt to find the more puttable
areas. Irwin had done everything but win in the Nationwide,
finishing second in 1995,'97 and '98. A notable near-miss in 1995
ended with Irwin trying to launch a 3-wood to the 18th hole off a
slightly downhill lie and finding the pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a position golf course,'' Irwin said. ``The long hitter
has a distinct advantage, but you can't just step up and whale it.
The greens are not extraordinarily difficult to hit, but it's a
course fraught with potential disasters. You can play aggressive,
but you need to be prepared for a wild ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has been very active in his course design work and is
building a house in Phoenix. ``I feel fairly good, but I'm not on
top of my game, simply because I have so many other things swirling
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will play in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach next month two
weeks after turning 55, joining Jack Nicklaus as the only Senior
players in the competition. But he will attempt to prevent the
burnout that occurred late in 1998 and carried into the beginning
of 1999. In August, Irwin will prepare for the Senior Tour finish
with a fishing trip to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've never done before, but it's something I
need to do,'' he said. ``The machine still works, but the battery
runs down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Deep in the pit of a prized new venue that is decorated
in the happy color scheme of a Life Savers pack, a fretful Pat
Riley was as helpless a sight Sunday afternoon as he was a year ago
in the dank and gloomy air of the old Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, an anxious Riley was planted on the sideline,
waiting to see if Allan Houston would begin to summon the kind of
mental focus that can bend spoons, move pencils and throw his Heat
into a trance. So, Riley, his team and the screaming masses inside
American Airlines Arena seemed to be bracing themselves for the
moment when the serene shooter would make another playoff game go
``poof.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was an apparent malfunction in Houston's spell. A
missing ingredient in his potion. Instead of undoing the Heat,
Houston fell apart in the final five minutes of Game 1 Sunday.
Instead of calm, Houston exhibited uncharacteristic jitters as he
botched an open 3-pointer and turned the ball over three times in
the Knicks' 87-83 loss. Instead of deflating the Heat's hope of
growing from their past pains, he opened the way for them to take a
1-0 lead in this four-of-seven-game, second-round playoff series,
87-83.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's final misstep came when Dan Majerle _ the old guard
who was patrolling him the day he eliminated the Heat last year
with his destined runner _ stuck his jalopy-shaped body on Houston
at the top of the arc with five seconds left in the game. As
Houston moved to shoot, Majerle stripped the ball in mid-dribble
with 1.7 left on the clock. Any chance for a miracle was officially
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to be the guy with the ball in his hands at the
end of the game, I've got to get a shot up or make something
happen,'' said Houston, who finished with a team-high 21 points but
was eight for 18 from the field. ``In the past, I've usually done
that. I didn't do either today, and that's what's so disappointing.
We didn't do what we had to at the end to get this win.''
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning did exactly what his team needed. He did not
take pity on his mentor, Patrick Ewing. He did not think twice
about how Ewing spent his idle moments on the bench Sunday wrapped
in a heating pad for his tight back. He did not freeze at the
moment he had a late-game encounter with his boyhood hero.
</P>
<P>
   Calmly, Mourning slipped to a spot outside the paint. And with
Ewing laboring to reach him 17-feet from the basket, Mourning rose
off the floor and sent up a soft jumper that was nestled by the net
with 5.6 seconds on the clock. As it turned out, it was the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire Patrick's attitude and his determination,''
said Mourning, who led the Heat with 26 points and helped hold the
ailing but able Ewing to 17. ``That's one of the things I've
admired about him over the years, from watching him play at the age
of 12. A lot of him has rubbed off on me. He's the reason I
approach the game the way I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat approached this game with desperation. The Knicks
arrived with an air of arrogance that didn't wear well. It's as if
they thought the game would just come to them in the end _ because
it has so often. When it didn't, they grew impatient.
</P>
<P>
   During a fourth quarter filled with too many jump shots and not
enough drives, the entire team failed to keep their composure. In
the final five minutes of the game, the Knicks were 0 for 5 and
committed four turnovers. And not one of the Knicks who had haunted
the Heat in the past could avoid a trap door.
</P>
<P>
   A harried Chris Childs failed to crush the Heat by missing two
3-pointers in the final four minutes; and a wide-open Larry Johnson
wavered just enough when he unleashed a 3-pointer with 1 minutes 11
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him out there by himself,'' said Tim Hardaway, who
limped on his injured foot, left the game briefly to get retaped,
and finished with six points and seven assists. ``If he had hit
that one, we would have seen him doing his `L.J.' thing up and down
our court.''
</P>
<P>
   But with his team down by two points, Johnson missed the
go-ahead shot. But in some ways, the Heat created Johnson's miss by
playing aggressive defense most of the game. It was the kind of
hovering effort that left the Knicks to shoot just 42.3 percent
from the field, the kind that left Johnson shocked at how alone he
was at that point in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long, they were rotating to me,'' Johnson said. ``So,
I was a little surprised to see myself that wide open. Once I saw
that, I thought I rushed it. Got too excited. I've got to hit that.
I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks managed to tie the game with 55.6 seconds left
when Jamal Mashburn mindlessly fouled Latrell Sprewell. Finally,
Sprewell had a chance to make an impact. For most of the day, he
had been banged and bumped off his game by the bulky Mashburn. This
was not the more-compact, less-experienced Vince Carter. This was
harder. Without double teams to help him, Sprewell gave up 21
points to a steady Mashburn. Without a way to score around his
size, Sprewell ended up with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   But his last two were critical. Sprewell made his free throws,
tied the game at 83-83, but watched Houston commit 2 turnovers in
the span of 30 seconds. With his logic on the blink, Houston tried
to zip a pass to Ewing in the post, right beneath the chin of P.J.
Brown, who grabbed the steal with 28.3 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those passes where I would have really had
to thread a needle,'' Houston said. ``That's probably the single
play I wish I could have back. I don't care if Patrick was Jerry
Rice, that would have been a tough one to catch. As soon as threw
it, I wish I had it back.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of those moments during the game. The Knicks
wished the first quarter hadn't happened, when they failed to match
the Heat's intensity, and went on a 0-for-12 stretch over a
seven-minute period. They wished they hadn't fallen behind by eight
points twice in a third quarter that was only revived on the solo
intensity Charlie Ward showed as he drove to the hoop and dove on
the floor. On one move, he left Hardaway in pain as he planted his
bad foot to stop Ward's drive. On another, Ward crashed into
Mourning's right temple in a scramble for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman Trophy winner had a flashback,'' Mourning said.
``He went head-first into me. That's the way both coaches teach.
The football player he is, he shook it off. I had to gather myself
and get back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat did that all day. If the Knicks made a run, the Heat
regrouped. If the Knicks came up with a big play, the Heat returned
it with two. While the Knicks melted down in the fourth quarter
with five turnovers, the Heat didn't turn it over once.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept their composure,'' Houston said. ``That's something
we usually pride ourselves on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they do it right here, right in the pit of Riley's
turf.

COMMENTARY: ROOM TO LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you can get past the politics that keeps a sense
of impending doom hovering over the city's school system, you can
actually find some pockets of good news.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents would welcome an initiative that resulted in
improved test scores, more manageable classrooms, and heightened
morale among teachers and principals. That's what you're supposed
to get when you reduce class sizes. And, according to a new report
from the nonprofit Educational Priorities Panel, that's what's been
happening in some New York City schools in which classes in the
very early grades have been reduced to about 20 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the long knives are out for Harold Levy, the interim
chancellor. Yes, the needs of children are requently sacrificed to
the power cravings of ruthless politicians and mindless
bureaucrats. But as this report shows, there are also some modest
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial amounts of money from the state and federal
governments have been flowing into the school system to reduce
class sizes in some schools from kindergarten through third grade.
The Educational Priorities Panel did a survey of five schools where
the program has been under way for at least a year and compiled the
results in a report called ``Smaller is Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found:
</P>
<P>
   _ That students in the smaller classes tended to display a
greater enthusiasm for reading and appeared to be learning faster
than the year before, although it was too early to make definitive
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   _ That there was a noticeable decline in disciplinary problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ That parental involvement increased.
</P>
<P>
   _ That teacher morale increased and schools found it easier to
hire more qualified and experienced teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One might ask, ``What took so long?'' It seems obvious that even
the best teachers would be handicapped by the huge, unruly classes
that have plagued so many of the city's schools for so many years.
And there is now substantial research showing that reduced class
size is the most effective way to improve student performance,
especially in the very early grades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the help of $110 million in state and federal
money, about 950 smaller classes were established in the city's
schools, according to Leonie Haimson, a consultant to the EPP and
author of the report. But while there are smaller classes in 530 of
the city's 675 elementary schools, some of the schools were able to
reduce classes in only one or two grades.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that over all about 30 percent of the pupils in
kindergarten through third grade are now in smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the teachers and the principals love it.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Sherman, the principal at P.S. 139 in Brooklyn, told me last
week: ``It's working wonderfully. The children's needs are being
met individually. Teachers can really work one on one with the
children, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Our classes
are heterogeneously grouped _ you know, mixed abilities _ and
having a smaller class allows the teacher to address everybody's
different learning style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman was quoted in the report as saying: ``The first year I
got here, 48 percent of the first graders were meeting or exceeding
their grade level on the California Achievement Test. Last year it
was 69 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were easy it wouldn't be New York. While state and
federal money is coming in, and even more will be available next
year, so many of the city's schools are in such bad physical
condition, and there is so much overcrowding, that many schools are
unable to use the money to reduce the size of their classes.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that are too crowded to create new, smaller classes are,
in some cases, using ``floating teachers'' to provide additional
instruction to small groups of pupils in their regular classrooms.
This method is having mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned here is that, politics and fights over
financing aside, there no longer seems to be any question about the
important benefits of reducing class size, especially in the
earliest grades. Studies have shown that those benefits last for
years. The challenge in New York _ a huge one _ is to keep the
money flowing while rebuilding the physical plant to the point
where smaller classrooms are the norm.

CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON VOCAL LIBERAL INTELLECTUALS
</HEADLINE>
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's leaders are trying to rein in a growing and
increasingly assertive liberal intellectual movement, criticizing
prominent academics and authors in speeches, forbidding newspapers
from running their articles and punishing or shutting down
publishers who have brought out their work.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, unofficial and quasi-official outlets for
liberal political ideas have multiplied rapidly in China _ on the
Internet, in informal discussion groups, in magazines and books
that result from collaborations between independent editors and
state publishers. At a time of rapid economic and social change,
China's leaders clearly view this trend as a threat to their
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Western-leaning economics, President Jiang Zemin has
in the last year constantly reiterated the importance of standing
fast by Communist ideology in a China overrun with dot-com
start-ups. In the last few months, those admonitions have led to a
series of punitive actions against writers perceived as straying
too far in a liberal or reformist direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tense time,'' said a prominent professor, who like
others would speak only if not identified. ``President Jiang is
very unhappy with some things that friends have written. He wants
to undertake some ideological cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where economic reforms have spawned greater
pluralism in ideas and the means to express them, it is impossible
to mount a concerted old-style Communist Party campaign, academics
here say. But the scattershot attacks have been many and varied,
and do have short-term consequences, at least.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Guangdong province, Jiang himself directly
criticized a much-revered retired official of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, Li Shenzhi, for an Internet essay.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial offices of the Reform Publishing House in Beijing
have been shut down for bringing out ``The Secret Scriptures of
Officialdom,'' a book that obliquely describes the back-stabbing
and bribery required to attain public office.
</P>
<P>
   High-level officials have canceled the scheduled publication of
the second volume of the official ``History of the Chinese
Communist Party,'' covering 1949-82, saying the final draft was too
critical of the party's past errors. As a result, in part, Gong
Yuzhi, one of the book's chief editors, has retired as head of the
Central Party School.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at two lively, independent newspapers, Southern Weekend
and Shopping Guide, have been replaced. And editors at a popular
newspaper have been criticized for reporting that several employees
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency were disciplined for the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a year ago _ a fact not
reported in the state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Liu Juning, a political scientist who has written
about the need for political reform, was fired from his job at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and editors at the state-owned
Commercial Publishers had to write self-criticisms for publishing
his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that Jiang Zemin feels that the intellectual
community has become too brazen,'' said a newspaper commentator,
who also would not be identified. ``Everyone is aware of the spirit
of Jiang Zemin's speeches. And even if they don't agree, they know
if they don't act, they're putting themselves in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese liberals say the timing of the intense criticisms, after
years of stuttering but slowly expanding intellectual freedom, is
probably related to Communist Party politics.
</P>
<P>
   They say China's leaders are nervous about the liberalizing
forces that could be unleashed by China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization, as early as this year. They add that
Zemin's tenure as president and party leader will probably end in
the next few years and that he is trying to burnish his image to
maintain some role for himself in the future. That means turning
down the volume of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the campaign has had a clear dampening effect: China's
growing stable of liberal intellectuals _ in universities,
government research institutes, the media and publishing _ are
lying low. For instance, more than half a dozen people who last
year would have been happy to be quoted by name, refused to be
identified in this article.
</P>
<P>
   But most remain confident that the current tightening on
intellectual life will pass. And in the China of today, threats
from the central authorities have diminished influence. Bookstores
are still filled with provocative books. And people fired from
government institutes can now often find alternative employment in
the expanding private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can continue to do my work, but it will be more difficult,''
said Liu, the political scientist who was fired. ``Now, for
example, I think it will be very difficult to publish articles or
books in the major media. And, perhaps, students will not be able
to invite me to lecture at universities.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government's surprising face-off with Li _ by far the most
talked-about event in the crackdown _ shows both the government's
determination to curb liberal voices, and also how far some
essayists have gone.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time aide to Zhou Enlai, the late prime minister, Li had
been considered nearly untouchable, until he was berated by Jiang
in a speech this year to Communist Party cadres. The criticisms
were deleted from published versions of the lecture, Chinese
journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who is in his late '70s and will probably suffer no
immediate effects from Jiang's speech, has long issued muted
criticisms of the government, generally concerning the 1988
military suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen
Square. But his recent essay was considerably more explicit,
mocking last year's lavish celebration of 50 years of Communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler is dead, Stalin is dead; there can't be that many
countries left that strive for this vision of grandeur,'' he wrote.
``My own guess is perhaps only Kim Jong Il's Korea would embrace
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His essay was widely circulated in intellectual circles _ on
paper and by e-mail. It was ultimately posted on the Internet,
though not by Li himself, his friends say. That is when it came to
the attention of government officials.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although liberal academics say senior officials have also
directly criticized a few other longtime reformers, including the
economist Mao Yushi, the tightened policy has generally trickled
down by more circuitous routes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Jiang has insisted that all officials
rededicate themselves to Communist ideology through his ``Three
Stresses'' campaign (``Politics, Study, Probity''), and some have
clearly heeded the call.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, the central government's News and Publications
bureau called publishers to a conference just outside Beijing to
deliver Jiang's admonitions, specifically criticizing two
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   Although all publishing in China is theoretically owned and
controlled by the state, most publishers these days collaborate
with independent, for-profit book editors, generally by selling
them a government license to print a particular book. This
widespread practice, which started as a way to raise money for
cash-strapped state publishers, has opened up the industry to a
broad spectrum of politically sensitive topics, since the actual
editing is no longer done by government employees.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, state publishers were told that Jiang wanted
to curb the practice and were instructed to review all books they
had brought out since 1997 to see if they contained attacks on the
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, all of the publishers totally withdrew, without
exception,'' said an independent editor. ``Now they've started
coming back, but very slowly, and the book has to be totally secure
and unprovocative.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tightening has surprised many Chinese who had hoped that the
government would open publishing and generally relax security, once
the 50th anniversary celebrations were over last fall. And in a
throwback to old-style Communist campaigns, trouble for individuals
has often been heralded by an article in an obscure journal or a
letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's firing from the Academy of Social Sciences grew out of an
indignant letter from a graduate student at Beijing University who
had heard him speak. The letter, printed in Guangming Daily, a
party newspaper aimed at intellectuals, was addressed to the
academy and also to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as Chinese intellectuals bemoan the current climate,
they feel more inconvenienced than terrified by the government's
wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The methods are pretty much the same as in Deng Xiaoping's and
even Mao's time,'' the professor said. ``What's different is that
nobody pays attention anymore. The effect is very limited.
Intellectuals don't feel that much pressure. And ordinary people
don't pay much attention or sympathize with the authors.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the current effort would peter out within a
year because ``no one approves of this kind of criticism anymore.''
And the graduate student who caused the dismissal of Liu would
probably have trouble getting a university job in the future, he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And even as some authors complained that publishers had put
their books on hold, strong liberal voices were cropping up here
and there _ in some very unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   The current edition of ``Reading Room,'' a monthly journal
published under the auspices of the Hunan Province News and
Publication Bureau _ the provincial censorship organ _ features two
long, somewhat daring essays. One advocates more aggressive
economic reform. The second explores the often prickly relationship
between writers and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, winning and consolidating state power was the main
objective of all revolutionary work, and publishing, as a part of
it, was no exception,'' Li Xianzhi wrote in this second essay.
``The longstanding precepts of `class struggle' and `ideological
dictatorship' destroyed people's ideas of rule of law, that is,
their ideas of freedom.''

 &HT;    Phils knock wind out of Braves
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves should thank their record 15-game winning
streak. Without it, the injury-plagued team would be three games
under .500 and certainly no one would be talking about this being
Atlanta's best team ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lost 7-4 Sunday to the Philadelphia Phillies and got
a scare in the process as two more players were forced out of
action.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Terry Mulholland experienced trouble with his
breathing in the fourth inning and was removed after being rocked
for eight hits and five runs. He was taken to Piedmont Hospital as
a precautionary measure but is expected to rejoin the team today in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Quilvio Veras landed hard on his right wrist when
Doug Glanville upended him trying to break up a third-inning double
play. Veras struck out in the bottom of the inning, then was
replaced by Keith Lockhart. X-rays were negative and Veras hopes to
play against the Marlins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   After putting two players on the disabled list Friday and one
more Saturday, at least the Braves got some good injury news for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the Braves' streak is definitely missing, however.
After leaving 10 men on base Saturday in a 6-0 loss to Curt
Schilling and the Phillies, Atlanta stranded 11 on Sunday. The
Braves were 2-for-20 with runners in scoring position during the
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days, we just haven been able to get a hit
when we needed it,'' manager Bobby Cox. ``Things even up in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what we did the last couple of weeks wasn't going to
last all season,'' Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had a chance to make a dramatic rally in the ninth
inning, loading the bases with nobody out. But Atlanta could score
only one run, on a sacrifice fly by Jones to deep left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good pitch to hit, but just missed it,'' Jones said.
``I was looking for a fastball and I didn't adjust quite enough on
the slider.''
</P>
<P>
   The series loss was the Braves' first at home this season and
only the second in 19 series going back to last year.
</P>
<P>
   But discounting the 15-game winning streak, the Braves are only
6-9. They started the season 5-6 and are 1-3 since winning No. 15
last Tuesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who have the worst record in the National League,
came close to sweeping the Braves. Atlanta blew a four-run lead in
the ninth inning Friday, but Andruw Jones won the game with a
walk-off homer in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hit his eighth homer Sunday off Andy Ashby, but it came
with the bases empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big to get this series against the best team in the
National League,'' said Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, who tied
his career high with four hits, including a homer.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back losses were the first for the Braves since they
were swept by the Cubs in a three-game series at Chicago that ended
April 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are 14-4 at Turner Field, but just 7-5 on the road
going into their seven-game trip to Florida and Philadelphia, where
they will have to face Schilling again Friday..
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (4-1) will pitch for the Braves tonight. He is
trying to bounce back from a 6-4 loss at Los Angeles on Wednesday
that snapped the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these injuries are freaky,'' Chipper Jones. ``But we can't
get down about them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still put a good team out on the field,'' Cox said.
``I'm not alarmed about our team at all.''

CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON VOCAL LIBERAL INTELLECTUALS
</HEADLINE>
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's leaders are trying to rein in a growing and
increasingly assertive liberal intellectual movement, criticizing
prominent academics and authors in speeches, forbidding newspapers
from running their articles and punishing or shutting down
publishers who have brought out their work.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, unofficial and quasi-official outlets for
liberal political ideas have multiplied rapidly in China _ on the
Internet, in informal discussion groups, in magazines and books
that result from collaborations between independent editors and
state publishers. At a time of rapid economic and social change,
China's leaders clearly view this trend as a threat to their
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Western-leaning economics, President Jiang Zemin has
in the last year constantly reiterated the importance of standing
fast by Communist ideology in a China overrun with dot-com
start-ups. In the last few months, those admonitions have led to a
series of punitive actions against writers perceived as straying
too far in a liberal or reformist direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tense time,'' said a prominent professor, who like
others would speak only if not identified. ``President Jiang is
very unhappy with some things that friends have written. He wants
to undertake some ideological cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where economic reforms have spawned greater
pluralism in ideas and the means to express them, it is impossible
to mount a concerted old-style Communist Party campaign, academics
here say. But the scattershot attacks have been many and varied,
and do have short-term consequences, at least.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Guangdong province, Jiang himself directly
criticized a much-revered retired official of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, Li Shenzhi, for an Internet essay.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial offices of the Reform Publishing House in Beijing
have been shut down for bringing out ``The Secret Scriptures of
Officialdom,'' a book that obliquely describes the back-stabbing
and bribery required to attain public office.
</P>
<P>
   High-level officials have canceled the scheduled publication of
the second volume of the official ``History of the Chinese
Communist Party,'' covering 1949-82, saying the final draft was too
critical of the party's past errors. As a result, in part, Gong
Yuzhi, one of the book's chief editors, has retired as head of the
Central Party School.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at two lively, independent newspapers, Southern Weekend
and Shopping Guide, have been replaced. And editors at a popular
newspaper have been criticized for reporting that several employees
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency were disciplined for the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a year ago _ a fact not
reported in the state-controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Liu Juning, a political scientist who has written
about the need for political reform, was fired from his job at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and editors at the state-owned
Commercial Publishers had to write self-criticisms for publishing
his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that Jiang Zemin feels that the intellectual
community has become too brazen,'' said a newspaper commentator,
who also would not be identified. ``Everyone is aware of the spirit
of Jiang Zemin's speeches. And even if they don't agree, they know
if they don't act, they're putting themselves in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese liberals say the timing of the intense criticisms, after
years of stuttering but slowly expanding intellectual freedom, is
probably related to Communist Party politics.
</P>
<P>
   They say China's leaders are nervous about the liberalizing
forces that could be unleashed by China's expected entry into the
World Trade Organization, as early as this year. They add that
Zemin's tenure as president and party leader will probably end in
the next few years and that he is trying to burnish his image to
maintain some role for himself in the future. That means turning
down the volume of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the campaign has had a clear dampening effect: China's
growing stable of liberal intellectuals _ in universities,
government research institutes, the media and publishing _ are
lying low. For instance, more than half a dozen people who last
year would have been happy to be quoted by name, refused to be
identified in this article.
</P>
<P>
   But most remain confident that the current tightening on
intellectual life will pass. And in the China of today, threats
from the central authorities have diminished influence. Bookstores
are still filled with provocative books. And people fired from
government institutes can now often find alternative employment in
the expanding private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can continue to do my work, but it will be more difficult,''
said Liu, the political scientist who was fired. ``Now, for
example, I think it will be very difficult to publish articles or
books in the major media. And, perhaps, students will not be able
to invite me to lecture at universities.''
</P>
<P>

   The government's surprising face-off with Li _ by far the most
talked-about event in the crackdown _ shows both the government's

BESIEGED GOP CONGRESSMAN IN UTAH FACES RUNOFF IN RE-ELECTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ After all the chaos of the last two years, Rep.
Merrill Cook of Utah left the Republican state party convention
Saturday still unsure how the turbulent past might affect his quest
this year to win a third term in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A series of unpleasant incidents, including public temper
tantrums, staff disputes and a trial in which a jury determined he
owed a former campaign consultant almost $200,000, has made him one
of the country's most vulnerable House Republicans, in the view of
Democrats, who need a net gain of six seats to regain the majority
they lost six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And he might still be.
</P>
<P>
   Through two rounds of balloting that eliminated only one of two
challengers, he failed to win the 60 percent of delegate votes he
needed to secure the party nomination without a primary as he had
two years ago. Instead, he faces a June 27 runoff against Derek
Smith, an energetic political novice whose strong showing was
bolstered by support from a surprising source, another Utah
congressman, Rep. Christopher B. Cannon. It is widely known in Utah
that Cannon and Cook are not especially fond of each other. Cannon,
who lent the challenger some of his staff for the campaign,
nominated Smith at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   After a first round in which Cook won 45 percent of the vote to
31 percent for Smith, a business owner, and 23 percent for Jeff
Wright, a venture capitalist, Cook's margin narrowed in the second
round, with 53 percent to 46 percent for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon and Utah's other representative, James V. Hansen,
advanced straight to the general election. Cannon, who represents
eastern Utah, won 78 percent of the vote in a bid for a third term.
Hansen, who represents the western side, was unopposed in seeking
an 11th term.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pronounced himself satisfied with the outcome, insisting
that advancement to a primary, as opposed to elimination,
vindicated him and showed that delegates from his district, the
greater Salt Lake City area, appreciated his work in Washington, if
not his well-publicized troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not the unequivocal coronation he sought from
delegates who let no opportunity pass without reminding most
incumbents they should take nothing for granted, especially if they
have shown any moderate tendencies. Even though Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
surpassed the 60 percent to avoid a primary in his race for a fifth
term, he was greeted with a healthy mix of boos and jeers upon
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   So was Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, who is running for a third term
against three challengers and failed to reach 60 percent in any of
three ballots, putting him in a primary for the first time since
1992. He will face another political newcomer, Glen Davis, a
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconscionable, for all they have given to the party,''
Dan Jones, a Republican pollster and consultant, said of the
booing. ``I'm surprised. But it shows there is a real schism in the
Republican Party. The far right is alive and well. Moderates are
frustrated how to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah is one of the most Republican states in the country. Every
major office but one, state attorney general, is held by a
Republican, and that could change because Jan Graham, a Democrat,
is not seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But in Utah, there are Republicans and there are Republicans.
And when one makes an exception to unfettered gun ownership rights,
for example, as Leavitt did in pushing a measure that would have
prevented people from carrying concealed weapons into a church or
school _ it failed in the Legislature _ he loses support. For that,
many delegates opposed to Leavitt branded him ``a liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These conventions are the political version of hazing,''
Leavitt said. ``You have to expect it as a two-term incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
were no less charitable. They passed out literature accusing him of
being soft on gun rights by favoring a three-day waiting period for
background checks at weekend gun shows as part of last year's
juvenile justice legislation even though the National Rifle
Association, which opposes checks that take so long, has endorsed
him.
</P>
<P>
   In Cook's case, the concerns reflected not so much his record as
his controversies, which left him nervous and confused before the
voting. At a candidates' forum on Friday night, he conceded he
could win ``anywhere from 15 percent of the vote to 75 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Calmer after the balloting, he promised he was not disappointed
at all, even with the prospect of a contentious primary and charges
by Smith supporters that he was no longer electable. ``I always
felt this was the toughest part, the convention phase,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wins the primary, Cook will have his hands full with
his Democratic opponent, Jim Matheson, the son of a popular former
Utah governor, Scott M. Matheson, who was nominated Saturday at the
more serene Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also nominated Bill Orton, a former congressman,
to run for governor; Scott Howell, the state Senate minority
leader, to oppose Hatch; Kathleen McConkie Collinwood to oppose
Hansen; and Donald Dunn, a former White House staffer, to face
Cannon.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Sierra Leone edged back toward war on
Sunday as government and rebel forces fought each other in a town
not far from the capital, Freetown, and the U.N. force that was
supposed to keep peace between them sank deeper into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Panic spread through Freetown early Sunday after the U.N. force
mistakenly announced that rebels of the Revolutionary United Front
were advancing to the capital by using human shields and were less
than 15 miles from this seaside capital. Even after the United
Nations retracted its announcement in the predawn hours, the
streets of Freetown remained tense through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rifle-toting former soldiers who had fought against the
government and who should long have been disarmed, under the terms
of a peace accord that was reached nine months ago, roamed the
streets. Hundreds of them assembled at the national stadium after
their leader, Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the chief of a junta
that briefly controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, said on national
radio that no one had a monopoly on violence.
</P>
<P>
   A government helicopter gunship attacked the junction town of
Rogberri, about 25 miles east of here, as rebels were said to be
advancing from that direction, said Oluyemi Adeniji, the U.N.
special envoy to Sierra Leone, adding that his mission had learned
of the assault only after it had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The international force took reporters to the area Sunday to
show that it was not under rebel control, although many refugees
could be seen fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some violations on both sides,'' Adeniji said
at a news conference. ``So we are now picking up the pieces and
trying to put things back to the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting largely eclipsed diplomatic efforts to secure more
than 500 U.N. peacekeepers and civilians who were still being held
hostage by the rebels. Foday Sankoh, the leader of the rebellion,
still denied that his men were holding hostages, although Adeniji
said Sankoh had pledged to help the United Nations locate its
missing personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, announced
Sunday that it was sending warships and 700 to 800 troops to West
Africa to help citizens who might need to flee Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration is still pondering a
request to provide air transport for Bangladeshi soldiers slated to
join the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone and indicated that it expects
the British to take the lead in any international response to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to help,'' said a senior administration official.
``The directive we have is to be helpful and to respond
positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this small West African country's relative lack of
political significance, the success or failure of the United
Nations here will be closely watched in Africa. Perhaps more than
any other African country, Sierra Leone _ whose nine-year civil war
produced searing images of mutilated men, women and children _ came
to symbolize the West's post-Cold War indifference to Africa and
its conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   So if Sierra Leone was regarded as a recommitment of the
international community to peacekeeping in Africa, the mission so
far has proved to be an embarrassment for the Western governments,
including the Clinton administration, which supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the falling credibility of the international
peacekeeping effort, Adeniji said that ``people tend to exaggerate
mistakes and to minimize credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, the chief of peacekeeping for the United Nations,
left Sunday for Freetown to help broker the release of the hostages
and bolster the morale of the other peacekeepers, the U.N.
spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' latest humiliating setback took place with
the false announcement of an imminent invasion by the rebels, who
had frequently accused the peacekeeping mission of creating panic
by spreading false information.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. personnel and vehicles moved across town in the middle of
the night to western Freetown, as Philip Winslow, the spokesman for
the U.N. operations here, spoke live on CNN about the impending
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Adeniji, who is the United Nations' special envoy to Sierra
Leone, said that the mistake happened after ``taking reports
without proper verification.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake, however, seemed to increase the population's
skepticism about the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could not give us adequate information about what is
going on in the country, about security positions, then it is clear
to us that they are not competent to protect us,'' said Sahr
Kellie, 26, a university student who had come to the stadium. ``I
don't trust them anymore.''

</P>
<P>
   The departure of many foreigners also appeared to deepen many
Sierra Leoneans' anger at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ordered the departure Sunday of
nonemergency staff from the U.S. embassy here, and evacuated
Americans aboard helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Many nonessential U.N. personnel and workers for nongovernmental
organizations were evacuated over the weekend, and the departure of
many foreigners appeared to deepen many Sierra Leoneans' anger at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   James Roy, 42, said he had come to the stadium to show support
for the former soldiers, because he had lost faith in the United
Nations and feared that its mission here might fail, as other
missions by the international organization had failed elsewhere in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Sierra Leonean who has been suffering for nine years,''
he said. ``And your United Nations is not coming to do anything.
How could 300 men with all their ammunition, and all their
reputation, allow themselves to be disarmed like that?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened in Angola. The same thing happened in
Somalia. I don't want a repeat of that here.''
</P>
<P>
   The former soldiers at the stadium, one-time allies of the
Revolutionary United Front, fought against the government of
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. In a brutal assault on Freetown in
January 1999, the rebels and soldiers killed thousands of civilians
and chopped off the hands, arms and legs of hundreds. A
Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force prevented the fall of
Freetown at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from abroad, Kabbah signed a peace treaty with
the rebels last July. The treaty lifted a death penalty that had
been imposed on Sankoh and made the rebel leader a member of a
power-sharing government. Under the accord, the 45,000 estimated
combatants were supposed to have finished voluntarily disarming
last year. But the combatants, especially those belonging to
Sankoh's group, delayed doing so.
</P>
<P>
   According to official figures, half of the total are said to
have disarmed. But the real figure is probably lower. It is
impossible to know precisely how many fighters answer Sankoh's
orders, but it could be more than 10,000. The United Nations, whose
force was expected to reach a full strength of 11,000 by July, now
has 8,700 troops in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh blames the United Nations for the current crisis, saying
that its peacekeepers tried to force some of his men to disarm. But
officials with the peacekeeping force and U.S. officials say the
clashes appeared to have been well coordinated by Sankoh's group.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taking and killing of Kenyan peacekeepers occurred
at three different locations last week just as the Nigerian-led
West African force pulled out of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   It became increasingly clear that Sankoh, a man who would be
considered a war criminal in most countries, was not interested in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as his men delayed giving up their arms and
frantically mined diamonds in the Kono district, which they kept
off-limits to the United Nations, it was thought that Sankoh had
amassed a war chest for a future election or war.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, a former guerrilla and
longtime supporter of Sankoh, became president of his country by
refusing to disarm and thus frightening Liberians into voting for
him. Many believe that Sankoh is following that example.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force made slow progress as it saw its movements and
deployment blocked often by the rebels. Peacekeepers were disarmed
and robbed of their equipment by rebels in several instances.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last week, the rebels seemed to gain control over the
peacekeepers with surprising ease. Clearly embarrassed by the
situation, U.N. officials have been extremely reluctant to provide
full details of the incidents. At first they said they could not
explain the whereabouts of certain troops, simply saying that they
were no longer in contact with U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how many hostages there are and how many
peacekeepers have been killed. Until Sunday evening, U.N. officials
had been saying that 300 were being held hostage and that they had
lost contact with 200 Zambians.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday night, Adeniji, the special envoy,
was asked whether the 200 were now considered hostages. ``As long
as they've not been found, they've not returned, that's our
assumption,'' he said.

CLINTON SETS MEETING ON PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials and Democrats in Congress say
they have become concerned that negotiations on a bill to define
patients' rights have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has summoned 10 members of Congress to the
White House in an effort to galvanize talks on the issue, one of
his party's top legislative priorities this year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats do not accuse the Republicans of bad faith, but say
the negotiations have become enmeshed in a slow, frustrating
process that seems to be leading nowhere. Each party says the other
is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Senate and the House passed very different
versions of the legislation, which would for the first time
establish comprehensive federal standards for private health
insurance, especially health maintenance organizations and other
forms of managed care. For decades, insurance has been regulated
mainly by the states.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are widely viewed here as a major test of the
leadership abilities of Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the
House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   As assistant majority leader of the Senate, Nickles has
repeatedly shown his ability to round up Republican votes. But
never before has he faced such a public test of his ability to
forge compromises with Democrats on complex issues with immense
political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed at the pace of negotiations, Clinton invited
leading conferees from both parties to the meeting, tentatively set
for Thursday. Chris Jennings, the president's health policy
coordinator, said, ``We are very troubled by the delays.'' He said
Clinton would urge the conferees to ``roll up their sleeves and get
down to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nickles said: ``I don't think the talks have
stalled or bogged down, but they've moved back a little bit. We
keep trying to move forward, but there's been two steps back by the
Democrats. We closed some issues that the Democrats now say are
still open. I hope to accelerate the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expected to attend the meeting include Nickles, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and Donna Shalala,
the secretary of health, met last Wednesday with consumer
advocates, doctors, nurses and others who support the
administration's position. After the meeting, the consumer
advocates and health-care professionals complained that Republicans
were delaying the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said he did not appreciate the administration's efforts
to pressure the conferees by mobilizing its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful in keeping politics out of this for the
last three or four months,'' Nickles said. ``But the Podesta
meeting suggests that the administration is trying to politicize
the process. That's not helpful. This process would be very easy to
blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, just before the spring recess, House and Senate
negotiators said they had reached a tentative agreement on an
appeals procedure that would allow patients to obtain an
independent medical review of decisions by an HMO to deny care or
coverage. But lawmakers have been unable to translate that
conceptual agreement into legislative language.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kennedy said, the negotiators have not even begun to
discuss the two biggest issues: Should patients have a new federal
right to sue HMOs for injuries caused by substandard care? Should
the protections of federal law apply to all Americans with private
health insurance _ more than 160 million people _ or just to those
in certain types of health plans that are now exempt from state
regulation?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strongly prefers the House bill because it would cover
more people and make it easier to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic congressional aides have been meeting
several times a week to discuss compromises on other issues, like
access to emergency care and to medical specialists. But Democrats
said the negotiations had been hampered because they were not
allowed to keep copies of the legislative language proposed by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust between the parties appears to be growing. Democrats
said the Republicans were making a political calculation, trying to
decide whether public concern about HMOs was deep enough to require
congressional action this year. For their part, Republicans resent
the pressure from the White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joanne L. Hustead, director of public policy at the National
Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy group supporting
the House bill, said Republicans were ``dragging their feet.'' And
she added, ``I believe that the Senate leadership is not committed
to getting a bill enacted into law.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this view, Nickles said: ``That person doesn't know
what they're talking about. We've been pushing very hard to get a
bill that gives patients protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has often demanded that Congress pass ``a patients' bill
of rights,'' but lawmakers say he may inadvertently have shifted
public attention from that issue by giving more emphasis to another
goal: expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Crosby, executive director of the American Osteopathic
Association, said doctors strongly supported the legislation to
define patients' rights and make HMOs more accountable. But Crosby
said, ``Medicare drug benefits have taken away a lot of attention
from the patients' bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles has opposed any expansion of patients' right to sue,
saying the prospect of such lawsuits would lead to an increase in
premiums and could cause employers to drop coverage for their
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But his home state, Oklahoma, has just adopted a law making it
easier for patients to sue HMOs and other insurers for the
unreasonable denial of medical care. Under the law, a health plan
can be required to pay damages if it fails to exercise ``ordinary
care'' in treating patients.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the chief sponsor of the Oklahoma bill, state
Sen. Brad Henry, a Democrat, said: ``Senator Nickles is definitely
out of step with the public here in Oklahoma. Polling information
shows that 72 percent of Oklahomans support giving a patient the
right to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma measure, approved 94-5 in the state House of
Representatives and 44-2 in the state Senate, was signed by Gov.
Frank Keating on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents HMOs, said: ``Just prior to the
congressional recess, members of the conference committee seemed to
be making significant progress. But things are slowing down. I'm
baffled how things could have changed so much in three short
weeks.''

POLITICAL MEMO: NUMBERS SUGGEST A BREAK IN THE PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The latest numbers offered a stunning
contradiction: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 30
years, and two major national polls showing Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   To put that contrast in perspective, the last time a president's
party lost the White House in good times was 1920. And even then,
the country was recovering from the double-digit inflation of World
War I.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't the booming economy blowing Bush away? Have the
rules changed?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economy has stayed strong so long that most people
are not worrying about it. Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster,
said, ``It doesn't sit there as a major worry that people talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster who collaborates with Hart
on the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, said one reason for Bush
support among older people was that ``only about 6 percent of the
old people have economic worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Gore does not get credit for the way things are. Polls
show the public gives it to President Clinton and Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   That may be reasonable enough, but Gore's own weakness as a
candidate compounds that problem. After all, Gore is campaigning on
a promise to keep the same economic policies Clinton has followed,
while Bush's central campaign message is that he wants a very big
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBC/Journal poll showed that only 27 percent of voters
thought Gore was very likely or fairly likely to pursue policies
that would keep the economy strong, compared to 32 percent who said
that of Bush. (Both of them enjoyed less credence than they did in
December, when 36 percent had confidence in Gore and 43 percent in
Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/Journal poll had Bush ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent. A
Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today had the Bush lead at 49 to 44.
Both polls were taken the last weekend of April, and the margin of
sampling error for NBC/Journal survey was plus or minus 3
percentage points, one less than for the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has simply not capitalized on winning his party's
nomination more easily than Bush won his or achieving quickly the
party unity and support from Bill Bradley that Bush is still
seeking from Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Teeter said the data in the NBC/Journal poll explained it.
``Gore is not a very good candidate,'' he said. ``He is not a very
likable candidate.'' Teeter argued that Gore's frequent attacks on
Bush ran the risk ``of looking like the guy who is out of his
time,'' out of step with an optimistic country.
</P>
<P>
   Though Teeter agreed that a strong economy was a major factor in
retaining a president or his party, he said the most ``likable''
candidate had won most postwar elections. The clearest exception
was 1968, when a losing war, civic turmoil and rising inflation
helped Richard M. Nixon edge out Hubert H. Humphrey. In 1976,
Teeter said, both Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford seemed
likable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are early days. When the nomination contests ended
in March, public interest in the campaign plummeted, and surveys by
the Vanishing Voter project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University show that
knowledge about the candidates has also declined.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Gore message in the summer and
fall will emphasize continuity and accuse Bush of risking
prosperity for a needless tax cut. Comparisons with the last
Republican administration are inevitable, but will have special
bite because the phrase ``Bush recession'' will surely be used.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, while conceding Gore's weak standing, cited a focus group
he conducted last Tuesday in a Philadelphia suburb as offering hope
for Gore. Everyone in the group of 12, whether he or she favored
Bush or Gore, ``wanted the same policies,'' he said. ``They didn't
want to tinker with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is sitting on a gusher,'' Hart said, if he can find a
way to identify himself with the voters' desire for continuity.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that it is not too late for Gore comes from a
New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in May 1988. That was the last
time a vice president ran to succeed a popular president in an
economic boom. Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts led Vice
President George Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent. It didn't last.

DRYSDALE SAYS PREAKNESS   ONLY `POSSIBLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Immediately after Saturday's Kentucky Derby,
in which Fusaichi Pegasus waltzed to the first victory by a betting
favorite in 21 years, it was hard to imagine anything keeping the
brilliantly athletic colt from the first Triple Crown sweep in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday morning a spoiler emerged. It's Neil Drysdale,
Fusaichi Pegasus' trainer, who suggested the Japanese-owned horse
is only a ``possible'' entrant in the May 20 Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this was just Drysdale playing semantic games with the
press as he did throughout Derby week. Or maybe it must be taken
seriously - the English-born Hall of Famer is legendary for
refusing to race any horse who's less than 100 percent healthy and
in form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to just see how he is the next few days,'' Drysdale
said at the Churchill Downs barn where Fusaichi Pegasus awoke,
alert and apparently healthy, as the most respected Derby winner in
at least a decade. ``He's fine at this very minute in time, but all
he's done is go for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always look good the first couple of days (after a race).
It's the third or fourth days you've got to be careful of, when you
start training them again. It was hot (Saturday), and we'll have to
see what that took out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said his tentative plans call for Fusaichi Pegasus to
remain at Churchill Downs before flying to Baltimore the Wednesday
before the Preakness. The trainer intends to go first to inspect
the track surface.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers of most of the 18 horses Fusaichi Pegasus and
jockey Kent Desormeaux defeated in the 1-mile Derby were proceeding
on the assumption he will go on to the 1 3/16-mile Preakness. It
appeared as few as three would challenge him at Pimlico Race
Course.
</P>
<P>
   The three are Captain Steve (eighth), High Yield (15th) and
Hal's Hope (16th). Throw in non-Derby horses Red Bullet (second to
Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial) and Snuck In (second in the
Arkansas Derby), and you have a Preakness field of six. That would
be the smallest since 1979, the year Spectacular Bid, the last
winning Derby favorite, beat four in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Derby horses' trainers said they would consider the
Preakness. Ruled out were Aptitude (second in the Derby, waiting
for the June 10 Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown),
The Deputy (14th, heading back to California for a rest) and Anees
(13th).
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil did a great job with this horse,'' said John Kimmel,
trainer of fifth-place Wheelaway, who's likely to wait for the
Belmont. ``He really didn't train him that hard. It just shows how
much talent (Fusaichi Pegasus) has. (Now) he comes out of it as a
pretty fresh horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenine Sahadi, trainer of The Deputy, rated Fusaichi Pegasus a
stronger Triple Crown candidate than Silver Charm, Real Quiet and
Charismatic, the past three Kentucky Derby winners, each of whom
came within a Belmont victory of being the first to sweep the
classics since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's raw talent and he just keeps getting better,''
Sahadi said of the one-time $4 million yearling.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying from 15th to win by 1 lengths with seeming ease, the
Japanese-owned, Hollywood Park-based son of Mr. Prospector recorded
his fifth consecutive victory, rewarded his backers in the crowd of
153,204 with a 2-1 payoff, and changed almost everybody else's
minds.
</P>
<P>
   He was cooler and better behaved than expected, bucking once
during the walk from the barns; Drysdale said Fusaichi Pegasus was
bothered by flies and then by his fly net. He proved more nimble
than a big horse should be as he picked his way through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Shaquille O'Neal, able to make the spin move,
despite being 1,200 pounds,'' Desormeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   He impressed even High Yield trainer D. Wayne Lukas, the
four-time Derby winner who had sounded skeptical, comparing
Fusaichi Pegasus to 1992 Derby flop Arazi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not watering down the performance. It was brilliant, it
was best on the day, it was everything everybody hyped it to be,''
Lukas said Sunday. ``I'm just saying you can't run up the white
flag. He's going to be tested. ... We've got to just keep going
over there (and challenging him).''
</P>
<P>
   But will he be there when they do?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The nightly news is often full of stories about
violence and racial strife across the world and around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for the last five years, Jacqueline Sowell has loved
to wake up in the morning, put on her uniform and go to work as a
waitress in the coffee shop at the Holiday Bowl, a faded bowling
alley on a faded street in the faded Crenshaw district west of
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the Bowl renewed her faith. It showed her day after
day just how well people of diverse backgrounds and races can get
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a United Nations in there,'' she said the other day.
``Our employees are Hispanic, white, black, Japanese, Thai,
Filipino. I've served grits to as many Japanese customers as I do
black. We've learned from each other and given to each other. It's
much more than just a bowling alley. It's a community resource.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday, after 42 years of strikes,
spares and brotherhood, in Sowell's words, the Holiday Bowl was
closed. The building is being sold. According to the property
owner, Marshall Siskin, the bowling alley has been losing money for
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all things,'' Siskin said, ``it's reached a point where
it has to change.'' Maybe so, but not without a fight, Sowell said.
A few hours after the last balls thundered down the lanes, a group
of her neighbors, co-workers and friends were standing outside,
holding signs, declaring the Bowl ``A Landmark of Diversity'' and
urging the new owners and the city to ``Preserve Not Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing everything I can to save it,'' said Sowell, who is
40 and grew up in the neighborhood. ``I learned how to use
chopsticks in the coffee shop. We're trying to get a loan to make
it a worker-owned business.''
</P>
<P>
   The design of the building, with its sloped roof, plate glass
windows and orange and white facade, is another reason the Bowl
should be saved, said John English, a volunteer with the Los
Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit preservation group, which is
working with Sowell. English said the Bowl is an example of
``Googie'' _ a 1950's architectural style regarded as being born in
California. Sowell, English and their allies hope they can persuade
the city's Cultural Heritage Commission of the Bowl's significance
and make it harder for it to be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone admits the real significance of the Holiday Bowl is
not the bricks, but the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find at the Holiday Bowl,'' English said, ``is what's
best about Los Angeles, this incredible mix of people. You have
something that you can't just tear down and re-create somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl was built in 1958 by a group of Japanese-American
businessmen when the Crenshaw district was heavily Japanese. But
there were also blacks and Latinos, and the neighborhood, in those
days, was one of the most diverse in the city. The Bowl quickly
became a neighborhood landmark. ``Meet me at the Bowl,'' echoed
across the playgrounds and shops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as scores of other businesses and buildings were being
burned to the ground during the riots after the acquittal of Los
Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney
King, a group of regulars stood outside and told looters that the
Bowl was ``our place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only building around here,'' Sowell said, ``that
withstood the riots without so much as a broken window.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night it was time to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Nakamoto, 56, who was born in a Japanese-American internment
camp, had been going to the Bowl for 36 years. ``Everybody comes
through here eventually,'' Nakamoto said. ``The other day, a guy I
hadn't seen since high school came through. It's like one big happy
family. A lot of blacks and Asians have been bowling together for
40 years. The only color I see is on a bowling ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nakamoto talked, stroking his white beard, Barbara
Fisher-Shaw, an African-American who has bowled there for 12 years,
walked up and threw her arms around him and told him not to give
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fight on our hands,'' she said. ``But we're going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on a wall, was a list of the people who have bowled a
perfect score. The names reflect the diversity that has been at the
heart of the Bowl: Deguchi, Crist, Marshall, Washington, Smith,
Lee, and Furukawa.
</P>
<P>
   George Furukawa was the third person to bowl 300 at the Holiday
Bowl. ``I was one of the first people to come here, and now it
looks like I'm going to be one of the last,'' Furukawa said on
Friday night, sipping a beer at the bar crowded with old friends,
all of them with one eye on a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game
and one eye on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Furukawa is 83 and has not bowled since 1986 when a mugger's
bullet shattered his leg. But he still lives in the neighborhood,
and until last weekend he went to the Bowl ``every day unless I was
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, people began to cry and hug each other.
The ``Friday Five'' bowling league was still on the lanes. ``This
is where I grew up,'' said the league's secretary, Stacee Fujii,
33. ``I started when I was 8. My whole family bowled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As racial as everybody is these days,'' she continued, ``this
place is very integrated. To see it close, it's very emotional.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, a man with an
intimate knowledge of war, there is a clear logic to his new
assignment to persuade the Senate to reconsider a treaty ending
underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   As a Polish child fleeing the Red Army in Warsaw in 1944, a
teen-age refugee in Berlin, a young Army major in Vietnam, the
supreme commander of NATO forces in the early years of the Bosnian
war and then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the retired
Army general has seen war from nearly every possible vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``War has never been something theoretical for me or my
family,'' said Shalikashvili, who commutes here from his retirement
home on Puget Sound to act as the president's special adviser on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the Senate rejected last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He even survived the stomach-dropping experience of discovering
that his family's war experience was darker than he had realized.
In 1993, while he awaited Senate confirmation for the top military
job, historical documents were uncovered showing that his deceased
father, Dmitri Shalikashvili, had served in a German army unit
commanded by the Waffen SS.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was a kind and gentle man, and I loved him very
much,'' the general told the Senate panel on the day of his
confirmation hearing. ``I'm deeply saddened that my father had this
tragic association.''
</P>
<P>
   A military man to the core, the general does not speak easily of
things personal. When he retired as chairman in 1997, he and his
wife moved to Steilacoom, Wash., south of Seattle, to a home with a
clear view of the Olympic Mountains, and most important, close to
their grown son, Brant, their only child.
</P>
<P>
   In his spartan office on the fifth floor of the State
Department, he talks, instead, of the American soldiers he wants
protected not only by state-of-the-art weapons and fighter jets,
but by arms control as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a combination of making sure we have the means of
protecting ourselves with weapons and by diminishing the number of
weapons out there that our soldiers have to confront,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how his childhood, his Central European roots as well
as his move to Peoria, Ill., at age 16, affect his support for arms
control, he ducks the question with the gentle command: ``Don't
make me sound schmaltzy.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters, he said, are his years as an officer and commander
who actually had to prepare defenses against weapons of mass
destruction and how he became convinced ``that we will be much
better off with the test ban treaty than without it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the chairman through most of the negotiations,'' he
explained. ``I undertook a separate, independent investigation,
including careful discussions with laboratory directors. And I
recommended to the president in 1996 that he should sign the
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the general noted, the military has supported the
treaty banning underground nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   That seal of approval, though, was not enough to sway the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, by a vote of 51-48, the Senate rejected the treaty
that had taken decades to negotiate with over 100 nations and was
viewed as the single most important measure for halting the
proliferation of nuclear weapons. If renegade countries like North
Korea and Iran continued testing, the senators reasoned, then the
United States also had to be able to test its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was denounced from Berlin to Singapore for its
``arrogant'' defeat of that treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Now several conservative senators are going one better and
trying to pull out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to get entangled in that debate,'' the general
said, ``but you can't talk in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the middle of the most heated arms control debate in
recent memory, one tied to whether the United States will build a
national missile defense system, the general is taking a soft-sell
approach.
</P>
<P>
   He meets with senators in private, away from the limelight, to
fulfill his mandate to persuade the Senate to approve the treaty
sometime in the next administration, not in President Clinton's
final months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way people don't feel the same pressures of time or
politics,'' he said. ``I tell them this is too important a treaty
to be left languishing on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month into his job, the general has talked to a dozen
senators. While he will not discuss these private conversations, he
said he had figured out the nature of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are senators who don't feel comfortable with any arms
control treaties and there are others who don't like this
particular treaty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing this new battlefield seems oddly familiar to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel much different from when I was chairman of the
Joint Chiefs,'' he said. ``I had to go to the Senate for the
budget, and for Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq and the Chemical
Weapons Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject matter _ the hard-nosed details of verification of
nuclear stockpiles as well as the nuanced diplomatic consequences
of trying to renegotiate the treaty _ is exactly what he had to
juggle as NATO supreme commander, the first time he felt like a
soldier-statesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly with my background, knowing war in Europe, knowing
the totality of Europe, I could easily understand Europeans and
convince them why America wants certain things,'' said the general,
relaxing his rule on personal reflection for a moment. ``And I felt
European and American, the commonality of my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those European diplomats who became friends are now
calling him to register their complaints about the Senate and its
aversion to arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   He tells them what he tells the senators. ``As a military man I
can't accept the notion that arms control agreements don't have a
place in our national security anymore.''

STEVENS'S HARD-HITTING PLAY PUTS DEVILS IN COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils have a grand opportunity to
advance to the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the
first time since capturing the trophy in 1995. They are a victory
from reaching the conference finals for two reasons: they have
raised their intensity level and their best players have been more
effective than the opposition's.
</P>
<P>
   It happened against the Florida Panthers in the opening round,
and it is happening again against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils defeated the Leafs, 4-3, Saturday night in Toronto,
giving them a 3-2 lead in their four-of-seven-game Eastern
Conference semifinal series. Game 5 was probably the best in the
series for Toronto, but the Devils still prevailed primarily
because of an inspiring performance by Scott Stevens and a number
of brilliant plays by Patrik Elias, Scott Gomez and John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   With goalie Martin Brodeur doing his part and the team making
few mistakes in their zone, the Devils showed their resilience by
coming back from two one-goal deficits.
</P>
<P>
   After a strategy meeting here Sunday, Stevens said the Devils
were aware of what they had to do to wrap up the series Monday
night in front of their home crowd at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play hard and not give them any life,'' Stevens
said. ``We've got speed like they do, but we've got to put it to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his head coach, Larry Robinson, Stevens added,
``Larry is getting us to do the right things.,''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ken Daneyko, who has teamed up with Stevens to help kill
all 28 Toronto manpower advantages: ``You can use all the cliches
and check out the past. The bottom line is we stay focused on what
we have to do, which is play with discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   And along with playing a huge part in neutralizing Toronto's top
line of Mats Sundin, Jonas Hoglund and Steve Thomas, Stevens
delivered two crunching hits on Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn Adams that
were reminiscent of the thunderous hit he delivered on Detroit's
Slava Kozlov in the 1995 Stanley Cup finals, which the Devils
swept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be physical,'' Stevens said. ``I always try to be
physical. I got the hits and we got some goals. It was nice to
catch two people in the middle of the ice. I think others will be
thinking about it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens was not the central figure in the melee that broke
out at the conclusion of the game. The trouble started with
Toronto's Darcy Tucker tangling with Brodeur and Steve Thomas with
Scott Niedermayer.
</P>
<P>
   Fans pelted the Devils with soft drinks and other debris as
players barked at each other in front of their benches before being
escorted to the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens did not think there would be any carryover in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's closed,'' he said. ``It's too important to stay
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer and Brodeur were the only players who were assessed
penalties from the fight. Niedermayer drew 40 minutes for roughing
and cross-checking and Brodeur got 20 for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, whose only goal in the playoffs turned out to be
the winner on Saturday, said, ``It's not going to help your team if
you carry over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who has been dominant winning face-offs, was
another player who did think there would be lingering trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is we know what we can do to be successful, and
fighting is not one of them,'' Holik said. ``What we've got to do
is bring into the game the attitude like last night.''

WOMEN'S SPORTS FOUNDATION LOOKS BEYOND OPENING DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Female athletes, coaches, administrators,
educators and entrepreneurs gathered here this weekend to celebrate
their accomplishments and to prepare for the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the state of women in sports, those attending the
14th annual conference of the Women's Sports Foundation agreed that
there were more opportunities for women since Title IX of the 1972
Educational Amendments banned sex discrimination in
federally-funded school programs. Now, in a stance that reflects
the influence of the foundation and its constituency, the group
wants to focus less on getting in and more on moving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially the primary function was opening doors of
opportunity,'' said Donna Lopiano, the executive director of the
foundation. ``Now, it's exploiting the participation of women in
sports in an economic sense, gaining access to assets, program
expansion and addressing the continuing problem of girls being
discouraged from sports.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed in the theme of the conference: Brave
New World of Women's Sports. For the 350 who registered for the
three-day event at the Long Island Marriott, it was a chance to
exchange information and ideas, network and develop strategy to
fulfill the potential that women have in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   It provided a setting for the kind of informal debate many women
had not engaged in since their college days, on topics as disparate
as the feasibility of a 24-hour women's sports channel and the
notion that news media images have increasingly portrayed female
athletes as sex objects.
</P>
<P>
   During a panel discussion on women of color in sport, Krista
Ford, the only African-American woman on the United States
bobsledding team, talked about the trials and tribulations that
come with being ``a first and only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no diversity in winter sports,'' said Ford, who also
competes in bodybuilding. ``In bobsledding, there are no women on
member boards. It's all good old boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said she had grown weary from the constant battles, but
vowed to continue the fight ``so other kids won't have to go
through the hell we've had to endure as pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1974 by Billie Jean King, the foundation has
emerged as a leader and advocate for women's sports. From May 1974
to May 1999, the foundation awarded more than $5 million in grants
and scholarships to girls' sports programs, elite athletes in
training and other leaders in women's sports. It annually responds
to more than 100,000 requests for information on issues ranging
from pregnancy and exercise to coed sports, and assists more than
700 students, parents and coaches a year on gender equity issues.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure its place in the future, the foundation has begun to
change the way it reaches its audience. Last year it created a Web
site &QL; 
www.womenssportsfoundation.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's sports has been somewhat prevented from educating the
next generation,'' Lopiano said, noting that because men are still
largely in decision-making roles in athletics, women do not have
equal access to young athletes. ``We had to find a way to leap over
the more traditional communication systems of getting to kids
through teachers in the schools and go directly to the teens by
using teen media vehicles: television and the Web. The Web is the
most cost effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of the foundation's clout was found in the mix
of corporate sponsorships for this year's convention. Although
there were female-oriented sponsors like Tampax and Sports
Illustrated for Women, big donors also came from the finance,
apparel and telecommunications industries. Among them: Merrill
Lynch, Mervyn's of California and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Lofstrom traveled here from Ottawa, where she runs an
on-line company for women's sports products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an organization like the Women's Sports
Foundation in Canada,'' she said. ``It's so exciting to be here
with these women, who are helping to change the role women play in
sports not only in America but throughout the world.'' &QL;

BUSH RUNS, WITH A LEXICON OF HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Calif.)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush has never been considered
much of a wordsmith. But bit by bit, he is developing a political
dictionary all his own.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Vice President Al Gore distorts the Texas
governor's record and proposals, at least as Bush sees it, Gore is
not ``lying,'' two syllables that never escape Bush's lips. Rather,
Gore is behaving in a manner that is ``disappointing,'' four
syllables that the governor much prefers and has begun to use ad
nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee,
says that he will soon identify numerous ways in which the
government can save money, none of these plans will be ``cuts,'' a
four-letter word that the candidate avoids. They will be
``savings'' that make the government more ``efficient'' _ kinder,
gentler terms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a name game all the more interesting for the fact that
Bush, with little smiles and wiggles of his eyebrows, wholly
acknowledges that he is playing it. And this unspoken but
unmistakable admission has precipitated endless rounds of semantic
jousting between Bush and reporters, who are constantly trying to
get him to say what he clearly means.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign plane on Wednesday, as he flew from Austin to
Palm Springs, Calif., he said that the vice president was
demonstrating a predilection to ``stretch the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that not the same as lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disappointed,'' Bush said, with a ``nice-try''
twinkle and grin. ``I think that's the word I'd like to use. It's a
disappointing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a savvy enough candidate, understands that in politics,
diction establishes tone, and tone is everything. And he turns to
euphemisms to resolve inherent tensions in his campaign, like his
pledge to run a positive race and his simultaneous resolve to wage
an aggressive fight that exposes what he believes to be Gore's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same thing in the primaries, watering down the nouns
and verbs he used to describe and disparage his principal opponent,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Bush's mantra at the time was that
McCain ``says one thing and does another.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that not make the Arizona senator a ``hypocrite''?
</P>
<P>
   Bush flinched at the mere suggestion. No, he said, it made the
senator a man practiced in the ways of ``Washington,'' a word that
was perhaps dirtier but much less explicitly mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ALIEN BACKERS WELCOME
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Republican primaries, the Bush campaign trumpeted
seemingly any and every endorsement, whether it came from the
governor of a large state or the secretary of a small sewing
circle.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Bush campaign took that tendency to the outer
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush showed reporters in the back of his campaign plane a recent
copy of the Weekly World News, a supermarket tabloid, with a cover
story on the extraterrestrial support he was receiving. The front
page featured a photograph of the governor standing beside an
oblong, hairless, vaguely reptilian space alien.
</P>
<P>
   This was not to be taken lightly. As the newspaper noted, the
same intergalactic kingmaker had backed Bill Clinton when he was
first elected president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And as Bush noted, his alien encounter was further proof of his
commitment to expanding the Republican Party's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``New faces, new voices,'' he said as he held the front page
high. ``It goes to show I'm willing to reach across certain
demographic lines.''
</P>
<P>
   EARTHIER EXCHANGES
</P>
<P>
   The exchange also went to show what a prankster and funny man
Bush fancies himself, a persona on vivid display last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was hurling accusations and put-downs in the governor's
direction, and Bush was laughing, establishing a contrast that may
not have been accidental in the least.
</P>
<P>
   His humor was broad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters during an airborne news conference one
afternoon if he would be giving a lengthy stump speech at the
airport in Palm Springs, he blanched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not outdoors!'' he gasped, alluding to the desert heat and one
of its less attractive effects on the human body. He tugged at the
portion of his dress shirt covering his underarms.``Pit city,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his exodus from Washington the week before, after
several campaign stops there, and how one local man reacted to the
passing of yet another motorcade by pulling down his pants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the man was really ``mooning authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor seemed a bit less sanguine when the topic turned to
a profile, in a major magazine, of the campaign's chief strategist,
Karl Rove. Bush has a thing about advisers eclipsing the candidates
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   And he jokingly wondered what he should expect next: a Playgirl
magazine pictorial of his campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh? Allbaugh
is older and burlier than a typical centerfold, but Bush had a
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have him wear a bikini bathing suit,'' he said.

   TIME WARNER'S PUBLIC RELATIONS GAFFE

<P>
   Time Warner's decision to block the ABC television network in
3.5 million homes last Monday will surely be a prominent chapter in
public relations history. In just 39 hours _ the time it took for
it to restore the ABC signal _ Time Warner managed to anger many of
its customers, rile local and national politicians, draw the ire of
the Federal Communications Commission, and upset what had looked
like smooth sailing on the way to approval of its merger with
America Online.

to pile on some additional torment for NBC: ABC quietly let the
Thursday edition of ``Millionaire'' run eight minutes long, just
enough to blunt the start of NBC's strongest series, ``E.R.'' ABC
beat ``E.R.'' in its first half-hour, something no regularly

 When Truth Challenges Fiction and Becomes Art  
 By SARAH BOXER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It has a clunky name: ``nonfiction
narrative'' or ``narrative nonfiction.'' It is factual writing that
reads like a good novel. It happens in books, in magazines and
occasionally in newspapers, or at least it used to. ``Dispatches,''
``A Bright and Shining Lie,'' ``The Soul of a New Machine,'' ``In
Cold Blood,'' ``Into Thin Air'' and ``The Professor and the
Madman'' are examples.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday there was a daylong conference here devoted to the
state of narrative nonfiction. First, the Columbia University
Graduate School of Journalism and the Neiman Foundation for
Journalism at Harvard University gave out three awards in the
genre: two in memory of J. Anthony Lukas, the author of ``Common
Ground,'' who died in 1997, and one in memory of Mark Lynton, a
senior executive at Hunter Douglas in the Netherlands, who died the
same year and whose family has financed the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize ($10,000) went to Witold
Rybczynski, an architect and professor of urbanism at the
University of Pennsylvania, for his book ``A Clearing in the
Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century.''
The Mark Lynton History Prize ($10,000) went to John W. Dower, a
professor of Japanese history at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, for his book ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II.'' The J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award
($45,000), for authors who have run out of money before finishing
their books, went to James Tobin, who is working on a biography of
the Wright brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The morning panel, moderated by Alan Brinkley, a professor of
history at Columbia University, was given over to the prizewinners
talking about the future of their art. The three men were pretty
sanguine. The one thing that seemed to weigh on their minds was the
boundary between fiction and nonfiction. Should it be there? Is it
arbitrary?
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said great fiction is generally a notch above great
nonfiction. But occasionally a nonfiction book like ``Common
Ground'' or ``Rising Tide'' rises to the level of fiction. The best
nonfiction books are not just about school busing in Boston or a
flood in the Mississippi Delta, Tobin said. They are about ``what
it means to be human in these circumstances,'' just like good
fiction. But despite the similarities, Tobin said, the fence
between fiction and nonfiction should remain. When he learned that
the end of Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood'' was made up, he said,
``I felt let down.'' Why? ``There is something about knowing that
these events took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rybczynski is no champion of the boundary. He agreed that people
can feel deceived by nonfiction. But, he said, they can also feel
deceived by fiction in which real people masquerade as characters.
He thinks the term nonfiction, which he guessed dates to the 19th
century, may be itself fictitious. The idea that nonfiction is
different because it is true, he said, is absurd: If nonfiction
were true, there would be one biography for one life, and it would
be updated as new facts came to light.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one truth, Dower said, any more than there is a
single Japan. A writer of history relies on sources who may or may
not remember things accurately. And in the end, he said, the way
that people actually remember an event, whether they are right or
not, can be as important as the facts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of journalists in the afternoon, moderated by Robert
Vare, who teaches at the Neiman Foundation at Harvard, was
considerably less sanguine. The participants suggested that while
this may be the golden age of narrative nonfiction for books, it is
not the case with magazines and newspapers. The general-interest
magazines that once published long nonfiction articles are now
looking more like newsweeklies, and the newsweeklies are looking
more like newspapers. Everyone wants stories faster, cheaper,
shorter and timelier.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Guillermoprieto, who writes for The New Yorker and is the
author of ``The Heart That Bleeds'' and ``Samba,'' said she
despaired of poorer countries like Mexico and Brazil ever having
the money to support journalists who want to write articles that
require weeks or months of research. Out of some 18 million people
in Mexico City, she said, there are fewer than 200,000 newspaper
readers. The United States is lucky. It has readers who have money
to buy papers and editors who have money to spend on reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hart, the editor of The Oregonian, which just won a
Pulitzer Prize for a report about the journey of 20 pounds of
potatoes from the farm to a box of McDonald's french fries in
Singapore, talked about American newsrooms, past and present. He
talked about Damon Runyon, Ernie Pyle, Ernest Hemingway, Walt
Whitman and Mark Twain: reporters who were writers. The
19th-century newspaper was full of voices and stories. So why do
editors give you a blank look if you talk about denouement? Why do
they demand that everything be told in the first paragraph?
</P>
<P>
   The other journalists offered him some answers. Michael Kelly,
the editor of The Atlantic Monthly and the author of ``Martyr's
Day,'' a book on Saddam Hussein, blames the camera. In the 19th
century, correspondents had to describe what a battle or a volcanic
eruption looked like, he said. Now most editors find dispatches
from the front pointless or anachronistic. They've got the picture,
they figure; why do they need a description? When A.J. Liebling
described Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana cooling his face with a
handkerchief dipped in Coca Cola, young reporters were hanging on
his every word, hoping to write like him one day, Kelly said. Now
our literary farm system is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Kirn, a book critic and the author of ``Thumbsucker'' and
``She Needed Me,'' said the appetite for narrative nonfiction was
there, but was being satisfied ``synthetically.'' He thinks he
knows what this nonfiction junk food is, he said: it is the
``spurious supernarrative,'' about people like O.J. Simpson or
Monica Lewinsky or Elian Gonzalez, with characters and plots that
everyone knows but no individual authors. The supernarratives are
covered by packs of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Editors are now seeing the folly of their ways and learning that
there are some things that reporters do better that anyone else,
Kirn said, which is to tell a true story that no one knows. If you
want to call it narrative nonfiction, go ahead.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.T. Houk, the impresario behind one of the nation's largest
charities, is no stranger to controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service once tried to revoke his
organization's tax-exempt status. Last year, Congress and the IRS
put a stop to a charitable giving strategy promoted aggressively by
Houk that critics said benefited donors more than recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Now Houk is facing a challenge to what he claims is the
cornerstone of his brand of philanthropy: finding ways to have
donors and volunteers pay themselves for their charitable deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the notion that anyone ought to perform a charitable
service for free, Houk derides what he calls the ``charity poverty
syndrome.'' He acknowledges that some people make exceptional
volunteers, but says, ``Volunteers give you dregs, not dynamite,''
especially as fund raisers. ``You get what you pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Donors who entrust money instead to his Falls Church, Va.,
charity, known as the National Heritage Foundation, set up
individual accounts that mimic foundations at a fraction of the
cost. In turn, they are eligible for immediate tax deductions for
their gifts and are encouraged to use the money in their accounts
to pay salaries and expenses for themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Donors need not worry about the low pay charities offer, says
the pitch on the foundation's Web site, ``We would strive to bring
your salary up to private industry standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the charitable world bridle at the notion that
people have any business paying themselves to carry out their
charitable impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like paying the Girl Scouts to sell cookies,'' said Jack
Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, which is
one of many competing charities that also offer ``donor advised''
funds, which allow donors to set up individualized accounts with
funds earmarked for charity.
</P>
<P>
   The California Community Foundation bars donors from paying
themselves or family members. ``It's not illegal, but it just
doesn't pass the 60-second smell test,'' Shakely said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Heritage Foundation, however, is far less
restrictive, one reason why at last count tens of millions of
dollars from some 4,000 foundations had been set aside for charity
under its auspices. How much of that money will ever go to
worthwhile causes is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative and marketing fees payable to National Heritage,
some of which are split with financial advisers who bring in the
funds, come right off the top. Then there are also the many
families who dip into their National Heritage accounts to pay
themselves salaries or defray expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. W. John Martin of Rosemead, Calif., set up his charity to
fund research on viruses that no university or government agency
would underwrite.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Cynthia Fleming of Poulsbo, Wash., used some of the
money they gave to National Heritage to send their son to Mexico
for three years, calling it missionary work. While the Flemings
could have tried to create their own foundation, it would have been
``very time consuming and expensive,'' said Ms. Fleming, who heard
Houk's spiel on radio and was persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome T. Barrett of Falls Church, Va., heard about National
Heritage from a colleague. What he finds most appealing was
foundation officials' willingness to look after many of the details
of running a charity. ``They take care of the money, and they will
defend you in court'' if a donor runs afoul of IRS rules, Barrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his charity, Friends of FMCS History Foundation, to
sponsor research on a book he is writing on the federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service, where he once worked. His foundation no
longer has enough assets to allow him to dole himself a salary, but
it covers the rent on his office.
</P>
<P>
   While Houk says the National Heritage Foundation ultimately
controls where every dollar under its management goes, many of his
competitors want Congress to outlaw use of such accounts to siphon
money to donors and their families. The effort to curb this
practice was reported last Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The
Clinton administration has proposed going further: restricting the
gifts these funds can make to charities registered with the
Internal Revenue Service. That would preclude donors from giving to
foreign charities and needy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Houk makes no bones about favoring old-fashioned
entrepreneurship as a way to invigorate the nation's charities.
Accustomed to being the focus of regulatory ire, Houk, a former
Fulbright scholar who boasts a law degree, an M.B.A. and a Ph.D.,
refuses to back down even at the risk of further scrutiny by the
IRS and sharp public criticism. ``The envelope needs pushing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If that makes him something of a maverick, so be it. ``All
progress is created, in my opinion, by skewed personalities,'' he
said. ``The champion is not an average guy.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quick to rely on biblical sources to support his views about
paying volunteers, he claims the National Heritage Foundation has
the potential to revolutionize churches, schools and other
charities. But he is convinced that competing charities, the
government and the media are conspiring to put an end to his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Dayton, Ohio, Houk, who is known as Dock, describes
himself as coming from a wealthy background. He said his family was
connected with the Mead Corp., the giant paper company. He claims
to have given nearly all of his inheritance to charities except for
some property he kept for his wife and some small mutual fund
accounts for his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Brown University, he spent a year in
Finland on a Fulbright scholarship, where he earned an M.B.A.
Later, he added two other advanced degrees before working for the
government researching the impact of international aid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, dismayed by the government's actions to crack down on
private charities, Houk created the National Heritage Foundation in
anticipation of the 1969 Tax Reform Act, which took aim at
perceived abuses by corporations and individuals whose charitable
activities were said to be more for their benefit than that of
others. ``I didn't like the 1969 tax act,'' Houk said. ``I thought
it might cauterize charitable giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Houk was also busy on other fronts: creating what he claims was
the first socially conscious mutual fund and teaching in the
economic and business department of Liberty University, the college
founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, the National Heritage Foundation was coming
under increased scrutiny by the IRS, which can revoke a charity's
tax-exempt status for some offenses. The service brought a case in
1982, alleging that the charity was really a group of private
foundations, which would be subject to different requirements, and
that it offered significant private benefits to financial planners
who promoted it.
</P>
<P>
   Houk's organization, which by then had ousted him at the
insistence of a big donor and had changed its name to National
Foundation Inc., won the case in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He got going again in 1994, forming a new group that he again
called the National Heritage Foundation. It invoked many of the
same principles about the evils of big government, attracting many
powerful supporters. For instance, Bruce R. Hopkins, a prominent
Kansas City charity lawyer, wrote the forward to Houk's book, ``The
Coming Charitable Revolution,'' in which he lauded Houk's vision of
a grass-roots brand of philanthropy. That said, Hopkins said in an
interview he never meant to provide Houk's organization with a
blanket endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   There also remains significant enthusiasm for Houk's creativity
at motivating people to give among people who work with donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is charitable entrepreneurship, and how far you
can push that,'' said C. Dennis Brislawn, a trusts and estate
lawyer in Kirkland, Wash., who has set up foundations for clients
at National Heritage. ``Dock Houk is one of the champions to push
the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting a cut of the fees levied on donors' accounts,
financial planners who generate a lot of business for National
Heritage have also been rewarded occasionally by having foundations
set up in their own names at National Heritage's expense. Planners
may also use foundations to pay themselves for raising funds for
charity.
</P>
<P>
   What Houk and his organization get out of all this is open for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when people were enthusiastic about a plan to buy
so-called split-dollar life insurance policies at his urging,
National Heritage took in $128 million in revenue, its tax returns
show. The split-dollar life insurance scheme, in which donors'
gifts to a charity were used to buy life insurance policies naming
both the charity and donors' heirs as beneficiaries, was outlawed
last year, and Houk says National Heritage's revenues fell to about
$61 million in 1999, information that is not yet available on the
tax returns. Some donors who took his advice and bought
split-dollar life insurance policies that have backfired are
mulling lawsuits, although it is not clear that Houk would be the
target of such actions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a banner year like 1998, only $3 million was disbursed
to outside charities, the tax returns show. Another $3 million
covered other program expenses like honorariums and publicity, and
nearly $60 million was used to buy insurance policies and other
investment products used to build endowments. And information on
how much donors are paying themselves cannot be gleaned from the
tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The charity's 1998 tax return makes no mention at all of Houk's
own pay package and does not list Houk as one of its top officers,
omissions that Houk acknowledged were an error, especially when the
organization's letterhead refers to him as its executive director
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Houk says he makes about $6 an hour, roughly $12,000 a year or
so, in keeping with his sense that he does not need the money. He
does, however, allow the organization to pick up some of his
expenses, like frequent travel to the West Palm Beach, Fla., area,
where he maintains a modest office.
</P>
<P>
   Having installed his wife, son and daughter-in-law in top
positions at National Heritage, he allowed them as a group to make
about $166,000 in 1998 salaries, according to the tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport lounge in West Palm Beach last Friday, Houk said
he did not understand why he was such a target for regulators, who
he said were paying undue attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably more socially responsible than the average
bear,'' Houk said defiantly. He says he could easily spend his days
playing tennis and enjoying life, but there is little sign of
surrender. ``We're not going to quit fighting,'' Houk said.

 &HT;    Victorious Loudon hopes to make leap to Olympics
 &HT;    By Carrie Teegardin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tiffani Loudon's lead in the inaugural Foxhall Cup
appeared to be in jeopardy Sunday morning, when her 14-year-old
horse Makabi woke up sore and tired from Saturday's grueling
cross-county round.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarians had to think twice before allowing Makabi to
compete in Sunday's stadium jumping, the final phase of the equine
triathlon. And Loudon knew she had absolutely no room for error,
with Australian Olympic gold medalist Phillip Dutton standing in
second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to calm myself,'' Loudon said.
</P>
<P>
   And that she did. Before a hushed stadium of 4,000 spectators,
the 5-foot Loudon guided the veteran bay horse to a picture-perfect
round on the jumping course. Not a single rail dropped and Loudon
and her mount picked up a national title, three silver trophies and
a $55,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this horse, for one,'' Loudon, 24, told the spectators
after being asked how she felt about winning.
</P>
<P>
   If the horse wasn't feeling his best Sunday, he didn't show it.
Only five other riders were able to produce a clean round over the
jumping course.

   ``He ran well all weekend,'' said Loudon, of Blythewood, South
Carolina. ``He couldn't have done anything better, I don't think.
Yesterday, he didn't miss a beat, he didn't put a foot wrong and
today he was great.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Makabi's efforts will be enough to earn
Loudon a spot on the U.S. Olympic equestrian team. The Foxhall Cup
was an Olympic trial. But Loudon missed a key trial last weekend in
Kentucky because Makabi was not sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every rider's dream,'' Loudon said of the Olympics.
``We'll just have to take each day and see what happens. I would
love to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foxhall Cup is a competition in ``eventing,'' one of three
Olympic equestrian sports. It's a triathlon in which horses and
riders face off in dressage, cross-country and stadium jumping. The
Foxhall Cup is the most high-profile equestrian competition ever to
be staged in Atlanta, other than Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Held in Douglas County, the event is hosted by Atlanta
businessman Jim Richards and his wife, Janet, at their 1,200-acre
farm along the banks of the Chattahoochee River. While the event
drew just 3,500 spectators for Saturday's cross country competition
and 4,000 for stadium jumping, Richards said he and his staff were
thrilled with the outcome. He's hoping Foxhall will draw up to
100,000 within five years. Richards has a 25-year contract to host
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about where we're headed,'' Richards said.

EDITORIAL: CLAIMS OF A SAFER CIGARETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 8:
</P>
<P>
   The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. recently began test-marketing the
new Eclipse cigarette with the claim that it may present less risk
of cancer. The trouble is, there is no way for consumers to judge
whether that bold claim is valid. For other food or drug products,
this kind of claim would be subject to prior independent government
scrutiny. Yet tobacco products, known to kill some 400,000
Americans a year, are exempt from regulation by the Food and Drug
Administration. The Eclipse sales pitch shows the glaring need for
Congress to give the FDA power to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Federal Trade Commission, which has power
to take action against misleading or deceptive advertising, should
examine the claims about Eclipse cigarettes. But unlike the FDA,
the FTC does not pre-clear health claims before they reach
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds says its tests show that the smoke from Eclipse, a
cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco, contains lower
levels of carcinogens and causes less inflammation in the
respiratory system than smoke from conventional cigarettes.
Eclipse, however, does not reduce and may even increase the risk of
heart disease in some people, leaving it unclear whether it offers
a net gain or loss to health. Whatever the case, any health claim
concerning a deadly, addictive product should be subject to
verification by government authorities before reaching the market.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing pitch for Eclipse raises other troubling
questions. The ads say that for smokers worried about their health,
Eclipse is ``the next best choice'' to quitting. That message may
offer just enough reassurance to lull some smokers into continuing
when they might otherwise try to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that the marketing of ``low tar'' cigarettes
did not result in better health outcomes because smokers tended to
smoke more or inhale more deeply on low-tar cigarettes. Even if
Eclipse can be shown to be less toxic in laboratory tests, how it
is marketed and how smokers use it will determine its impact on
consumer health. As the tobacco industry begins to create and sell
a new generation of products, strong federal regulation will be
crucial.

EDITORIAL: THE LATEST FUND-RAISING BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 8:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A civil suit filed against the House majority whip, Tom DeLay,
and his fund-raising empire by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee last week charged them with violating a federal
racketeering law, the so-called RICO statute. The accusation was
that DeLay extorted huge donations from corporate lobbyists and
laundered the money through tax-exempt groups set up to avoid
federal contribution limits and disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The courts will have to decide whether such unsavory political
fund-raising amounts to racketeering in a legal sense. But the suit
spotlights a real problem _ the emergence of shadowy tax-exempt
organizations that are secretly raising and spending unlimited sums
of money to influence federal elections. Political groups can now
gain tax-exempt status under section 527 of the federal tax code
without having to register with the Federal Election Commission
even though they are actively engaged in trying to influence
federal elections. That is a dangerous expansion of the soft-money
loophole that evades even the disclosure requirements imposed on
soft money given to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy that has arisen over this lawsuit should not
obscure the immediate duty of the House Ethics Committee to review
the propriety of DeLay's conduct. Nor should it distract Congress
from passing legislation to stop federal officeholders like DeLay
from using elaborate schemes to put their fund-raising outside the
limits and disclosure requirements set by existing federal laws. In
the longer term, of course, Congress must address more expansively
the growing problem of unregulated soft-money donations. But for
the sake of its own institutional integrity, Congress should
immediately move to prevent its members from controlling huge
stashes of secret political money.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates and officeholders have an ethical duty to fully
disclose their campaign finance activities and to abide by
contribution limits designed to protect the political system from
corruption. These are basic principles that lawmakers on all sides
of the campaign finance debate should be able to agree upon, and
quickly.

EDITORIAL: NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 8:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army's commitment over the weekend to
subject its secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection
should reopen the path to peace in Northern Ireland. By ending its
longstanding refusal to make a meaningful gesture toward
disarmament, the IRA has removed a critical barrier to fulfilling
the two-year-old Good Friday peace agreement and establishing a new
political order in Ulster. Catholic and Protestant political
leaders must now work together _ and with paramilitary leaders on
both sides _ to translate this hopeful development into a durable
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's statement came just 12 hours after the British and
Irish governments announced that they had agreed on a new formula
to restart the suspended home-rule government in Belfast. Under the
plan, the power-sharing arrangement that Britain suspended in
February after only eight weeks in operation would resume on May
22. The February deadlock was due in large part to the IRA's
intransigence over disarmament. At the time, David Trimble, the
pivotal Protestant leader, was threatening to give up his post over
the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's new proposal meets the British and Irish governments'
demand that paramilitary groups state clearly that they will put
their arms ``completely and verifiably beyond use.'' The group said
some arms dumps would be open for inspection within weeks as a
confidence-building measure and would be subject to re-inspection
at regular intervals by representatives of an international
disarmament commission to verify that weapons are not being used.
The IRA also said it would reappoint representatives to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   To move from confidence-building steps to a broader disarmament,
the IRA will have to devise long-term timetables for setting aside
all of their explosives, hand grenades, assault rifles and pistols,
subject to verification. The Protestant paramilitaries must do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's long-awaited commitment was not an easy one for the
group to make. Its leaders deserve credit for overcoming doubts
about disarmament among the organization's most militant members.
Reciprocal steps must be made by the Unionist side. Trimble greeted
the IRA's announcement cautiously, but he conceded that it ``does
appear to break new ground.'' He must now follow through on his
recent promise to bring his party back into a home-rule government
if the IRA made a firm commitment to disarm, without waiting for
actual disarmament to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments have postponed by a year the
deadline for completing a number of additional measures that are
needed to insure peace. They include development of a new police
force with a more balanced membership among Roman Catholic and
Protestant officers and new provisions for respecting the rights of
Catholics. These goals should not be neglected in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Both Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, have shown admirable persistence in
reviving the Good Friday agreement. Trimble and Gerry Adams, the
leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, have each shown
courage in making the compromises necessary to end three decades of
sectarian conflict that has cost more than 3,600 lives. The IRA and
the Protestant paramilitaries have maintained cease-fires for
nearly three years. With the prospect of renewed self-rule, there
are grounds for optimism in Northern Ireland among the overwhelming
majority who yearn for a fair and lasting peace.

BAD BREAKS FOR SCHOENEWEIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Scott Schoeneweis had gotten all the good bounces a
pitcher could hope for leading up to Sunday's game against the
Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The bounces Schoeneweis has been getting are ground balls to his
infielders. But in the Angels' 8-2 loss before 42,940 at Safeco
Field, he got bounces of a different kind and Schoeneweis (4-1) was
tagged with his first loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it was the sixth inning when nothing went
Schoeneweis' way. First, there was the line drive by Dan Wilson
that nailed Schoeneweis on his lower left back. Schoeneweis stayed
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched through chemotherapy,'' said Schoeneweis, who
overcame testicular cancer while in college at Duke. ``No matter
how much it hurt, I didn't want to come out of the game. That shows
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was Mark McLemore's fly ball to right field that
bounced out of right fielder Tim Salmon's glove for an error. That
scored the second run of the inning and knocked Schoeneweis out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   What was a 2-1 game going into the inning was now 4-1, and
Schoeneweis was replaced by Eric Weaver. The Mariners scored twice
more in the inning -- including once when center fielder Garret
Anderson couldn't hold on to a long fly ball by Mike Cameron -- to
go up 6-1 heading to the seventh. Schoeneweis was charged with all
four runs in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That inning could have been a lot better than it was, but
that's baseball,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis walked a season-high five batters while giving up
six runs (five earned) and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. (The Angels
walked 12 in all, tying a club record for walks in a nine-inning
game).
</P>
<P>
   But Schoeneweis was not upset with the way he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I wanted to,'' he said. ``They took a lot of
pitches and worked deep into the count. I don't think I got
crushed. I'll stick with it and do the same thing next time. I'm
not going to change anything. ... They took a lot of really close
pitches. I don't know how they did it, because I can't throw those
pitches any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made good pitches, but they're a very disciplined bunch of
hitters,'' he said. ``They have some veteran hitters that were
patient with him. They came out and just did a good job. It wasn't
anything Scott did or didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Angels hitters were not nearly as disciplined
with Mariners starter John Halama (4-0). Halama, who throws a
variety of off-speed stuff, held the Angels to one run and two hits
through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was throwing his changeup for strikes,'' said Salmon,
who went 0 for 3 with a walk and two strikeouts. ``He gets you
thinking about the changeup, and that makes the fastball more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Anderson's
two-out, RBI single. But Halama held them without another hit until
leaving the game after the sixth. The Angels finally got their next
hit in the seventh when Scott Spiezio singled off Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) night we had two hits, and the first six innings
(Sunday) we only had a couple of hits,'' Scioscia said. ``That puts
pressure on the pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners pitching did a particularly good job on Darin
Erstad, who went 1 for 14 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said pitchers are making adjustments with him, and they
worked in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeing much to hit,'' he said. ``I tip my hat to the
Seattle staff. The few pitches to hit that I got, I didn't hit
'em.''

THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA, AND MICROSOFT'S  
 AN E-HOLSTER TO CARRY GADGETS  
 MODEM INVENTOR WILL HEAD NEW E-BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates complains that everyone at Microsoft pitching a new
project seems to invoke the notion of the innovator's dilemma. The
term, Gates told Forbes magazine last year, is ``a required slide
in every funding presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gates might do well to pay attention, says Clayton M.
Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the
phrase. His book, ``The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies
Cause Great Firms to Fail,'' has been causing a stir at technology
companies since it was published in 1997. It describes how leading
companies are ambushed by new products.
</P>
<P>
   Technology industries, he says, go through life cycles. A large,
integrated company makes sense, in his view, when a technology is
young and it is a formidable task simply to make a product or
service that works. In the days when the national telephone network
was being built, Christensen said, ``a single company would have
dominated, even if AT&AMP;T were not created.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a technology matures, he noted, ``it causes the industry
to disintegrate.'' Then, speed of marketing and ease of
customization tend to matter more. That is when a technology leader
is most susceptible to a disruptive technology coming up from the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's market for personal-computer software, Christensen
insists, has the characteristics of maturity. ``For Microsoft, the
mainstream product lines _ the Windows operating system and Office
suite _ are just huge software programs,'' he said. ``Most users
don't use more than 10 percent of their features.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Java,'' Christensen said, referring to the Sun
Microsystems language for Internet programming, ``is coming up.''
Like many insurgent technologies, he noted, Java was first
developed for another market _ consumer electronics _ but it found
its early use on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   His prognosis for Microsoft? ``No matter what happens in the
antitrust case, Microsoft will go where IBM went in mainframes,''
said Christensen, whose book is being published in paperback by
HarperBusiness. ``Microsoft will still be dominant in PC operating
systems but, like mainframes, that will not be the mainstream of
computing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' he added, ``will still be around, but it will not
be the all-powerful entity it once was. This is the mechanism by
which markets destroy monopoly.''

   An E-Holster to Carry Gadgets
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Traeger's collection of portable electronic devices grew,
he saw the day approaching when he would own more gadgets than he
could comfortably carry. He imagined something that would let him
wear his cell phone, his organizer and even his pager at the same
time and give him easy, quick access to any of them. He imagined,
in fact, something like a shoulder holster.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the e-Holster, an accessory that closely
resembles a gun holster and can be worn completely concealed under
a jacket or sweater. The e-Holster was designed by Jerry Ahern of
Commerce, Ga., a firearms-concealment expert whom Traeger expected
to bring an intuitive feel to the problem. Designers of gun
holsters, he reasoned, know the ergonomics of easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Traeger's company, Personal Electronics Concealment of St.
Augustine, Fla., sells the e-Holster, along with his newest
product, the e-BeltPouch, from its Internet site
(www.eholster.com). The e-BeltPouch attaches to an ordinary belt
and holds a cell phone or an organizer in a sideways position,
permitting the wearer to sit down without fear of losing the
device.
</P>
<P>
   The basic e-Holster, in nylon, costs $99.95; a leather version
is $119.95. The e-BeltPouches range in price from $47.95 to $84.95.
</P>
<P>
   With a hand-held organizer on one side, a cell phone on the
other and a pager clipped to the harness, the e-Holster wearer can
look like a road warrior. ``There is a little macho thing to it,''
Traeger said.
</P>
<P>
   But that little macho thing might be a problem. ``I don't think
it's a very good idea,'' a San Francisco Police Department official
at the department's shooting range said. An officer frisking
someone, for instance, could think they're carrying a weapon. ``It
would certainly be a concern for any officer. They'd have to be on
the alert.''

   Modem Inventor Will Head New E-Business
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes knows how to make money _ and how to lose it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Credited with inventing the computer modem in 1978 as a
29-year-old engineer working out of his kitchen, Hayes built the
company that he had started to manufacture the devices, Hayes
Microcomputer Products, into an industry powerhouse in the 1980s.
But the company failed to adapt as lower-cost competitors eroded
its market share, and after years of struggle, it finally shut its
doors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after quietly serving as a consultant for Internet
companies and heading an Internet industry association, Hayes
recently re-emerged, this time as chief executive of a new
e-commerce unit of the online retailing company International
Brands.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called World Best Buy, has a Web site selling
discounted merchandise like clothing and electronics as well as
used items through an electronic garage-sale format that matches
buyers with sellers. It recently added an auction service and plans
additional services soon, though Hayes would not go into details.
</P>
<P>
   The site has $40 million in prepaid ads, Hayes said, and
interest among other advertisers, particularly in the automotive
business, is high. The site has a section dedicated to cars and car
parts.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Hayes Microcomputer, which introduced the
Hayes-compatible PC modem in 1981, remains a cautionary tale of the
computer industry. The company reached a peak of $250 million in
annual sales before seeking bankruptcy protection for the first
time in 1994, after failing to react quickly enough to competition
for its principal product and the rise of powerful new competitors
like 3Com and U.S. Robotics.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes successfully resisted takeover bids for several years, but
finally merged with Access Beyond in 1997, and ceded control.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1998, the company lost $17.6 million and
filed for bankruptcy again in October. In January 1999, Hayes
Corp., as it was then known, shut down for good, ending a chapter
in PC history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointment,'' Hayes said, adding that he lost
$150 million in the bankruptcy. ``So I started doing what I know
best,'' he said, ``helping companies grow fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides consulting, Hayes has spent the last few years as
chairman of the U.S. Internet Industry Association, a trade group
that has focused, among other things, on promoting the Internet as
a tax-free zone.

SALMON HAS BIG ROAD TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- When the Angels began their six-game trip to
Baltimore and Seattle, nobody on the club had a lower batting
average than Tim Salmon's .217. But that was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had hit a game-winning homer in the 13th inning on April
29, the second-to-last day of the homestand, and he said at the
time that maybe that was what he needed to get going. It turned out
he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit .474 (9 for 19) on the trip with three homers and six
RBIs, raising his overall average to .261.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it,'' Salmon said when asked of the game-winning
homer was the catalyst he needed. ``Up to that point I felt I was
swinging pretty good, I just wasn't getting hits. Sometimes it
takes something to get you over the hump. You're looking for that
bloop single in a crucial situation. For me, it was that homer.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he was never worried about getting his swing to
where he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a track record, I have that to go on,'' he said.
``I've had bad starts in the past and went on to have good seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not isolated. There are always guys out there off to a
slow starts and they rally to have a great year. You don't expect
(Ken) Griffey to hit .200 all season, do you? It's not fun to have
a slow start by any means, but it helps when other guys are having
a good start. Then when they cool off, I'm hot, it's my turn. It
seems a little bit unrealistic for all nine guys to be hot all the
time.''

   As hot as Darin Erstad was in April, he's been cold in May.
After Sunday's 0-for-5 performance, Erstad is hitting .115 (3 for
26) this month. But Erstad will not overanalyze his swing and try
to make too many changes, like he did last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach is the same,'' said Erstad, who is hitting .383.
``You still to to hit the ball in the same spots, stay inside the
ball. You make a little adjustments but nothing drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said his current slump doesn't make him feel any added
pressure, but ``It drives me to be better. If I'm just going
through the motions, I'm going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The past year has been quite a whirlwind for Mariners pitcher
Brett Tomko. Tomko, who grew up in Placentia and played two seasons
for Mt. San Antonio College, began last season in Cincinnati at the
Reds' ace, but struggled to a 5-7 season. Amid a winter of trade
rumors, he finally was traded to Seattle, heard more rumors he was
going to be traded to the Angels, then started the season at
Triple-A Tacoma after the Mariners sent him down.
</P>
<P>
   He was called up April 22 to replace the injured Jamie Moyer,
and is 1-1 with a 5.30 ERA in three starts going into today's start
vs. Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, Tomko said ``It would be nice someday'' to
play in his hometown. ``(Seattle's) not my backyard, but it's still
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko will forever be noted in baseball history as one of the
players traded for Ken Griffey Jr. But he didn't necessarily think
of it as a good thing initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had apprehensions coming over here,'' he said. ``Cincinnati
Reds was all I knew my first five years. At first I was a little
nervous. But I've made a lot of friends and I'd like to stay and
compete for an AL West title.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, out since May 2 with a sore shoulder,
is expected to start tonight vs. Oakland. DiSarcina has played in
only 11 of the team's 32 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS VS. OAKLAND
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 at Edison Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: FSN; KLAC-570, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Ramon Ortiz (2-2, 5.47 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Oakland's Ariel Prieto (first appearance). The Angels
finished their trip to Baltimore and Seattle at 3-3, but lost the
final two games to the Mariners after holding a share of first
place with them. The Angels, currently 16-16, have not been more
than two games above or below .500 all season.

COLUMN: MAN WITHOUT EMPATHY NOW ASKS IT OF VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treat him is if he were Everyman, says Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. Public officials have problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   Will the public accommodate him, as one recent poll suggested?
That would mean a married candidate _ if Giuliani remains a Senate
candidate _ can acknowledge a relationship with ``a very good
friend,'' pronounce his behavior to be nobody's business, and
suffer no ill political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a Catholic school alumnus who has labored to rid
his city of sleaze, tried to punish a museum that exhibited art he
considered immoral and wants the Ten Commandments posted in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your Nixon-to-China syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know if the mayor will pursue his Senate campaign,
given his bout with cancer. We do know that he is asking a lot of
tolerance from New Yorkers _ and from his wife, Donna Hanover, who
now refers obliquely to the need for ``decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unusual thing,'' said Michael Beschloss, a
historian of the presidency. ``You can rack your brain and not find
a precedent in recent history that foreshadows this.'' Not,
Beschloss noted, that it comes out of nowhere. A half-century ago,
a divorce spelled the death knell of presidential aspirations; by
1980, Ronald Reagan, a divorced man, was elected. Bill Clinton won
the presidency in 1992 despite Gennifer Flowers and survived Monica
Lewinsky, and impeachment, with his popularity intact.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart's presidential candidacy collapsed primarily because
of revelations of an affair, but only after he boasted of a solid
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Hanover long ago acknowledged leading separate
lives, so the mayor's problem is not hypocrisy. But can a man not
known for his empathies ask the public to understand that public
officials also live the lives ``that other human beings do''?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has worked a lifetime creating the impression that he
is unlike the rest of us: the tough, unyielding prosecutor; the
high-minded, uncompromising mayor. He routinely berates those who
ask him questions he doesn't like and roughly faces down all
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Public matters, not private, Giuliani would say. But
distinctions blur. In the long run, what is likely to matter most
is what people think of the Giuliani they know, not of his new
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rule in politics is if you have a general
reservoir of good will among your constituents, you can get away
with it,'' suggested Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the
newsletter Privacy Journal. ``People have come to know Giuliani
over several years. Everyone pretty much has made up his mind about
him as a public figure. Associating with someone not his wife isn't
going to change people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers do, indeed, know Giuliani; few are undecided between
him and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Even his conduct in addressing this
friendship was in character. The mayor, who loves to manipulate the
media, all but announced the relationship himself.
</P>
<P>
   The story broke last week in the tabloids after the mayor
brought Judith Nathan to several public events, including (tweak,
tweak) the Inner Circle, a reporters' dinner and show held March
11. Rumors flew, and finally the couple were seen together so
frequently that the story broke, first in The Daily News, then The
New York Post. They said she was a divorced nurse, a mother of a
15-year-old girl, who works for a pharmaceutical company and has
been seeing the mayor for months.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor confirmed his friendship, perhaps, because the timing
was good: he was drawing sympathy for his diagnosis of prostate
cancer. Besides, he knew that two books about him were in the works
and that Gail Sheehy had written an article about the Senate race
in the new Vanity Fair. Getting potentially damaging news out
yourself is good politics.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not care much about inside baseball. What they
know is that the mayor has a failing marriage, that Giuliani is
open about pursuing midlife happiness, that Hanover is upset, that
two children are caught in the middle. There are consequences, as
there are for millions of people in troubled marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor will not lie about it, to his credit, but asks the
public to allow him a degree of latitude that he has rarely granted
others. It seems logical that the voters' willingness to separate
his personal and political identities will depend not on any
theories about what is private in public lives, but on the
reputation Giuliani long ago created for himself _ and on Hanover's
``decisions.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: REFORMING THE DEATH-PENALTY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 8:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressional misgivings about the nation's profoundly flawed
death-penalty system may lead to important reforms. In February,
Sen. Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, introduced a bill that
would provide competent lawyers to capital defendants and guarantee
federal and state death-row inmates access to DNA testing if that
could help exonerate them. The measure's chances have now
brightened with the emergence of a Republican co-sponsor, Sen.
Gordon Smith of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The companion version introduced in the House a month ago also
boasts bipartisan sponsors _ Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican,
and Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat. This effort has the
endorsement of Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, the Republican who
declared a moratorium on executions in his state in January.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on Governor Ryan's idea, Sen. Russell Feingold,
Democrat of Wisconsin, has put in a bill that would impose a
moratorium on both state and federal executions while a national
commission examined the troubling questions that have arisen _ not
least the glaringly inadequate safeguards to prevent conviction and
execution of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   These moves come at a moment of growing skepticism about the
system across the ideological spectrum. The religious broadcaster
Pat Robertson and the conservative columnist George Will have
lately expressed concern about the death of innocent people. In
three new decisions, meanwhile, the Supreme Court has signaled that
while federal courts retain a role in correcting death- penalty
injustices, their room to do so has been limited by a 1996 law
intended to speed executions. It is Congress' responsibility to
undo that damage by minimizing the chances of unfairness and
mistakes.  &QL;

AT CUBAN DAY PARADE, MAYOR HAILED AS HERO  

</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands chanted his name. Hundreds waved his blue
``Rudy'' campaign signs. And after a dozen days that few could
doubt Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would rather forget, there was
little hesitation by the mayor about how to respond: an
enthusiastic thumbs up and a broad, relaxed smile.
</P>
<P>
   The scene took place Sunday afternoon on the Avenue of the
Americas as Giuliani marched in the annual Cuban Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has long been popular with the city's small but vocal
Cuban-American population, having snubbed Fidel Castro during his
1995 visit to the city and named a corner outside the Cuban Mission
to the United Nations in honor of an exile group that lobbies for
the overthrow of the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   But after several months of persistent criticism of the Clinton
administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez affair, Giuliani
appeared Sunday to have achieved hero status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva Rudy,'' they chanted, as he stepped out of his city car.
``We love you,'' ``Go Rudy, go,'' ``You are our hero,'' others
yelled. Some even made reference to his announcement 11 days ago
that he had been told he had prostate cancer and to his more recent
acknowledgment of a close friendship with an Upper East Side woman,
saying, ``I pray for you,'' and ``Everything will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is a strong person,'' said Ermina Rivero, 74, a
retired teacher, who wore a ``Women for Rudy'' button and a T-shirt
featuring a photograph of Elian and the words ``Federal Child
Abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He fights for the people,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was unabashed about his admiration for the
Cuban-American community, saying he felt a ``very close kinship''
to immigrants who, like his Italian-American relatives, quickly
became self-sufficient after arriving in the United States. He also
said he appreciated the struggle by Cuban-Americans against what he
called the oppression of the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tremendous respect for the Cuban-American community
because they embody the very best values of America,'' Giuliani
said, as supporters chanted his name. ``And I know at this time
they are suffering even more than usual because of the events of
the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a candidate for United States Senate, again condemned
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno Sunday for the
seizure of Elian from his Miami relatives last month before
reuniting him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used those agents as storm troopers,'' Giuliani said
Sunday, repeating a description he has used, which some have called
inappropriate. The federal agents, he said, ``dressed up as if they
were involved in a major war confrontation and they went in with a
machine gun pointed at a child.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The molten sun beat down mercilessly. The hot, slow
afternoon was a furnace. The parks lay green and motionless.
Pavements shimmered like burning lakes. It might have been one of
those torrid days in August when the heavy iridescent air presses
down on the spirit and all seems hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat wave that smothered the metropolitan area and the
mid-Atlantic states Sunday was no illusion. Normally in the high
60s in early May, the temperature hit 93 degrees in Central Park
just after 3 p.m., breaking a record of 92 set in 1939, when the
World's Fair opened in New York and war in Europe began.
</P>
<P>
   Other records from New England to Virginia were also shattered.
It was 94 degrees in Newark and Concord, N.H.; 93 in Salisbury,
Md.; 92 in Atlantic City; 89 in Burlington, Vt.; and 87 in
Bridgeport, Conn. _ all records. And it was 90 in Boston,
Philadelphia and Washington, although those were not record highs.
Meteorologists said the region's heat-humidity index was in the
mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual spring heat _ a huge, humid air mass from the
Midwest that was expected to linger until Wednesday _ felled about
40 people with dehydration and exhaustion on a five-borough bicycle
tour of New York, while 40,000 other cyclists survived the 42-mile
ordeal by pausing along the way to gulp gallons of water and get
doused by kindly strangers with garden hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency medical service workers treated those stricken by the
heat and said no one was hospitalized. No deaths or serious
injuries were reported in the region, but the heat depleted many of
the well-conditioned runners in the Olympic marathon trials in
Pittsburgh, with only two Americans, one man and one woman,
qualifying for the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Saharan heat, it was a lovely day in New York.
Castles of clouds drifted in a liquid blue sky that seemed to go
with tinkling chimes on a country porch. On Broadway, greengrocers
set out pyramids of limes, oranges and apples. Down at the Battery,
sea gulls dipped and soared, pencil lines in a musical composition,
and the harbor rippled like blue-gray silk.
</P>
<P>
   While millions kept to the air-conditioned comfort of homes or
sought relief in refrigerated theaters, shady parks, beaches or
country retreats, there were many who challenged the day in shorts,
tank tops and sunglasses, getting out to roller-blade, jog, stroll
or just sit in the sun with the Sunday papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to this, but it's too darned hot,'' Bruce Anderson,
41, a native of Mobile, Ala., said as he and his newspaper wilted
on a bench on West Street by the Hudson. ``This weather makes you
not want to do anything,'' he added. ``I'm going home and take a
nap.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White Horse Tavern on nearby West 11th Street, Anna
Meyer, who had come from upstate New York for the Bike New York
Tour, breezed in with a sweaty exhilaration and joined the crowd.
``It was a great day, perfect weather for riding,'' she said. ``Now
I deserve a couple of beers and a burger.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Brooklynites flocked to Prospect Park, and despite
the heat some danced lavishly to the beat of 20 musicians on congas
and steel drums. Yaffa Chapman, 33, of East New York, shook her
hips in a colorful African lapa skirt and beamed. ``Me not dancing
in the summer is like man keeping nature from blossoming,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Guy Isa Love-Zion Proud Nubian Messiah, also known
as Guy Perry Hargett, whispered encouragement and rejoiced over the
steamy summerlike day. ``Occasionally, the heat makes you think of
ancient times,'' he said. ``It leads you to put your foot down anew
with a little ancient African boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   For Juce St. Victor, 28, it was a day to go fishing. He combed
the shore of Prospect Park Lake with his sons, Jamel, 9, and
Jiovanni, 3, and a red cart carrying fishing rods and a boom box to
play Bob Marley. ``The heat doesn't bother us,'' he said. ``We get
fresh air in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the region sweltered, there were cool breezes off
the ocean on the south shore of Long Island. Elana Sessler, of
Atlantic Beach, ran errands, played tennis and was still going at
midafternoon. ``I went for a bicycle ride on the boardwalk,'' she
said. ``That was glorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Petrosino, 7, of Island Park, cooled off with a
hockey lesson at Long Beach Arena while his parents watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better in there,'' his father, Ralph, said as they
came out blinking in the sunlight. ``It's got to be 35 to 40
degrees. There's a nice humidity haze. It works for me, if I can
get two hours in air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Artificial cool was also on the mind of Lyle Tick, 24, an
account executive for a Manhattan advertising agency, who spent the
morning buying and installing a new air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suffered last summer with no air-conditioning,'' he said,
``so at the first sign of heat I went out and got one.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was it so hot in early May?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Knight, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
said dry, mild weather last summer and winter in the Rockies and
the northern Plains states left the ground from Montana through the
Dakotas, Minnesota and the Great Lakes states very dry. That is the
region where most of the weather reaching New York and the East
comes from.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the sun's radiant energy warms the ground and
evaporates the moisture in it, he noted. The sun does not heat the
air directly, but first heats the ground, which transmits the
warmth into the air. But when the ground is already dry, as it was
this spring, the efficiency of the heat transfer from sun to ground
to air is extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   So the air over the Great Plains has been getting increasingly
hot this spring. A week ago, meteorologists knew a big heat wave
was on the way, heading east and setting records. In recent days,
records in the high 80s and low 90s were set in the Dakotas,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And voila, it comes to New York and the East Coast,'' Knight
said.

PRESIDENT EXTOLS MRS. CLINTON'S CANDIDACY TO FRIENDLY CROWD IN
ARKANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ It was an afternoon filled with nostalgia
and sentiment as President Clinton returned here Sunday both to
revisit memories of his political life in Arkansas and to preside
over a fund-raising reception for his wife's effort to be elected a
U.S. senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of more then 300 Arkansans, the president
introduced Hillary Rodham Clinton as someone who would do ``a
superb job'' as senator.
</P>
<P>
   To a crowd made up of her old friends, political associates,
former fellow law school professors and child-advocate colleagues,
Mrs. Clinton called the trip ``a very pleasant journey in time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton has campaigned throughout the state of New
York as a Senate candidate, Sunday's reception at the New State
House Convention Center was one of the rare occasions when the
president attended an event with his wife's political campaign as
its centerpiece. He appeared with her when she made a formal
announcement of her candidacy in February, but did not speak at
that event.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the president spoke effusively Sunday about his
wife, portraying hers as one of the most important races of the
2000 campaign year. ``I have spent the last almost 30 years having
conversations with my wife about every conceivable issue,'' Clinton
said. ``In my whole life, I've never known anyone who had a better
grasp of the issues. I think the Senate would be a much better
place if she were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's reception, which raised about $100,000 for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign, seemed to be a personal pilgrimage as
well as a political event for both Clintons. Before the president
and Mrs. Clinton spoke to a decidedly partisan audience, the
audience heard the two extolled by two of their closest political
allies in this state: the former Sens. Dale Bumpers and David
Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton repeated many of the themes that are fixtures of
her speeches in New York. She talked about her opposition to school
vouchers and the need to make health care more widely available.
But she, like the president, also reminisced about her days in
Arkansas, her once-adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, where the president's change of voter
registration from Arkansas to New York made front-page headlines,
Mrs. Clinton's decision to seek office in another state has been a
matter of some local controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's reception offered nothing but warm enthusiasm for
the Clintons, who a day earlier attended the wedding of a staff
member near Paris, Ark. And the president made clear his strong
feelings about his native state, referring to Arkansas in his
remarks as ``home'' and telling the audience of his plans to make
frequent stays in an apartment to be included in the presidential
library that will bear his name, which will be built near the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took pains to explain to the audience that his wife's
decision to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., was one that came to her at the urging of others.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not mention Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her
Republican rival. But she bitterly chastised the Republican Party
for advocating the use of a budget surplus to finance a large-scale
tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and the president talked about the role
reversal they had undergone after she became a candidate. She spoke
of the critique the president had offered her during her rehearsal
of the speech in which she officially announced her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had and probably still have a lot to learn about being a
candidate,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``And I'm trying to do the very
best job I can. But I want to take back every time I said to Bill,
`You know, you could have said it like this.'''

   LONDON _ After 30 years of being at war with each other, the
IRA's ruling Army Council and the leaders of the Ulster Unionists
now find themselves in the same boat, trying to sell to their
grass-roots the idea that the IRA's offer to allow international
inspectors to check its hidden arms dumps is the only way to keep
the Northern Ireland peace process alive.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides face challenges in succeeding and risks if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the prickly but pragmatic Ulster Unionist leader,
has to convince his party that by accepting the IRA's pledge, they
have a chance to defang the IRA, even if the guns never get
formally turned in and simply remain in the hidden dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formal handover of weapons is seen by the IRA as a
surrender it did not agree to when it called a cease-fire to allow
politics to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's strongest argument is that if unionists really want to
disarm the IRA, this is the most realistic chance. Saying no to the
IRA offer to put arms ``beyond use'' will ensure unionists never
get what they say they want.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the unionists are entitled to say no. It is, after
all, despite republican protests to the contrary, a free country.
But the unionists would reject the deal at their own political
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with senior officials from both the British and Irish
governments suggest that British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, would be furious and embarrassed
if the unionists thumb their nose at the deal that the two leaders
so patiently stitched together.
</P>
<P>
   If rebuffed, London and Dublin would likely draw up an
alternative plan that would not be as advantageous to unionists as
the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, meanwhile, the unionists would be seen as the
obstructionists to progress. The same would go for the IRA if,
faced with grass-roots opposition, the IRA leadership reneges on
its offer to let former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari and
former African National Congress chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa
inspect their arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has a lot to gain by keeping the peace process alive.
The IRA leadership can point to the promised reform of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the 90 percent Protestant police force. In
return for the IRA pledge, the British government has promised to
reduce British troop levels, which at 15,000  &UR; today &LR;  are already
the lowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It took the IRA nearly 30 years to kill 300 police officers and
700 British soldiers. By embracing democracy, the IRA could send
the British army packing in a few years, and could in 10 years cut
the 13,000 police force in half, and make its composition closer to
that of Northern Ireland, which is 40 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' an IRA man said in a recent conversation, ``is real
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, IRA leaders can point to the early
parole of some 400 of its prisoners, the last of whom are scheduled
to be released by July 28. For 30 years, republicans sent thousands
of their own young to warm cells and nearly 400 to cold graves.
Anyone who wants to go back to war has to assume responsibility for
consigning the next generation to death and prison.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the flexibility and resiliency that has marked their
partnership, Blair and Ahern have pushed next Monday's deadline for
disarming back to next May. That is already being seized on by some
unionists as one concession too many. But there is nothing the IRA
could do, short of ordering its members to commit mass suicide,
that would satsify hard-line unionists like the Rev. Ian Paisley,
leader of the fundamentalist Democratic Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment on the IRA's pledge, Paisley said, ``I don't
trust the IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   But most unionists, whether they like it or not, have to trust
that what the IRA said on Saturday was a genuine and sincere
attempt to show that the war is over at a time when the IRA is
unable or unwilling to say explicitly that the war is over.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the IRA who do not like the idea of letting outsiders
peruse their arms dumps have two options. They can sulk and lament
the end of their ``armed struggle,'' or they can join dissident
groups and mount a new campaign of violence. If they choose the
latter, they will find few republicans willing to offer them
support, much less their homes as havens and their children as
recruits.

<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor is to be honored Monday in a majestic and
intricately planned Roman Catholic funeral Mass that, though rooted
in ancient traditions that viewed death as a bleak event, will
celebrate his anticipated ascension into heaven and eternal life
with God.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,500 people _ including President Clinton, city
and state leaders and cardinals and archbishops in colorful
vestments _ are to gather under the soaring spires of St. Patrick's
Cathedral at the Mass for the cardinal, the eighth man to lead the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening prayers to the singing of hymns to the taking
of communion, the ceremony is at its core the same carefully
structured Mass of Christian Burial held the world over for any
Catholic, said the Rev. Thomas Lynch, who teaches church history at
St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. But the people packing the pews
of the church _ and presumably millions more who will watch on
television _ will see an elaborate, two-hour event filled with
pageantry and spectacle honoring O'Connor, who died Wednesday at
80.
</P>
<P>
   With the cardinal's closed coffin resting in the center aisle
near the altar, the light streaming through the church's stained
glass, the ceremony will begin with a procession estimated to take
45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Following a cross bearer, hundreds of priests, nuns,
seminarians, deacons, representatives of lay orders and leaders of
other religions will file through the bronze portals of St.
Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishops will follow. Those coming last will be among some of
the highest-ranking officials in the Catholic Church, 15 cardinals
from the United States and five other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them will be Cardinal William Wakefield Baum, a Vatican
official and the senior American cardinal, who will speak to the
congregation. Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, will
deliver the homily, and Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's
secretary of state and Pope John Paul II's No. 2 man, will preside
over the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Awn, a former Jesuit priest and a professor of
religion at Columbia University, said the rich, elaborate nature of
a cardinal's funeral harks back to an ancient church in which
cardinals were actually princes and popes were monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On occasions like this, religious institutions like the Roman
Catholic Church fall back on the classical traditions,'' he said.
``So all of the rituals surrounding the funeral of a cardinal are
very reminiscent of these ancient, older allusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Christian ceremonies were gloomy and foreboding. And
through the centuries, Catholic funeral ceremonies with their
medieval chants, candles surrounding coffins and apocalyptic hymns
like ``Dies Irae'' (Day of Wrath) _ continued to emphasize concern
about judgment day.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to change with the Second Vatican Council in
1965. The Catholic Church, in its drive to broaden participation,
ceased to compel the use of Latin in Mass, did away with black
garments and simplified its ceremonies. Other revisions came in the
following years, affecting the rites of burial. Monday, say church
officials and experts on the liturgy, the focus is on celebrating
the deceased's new life.
</P>
<P>
   For mourners, the effect has been one of affirmation and faith,
stressing the hope and renewal that come with the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   That emphasis starts from the very beginning of Mass, with the
cardinal's wooden coffin covered with a white pall and blessed with
holy water, reminiscent of the joy of baptism. A Gospel book is
placed on the coffin, a sign that those who remain must carry on
the Gospel of Christ to the world. A crucifix will rest on the
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   The concelebrants _ those who come in union to celebrate the
Mass _ will enter the sanctuary area, Cardinal Sodano in the center
and the other cardinals close by.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening prayer, Mother Agnes Donovan, the superior of
the Sisters of Life, an order founded by the cardinal, will do the
first reading from the Old Testament. The reading, from the Book of
Wisdom, says that the ``souls of the just are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reading, from the New Testament, is from the letter
of Paul to the Colossians. Read by Therese Snyder of the Catholic
Guild for the Blind, Paul explains that he has found ``my joy in
the suffering I endure for you,'' and says that he became a
minister through God's will.
</P>
<P>
   The third and last reading, from the Gospel of Mark, recounts
the Passover Supper. In one of the most important biblical
passages, Jesus tells his followers, ``Take this, this is my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ann Rehrauer, associate director of the Liturgical
Secretariat for the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops in
Washington, said the themes in the readings would carry a strong
sense of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Law will then speak in the one portion of the Mass that is not
scripted. But the homily is expected to be far different from a
free-wheeling eulogy one might hear in other Christian churches,
with the emphasis on the deceased's accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Connor will certainly be lauded, the homilist's primary
goal is not to praise him, Rehrauer said. Rather, it is to give
thanks to God. ``Anything the cardinal was able to do, he did for
the grace of God,'' she added, ``which is different from a eulogy,
which says isn't this a terrific person.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Prayer of the Faithful, members of the cardinal's
family will bring the gifts of bread and wine to the altar and
prayers are then offered.
</P>
<P>
   The steps that follow are among the most significant and
emotional in Catholicism, starting with a recollection of Christ's
words and deeds at the Last Supper. Catholics believe that by
taking bread, giving thanks, breaking bread and giving it to the
disciples, Christ gave of himself. The next day he was crucified.
And by now accepting the body and blood of Christ, the believer is,
in turn, accepting him and his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   After communion, the last prayers are read over the body of the
cardinal. The coffin is blessed with holy water, again recalling
baptism. The choir will sing ``may the angels take you into a
paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffin will then be carried up the altar, around the rear
and down a narrow stairwell to a crypt that holds the bodies of
five cardinals, four archbishops and other church leaders.
Accompanying the coffin, will be the cardinal's family and a few
clergy members.
</P>
<P>
   In the crypt, a final prayer is said, holy water is sprinkled
and the choir sings the traditional hymn to Mary, ``Salve Regina.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the pulpit and the pew on Sunday, those who had
known Cardinal John O'Connor either well or fleetingly offered
personal remembrances of a man who they said retained a personal
touch despite his lofty status as the archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The tributes came in two public Masses that were followed by an
evening vigil _ the third day of rites leading up to Monday's
invitation-only funeral in St. Patrick's Cathedral that is expected
to attract far more than its 2,500-seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon Mass was devoted to those who worked with the
cardinal in his previous pastoral affiliations in Scranton, Pa.,
Philadelphia and the military, and the other was primarily for
members of religious orders and employees of the Archdiocese of New
York, which encompasses 2.4 million Catholics in 10 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Edward M. Egan of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., who
is said to be the most likely successor to O'Connor, attended the
second Mass, at which Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston officiated.
Law was a close friend of O'Connor, who died on Wednesday of
complications related to brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Egan sat at the altar, in the first row of several bishops. He
did not speak but was one of a number of bishops to offer Holy
Communion. An announcement from the Vatican on the next archbishop
for New York was not expected until Tuesday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands waited long hours in Sunday's heat to get into
the cathedral _ halfway through both Masses, ushers were still
trying to find seats for those left standing _ homilists and
parishioners offered a glimpse of the workaday cardinal as well as
his of his lesser-known life before his appointment to the
archdiocese in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Robert A. Brucato, apostolic administrator of the
archdiocese, said during the evening Mass that the cardinal lived a
dual life. He was a ``world figure who could talk to presidents and
kings'' and made a conscious effort, despite the potential for
criticism, to reach out to the news media to deliver his message.
But then, Brucato said, there was also ``the John Cardinal O'Connor
more familiar to the people of New York, the John Cardinal O'Connor
who touched people. There will be less of a paper trail of that
John Cardinal O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He started so many works, especially for those in need,''
Brucato said, mentioning the cardinal's efforts to reach out to
AIDS patients, schoolchildren and the disabled. ``And then he
personally ministered in those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, archdiocese workers and members of religious orders
reflected on the theme and recalled their own contact with the
cardinal, whether it was his riding the elevator like any other
employee at the archdiocese's East Side headquarters or checking on
pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Francis, an executive with the church-sponsored
Catholic Health Care System, said she recalled the cardinal driving
by a nursing home that was undergoing renovation and then phoning
employees the next day with a suggestion to add shades to the
windows of the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a big supporter of us,'' she said. ``There were
many times he would sit with AIDS patients and personally bathe
them and pray with them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeanne-Marie Neilson, a psychiatric social worker who works for
the archdiocese, said the cardinal fostered a familylike atmosphere
among workers at the Catholic Center, the archdiocese office. Her
closest contact with the cardinal came when she shared an elevator
with him one morning and exchanged morning greetings. ``He was
waiting for the elevator and riding up just like the rest of us,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in a similar vein, congregants offered
similar folksy views of the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother died in January he called the same day and
asked to come to the funeral,'' said the Rev. Jerry Deponai, one of
three priests assigned to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
who occasionally visited the cardinal and shared his concern about
the shortage of priests in the military. ``As you know, he did not
say things unless he meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the earlier Mass, with the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, looking on, Edwin F. O'Brian, the archbishop of the
Archdiocese for the Military Services, noted the cardinal's 27
years as a Navy chaplain, from which he retired with the rank of
rear admiral.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian credited O'Connor with opening the minds of military
leaders to the importance of chaplains in the spiritual life of
soldiers and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Red Cross volunteers or scoutmasters,'' O'Brian
said of the attitude that the cardinal impressed on military
officers. ``Chaplains are distinct professionals, pastors whose
uniforms belonged to the corps but whose heart and soul were
possessed by God.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``One newspaper the other day said he was an obscure
military chaplain. There was never a day when John O'Connor was
obscure.''

PATAKI PROPOSES DNA BOARD TO REVIEW OVERTURNED CONVICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki on Sunday proposed the creation of a state
DNA Review Committee that would examine all convictions in New York
overturned because of new genetic evidence. The panel would also
propose regulations to improve the use of the precise forensic
science of DNA profiling by the state's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as the reliability of genetic evidence has
improved, DNA testing has been used to set aside 64 criminal
convictions in the United States, according to statistics
maintained by the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo
School of Law at Yeshiva University. Seven of the overturned
convictions have been in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the most prominent New York case, Victor H. Jenkins was
convicted of raping a Buffalo woman in 1982, a time when current
DNA profiling methods did not exist. Jenkins served 17 years in
prison before DNA evidence exonerated him last year. Pataki said
Sunday that the committee would work to find the causes of this
mistaken conviction and of others in New York, and would make
proposals to more thoroughly implement the use of forensic DNA in
future investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not to convict someone of a crime,'' Pataki said.
``The point is to convict the right person of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki's plan, the review committee, which would require
legislative approval to be created, would serve as a subcommittee
of the 14-member State Forensic Science Commission, a board that is
responsible for certifying crime labs in New York. It would include
defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges, forensic scientists and
senior police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Scheck, a law professor and a member of the commission,
said the committee would examine each conviction in New York that
was set aside by exculpatory DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is amazing about DNA exonerations is
that no opinion is ever written about them,'' Scheck said Sunday.
``What happens is the judge just issues an order and the person
walks out of prison. The idea is to have a blue-ribbon commission
that basically would issue a report about what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheck is a co-author of ``Actual Innocence: Five Days to
Execution and Other Dispatches from the Wrongfully Convicted'' and
is a co-founder of the Innocence Project, a student-professor
program in Manhattan that has helped exonerate dozens of inmates
through post-conviction DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor plans to announce his proposal formally Monday
morning in Manhattan at the Fifth Annual Conference on the Future
of DNA.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said the project's review of DNA exonerations had found that
among the most common causes were incompetent defense counsel,
shoddy or fraudulent crime labs, inaccurate identification by
witnesses, false confessions, misconduct by the police and
prosecutors, and reliance on incriminating testimony from inmates
who negotiate with the authorities, a class of witness often
referred to by defense lawyers as ``jailhouse snitches.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Jenkins, when the 23-year-old victim saw him at a
Buffalo police garage, she did not identify him as the attacker.
But later, after the police showed her a variety of pictures of
Jenkins, and under what one of his defense lawyers described as
suggestive pressure, she said he was the one who raped her. That
identification led to the conviction; nearly two decades later, DNA
evidence showed it was almost certainly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had a personal brush with erroneous convictions
in the 1980's, when Nathaniel Carter, with whom the governor played
basketball as a teen-ager in Peekskill, N.Y., was convicted of
murdering his former wife's foster mother. Carter spent 28 months
in jail. He was freed when his former wife admitted to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me aware that we truly have to seek to have a fair
system of justice,'' Pataki said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the latest in a series of Pataki's DNA
initiatives. Last year, he successfully pushed for the expansion of
DNA testing, which now requires roughly 65 percent of convicted
felons to submit DNA samples for a state offender database. This
year he has proposed legislation to expand testing further, so that
it includes any citizen convicted of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has also proposed eliminating statutes of limitations for
16 felonies, including rape and second-degree sexual assault, in
which DNA evidence is often collected.
</P>
<P>
   His latest proposal has many elements, he said. In addition to
investigating the facts behind DNA exonerations, Pataki said, the
review committee would be charged with creating state policies for
the collection, handling and storage of DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent cases illustrated the need for these policies, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, the Westchester County district attorney's
office was able to secure an indictment this year for a 1979 murder
because the police had saved a sheet with the attacker's
bloodstains on it. DNA testing matched the blood to that of Walter
Gill, an inmate at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining,
N.Y. who recently submitted DNA to the state offender database.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, Coney Island Hospital performed a rape
examination last year but failed to properly collect and submit DNA
from the victim, weakening the state's case against Anthony Jones,
a serial sex offender who attacked the woman on the morning after
he was released from prison. Jones was convicted this spring of
second-degree assault. With no DNA evidence to support them,
multiple sex-crime charges against him were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that many police officers and hospital
employees did not yet have experience collecting DNA from victims
and from crime scenes, and that even when it was properly
collected, there was not a formal set of rules to govern its
storage and retention. The committee would be asked to create them.

OUT-OF-STATE PACS CONTINUE TO AID PATAKI  

</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki, hoping to keep his political
choices open, has continued to raise money through two political
action committees that he set up outside New York to enhance his
national profile.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of those committees, which bear the name
``21st Century Freedom,'' is to help Republican candidates around
the country who share his views. But campaign records show that
most of the total of $892,573 raised so far has been used to
benefit Pataki by building new political alliances and subsidizing
an increasingly expensive political apparatus that helped him win
two terms as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-state PACs _ one was formed under federal law, and
the other in Virginia, where there are no limits on contribution
amounts _ have channeled $67,433 to state and federal races outside
New York. Yet they have paid at least $126,944 to Pataki's longtime
pollster, Arthur Finkelstein; $118,046 to his political
consultants, Kieran Mahoney and Adam Stoll; and $190,653 to a
half-dozen campaign aides who are or have been on his payroll for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Other money has been used to hire prominent Republican
consultants who could help Pataki in a future run for national
office. For instance, Benjamin L. Ginsberg, an elections specialist
at the Washington law firm of Patton Boggs, whose clients include
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, billed $7,264 in legal fees as
recently as March. Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato
Institute in Washington, received $27,500 for fine-tuning Pataki's
fiscal proposals, while Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Presidents
George Bush and Ronald Reagan, was paid $10,000 to polish his
words.
</P>
<P>
   The money figures are the latest the committees had available.
In the case of the Virginia PAC, they cover all of calendar 1999;
the federal PACs figures cover the period from January 1999 to
March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pataki has not revealed his political plans, it is
clear that he commands substantial resources that could be
mobilized on short notice. In the last week, politicians and
lobbyists have speculated that Pataki may do just that to run for
the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton if the probable
Republican candidate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is forced to drop
out because of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, the most successful political fund-raiser in the state's
history, has brought in a total of more than $3.2 million in
contributions since January 1999, including $2.4 million through
his main campaign fund, Friends of Pataki, which is based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   He has already spent more than two-thirds of that money _ mainly
on political consultants, salaries for his full-time campaign staff
members, travel and fund-raising expenses _ even though he does not
face re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete change in culture,'' said Assemblyman Richard
L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County who has criticized
Pataki and Republican leaders for their aggressive fund-raising
practices. ``There is no election cycle anymore; it's flat-out
fund-raising from the inauguration to the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, chief political adviser to Pataki, said money from
all three committees had enabled the governor to travel around the
country and build support for the party. ``The governor feels very
strongly about promoting the Republican agenda of smaller, more
effective and efficient government, lower taxes, individual freedom
and other issues that are part of it,'' she said. ``We have and
will continue to use these PAC's to disseminate and promote that
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lobbyists and other regular contributors complain that they
are paying heavily for Pataki's growing political activities. They
say privately that Pataki's campaign aides have aggressively
encouraged them to send donations to the Virginia or federal PAC's
as a way to skirt New York's contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they call and ask us to make out two or three checks
instead of one,'' said a lobbyist who had given several thousand
dollars to Pataki's committees but spoke on condition of anonymity
because the issue had become so sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York election law, a corporation's contributions to
all candidates and committees is limited to $5,000 a year. The law
also limits an individual's donation to a state official's
statewide general election campaign to $30,700 over the four years
of the official's term. But several corporations and individual
donors would have exceeded those limits if their donations to all
the committees were tallied up.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, one of the state's largest employers, contributed
$50,000 to the Virginia committee _ 10 times the corporate limit in
New York _ in addition to $50,500 in largely unregulated soft money
to the Republican Party's housekeeping committee. Although Pataki's
PAC is separate from the Republican committees, they often transfer
money back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   A real estate developer, Peter S. Kalikow, contributed $25,000
to the Virginia PAC and $12,500 to Friends of Pataki, a total of
$37,500, which is more than the state's limit for individual
donors. He also directed $12,500 to the Republican state committee,
and his company, H.J. Kalikow, gave $5,000 to the state committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia PAC collected $291,400, or more than half its total
contributions, from New York businesses, residents and other
political committees. The federal PAC, which is barred from
accepting corporate donations and limits individuals to $5,000,
still raised $356,073 including $138,375 from New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said Pataki's multiple committees had made
a sham of the state's campaign finance laws. ``It essentially means
there are no campaign contribution limits for governor,'' he said.
``Those who are seeking to curry favor can give as much as they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucha rejected such criticism. ``This gives us the ability under
the law _ which, the last time I looked, both parties were doing _
to go out to other states and other arenas and talk about the
governor's successful record in New York and the principles of the
Republican Party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Pataki's out-of-state committees have helped
finance Republican aspirations in other parts of the country. The
Virginia PAC contributed $28,000 to 12 Republican candidates
running for the State Legislature in New Jersey, and $28,100 to 8
Republican candidates in Virginia. The federal PAC contributed
$11,333 to 11 Republicans from Vermont to Arizona who are running
for the federal office.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign records show that most of the money has been used
to further Pataki's own political interests. There was little real
difference in how the money was spent from the three committees _
indeed, the same political consultants drew regular payments from
each one.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   After visiting her mother, Grace Burney got into an elevator
with her husband and children and realized that the man facing her
looked familiar. He was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, carried a
bicycle helmet and was standing between an older couple _ his
parents, she figured. Finally, her staring became obvious. The
father smiled at her and pointed at his son. ``You recognize him?''
he asked. But Burney still could not place the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to high school together,'' the younger man joked. Not
possible, she thought, too big an age difference. The man kept
bantering. ``Where do you live?'' he asked. Burney told him, and
asked where he lived. His reply did nothing to help her. She still
could not place him. As they were leaving the elevator, he finally
assuaged her curiosity. ``I'm your senator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Charles Schumer, who had bicycled from Brooklyn to Queens
and had also been visiting his parents. They were seeing him off.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Miller and Janet Capron were at the Quad Cinema in
Manhattan. As the two remaining films were about to begin, the
usher in charge announced the order of admission: ```Beautiful
People,' line for `Beautiful People' only.'' The crowd laughed and
the usher lifted the velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that followed delighted the remaining
moviegoers. ``Next _ `Trash,''' the usher declared.
</P>
<P>
   The two women bowed proudly before entering the appropriate
theater.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit with his sister and her family, Ashton Spann
offered a $10 bill to one of his grandnieces who was in her early
teens. She was reluctant to accept it and protested, albeit
somewhat mildly, ``Oh, you don't have to do that, Uncle Ashton.''
</P>
<P>
   Spann insisted. He put the bill in her hand. ``Now, now, that's
what uncles are for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave him a hug and whispered in his ear, ``Gee, Uncle
Ashton, you certainly know your job description.''

   Perhaps because I have written two books on Eleanor Roosevelt, a
friend gave me a book called ``The Eleanor Roosevelt Girls'' by
Bonnie Bluh, as a birthday gift. It made me eager to read Bluh's
other works, and one weekend a friend and I went into a bookstore
in Greenwich Village. The saleswoman said that they had no other
books by that author and that a search of Books in Print found
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How odd,'' I said. ``Several other titles are listed in the
author's new book as well as three plays. I'd love to meet Bonnie
Bluh _ we both seem to love Mrs. Roosevelt.'' Then I asked if by
chance, she knew Bluh. ``I'm afraid not,'' the saleswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   A tall young man nearby spoke up. ``I know Bonnie Bluh,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I exclaimed. ``That's great. Do you know her well?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes, I guess so,'' he replied. ``I am her son.''
</P>
<P>
   We all broke out laughing. I handed him my card and said I would
love to hear from his mother. A few weeks later, my phone rang. It
was Bonnie Bluh and we arranged to meet.

   Buttons! Buttons! Our lives are full of buttons. We push them
from our first waking moment until day's end. Pushing buttons to
start the day _ to illuminate the dark, start coffee, ignite a
stove, use a hair dryer, curling iron, radio, CD player, washer,
dryer, cross a street, use a computer, calculator, cell phone,
telephone, elevator, snack machine.
</P>
<P>
   WHOOSH! Think of a life button-free. There would be no life at
all, because I'm sure it's buttons that light up the sun and click
on the moon and stars. Thoughts bring out dimples and smiles or
tears and sobs from built-in buttons that are triggered by
happiness or sorrow.
</P>

   And then at night we push a button to close out the world and
activate the button of dreams. There are a million buttons in our

   The company they worked for was bought out, and during a
farewell lunch Philip L. Rolston and his colleagues were recalling
memorable moments in their years with the firm. They pinpointed one
of the highlights as a speech to the staff given by their
president, who had just been hired from France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand you have heard many rumors in the vineyard,'' the
president began. The staff was at a loss: How did vineyards get
into the act? Sensing their bewilderment, the president turned to
an aide. ``How does that expression go?'' he asked. The aide put
him right _ a matter of one word. ``The grapevine,'' the aide said.
``The phrase should go, `I understand you've heard many rumors on
the grapevine.'''

   My grandchildren visited me recently and as a treat, I took them

wander through the store and play with the samples and then each of
them could make a choice of one toy. We were followed into the

EGAN, A BISHOP IN CONNECTICUT, SEEN AS O'CONNOR SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL PAULSON

<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ Monsignor Stanley B. Rousseau knew something
was up when he looked through the confessional and saw a news
photographer sitting on the other side, waiting to ask permission
to take pictures from his church roof.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, all eyes are on St. Patrick's Cathedral, where
Cardinal John J. O'Connor will be buried Monday after 16 years as
the outspoken shepherd of the country's most visible Roman Catholic
flock.
</P>
<P>
   But here in southern Connecticut, attention is focused on Bishop
Edward M. Egan, who is widely expected to be tapped by Pope John
Paul II to succeed O'Connor as archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As always with the secretive church, those who really know
aren't talking, and the Vatican isn't expected to announce its
choice for the new archbishop of New York until Tuesday at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement is the prerogative of the Holy Father, and as
far as I know he has not made any announcement,'' Boston's Cardinal
Bernard F. Law said before heading to New York to attend a memorial
Mass Sunday &UR;  &LR; night and to deliver the homily at O'Connor's funeral.
``I think during these days, the focus very appropriately is on
Cardinal O'Connor and his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus among American church officials is that Egan
is the man; several other bishops have said they have received
notice that they will not be going to New York, and some news
reports have had Egan asking his top aides in Connecticut to submit
their resignations to make room for his successor's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, a 68-year-old native of Chicago, seems to have the perfect
resume for the New York post. As a canon lawyer, he spent two
decades at the Vatican advising popes Paul VI and John Paul II, and
he spent two years as an auxiliary bishop overseeing Catholic
schools in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Connor, who came to New York from Scranton, Penn., and
the bulk of Egan's experience is in a relatively small and obscure
see, here in southern Connecticut. And, also like O'Connor, Egan
shares the doctrinaire ideology of John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes the pope's line and is very much into the church's
teaching,'' said Gene Doris, the athletics director at Fairfield
University, a Jesuit school in the Bridgeport diocese. ``He is not
one of those American bishops who is more understanding of the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Doris said, Egan was a strong supporter of a
measure adopted last year by US bishops to require Catholic
theologians to obtain approval from their local bishop to teach at
a Catholic school. And, Doris said, Egan has opposed a variety of
speakers at Catholic colleges who have held views contrary to
church teachings on social issues such as abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese of Bridgeport, which includes 360,000 Catholics in
Fairfield County, is extraordinarily economically diverse. It
includes a city that has been one of the most troubled, Bridgeport,
as well as a string of wealthy New York suburbs, including
Greenwich, that are referred to as the Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Egan arrived in 1988 to take over a diocese in debt, and turned
around church finances with a fund-raising zeal that has continued
unabated. He has exhorted the diocese's many rich Catholics to
donate more money, and has raised millions to refurbish church
facilities and to aid the poor and the diocese's many immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But Egan is best known for his successful efforts to save the
diocese's school system, which was suffering from declining
enrollment and weak finances when he arrived. In a move that
overturned one of the fundamental organizing principles of the
Roman Catholic Church, Egan abolished parish schools, creating
instead a Catholic school system organized into regions in which
the regional schools were financially supported by all parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His proposal was not well-received, but, in hindsight, it
saved Catholic education in our diocese,'' said the Rev. Lawrence
J. Carroll of St. Joseph's Church in Brookfield. ``We're now
thriving and putting on additions to schools due to his
foresight.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan also started a seminary program here (the only one in the
diocese had closed years earlier). It is so well-regarded that the
admissions dean at Stanford University chose that school when he
decided to become a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``His area of priority definitely has been Catholic education,''
said James D. Fitzpatrick, assistant vice president of Fairfield
University. ``He realized there was a challenge, he took a lot of
heat, and it's strengthened the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Catholic bishops, Egan has had to deal with the
repercussions of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy, and he has been
faulted by one lawyer, Cindy Robinson of Bridgeport, for showing
little sympathy to victims. Robinson represents 21 people who say
they were abused by priests of the Bridgeport diocese.
</P>
<P>
   But he has maintained good relations with priests and
parishoners here, judging from interviews Sunday around the
diocese. Despite the stereotype of canon lawyers as being academic
and aloof, Egan is said to have a warm personality, and his
presence at the pulpit, with his large frame and strong voice,
commmands attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad to see him go,'' said Martina E. Hall, 40, of
Bridgeport, who said she was disappointed, but not surprised, that
Egan seemed to be headed to New York, because Egan's close ties to
the pope were well known. ``He is a really friendly, personable
person, and whenever you meet him, he gives you one-on-one
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was one of several Nigerian immigrants praying Sunday at
St. Augustine's Cathedral in Bridgeport, the seat of the diocese,
which boasts immigrants from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``His preaching has given me my life,'' said Helen Eneh, 38, of
Bridgeport, a student at Sacred Heart University, one of three
Catholic colleges in the diocese. ``I really love him as a bishop,
and wish he could stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest at the cathedral, Rousseau, said Egan is not as
colorful as O'Connor _ Egan has a less playful, more restrained
demeanor _ but that he should do well as pastor of New York's 2.4
million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very outgoing and affable _ he's an extrovert,'' Rousseau
said. ``O'Connor was a character. Bishop Egan will establish his
own style.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday of brain cancer. According to the
Associated Press, dignitaries expected to attend the funeral
include President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton;
Vice President Al Gore; former President George Bush and his son,
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush; UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; and more
than 100 bishops, archbishops, and cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, along with
two of O'Connor's closest associates, former Mayor Edward I. Koch
and Wall Street investment banker Ted Forstmann, are also expected.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor will be interred in the crypt beneath the cathedral's
altar, where all the previous archbishops of New York are buried.

PUTIN INAUGURATED AS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Trumpet fanfares resounded in the ornate, gilded
splendor of the Kremlin's imperial throne halls. Goose-stepping
soldiers saluted and preened, and cannons fired a 30-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony that more closely resembled a coronation than some
recent US inaugurations, President Vladimir Putin was sworn in
Sunday as Russians got a taste of a new tradition: the peaceful
transfer of power from one democratically elected leader to
another.
</P>
<P>
   But signs that this is a work in progress were everywhere. Putin
looked uncomfortable. His predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, struggled
with his lines. Everyone said the right things about serving the
people and safeguarding human rights during the nationally
broadcast ceremony. But if you turned down the sound, it looked as
though Russia was crowning a new czar.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion was fitting as Putin completed his eight-month
rise to power. Just as Russia's democratic transition is uncharted
territory, so is Putin's next move. Russians have put their trust
in the former KGB officer, but no one has a clear idea of what kind
of leader he will be, where his personal and ideological
allegiances lie, or how he plans to modernize a country racked by a
decade of economic decline, corruption and crime.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin, 69, standing woodenly at his side, Putin, 47,
promised to work openly and honestly to help compatriots live
better lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Russia to become a free, flowering, rich and mighty
and civilized country of which its citizens are proud and which is
respected around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing among the marble, gold and crystal of the Kremlin's
Andreevsky Hall, Putin said that he had a plan to accomplish this,
but that he would reveal it later.
</P>
<P>
   The guest list contained no clues as to whether Putin planned a
crackdown on freedoms, as some liberal critics fear, citing his KGB
past and his hard-line policies in Chechnya. Putin's old KGB boss,
Vladimir Kryuchkov, was present, but so was the former Soviet
leader Kryuchkov tried to unseat in a 1991 coup attempt, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who initiated the changes that led to an end to 70 years
of Communist Party rule in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were the advisers who are reportedly
preparing a plan for Putin to speed up Russia's transition to a
market economy; so were the business elites who have amassed wealth
and influence using their political connections, the so-called
``oligarchs'' whom Putin has promised to oust from power.
</P>
<P>
   Another lingering question went unanswered: Is Putin his own
man, or the puppet of the same Kremlin entourage whose members were
widely rumored to have manipulated Yeltsin during the latter part
of his presidency?
</P>
<P>
   Putin's move Sunday to name Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov as
acting prime minister did little to clarify things. Kasyanov is
best known in the West for negotiating Russia's deals restructuring
the repayment of billions of dollars in debts. In Russia, he is
seen as a close confidant to a clique that includes such Yeltsin
insiders as businessmen-turned-politicians Roman Abramovich and
Boris Berezovsky, and Alexander Voloshin, who automatically
resigned as Kremlin chief of staff when Putin was sworn in. All
three were present Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had said he would avoid a lavish ceremony, but Sunday's
inauguration was a far more pomp-laden affair than Yeltsin's
swearing in after he was re-elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A solemn announcer called the play-by-play as a motorcade slowly
escorted Putin's blue Mercedes through the well-guarded streets.
</P>
<P>
   Putin walked through huge, golden doors and ambled in his
peculiar gait _ best described as a half-swagger, half-shuffle _
past more than 1,000 officials, dignitaries and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought we would be sitting comfortably somewhere,''
said a legislator, Irina Khakamada. ``But if you remember the
coronations of the czars, the court always stood.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin looked on tensely as Yeltsin struggled through many long,
embarrassing pauses to finish his speech. Yeltsin ended on the same
words he had used on Dec. 31, when he abruptly stepped down, making
Putin acting president until his victory in March 26 elections:
``Take care of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Putin read the oath, his hand placed on another ambiguous
symbol of Russian commitment to democracy _ a copy of the 1993
constitution that Yeltsin pushed through a referendum vote after
dissolving parliament and sending tanks to disband legislatures who
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   That constitution gives the president broad powers at the
expense of the legislature. Last week, one newspaper leaked what it
said was a document detailing how Putin intended to broaden those
powers by merging the former KGB with his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw the report as evidence of infighting for
influence in the new administration. But a Moscow Times
commentator, Pavel Felgenhauer, said: ``Some people fear that it is
more and more probable that Putin's `dictatorship of law' in Russia
will in effect simply be a dictatorship, a secret-politce state in
which the whim of Putin and his administration will be law.''
</P>
<P>
   After the oath, a presidential flag bearing the name of the new
incumbent was raised over the Kremlin. As Putin left on a red
carpet, a 30-gun salute rang out, as Putin and Yeltsin reviewed the
Presidential Regiment.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration took place as Russian warplanes blasted what
the military said were Chechen rebel positions, and as police
warned about possible guerrilla attacks. Yeltsin's inauguration in
August 1996, was ruined by a rebel counteroffensive that led to the
humiliating withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was Putin who took credit for masterminding Moscow's armed
campaign to retake control of Chechnya last year, and it was Putin
whose electoral ambitions greatly benefited from public support for
his tough stance against the rebels. This coincidence has led to
uneasy speculation in Moscow about whether the war was somehow
provoked by the Kremlin as a tactic to ensure Yeltsin's handpicked
successor election.

<P>
   (DOUGLAS,Ariz.) - The U.S.-Mex ico border here has become a
tinderbox of resentment as com plaints mount over area ranchers'
practice of detaining illegal immi grants who cross their land and
trash their property.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with guns, cell phones and night-vision scopes, some of
the property owners for months have been rounding up 20 to 80
border crossers a night and turning them over to U.S. Border Patrol
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are bristling at reports that some of the most
militant ranchers have recently moved onto public roads to make
their stops.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure encouraging tourists to help ranchers catch border
crossers alarmed diplomats further when it appeared in Douglas two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said her
government has hired Washington, D.C., attorneys to look into suing
the ranchers over possible human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as the government of Mexico, can bring suit, with proof,
against those who have violated the rights and dignity of Mexico,''
said Green, who called the detentions racist and dangerous. ``We
will take this as far as we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Mexican Consul Salvador Cassian-Santos cited 24
incidents between April 1999 and April 2000 in which armed property
owners stopped illegal immigrants, including one in February and
one in April that allegedly occurred on public roads.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Mexican Consul Miguel Escobar Valdez said the April stop
involved 16 border crossers, in two vehicles, stopped by border
resident Don Barnett on state Highway 80.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett is brother to Roger Barnett, who raises cattle on 22,000
acres near the border.
</P>
<P>
   DETAILS OF THE ARREST
</P>
<P>
   Escobar Valdez said the arrest un folded as follows:
</P>
<P>
   As the vehicles headed north, they passed Barnett's stopped
pickup. It began following them, flashing its lights and signaling
them to pull over. They did not see any Border Patrol markings on
the truck, so they continued driving. Barnett then passed them,
blocked the road and forced them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett wore a holstered pistol. A woman riding with him wore a
pistol in her waistband. Barnett told the drivers to give him their
keys. The woman took their pictures and briefly waved her gun.
Barnett then called the Border Patrol. Agents arrived and took the
people away for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Don Barnett said Sunday that he believed the people were legal
mi grant workers with permits, and he was looking to hire them to
help clean up his ranch. When they stopped, he said, he realized
they were in the country illegally and called the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't run off the road or anything like that,'' he
said. ``We were just trying to give some of those poor people a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   NO EVIDENCE OF VIOLATION
</P>
<P>
   Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said he looked into the
allegations and found no evidence that anyone broke any laws.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar Valdez said Mexico is deeply concerned about the
incident, as well as the brochure, which advertised ``fun in the
sun'' while offering tourists a chance to ``stay at the ranches and
help keep trespassers from destroying property.'' No one has
claimed responsibility for it, and many believe it is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Barnett and other ranchers say they will countersue for
thou sands of dollars in property damage if the Mexican government
takes them to court. They say they have met with politicians,
testified to subcommittees and written letters ad nauseam about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   They use one phrase for their situation: They are under siege.
</P>
<P>
   In part, they blame the Border Patrol, which over the years has
forced the northward tide of illegal immigrants into a bottleneck,
at Douglas, through heightened border enforcement operations such
as El Paso's ``Hold The Line'' and San Diego's ``Gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   FLOOD AT DOUGLAS
</P>
<P>
   Just in the Douglas area, Border Patrol agents say they now are
catching 25,800 crossers a month. David Aguilar, chief of the
Tucson sector that encompasses Douglas, refused to estimate how
many are getting through, but the ranchers say the number is about
10 times as great.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vance and other ranchers wonder who protects their rights
when border crossers tear up their fences and water tanks, leave
swaths of trash and human waste, and even start wildfires while
trying to stay warm at night.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Davis, who raises 120 head of cattle on 10,000 acres about
24 miles from the border, says he crisscrosses the land weekly to
pick up armloads of discarded blankets, plastic water jugs and
dirty diapers left by illegal immigrants meeting rides inland.
</P>
<P>
   And Stan White, who trains horses on property that adjoins
Davis' ranch, said he spent most of last Thursday trying to put out
a 20-acre wildfire he says illegal immigrants likely started while
waiting for a smuggler contact. The blackened area reached right up
to a bro ken-down van that they apparently abandoned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials say they understand the landowners' com
plaints, but they cannot condone the aggressive monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   They say the illegal immigrant trade has turned deadlier as
profits rise and armed smugglers fight for their cargo when anyone
gets in their way. Sooner or later, they say, somebody is going to
die in a matchup between rancher and smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   To appease the property owners, the Border Patrol put in place
the ranch patrol, a small detachment of agents _ eight per shift _
that transits empty roads between ranches.
</P>
<P>
   They go after bands of illegal crossers that get through the
dozens of agents deployed at the fence line. Recently, they've had
help from another special unit of 18 to 24 agents.
</P>
<P>
   `I WANT THIS TO STOP'
</P>
<P>
   But some of the ranchers say the effort is so thin it amounts to
public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want some Border Patrol agent to come glad-hand me,''
Davis said. ``I want this to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranchers' tribulations are draw ing the ear of a group
responsible for Proposition 187, the now-discarded measure that
sought to deny medical care, education and other benefits to
California's illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by immigration activ ist Barbara Coe, plans a
protest in Sierra Vista on Saturday to show support for the
ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO WEIGHS IN
</P>
<P>
   The volume is also rising on the Mexican side. Douglas Mayor Ray
Borane on Friday met in Agua Prieta with Sonoran Gov. Armando Lopez
Nogales and Jose Angel Pescador, the top immigration official in
Mex ico. Borane said Pescador wants to meet with the Clinton
administration to talk about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the United States to stick to an agreement setting
ground rules for notifying the Mexican Consul and Mexican
immigration officials _ an agreement he says has not been followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they should be treated as illegal immigrants,'' Borane
said, ``not invaders.''

ASIAN FESTIVAL UPDATES ITS APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was the year that the hip-hop singer with a
dragon tattoo stole the spotlight from the folk dancers.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself Double O, and he strutted in a black tank top
across the stage at Sunday's Asian Pacific American Heritage
Festival, his left arm emblazoned with a blue dragon. As a deep
bass pounded across Union Square Park, he ripped into rhyme. ``I'm
what you want, what you need,'' he sang. ``Oh baby, please come
home with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Asian urban outlet that was never exposed
before,'' he said to a reporter as he kissed a female fan after the
show. ``I think we're on the tip of the iceberg. I think it's going
much farther.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, acts like Double O have gradually taken center
stage at the 21-year-old festival, edging out more traditional fare
like Korean folk drumming and Malaysian dancing. Chalk it up to
younger organizers taking over the programming and a younger
audience attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, organizers said, more professionals in their 20s
have dropped by, more companies focusing on that market have paid
for banners and booths and more contemporary performers have been
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   The changes mirror larger trends in certain segments of New
York's Asian-American community _ namely, the growing visibility of
young Asian-American professionals in what is considered mainstream
culture, and the emergence of popular art forms that voice their
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands who attended Sunday's festival came with
cell phones, sunglasses and slick hair, and they were less
interested in the martial arts demonstrations than in the
erotically charged lyrics of Double O.
</P>
<P>
   The festival was started in 1979 by the Coalition of Asian
Pacific Americans when President Jimmy Carter designated
Asian-American Heritage Week. President George Bush later expanded
the designation to encompass the month of May.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, it drew several hundred people, most of whom had
ties to the 30 or so nonprofit groups that set up booths. These
included organizations like the Chinatown Health Clinic and the
Basement Workshop, an arts collective.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the festival financing came from state grants,
fund-raisers and rents for the booths. But since the late 1980s,
corporate sponsorship has become increasingly common. That backing
has intensified in recent years, especially as many companies have
become aware that Asian-Americans have the highest average
household income of any ethnic group in the United States _ $46,637
in 1998, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say the changes reflect a general demographic shift in
the last decade or so within many Asian-American communities.
Immigration laws passed in 1965 have resulted in more white-collar
immigrants entering the country and an entire generation of
children growing up in the United States in the 1980s and entering
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But the increasing commercial presence at the festival has
raised concerns among some people who worry that corporations may
overshadow the work of nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   And when the visibility of the professional Asian-American class
increases in mainstream culture, the awareness of working-class
immigrants and their problems can get lost, said Robert Ku, a
professor of English and of Asian-American Studies at Hunter
College.
</P>
<P>
   But festival organizers said they had been careful to keep the
event grounded in its original purpose. For instance,
career-oriented groups at the festival, like the National
Association of Asian-American Professionals, often run mentoring
programs to help recent immigrants or students.

QUEPASA.COM REACHING OUT
 FOR MORE LATINOS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 BY DANIEL GONZALEZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Arturo Jimenez is one of a growing number of
Hispanics defying the notion that they don't go online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it frequently for news, enter tainment; for what's ever
going on in the Latin world,'' said Jimenez, 31, an account
executive at Radio Unica, a Spanish-language talk-radio station in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 U.S. Department of Com merce study found that less than
13 percent of Latino households had Internet access, compared with
30 percent for Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two years, the gap has narrowed as increasing
numbers of Latinos rush to get online, accord ing to Ekaterina
Walsh, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said 28 percent of the nation's 32 million Latinos are
online at home. The number jumps to 47 percent when access at work,
school or library is included, compared with 43 percent for Anglos,
Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics are actually at the fore front right along with
Asians,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That effort is being aided by Quepa sa.com, a Phoenix online
firm that is distributing 2 million computer disks to attract more
Latinos, especially young, upwardly mobile ones like Jimenez, to
its bilingual Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, a sort of Latino version of America Online, offers an
array of news and information in English and Spanish as well as
chat rooms, links and a search engine to help guide viewers around
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of start-up companies, especially those on the
Internet, Quepasa.com lost money in its first year of operation:
$28 million last year. Still, the firm raised $48 million in its
initial public stock offering, and the number of registered Quepa
sa.com users increased 108 percent in the last quarter of 1999 to
more than 210,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trujillo, Quepasa .com's chief operating officer, said that
while the decision to offer free Internet access is primarily
market driven _ more viewers means more advertisers _ the company
also wants to help close the information-technology gap between
Latinos and Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the only venue that establishes the
opportunity for an equilibrium for our community to be competitive,
productive citizens,'' Trujillo said.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be Hispanic to take advantage of
Quepasa.com's free Internet access. It's available to anyone and
can be downloaded from the company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the giveaway is primarily tar geted at Latinos. Most of
the 2 mil lion computer disks distributed by Quepasa.com were
mailed to Latino households with a high probability of owning a
computer, Trujillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Other disks are distributed at com munity events such as last
month's Hispanic Business Expo at the Phoe nix Civic Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Simply offering free Net access won't solve the underlying
issues between the information technology have and have nots, said
Andy Carvin of the Benton Foundation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if everyone has Internet ac cess tomorrow,'' Carvin said,
``it really won't make that much of a difference if they lack the
literacy skills to take advantage of the technology and the
information, and if they don't have access to content that is
relevant to their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like Quepasa.com that cater specifically to the Latino
com munity also face the challenge of providing content that is
relevant to a broad range of interests and backgrounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of difference between a third-generation
Cuban-American family in Miami and a migrant worker family from
Guate mala in the Pacific Northwest,'' Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cavanagh, who studied In ternet access for a New York
busi ness research group, The Conference Board, said Quepasa's
offer of free Internet access may be viewed as a ``welcoming
gesture'' by Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are coming online in large numbers,'' Cavanagh said.
``If Que pasa can convince the Latino com munity that they care
about the community, they could do very well with that market. They
could have a chance to corner that market before anyone else can. I
think its a very shrewd marketing move.''

SEYMOUR SUDMAN, 71, EXPERT IN SURVEY DESIGN  

</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Seymour Sudman, a University of Illinois professor whose
books taught pollsters and marketing experts how to phrase
questions to get accurate answers, died on May 2 at a hospital in
Chicago. He was 71 and lived in Champaign, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke he had suffered last
month in Washington, where he was attending a meeting of the
American Statistical Association, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudman was a professor of marketing, sociology and survey
research. He had been on the Illinois faculty since 1968, and had
planned to retire this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A consummate semanticist, Sudman was fascinated by the way the
outcome of a questionnaire could be tainted by the choice of a
single word.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he contended that public-opinion polls,
particularly those done early on in political campaigns, ``are more
a reflection of name recognition than of voting behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that the emergence of the Internet created new
hazards for survey researchers because only part of the population
could be reached over it. Those without access to the Internet must
still be reached ``by mail, telephone or other old-fashioned
means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation led to a major embarrassment for pollsters
in 1936 when a survey by The Literary Digest, then a prominent
periodical, predicted that the Republican nominee, Gov. Alfred M.
Landon of Kansas, would defeat President Franklin D. Roosevelt by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey that prompted that prediction had unduly relied
on the telephone, which many households did not yet have. It was
Roosevelt who won by a landslide, carrying all but two states. Only
Maine and Vermont went to Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Sudman was an expert in survey sampling and the design of survey
questionnaires. He wrote scores of articles on the subject, and was
the author or co-author of nearly 20 books.
</P>
<P>
   Some are classic textbooks for students and lay readers trying
to grapple with statistics and survey writing. Among them are
``Applied Sampling'' (1976), ``Asking Questions: A Practical Guide
to Questionnaire Design'' (1982) and ``Polls and Surveys'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Sudman studied the reasons that people answer
survey questions the way they do. The result was ``Thinking About
Answers: Application of Cognitive Processes to Survey Methodology''
(1995), with two co-authors, Norman Bradburn and Norbert Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Sudman, who was born in Chicago, received a bachelor's degree in
mathematics from Roosevelt University in Chicago in 1962 and a
doctorate in business from the University of Chicago in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Blanche Berland Sudman;
a son, Harold, of Chicago; two daughters, Emily Hindin of Columbus,
Ohio, and Carol Sudman of Springfield, Ill.; a sister, Annette
Baich of Edwardsville, Ill., and two grandchildren.

MARTIN SCHILLING, DEVELOPER OF V-2 MISSILE, DIES AT 88  

</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Schilling, a German-born retired executive of the
Raytheon Co. who worked with Wernher von Braun at Peenemeunde,
Germany, during World War II to develop the world's first large
ballistic missile, the V-2, died on April 30 at a clinic in
Burlington, Mass. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who lived in Lexington, Mass., died from heart
failure, said his son Gerd.
</P>
<P>
   Although not a decisive weapon, the 47-foot-long V-2 (the
designation stands for Vergeltungswaffe 2, or Vengeance Weapon 2)
with its one-ton warhead, was one to inspire dread among Allied
civilians and soldiers alike. About 1,000 V-2s were fired at London
during the war, and some 4,000 were launched against Allied
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the V-2 traveled at an altitude of 60 miles and a speed
of one mile per second, faster than the speed of sound, there was
no warning of its approach. Furthermore, because it was not a
``smart bomb'' that could be aimed with at least a degree of
precision, the hit-or-miss V-2 was considered a terror weapon.
</P>
<P>
   For Schilling, however, who was entranced by the possibilities
of Jules Verne-style space travel, the V-2 could be a thing of
beauty. At one test flight from Peenemeunde in 1944, Schilling
recalled to his son Gerd, he watched through a telescope an
experimental V-2 rising to an altitude of 118 miles _ the edge of
space. It was, he said, ``a beautiful picture, showing the tiny
rocket against the immensity of space,'' he told his son.
</P>
<P>
   Although his sons say Schilling was not a member of the Nazi
party, most of his supervisors, like von Braun, were in the party,
according to ``Reaching for the Stars,'' by Erik Bergaust
(Doubleday, 1960). Schilling had been recruited by the Peenemeunde
team because he held a Ph.D. in applied physics and could be
valuable in the development of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   His specialty turned out to be the development of control vanes
in the fiercely hot exhaust plume of the rocket motor. The vanes
kept the rocket pointed straight up and later on its correct course
until it built enough airspeed to be guided by its external fins.
Today's rockets are kept on course at low speeds by the swiveling
of the motors.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, von Braun and 126 Peenemeunde scientists,
including Schilling, were resettled at Fort Bliss, near El Paso,
where they continued to develop rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   After the team was moved to Huntsville, Ala., they launched
America's first satellite into space in 1958, an event that
signaled the beginning of the space race with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Schilling joined the Raytheon Co. of Lexington,
Mass., which is now one of the world's largest electronics and
missile system contractors.
</P>
<P>
   For his work on the development of American military missiles,
including the Hawk, the Sparrow, the Sidewinder and the Patriot,
Schilling was awarded the Exceptional Civilian Service Award of the
United States Army in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon, he rose to the rank of vice president for research
and engineering and retired in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Oct. 1, 1911, in Heorde, Germany, Schilling attended the

SIDNEY PETERSON, 94, SURREALIST FILMMAKER  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sidney Peterson, an American surrealist filmmaker of
the late 1940s and early 50s, died on April 24. He was 94 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who was born in Oakland, Calif., studied at the
University of California in Berkeley. He made his early films with
help from his students while teaching at the California School of
Fine Arts. To support his filmmaking he worked at movie studios and
in New York at the video department of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the Whitney Museum of American Art showed four of his
experimental films, including ``The Potted Psalm'' (1946), which he
directed with James Broughton, and ``The Lead Shoes'' (1949).
Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the program showed
him to be a serious avant-garde filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The films owe a great deal to the surreal collaborations of
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, especially the first film of the
program, `The Potted Psalm,','' Canby wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson also wrote two books, ``A Fly in the Pigment'' (Hallen,
1962) and ``The Dark of the Screen'' (Anthology Film Archives,
1980).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Nora Kasarda of Manhattan; a
sister, Phyllis Ziegler of Albuquerque, N.M.; and a grandson.

GOOD TIME TO HUG YOUR TV _ REALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You hear it so often when you're a television critic that it's
all you can do to keep from strangling somebody:
</P>
<P>
   `TV? Oh, there's nothing good on TV anymore.`
</P>
<P>
   People spout this knee-jerk nonsense with the smug confidence
that the good old days of ``Hello Larry'' were some sort of
cultural high-water mark. Which is fine - we always remember the
past as being better than it really was (watch any ``Gilligan's
Island'' rerun for proof).
</P>
<P>
   No, the thing that irritates me to the point of implosion is,
simply, this:
</P>
<P>
   They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of things to love about television, right now,
right in the middle of this supposed TV draught. Five of them
follow:
</P>
<P>
   _ DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES. At first blush, it seems as if one of
the reasons a great show like ``The Sopranos'' or ``The Simpsons''
captivates us is that it allows us to feel a little superior -
normal, if you will, happy that we don't have to balance a midlife
crisis with a career in the Mafia, or a job as an inspector at a
nuclear plant with an insatiable thirst for Duff beer.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, that turns out not to be entirely true.
Certainly the extremes don't apply to most families, most families
never having had to deal with a dad who gunned someone down or
invented his own religion (approved by God, no less). But at their
hearts, parents in shows like ``The Sopranos'' and ``The Simpsons''
(let's toss in ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' as well) struggle to keep
their families together, no matter how unorthodox their methods.
That struggle is what really makes them worth watching - and, one
hopes, identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   _ AARON SORKIN. This time last year I might have said David
Kelley. Or maybe Tom Fontana. The point is, there are some great
writers working in TV right now, and television is, if anything, a
writer's medium.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has gotten too cutesy, if not downright dumb, with ``Ally
McBeal,'' but ``The Practice'' is still riveting at times.
Fontana's middle name could be ``Gritty'' for ``Oz'' alone; toss in
the canceled ``The Beat'' (and let's not forget the late, great
``Homicide: Life In the Street'') and you've got a guy in touch
with the seamier side of life. In, you know, a good way. But ``The
West Wing's'' glistening gab and ``Sports Night's'' rapid-fire rap
lands Sorkin at the top of the writing heap. You could enjoy these
two shows almost as much without a picture. And that's just not
supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   HBO. Yes, it's cable, but there's no better network going. Great
as ``The Sopranos'' is, it's not the only think HBO has going for
it. We've mentioned ``Oz.'' Then there's ``The Corner,'' an
excellent look at the ugly life of a drug-infested Baltimore
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea rugged, violent drama is all you'll see
here. In the past year HBO has also shown a great biography of
Howard Cosell; ``American Hollow,'' a documentary about a
poor-but-proud family in Appalachia - even a fantastic kids' show,
an animated version of the classic book ``Goodnight Moon.''But
perhaps HBO's neatest trick is what it manages with ``Real Sports
With Bryant Gumbel'' - make Bryant seem likeable. (CBS' ``The Early
Show'' hasn't figured out how.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they show movies, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ SESAME STREET. OK, everyone knows it's been a great children's
show for years. But it took having a daughter of my own to make me
realize how many other good children's programs are out there.
``Blues Clues,'' ``Dragon Tales,'' ``Between the Lions,''
``Zoboomafoo'' _ you can name enough quality kids' programming on
one hand to make a pretty good argument for TV as baby-sitter. Not
that any right-thinking person would do so, mind you. Sure keeps
her attention, though.
</P>
<P>
   _TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. Many people argue that there is far too
much sex and violence on TV for kids. And it's true - you can't
reasonably argue the point. What you can do, however, is take
advantage of a high-tech marvel that allows parents to prevent
their children from seeing things on television they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's called an off button. Even with so many things to love
about TV, sometimes it's the best of all.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The nightly news is often full of stories about
violence and racial strife across the world and around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for the last five years, Jacqueline Sowell has loved
to wake up in the morning, put on her uniform and go to work as a
waitress in the coffee shop at the Holiday Bowl, a faded bowling
alley on a faded street in the faded Crenshaw district west of
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the Bowl renewed her faith. It showed her day after
day just how well people of diverse backgrounds and races can get
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a United Nations in there,'' she said the other day.
``Our employees are Hispanic, white, black, Japanese, Thai,
Filipino. I've served grits to as many Japanese customers as I do
black. We've learned from each other and given to each other. It's
much more than just a bowling alley. It's a community resource.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday, after 42 years of strikes,
spares and brotherhood, in Sowell's words, the Holiday Bowl was
closed. The building is being sold. According to the property
owner, Marshall Siskin, the bowling alley has been losing money for
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all things,'' Siskin said, ``it's reached a point where
it has to change.'' Maybe so, but not without a fight, Sowell said.
A few hours after the last balls thundered down the lanes, a group
of her neighbors, co-workers and friends were standing outside,
holding signs, declaring the Bowl ``A Landmark of Diversity'' and
urging the new owners and the city to ``Preserve Not Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing everything I can to save it,'' said Sowell, who is
46 and grew up in the neighborhood. ``I learned how to use
chopsticks in the coffee shop. We're trying to get a loan to make
it a worker-owned business.''
</P>
<P>
   The design of the building, with its sloped roof, plate glass
windows and orange and white facade, is another reason the Bowl
should be saved, said John English, a volunteer with the Los
Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit preservation group, which is
working with Sowell. English said the Bowl is an example of
``Googie'' _ a 1950's architectural style regarded as being born in
California. Sowell, English and their allies hope they can persuade
the city's Cultural Heritage Commission of the Bowl's significance
and make it harder for it to be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone admits the real significance of the Holiday Bowl is
not the bricks, but the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find at the Holiday Bowl,'' English said, ``is what's
best about Los Angeles, this incredible mix of people. You have
something that you can't just tear down and re-create somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl was built in 1958 by a group of Japanese-American
businessmen when the Crenshaw district was heavily Japanese. But
there were also blacks and Latinos, and the neighborhood, in those
days, was one of the most diverse in the city. The Bowl quickly
became a neighborhood landmark. ``Meet me at the Bowl,'' echoed
across the playgrounds and shops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as scores of other businesses and buildings were being
burned to the ground during the riots after the acquittal of Los
Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney
King, a group of regulars stood outside and told looters that the
Bowl was ``our place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only building around here,'' Sowell said, ``that
withstood the riots without so much as a broken window.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night it was time to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Nakamoto, 56, who was born in a Japanese-American internment
camp, had been going to the Bowl for 36 years. ``Everybody comes
through here eventually,'' Nakamoto said. ``The other day, a guy I
hadn't seen since high school came through. It's like one big happy
family. A lot of blacks and Asians have been bowling together for
40 years. The only color I see is on a bowling ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nakamoto talked, stroking his white beard, Barbara
Fisher-Shaw, an African-American who has bowled there for 12 years,
walked up and threw her arms around him and told him not to give
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fight on our hands,'' she said. ``But we're going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on a wall, was a list of the people who have bowled a
perfect score. The names reflect the diversity that has been at the
heart of the Bowl: Deguchi, Crist, Marshall, Washington, Smith,
Lee, and Furukawa.
</P>
<P>
   George Furukawa was the third person to bowl 300 at the Holiday
Bowl. ``I was one of the first people to come here, and now it
looks like I'm going to be one of the last,'' Furukawa said on
Friday night, sipping a beer at the bar crowded with old friends,
all of them with one eye on a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game
and one eye on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Furukawa is 83 and has not bowled since 1986 when a mugger's
bullet shattered his leg. But he still lives in the neighborhood,
and until last weekend he went to the Bowl ``every day unless I was
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, people began to cry and hug each other.
The ``Friday Five'' bowling league was still on the lanes. ``This
is where I grew up,'' said the league's secretary, Stacee Fujii,
33. ``I started when I was 8. My whole family bowled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As racial as everybody is these days,'' she continued, ``this
place is very integrated. To see it close, it's very emotional.''

and the saw could be a key link in proving premediation, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   She told police that she found 60-year-old Pomerantz shot to
death in their Scottsdale home and then dumped his headless,
armless, legless torso into a Mesa trash bin Jan. 27 because she
feared she would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Pape has refused to tell police how the body was dismembered,
and investigators have yet to find a saw, or Pomerantz's head and
limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to test a reciprocating saw on a cadaver, or
perhaps directly on bones, hoping to produce markings that match
those left on Pomerantz's torso, said the source, who declined to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, prosecutors may be able to show premeditation
because the evidence is said to show that Pape purchased the saw
from a Scottsdale hardware store weeks before Pomerantz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have bought several types of blades designed to
cut different materials.
</P>
<P>
   Reciprocating saws are generally used in demolition work to cut
through pipes and other strong materials, said Chase Westerman, a
tool department manager at a Phoenix area hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cut through any material with it,'' he said, adding
that the saws range from $100 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The motor is typically 18 to 20 inches long and has a blade, up
to a foot long, that moves back and forth to shred material.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're awkward and are hard to control,'' Westerman said.
``If someone doesn't have a lot of muscles in their arms, or if
they've never done it before, it can be really hard to use. It can
kick back at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A normal-sized person who just used for the first time
wouldn't be able to control if they didn't have a lot of strength
in arms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials believe that because of the saw's strength,
Pape could have acted alone in cutting up Pomerantz's body, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pape is 5-foot-4 and weighs 105 pounds, friends say the
Frenchwoman exercised vigorously. She is being held in a Maricopa
County jail without bail. &QL;

VICTIM'S WIFE HAD BOUGHT POWER SAW

<P>
   (Scottsdale) - When investigators examined the smooth, straight
cuts left on a torso found in a trash bin in January, they thought
somebody must have used a powerful electrical saw to dismember the
man's body.
</P>
<P>
   So detectives searched Ira Pomerantz's bar, trying to find what
they initially figured was a meat-cutting instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Although they found nothing there, they did find evidence in his
wife's purse that she bought a reciprocating saw late last year,
according to a source close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Pape, a 47-year-old former Scottsdale beauty salon
owner, faces first-degree murder charges in her husband's death,

STOPPING SHAQ IS NO SMALL MATTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Excuse Shaquille O'Neal during the Lakers playoff
series against the Suns if his eyes have a way of growing as large
as his game. O'Neal has oceans of ability, but concealing his
eagerness is not one of his practiced arts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is an unstoppable 7-foot-1, 335 pounds of pure
basketball force supposed to think when he turns around and feels
like he's being guarded by the munchkins?
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Gimme the ball.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And so they did Sunday, O'Neal overcoming a sluggish first
quarter to power the Lakers to a 105-77 victory over Phoenix in the
opener of their best-of-seven playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   One game down, one thing already obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson, ``Shaq looks real
dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the league has a good answer for O'Neal, but the Suns
- coached by his ex-Magic teammate Scott Skiles - elected to play
him straight up. Or as it's known in most NBA circles: basketball
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   After a physical series against the Sacramento Kings that
included frequent double-teaming, O'Neal must have thought he'd
just earned an invite to Club Med.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he often opposed by a single defender, but for most
of the night, it was a center in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   With Luc Longley in early foul trouble and playing just 17
minutes, O'Neal most often had to power over ex-Laker Corie Blount
(a forward outweighed by about 100 pounds), Cliff Robinson (a
forward who weighs 20 pounds less than Blount) and Rodney Rogers (a
forward a half-foot shorter).
</P>
<P>
   The results were what might be termed predictable. O'Neal
finished with 37 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots - all
game-highs.
</P>
<P>
   This after a miserable first quarter that saw him shoot 1 for 7
with three rebounds and a block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four minutes into the first quarter, I thought Shaq was
struggling to get up and down the court,'' Jackson said. ``The pace
was elevated, and we had to bring it down. I asked him how he was
doing out there, and gave him a little rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems it didn't hurt - he was 14 for 21 with 11 rebounds in the
29 minutes he played after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got too much rest last night,'' O'Neal said. ``I
haven't gone to bed before 11 in about eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't hurt his turnaround that he was being
guarded by all those little people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to play as physical as I can without getting in
foul trouble,'' Blount said. ``I mean, there's a way to stop him,
it's just not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's biggest problem in this series could be to restrain his
eagerness when he turns and sees who's guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a little bit antsy, but I have to be careful because I
know they're probably going to do some flopping,'' O'Neal said. ``I
just try to go straight up.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles figures there's no way to stop O'Neal, so it's better to
contain him as best one can in single coverage, and try to stop
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   For one game, it was left as a nice idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is Shaq,'' Skiles said. ``I know him as well as any
player in the league. He's the MVP. It's up to us to do something
now to slow him down.''

HITCHCOCK SAVES LEHTINEN FOR AVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars winger Jere Lehtinen was again scratched from the
lineup last night because of his injured right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   It likely was the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said if there had been a Game 6,
Lehtinen would have played. Since the Stars dusted off the San Jose
Sharks, 4-1 in Game 5 last night, Lehtinen should be ready to play
in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Lehtinen wasn't held out because of
overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is eliminate any gray area of the
injury coming back on the table again,'' Hitchcock said. ``I guess
the best way to describe it is there is comfortable soreness and
uncomfortable soreness. Our view is if he plays a hockey game
today, could he get up and play another one in two days?
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not able to say yes to that yet. But we're at the
verge right now where we could say yes in 24 hours or 36 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen again skated in the warmup before the game. He did so
in Game 4 as well, but said he was ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, pretty much, my ankle,'' said Lehtinen, who has
battled the injury since Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another player added to our club and we need a lot of
things to go our way. I don't think we're fooling anybody about
that.''  &QL; 
A vote for teammates
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Jere Lehtinen missed 65 of the Stars' 82
regular-season games likely ensured that he wouldn't win his third
consecutive Selke Trophy this season.
</P>
<P>
   So who does Lehtinen think should win the award for the NHL's
best defensive player?
</P>
<P>
   He likes a group of guys named Guy Carbonneau, Mike Keane and
Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of them should be considered,'' Lehtinen said.
``All the injuries this season and still our system pretty much
worked, and those guys did a pretty good job there.''
</P>
<P>
   The finalists for the award are Detroit's Steve Yzerman, St.
Louis' Michal Handzus and San Jose's Mike Ricci.  &QL; 
Playing with pain
</P>
<P>
   Neither Guy Carbonneau nor Jamie Langenbrunner practiced
yesterday morning, but both played last night.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau rarely skates on game day, but he took a hit to the
back of his head at the end of Game 4. He had tests done on
Saturday but was cleared to play. Langenbrunner is still feeling
the effects of a hit he absorbed in Game 2. He missed Game 3 but
played in Games 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a practice-only player,'' Hitchcock said. ``I really
doubt that he'll practice \Rfor the rest of the postseason\S.''  &QL; 
Muller tries singing
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Kirk Muller returned from San Jose on Saturday
afternoon like the rest of his teammates. He didn't get a nap like
most of his teammates did, though.
</P>
<P>
   His twin daughters were having a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   So Muller spent his day with 20 9-year-olds doing karaoke.  &QL; 
Familiar faces
</P>
<P>
   When Stars winger Kirk Muller is elavated from the fourth line
to the third line with Mike Keane and Guy Carbonneau, it will be a
reunion of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near the end of the games in Montreal, Carbo, Keane and I
would play in the last minutes so it's kind of a reunion,'' Muller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The trio all played for the Canadiens from 1991-94. Not that
Muller has ever been a regular on the checking lines _ he's
normally been an offensive forward _ but the adjustment isn't
drastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is who you are actually playing against,''
Muller said. ``You try to be a little more defensive-minded and
maybe not take too many chances.''  &QL; 
Praising the Avalanche
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Stars had much time to watch the other Western
Conference semifinal, where Colorado disposed of Detroit in five
games, but they know the Avalanche are patiently waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you beat a good team in five, you're doing something
right,'' Muller said. ``They've got a really solid team. They are
playing well defensively, and they've got guys who can capitalize
when there are opportunities on offense.''  &QL; 
Tickets available
</P>
<P>
   Dates haven't been set for the Western Conference finals, but
the Stars will play Games 1 and 2 against the Colorado Avalanche at
Reunion Arena. There are 1,100 tickets available for each game.
Tickets can be purchased by calling 214-GO-STARS or at

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitcher Justin Thompson, still bothered by
some soreness in his left shoulder, is scheduled to undergo an MRI
today. Thompson was able to play catch in the outfield yesterday
without problem, but said he still feels ``something grab me'' when
he pitches off a mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the dark about this as much as anybody,'' said
Thompson, who was examined by Dr. John Conway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson underwent arthroscopic surgery last Aug. 27 to repair a
torn labrum in his shoulder. The Rangers had hoped he would be back
in their rotation by now, but his 30-day medical-rehabilitation
assignment was brought to a halt 10 days ago after three starts
because of the soreness.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers keep insisting this is a bump in the road. The MRI
will determine that.  &QL; 
Gold Club strikes again
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center fielder Ruben Mateo has been having problems with
the windows in the newly built Gold Club behind home plate. The
problem occurred again yesterday on Jason Giambi's eighth-inning
line drive that Mateo misplayed, allowing Terrance Long to score
Oakland's seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened a couple of times,'' Mateo said. ``I saw the
ball, but then I lost it for two or three seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo turned toward right field, but the ball went toward left
field and he never had a chance to catch it.  &QL; 
First-base meeting
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates met before yesterday's game with trainers
Danny Wheat and Ray Ramirez and first basemen Rafael Palmeiro and
David Segui to determined a course of action to deal with their
injuries. Palmeiro has a strained hamstring, and Segui has a
strained hip flexor.
</P>
<P>
   Both should be limited to designated hitter, but Segui was at
first base yesterday for the second consecutive game even though
he's having as much trouble running as Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Oates wanted assurances from the trainers that having them both
continue to play won't get them hurt and won't keep them from
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we can't keep going like this all season,'' Oates
said. ``I left the meeting having been told, No. 1, they can't hurt
themselves any more and No. 2, they can get better. I'll just watch
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui went 1-for-3 yesterday to extend his hitting streak to ten
games. He also made a nice diving stop of Terrance Long's grounder
in the third inning.  &LR; subheds:Left-handed schizophrenia
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-handed starters have been tougher on left-handed
hitters than their left-handed starters, one of the bizarre twists
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing left-handed hitters are batting .179 against
right-hander Esteban Loaiza and .203 against right-hander Rick
Helling. But they are hitting .342 off left-hander Darren Oliver
and .353 off left-hander Kenny Rogers.  &QL; 
Rangers face Griffey-less M's
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers begin a three-game series against the Seattle
Mariners tonight. It will be the first time the Rangers have faced
the Mariners since they traded Ken Griffey Jr. to the Cincinnati
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey played 11 years for the Mariners. In that time:
</P>
<P>
   He hit .315 against the Rangers with 30 home runs and 101 runs
batted in. It was his second-highest batting average against any
American League team, surpassed only by the .317 he hit against the
Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .382 at The Ballpark in Arlington, his highest at any
park in the major leagues. He has nine home runs at The Ballpark,
tied for the fourth-most by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 61-77 against the Mariners.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro's home run yesterday was the 371st of his
career, moving him past Gil Hodges into 46th place all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo has an 11-game hitting streak, tied for the
third-longest by a Rangers rookie. George Wright hit in 15 in a row
in 1982, and Jerry Browne matched that in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have committed an error in six consecutive games.

RED SOX TEE OFF ON DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last year, Jeff Fassero had a slugging Junior Griffey
on his side. This year, he has a dancing El Guapo. Who can predict
the things that will improve the quality of a man's life?
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, the Red Sox lefthander who won four games in Seattle
while spending most of the summer as Griffey's teammate, improved
his record to 4-1 Sunday at Fenway Park with a 9-7 win over the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was abetted by three home runs and another
summons from the bullpen for Rich Garces, who has pitched in each
of Fassero's last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a miserable year _ there was nothing good about
it,'' said Fassero, who lasted six full innings for the first time
this season before departing with an 8-3 lead. Carl Everett's
three-run home run in the fifth put the Devil Rays five runs in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I pitched good, something went wrong,'' Fassero said.
``The whole year was miserable. It's something I lived with and
tried to forget about, all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   With a wide lead, Fassero gave way to a wider body: Garces,
whose importance to the Sox is expanding at the same rate his
uniform appears to be shrinking, judging by the way the fabric is
stretching. The spotlight in the Sox bullpen is justifiably upon
Derek Lowe, who was called upon to claim the last five outs after
lefthander Rheal Cormier gave up two-run homers in the eighth to
Vinny Castilla and Bubba Trammell.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who sent designated villain Jose Canseco back to the bench
with his fourth consecutive strikeout after Canseco had doubled
home Tampa Bay's first two runs in the first, survived errors by
Jose Offerman in the eighth and Wilton Veras in the ninth to record
his seventh save while lowering his earned run average to 0.93,
best among American League relievers.
</P>
<P>
   But while Lowe has been nearly unhittable _ he has yet to allow
a run in nine innings over six appearances at Fenway _ the closer
was the one who suggested that the floodlights should be on Garces,
who has been a Longfellow-sized bridge between the Sox starters and
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been loose this year,'' Lowe said of El Guapo, who also
hadn't allowed a run at Fenway in five appearances until he was
charged with one Sunday when he gave up a double to Greg Vaughn,
who scored on Castilla's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's even put out a couple of dances for us this year in the
bullpen,'' Lowe said, claiming that Garces gets down to the sounds
of the music blaring over the PA system. ``He's a pretty good
dancer. You'd be amazed. He's got quick feet, he really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were cat's feet that Garces showed when he struck out
Canseco, the last batter he faced, with a curveball that made a
statue out of the Tampa Bay strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd figure Pedro was pitching with the four strikeouts I had
today,'' Canseco said, alluding to Pedro Martinez's 17-K
masterpiece Saturday in a 1-0 Boston loss.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is a swizzle stick, of course, compared to Garces, but
the reliever, who plays a vital role on a staff on which Martinez
is the only starter certain to go more than five innings on any
given night, is beginning to feel some of the same love that
Martinez gets from the Fenway faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Boston have been very nice to me everywhere I go,''
said Garces, who has allowed just three hits and a run in 6 2/3
innings on the days Fassero has pitched, and in 11 appearances
overall has a 2.70 ERA. ``There are a lot of people out there
cheering for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mall, people call, `Hey, Guapo, how's it going?' I'll
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was still for the taking until sore-legged Nomar
Garciaparra got off the bench after Jose Offerman's two-out double
in the eighth and rifled a pinch single off the elbow of reliever
Roberto Hernandez, the ball hit with such force that it caromed
over the head of third baseman Castilla, allowing Offerman to
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it hit him,'' Garciaparra said. ``I was thinking Vinny
Castilla was going to catch it and I'm thinking, `Oh, great.' I was
concerned when I got to first base. You don't want to see anybody
hurt. I wasn't trying to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez appeared as if he were in a daze as he left the
premises. Did he see Garciaparra's liner coming?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt it,'' said Hernandez, who planned to have X-rays
upon the team's arrival in New York Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. ``I hope it's
not broken. My first move was to get in the dugout as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman scored the last run for the Sox, who have scored 40 in
Fassero's four starts. With that kind of support, the 2-0 deficit
he faced in the first after an infield hit, his own throwing error,
and Canseco's double didn't figure to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we score early it makes it nice,'' said Fassero, who got
the lead back after Veras singled home a run in the second, Trot
Nixon homered with a man aboard in the third, and Troy O'Leary
homered two batters later. ``The guys came right back. (Pitching
coach) Joe Kerrigan told me, `A lot of bad stuff is happening, but
keep them close and we're going to score, and that's just what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's enough to make the 37-year-old Fassero click his
heels himself.

NOMAR HELPS OUT IN A PINCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ You can talk to him about the football he used to kick
between goalposts or the futbol he used to kick past goalies. You
can talk to him about popular music he finds interesting (he likes
a singer named Macy Gray). You even can joke with him, as some Red
Sox certainly did in Cleveland when _ before entering their hotel _
they looked to the valet stand and saw his image gracing the cover
of GQ.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a subject and Nomar Garciaparra probably won't be stumped.
But if you want to have a conversation that lasts more than five
seconds, don't mention baseball statistics. The game's most
versatile great player hates talking numbers, especially when they
apply to him. Maybe that's a good thing because, after looking at
those numbers, you'll find that there really isn't much to say
beyond, ``You the man, Nomie.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Carl Everett said Sunday when he passed the
shortstop in the clubhouse. He didn't say it because of the
staggering numbers, numbers that show Garciaparra hitting .400 this
season with runners in scoring position; .500 when there are two
outs and runners in scoring position; and more than .400 after the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said it because of Nomar The Pinch Hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra began his Fenway Park afternoon as a spectator,
resting a sore left hamstring. The Sox were thumping the Devil Rays
in the eighth inning, 8-3, and it didn't appear that Garciaparra
would be needed. But that was before Rheal Cormier turned Fenway
into a green-tinted Coors Field. The reliever gave up two home
runs, transforming an easy win to a shaky, 8-7 Sox lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Garciaparra had begun stretching and taking
swings, just in case something happened. So he was ready in the
bottom of the eighth when Jimy Williams told him he'd be batting
for Darren Lewis. He approached the plate with two outs and a
runner (Jose Offerman) on second. It was the third pinch-hitting
situation of his career, and his second against pitcher Roberto
Hernandez. Last year, Hernandez struck him out to preserve a 5-4
Devil Rays win.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just numbers, and you know how he feels about
them, right?
</P>
<P>
   This is what Garciaparra was thinking when he stepped in against
Hernandez: ``Just trying to get a good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what 32,336 fans (plus Everett) were thinking: You the
man, Nomie.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he began his walk toward the box, Garciaparra heard
the cheers. He was getting a standing ovation. He noticed that
there seemed to be 30,000-plus in the park even then, with two gone
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing here,'' he said when reminded of the ovation.
``The fans don't leave. They could have easily left when we had a
good lead, when it looked like we were in control of the game. They
stuck around . . . we appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch Hernandez threw Garciaparra was a fastball. The
shortstop fouled it off to the right. On the next pitch, you would
have thought you were in Jacobs Field. Hernandez threw another
fastball inside to back Garciaparra off the plate. It was a good
pitch. It was a ball. But some fans booed, thinking it was a cheap
brushback. Garciaparra smiled about it later and said he didn't
have a problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have a problem with the third pitch, either. He hit it
up the middle, where it ferociously ricocheted off the right elbow
of Hernandez. The ball wound up at third base, and by the time
Vinny Castilla got it, Offerman had crossed the plate. Manny
Alexander then pinch ran for the unlikely pinch hitter and, again,
there was an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Everett jokingly offered to vacate his locker so more
media members could talk to Garciaparra. ``You all want me to
move?'' the outfielder said with a grin. And he said that without
knowledge of even more staggering numbers. Asked what he knew about
Garciaparra before coming here, Everett said, ``I knew he had 30
home runs as a rookie.'' He didn't realize that, last May,
Garciaparra hit 10 homers, drove in 33 runs, batted .355, and had
two grand slams in one game.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, those are just numbers. What Everett and everyone
else wanted to talk about was production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to see a guy go up there with an ache and still get a
hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Garciaparra left the park, he asked about Hernandez. ``Is
he OK?'' he said. The pitcher had to leave the game after being
struck by the ball. He talked after the game and said he was all
right, although he was to have precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   As for Garciaparra's health, he was able to run and field _
pain-free _ during Sunday's pregame routine. Everyone agrees that
he needs to be in the lineup Monday against the White Sox. Of
course, there are agreements for different reasons. Garciaparra
needs to play because sitting irritates him. Numbers-lovers will
tell you that he needs to play because of his 1999 assault on
Chicago: .571, 3 homers, 12 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Again: Those are just numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has batted leadoff in his career. He's been a No. 3
man. He's been a cleanup man. He's won a batting title. He's been a
productive pinch hitter. One day, someone will challenge him. They
will ask if he can be the next Babe Ruth and be great at all
aspects of the game. They will ask this man if he can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Can he?
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and answered, only half-jokingly, ``Yeah, if called
upon.''

BANK ON DRYSDALE OPTING FOR PREAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Neil Drysdale is nothing if not reserved, and
the trainer displayed his customary caution Sunday when he refused
to commit Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of Saturday's Kentucky Derby, to
the Preakness at Pimlico May 20, the second leg of the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the little matter of the $5 million bonus
that goes to a Triple Crown winner to consider. So, cautious or
not, you can bet Drysdale and Fusaichi Pegasus will arrive in
Baltimore next Wednesday, barring a disaster. Fusaichi Pegasus will
stay at Churchill to train before being shipped to Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fine this morning,'' said Drysdale. ``Somebody dropped
something and he bounced. So, he was nice and bright this morning.
We have to see how he comes out of this race first before we go on
to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fragile animals, and sometimes something shows up in
the wash. So, literally, we'll just go one step at a time. We've
got to just see how he is the next few days. We've got to watch
him, and monitor him, and make sure he's training well. He's fine
this very minute in time, but all he's done is go for a walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, the 2-1 ($6.60) choice, put on one of the more
impressive runs in the 126 years of the Derby, coming from 15th
place to score under a hand ride in the rapid time of 2:01 for the
1 1/4 miles. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, he broke a 20-year jinx as
no favorite had won the Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness is run over a track notorious for tight turns, and
Fusaichi Pegasus is a big horse. But why worry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's pretty handy, and you can do what you want with
him,'' said the English-born Drysdale, 52. ``I mean, it was quite
obvious Sunday there was going to be a cracking pace. There was no
concern for him lagging along in the back. He's got natural speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very satisfying. This is a very talented horse, and he
looks like he's got a very bright future in front of him. It was
very rewarding to watch that talent come through. So, we'll keep
our fingers crossed, and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 150,000 people at Churchill Downs, and only
one thought Aptitude should have won the Derby: Aptitude's trainer,
Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude ran a terrific race to finish second at nearly 12-1,
beaten just a length and a half, but Fusaichi Pegasus was under a
hand ride, and to suggest he could have been beaten is laughable.
Frankel was miffed that rider Alex Solis came off the rail and let
Desormeaux and Fusaichi Pegasus through. However, that happened
just a half-mile into the race. What was Aptitude's excuse for the
rest of the journey, which brought him practically even with
Fusaichi Pegasus at one point in the stretch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, Alex rode a good race,'' said Frankel.
``But Desormeaux took the gamble, and that was the difference of,
maybe, winning or losing. I'm not saying I would have beaten him. I
take my hat off to him. Desormeaux rode a great race, and Neil did
a great job with him. I feel real good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, a closer, will be held out of the Preakness, go back
to California to train, and point toward the Belmont Stakes June
10. ``He's fine,'' said Frankel. ``I'll just train him up to the
Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, whose future lies on the grass, was a major
disappointment, finishing 14th as the 9-2 second choice. He's going
back to California to race on grass, and will head for the Del Mar
Derby on the turf Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give him a month to kick back,'' said trainer
Jenine Sahadi. ``His temperature was normal, and he scoped clean
after the race (no bleeding in the lungs). I don't have any
excuses. Maybe that last race (a win in the Santa Anita Derby April
15) took a little more out of him than we thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look dead or wiped out. He didn't do any running.
He got a lot more dirt kicked in his face (Saturday). In his last
two races (including the San Felipe, when he ran second to Fusaichi
Pegasus March 19), there had been smaller fields.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most trouble in the Derby came when Wheelaway, at 20-1,
crossed over in front of Captain Steve, an 8-1 shot, and herded him
to the inside while the field was turning for home. Captain Steve,
who had just taken the lead at the quarter-pole, was completely
shut off. The incident didn't help either horse, as Wheelaway fell
back to finish fifth and Captain Steve faded to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse was running big at the five-16ths pole,'' said John
Kimmel, who trains Wheelaway. ``Richie (rider Richard Migliore)
called on him a little too hard a little too soon. Otherwise, we
might have gotten a solid third . . . The winner stamped himself as
exceptional. He made no mistakes and got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wheelaway (who had run third in the Blue Grass April
15) was just one performance short of a good effort. When I have
him ready, he'll really unleash a big one. He is going to be a
force in this division. He may not be up to Fusaichi Pegasus, and I
was also impressed with Aptitude's run, but it's a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting how the performance of Fusaichi Pegasus put the
word ``maybe'' on the lips of opposing trainers. Only powerhouse
trainers D. Wayne Lukas, who will send High Yield (15th in the
Derby), and Bob Baffert, who will send Captain Steve, would commit
to the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hedged were Todd Pletcher, who is considering sending
More Than Ready (fourth) and/or Impeachment (third); Kimmel, who is
pondering Wheelaway's future, and Hal Rose, the 88-year-old trainer
of Hal's Hope (16th). The rest of the Derby field appears headed
home.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new faces for the Preakness, Red Bullet, trained by Joe
Orseno, is a legitimate contender. He won the Gotham and ran very
well when second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial, both run
at Aqueduct. Red Bullet, a son of Unbridled, did not race as a
2-year-old and was held out of the Derby to wait for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to give it a try are Snuck In (trained by Steve
Asmussen), who won the Rebel and was second in the Arkansas Derby,
and Kentucky Derby trial runner-up Sun Cat, trained by Lukas. It is
unlikely the Preakness field will number more than 10 . . . Derby
2000 established wagering records across the board. A total of
$9,726,912 was bet on-track; off-track wagering was $55,606,088.
Wagering on-track for the 10-race card was $19,967,162, while the
off-track handle was $81,386,383. The total for the race was
$65,333,000, and for the program $101,353,745.
