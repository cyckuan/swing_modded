<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Calls for Financial Rectification  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Commercial banks should establish a self-restraint mechanism
and a mechanism for guarding against risks," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of commercial banks found speculating in stocks on
credit or doing extra-account business will be removed from the
the post, Zhu warned.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a political and ideological education and
professional training among bank employees.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and departments must not intervene in the
business of banks or approve the establishment of financial
institutions without authorization, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Through the joint efforts of various sides, financial risks
can be prevented and warded off and the financial industry can
develop steadily, making a greater contribution to national
economic and social development," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with deputies from the Tibetan Autonomous
Region, the Vice-Premier said that it is a reliable guarantee for
the Tibet's long-term stability and prosperity to maintain in the
region political stability, economic development, unity among
ethnical groups and social progress.
</P>
<P>
It is also a big issue that concerns the safeguarding of
national safety and stability, as well as the overall situation of
modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He commended the region for achieving an economic growth rate
of over 10 percent for two years in a row and reporting a good
agricultural harvest for nine consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee and the State Council are very
concerned about the development of Tibet, tilting more toward the
region and other areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in transfer
payment and in the arrangement of key construction projects, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"Though there are difficulties in the economic work of Tibet,
</P>
<P>
... we certainly can achieve sustained economic growth and
social stability in Tibet by relying on people of various ethnic
groups and bringing into full play the initiative of officials at
all levels and people of all communities," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that the government will bolster its effort to rectify the
country's financial order and urged commercial banks to cut
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with deputies to the Eighth National
People's Congress from eastern Fujian Province, Zhu said that the
banking sector must make a greater effort to rectify the financial
order and prevent financial risks, in order to cut the ratio of
the banks' non-performing loans by two percent annually in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
"If a bank cannot meet this requirement, its president will be
held accountable," said Zhu, who is a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector has over the years played an important
role in promoting national economic development and in maintaining
social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must be sober-minded and recognize existing
problems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The problem of delayed repayment of bank loans and interest is
fairly serious, he said. Some state-owned enterprises and a fairly
large number of key construction projects begin to suffer losses
and are forced out of production soon after they go into
operation, increasing the amount of bad assets of banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some non-banking financial institutions are very poor in terms
of asset quality and are exposed to great financial risks for
violating business rules, raising funds illegally, extending
loans at high interest rates, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
If proper measures are taken from right now, risks can be
prevented and warded off, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank, the People's Bank of China, will
this year regard financial supervision as the most important part
of its work.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadians have given federal and
provincial governments failing grades for their handling of
environmental issues, a recent poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
The federal government got an average rating of 4.8 when
Canadians were asked to mark its overall performance on
environmental issues on a scale of one to 10. The provinces earned
an average rating of 4.7.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Insight Canada Research in November for
Environment Canada, is considered accurate within 2.9 percentage
points 19 times out of 20, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians were troubled by
the state of the environment, and most expressed serious concerns
about the potential damage brought by global warming.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent said they were concerned about climate change
and the damage it could do to the lakes and forests of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The majority (86 percent) of Canadians polled said they were
concerned about the fact that Canada will not meet its

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The deepening of economic
restructuring should start with reform of the economic system,

He suggested the establishment of a mechanism in the country's
investment system to minimize investment risks; establishment and
development of a capital market; and increase of macroeconomic
controls.
</P>
<P>
He said that reform of government departments and change of
government functions should be made to separate the functions of
the government and the enterprise.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in Canada climbed
10.5 percent in February, with Japanese brands leading the way and
nearly all automaker reported gains.
</P>
<P>
Canada's overall auto sales last month rose to 87,285 from
79,315 a year earlier. It's the sixth straight month of sales
increases.
</P>
<P>
The momentum suggests that optimistic industry forecasts --
five percent or more gains this year -- may prove true, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
In February, Ford Canada sold 20,593 vehicles, 17.1 percent
more over the same month last year. It saw a 32.5 percent increase
in minivans, pickups and sport-utility vehicles, and 4.8 percent
decline in car sales.

"Meanwhile, continuous efforts should be made to promote

countries and regions, to continue to ensure Hong Kong's leading
role in the economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past 17 years, the relationship of
mutual complementarity and benefits between Hong Kong and the
interior area has exerted a profound influence on Hong Kong's
development.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Hong Kong must continue to seek the support of
the interior area in order to maintain its economic prosperity
and stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a brilliant economic situation in the
interior area will provide the strongest guarantee for Hong
Kong's development, and the strategy of developing central and
western China will broaden the developing space for Hong Kong's
industrial and commercial circle.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, continuous improvement of the market economic
structure in the interior will add harmony to our cooperation in
the fields of finance, trade and investment, tighten our economic
ties, and strengthen our market links," he said.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed his conviction that beyond 1997 the
concept of "one country, two systems" would be successfully
realized in Hong Kong, which would make Hong Kong still more

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong tycoon said in Beijing
today that in order to maintain and promote economic stability and
prosperity, Hong Kong should preserve its advantages as a global
economic metropolis, and seek continuous support from the interior
area.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Tsin Tong, one of the top 25 men of wealth in Hong Kong,
made this remark at the Second Plenum of the Fifth Session of the
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, of which he is a Standing Committee member.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present Hong Kong enjoys public stability and
economic prosperity, and a smooth transition is gradually turning
into reality.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond 1997, Hong Kong will enter a new phase of development,"
he noted. "It has posed a new challenge for Hong Kong to find a
way to maintain and consolidate its status as an international
centre of trade, finance, shipping, information, and tourism,
while promoting a rapid economic growth in the interior area to
achieve mutual prosperity."
</P>
<P>
As an international free port, Hong Kong has conspicuous
advantages and characteristics of a global economic metropolis,
which should be well preserved to ensure the region's stability
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, Hong Kong should continue to make every effort to
draw all sorts of foreign capital, and provide substantial legal
protection and support for every foreign investor that runs
business in accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Housing Project in E. Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said here today that the much-criticized housing project
in East Jerusalem is a "most natural" decision which would
accommodate both the Jewish and Arab needs for housing.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the project in Har Homa has actually been
"overblown," Netanyahu complained at a joint press conference held
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak following their two-hour
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here earlier today, exactly a week after Israel
decided to build 6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa, a tree-covered
hill in East Jerusalem, taken by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, trying to downplay the negative side, said
that there is no other way to give much-needed homes to residents,
both Arab and Jewish, in the city, but to build new houses for
them.
</P>
<P>
"They have nowhere else to go... Jerusalem is a living city and
it has to expand," he said, adding that Israel has devoted 50
million U.S. dollars for building infrastructures in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that along with the 2,500 Jewish homes, Israel also
decided to build 3,000 houses for Arabs and 70 percent of the Har
Homa project is "private Jewish land."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said it would be the first new settlement in
Jerusalem, where Israel wants to have as their "eternal and
indivisible" capital. The former Israeli Labor government, under
pressure, had decided to postpone any decision on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mubarak publicly disagreed over whether peace
agreements between Israel and Palestine block Israel from building
new homes for Jews in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Though the Israeli leader denied that Oslo agreements forbid
such buildings in Jerusalem, Mubarak chipped in to say the fifth
article of Oslo provided that any decision on the holy city should
be put off until the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, apparently had failed to convince the Israeli leader
of the "complications of the peace process in the future," warned
that the Har Homa issue is likely to put the "final status" talks,
due to start within a few weeks, in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders looked tense and even angry on occasions during
the 30-minute news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said his talks with Netanyahu also dwelt
with what should be done and voiced his belief that Jerusalem issue
is sensitive, but could be solved.
</P>
<P>
"we are resolved to exert further efforts in order to move
ahead," he added.

<HEADLINE> Three Arrested for Murder of Hun Sen's Relative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Three men have been arrested
and charged with the murder of Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen's brother-in-law, police official said at a press conference
today.
</P>
<P>
Mok Chito, chief of the Phnom Penh municipal criminal police,
named the three suspects as Suos Kasem, 26, Prum Meanrith, 37, and
Srun Vong Vannak, the 30-year-old security chief of the Khmer
Nation Party led by former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Mok Chito said Vannak promised 50,000 U.S. dollars to Suos
Kasem if the latter could kill Kov Samuth, deputy director of the
Interior Ministry's economic department whose wife is the sister
of Hun Sen's wife.
</P>
<P>
According to Mok Chito, Suos Kasem accepted the deal and was
offered 2,000 dollars, a motorbike, a pistol and a magazine of
cartridge at a place near Wat Phnom. The three followed Kov Samuth
three times in 10 days before Suos Kasem shot and killed Kov
Samuth and escaped to Tralok Bek, Tuol Kork.
</P>
<P>
Kov Samuth exited a Phnom Penh restaurant in the morning of
November 19, 1996, when a waiting assassin shot him six times.
</P>
<P>
Suos Kasem returned later to Phnom Penh and went to the KNP
office in a bid to meet Vannak for the rest of the reward for the
murder, and after being told Vannak was not in the office, he went
first for hiding in Poipet and moved to other places afterwards,
Mok Chito said.
</P>
<P>
Suos was quoted as saying that "after learning Hun Sen's
declaration that the murderer would be accorded lenient treatment
if he exposed the man behind the murder, I decided to hand in
myself to the police."
</P>
<P>
Mok Chito said following Suos Kasem's confession, the police
investigated his statement and arrested Srun Vong Vannak on
February 14 and Prum Meanrith on February 17 after concluding that
Suos is the real killer who shot dead Kov Samuth.
</P>
<P>
Mok Chito said the court issued warrants to arrest Vannak and
Meanrith and charged three with deliberately planning the killing.
</P>
<P>
Mok Chito attributed the delay in making public the case to the
detainees' demand for secrecy and safety and said the police are
searching the man behind the murder as they do not not believe
such man as Vannak has an amount of money as large as 50,000
dollars to pay for Suos Kasem.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Housing Project in E. Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Viewed as an Israeli bid to
tighten grip on the third holiest city of Islam, the Har Homa plan
already sparked wide-spread Palestinian demonstrations and
worldwide criticism.
</P>
<P>
In case that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat makes good on his
threat to declare the Palestinian state if Israel goes on with the
plan, Mubarak said that Egypt would consult with "Arab brothers"
in the Arab League and comes up with a decision.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also pledged his commitment to the U.N. Security
resolutions 224 and 338 as the base for future talks, despite what
he termed as "different interpretations" with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"We stress commitment to go ahead on the peace road with the
Palestinians and other parties in the Arab world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nine months into office, Netanyahu said Israel has fulfilled
several obligations under the Hebron agreement, such as release of
Palestinian woman prisoners, ease of closure on the West Bank and
Gaza as well as financial transference to the Palestinian
Authority in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On economic cooperation, Mubarak denied that he has imposed
restrictions on Egyptian businessmen to do business with the
Israeli side, but implied that the peace prospect has its impact.
</P>
<P>
Besides Jerusalem, the talks between Mubarak and Netanyahu also
dealt with the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, frozen for 12
months. Mubarak was expected to urge Netanyahu to come up with a
new formula to persuade Syria to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no details and only said he would discuss these
proposals and ideas during talks in Washington with U.S. President
Bill Clinton on March 10.
</P>
<P>
This is Netanyahu's second visit to Egypt since he assumed
office last June. Since then, Mubarak has conditioned inviting the
Israeli leader to Cairo on progress on the Palestinian-Israeli
talks on the long-delayed Israeli partial pullback from the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed the Hebron withdrawal under the January 15
agreement with the Palestinian National Authority. It is committed
to starting the first stage of redeployment in rural areas of the
West Bank before March 7, a date Israel very likely to delay
because of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Netanyahu precedes Mubarak's March 10 trip to
Washington, which would also deal with the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, is the first Arab
country to make peace with Israel, in 1979, but ties remain cool
between them.
</P>
<P>
At a time, Israel accused Egypt of hamstringing the
Palestinians on reaching the Hebron agreement and tried to exclude
Egypt from mediation.

<HEADLINE> Japan's '97 Budget Clears Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's fiscal 1997 budget was
passed by the 500-member House of Representatives today with the
backing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its two
parliamentary allies -- the Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the 77.39 trillion yen (645 billion
U.S. dollars) budget, the biggest ever in Japan, paved the way for
its effective enactment by the end of the current fiscal year
without the need for a stopgap budget.
</P>
<P>
The general account budget of fiscal 1997, which goes from
April this year to March 1998, is three percent bigger than the
initial budget for fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
The planned rise in consumption tax from 3 to 5 percent in
fiscal 1997 and the abolition of special tax breaks will generate
an additional 5 trillion yen (42 billion dollars) in the revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to issue 16.71 trillion yen (139
billion dollars) in bonds to help finance the expenditure, a fifth
less than the amount raised through bonds in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
General expenditure is set at 43.81 trillion yen (365 billion
dollars), with 4.95 trillion yen (41 billion dollars) going to
defense, 1.17 trillion yen (10 billion dollars) to official
development assistance, 9.74 trillion yen (81 billion dollars) to
public works projects and 14.55 trillion yen (121 billion dollars)
for social security costs.
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes obligations such as servicing the
national debt, 16.8 trillion yen (140 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget, which has been sent to the upper house for debate,
is certain to become law at midnight on April 3 even if the upper
house fails to act by then, because the Japanese Constitution
stipulates that the budget is automatically enacted 30 days after
the lower house passes it and sends it to the House of
Councillors.

<HEADLINE> Latest German GDP Data Shows Economic Stagnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy stagnated at the
end of last year, as GDP figures for the final quarter showed
virtually no change from the third quarter, federal authorities
said today.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product in the third quarter of 1996 was 2.3
percent higher than in the same period in 1995, and GDP as a whole
for 1996 grew by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The silver lining was a 4.1 percent growth in capital
investment in the final quarter, although the rise for 1996 as a
whole was 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest data supported the pessimistic outlook by economic
institutes for the country's economy in early 1997. The
Berlin-based DIW Economic Research Institute claimed Germany's
GDP might fall 0.25 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt said the stagnation at
the end of 1996 was "by no means a new weakness in growth", and
stuck to the government's projection of 2.5 percent GDP growth for
1997.
</P>
<P>
But some less optimistic experts have pointed out a lack of
stimulus for the German economy, citing a slowdown in the
construction sector, weak consumer demand and moderate growth in
public spending. They noted that economic performance now rests
solely on exports, which hit a record 784.3 billion marks (461
billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Official data manifested a 1.4 percent decline in government
spending in the fourth quarter last year on an annualised basis, even
though as a whole in 1996, an increase of 2.4 percent was
registered.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected a halt in growth in public spending this year
in view of the government's bid to trim social welfare and to keep
budget within the limits required for the launch of the EU single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption was up slightly by 1.3 percent in 1996, but
that was seen as inadequate to boost economy this year taking
declining real income into account.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Reshuffle Can't Save Ukraine's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 5 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma's cabinet
reshuffle on February 25 isn't enough to save Ukraine's ailing
economy, a Ukrainian lawmaker said here today.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Deputy Yuri Buzdugan said the shake-up of the
government could not accelerate economic reforms, because
President Leonid Kuchma was likely to fill influential positions
not with experts, but with people loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma dismissed four ministers on February 25 amid growing
concerns about the performance of the Ukrainian economy.
</P>
<P>
He fired Finance Minister Valentin Koronevski, Economics
Minister Vasil Gureyev, Statistics Minister Alexander Osaulenko and
Valeri Malev, Minister of Machine Building, Military-Industrial
Complex and Conversion.
</P>
<P>
Koronevski and Osaulenko were sacked for their poor performance
while the dismissals of Gureyev and Malev were explained by their
transfer to other work. But the state-run Ukrainian Television
News said the depressing state of the country's economy was the
reason behind the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
At a closed-door cabinet meeting on February 21, Ukrainian
Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko attacked the four dismissed
ministers by name and also criticized the work of the Ministry of
Industry, the Ministry of the Coal Industry, the State Committee
for the Food Industry and the State Oil and Gas Committee.
</P>
<P>
The dismissals must now be followed by wholesale reform of the
Finance Ministry and the Economics Ministry, said a Western
economics adviser to the government who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the two ministries were full of old
bureaucrats with a Soviet mentality. He said, "They don't have the
vaguest idea about the role of these ministries in a free-market
economy."
</P>
<P>
At the February 21 meeting, Lazarenko blamed the Finance
Minister Valentin Koronevski for the banking system's inability to
satisfy even the short-term credit needs of the economy. Credit
has dried up as Ukraine has restricted money supply to rein in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also complained that the government did not
have a clear picture of economic conditions. "Data from the
Statistics Ministry does not permit judgements about the state of
the economy," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> All-Cypriot Parties Say Yes to Inter-community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Political party leaders from both
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus met today and decided to
facilitate direct contact between community leaders to assist a
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at the Ledra Palace Hotel in the United
Nations-controlled buffer zone, and was attended by all Greek and
Turkish Cypriot parties except the major Turkish Cypriot National
Unity Party.
</P>
<P>
Gustave Feissel, U.N. Secretary-General's deputy special
representative for Cyprus, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, read out by Feissel after the meeting, said
that the parties voiced support to the U.N. efforts to facilitate
"the urgent convening of direct negotiations between the two
communities on an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, political party leaders themselves agreed to make
"every effort" to help establish direct contacts and telephone
communications between leaders of the two communities, the
statement asserted.
</P>
<P>
It added that they also agreed to co-sponsor in mid-1997 a
bicommunal concert by renowned Greek and Turkish composers, Mikis
Theodorakis and Zulgi Livaneli.
</P>
<P>
Feissel described such meetings as "absolutely helpful in the
U.N. efforts for a settlement" and said the parties, which
represent the totality of the island, have a very important role
to play in bringing about an overall settlement on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
What is important, the U.N. envoy noted, is that "they (the
parties) are determined to overcome their differences and
facilitate the work" of the two communities' leaders who have to
negotiate the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Feissel called for more regular meetings of this kind and said
they are "a step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control of the northern third of the island in
the wake of short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Shocked over Renault's Handling of Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
today that he was "shocked" by the method used by French automaker
Renault to announce its plans to close a plant in Belgium with the
loss of 3,100 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The closure of an assembly plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium, was
announced last Thursday by Renault secretary general Michel Davy
de Virville, as part of restructuring plans which, according to
union reports yesterday, will also lay off 2,764 workers in France
this year.
</P>
<P>
Renault announced the drastic restructuring plan after
registering a five billion franc (one billion U.S. dollar) loss in
1996 which it blamed on the globalization of the auto market and
fierce competition from other European automakers.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe has summoned Renault chief
Louis Schweitzer to a meeting over the way the announcement
was made about the closure of Vilvoorde plant, in which the French
state has a 46 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, speaking ahead of the meeting later today, said that
the way Renault made its announcement "was not the right one,"
said French government spokesman Alain Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
"I want to open a period of discussion and dialogue, and a
search for alternative solutions in respect of the procedures and
rules of the (European) Community and in Belgium and France," said
Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He said that while taking into account the "industrial logic"
and the "constraints of international competition," Renault should
also keep in mind the "human dimension" when carrying out its
restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
"Renault should remain a great international enterprise... But
at the same time, one should not neglect the human dimension. The
method adopted (by Renault) is no good," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said he is also in touch with his Belgian counterpart
Jean-Luc Dehaene over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Karel van Miert, the EU commissioner for competition, said
Renault had failed to notify unions of its plans as laid down in EU
directives.
</P>
<P>
He said Renault did not take into account community directives
in deciding to close the Belgian factory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French union Force Ouvriere (FO) today called on
Renault to re-examine its production plans, shorten its working
week, adopt early retirement and employ more young workers.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Renault is not isolated. All the automobile
constructors in Europe have the same difficulties," said FO in a
communique.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Asks Council to Approve ITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) today
approved the terms of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA)
which were agreed during the negotiations in Geneva over the
weekend and presented it for adoption to EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The outline of an ITA deal was agreed among WTO countries at
their Ministerial meeting in Singapore last December, but they
left several issues outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, they decided to continue working until countries
representing 90 percent of the world IT trade were on board. This
target has now been exceeded with the decision by Malaysia,
Thailand, India, Romania, Estonia and Macao to present their
offers this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Declaration provides for IT tariffs to be
eliminated in four steps by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the EU and the U.S. decided to negotiate between
themselves a balanced additional acceleration of tariff cuts in
semi-conductors and other areas.
</P>
<P>
This, too, has been achieved: the EU will cut semi-conductor
tariffs in three stages by 1999, and the US will eliminate tariffs
on 2.6 billion US dollars worth of EU exports in July this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU semi-conductor industry will become a full
participant in the agreement reached between US and Japan
semi-conductor companies.
</P>
<P>
If the draft agreement is adopted by EU ministers, it will
enable the EU to commit itself definitively by the end-of-March
deadline fixed at Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Elsie Leung on HK Future Legal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung, Secretary of Justice
of the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), said in Beijing today that it is her firm belief
that Hong Kong would be able to maintain its existing systems and
legal spirit, and safeguard human rights and independence of
justice.
</P>
<P>
Leung made this remark at a meeting of legislators from south
China's Guangdong Province, who are here attending the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the success of 'one country, two systems' in Hong
Kong, we will maintain its existing legal system," she said,
adding that her duty is to help the HKSAR government manage Hong
Kong according to law, maintain its existing legal system, and
ensure that the essence of the common laws, especially the spirit
of equality before the law and the rule of law, be preserved and
developed.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that she had been greatly honored to be appointed
Secretary of Justice of the first HKSAR government, and defined
her role as a legal advisor to the chief executive and other
government departments.
</P>
<P>
"All my colleagues in the Department of Justice are highly
professional and dedicated to their duties, and I believe that
with their cooperation, the establishment and operation of the
legal system in the HKSAR will proceed smoothly," she noted.
</P>
<P>
She vowed to safeguard the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the
common laws, and dauntlessly perform her duty with conscience
and impartiality.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Basic Law, she said, the NPC has given
the HKSAR the power of legislation, justice independence, and the
power of final adjudication, while only six national laws will be
applied in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the central government has granted the SAR great
legal independence, as long as the Basic Law is not contravened,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She finally said that the NPC decision to retain most of Hong
Kong's existing laws has not only maintained Hong Kong's current
systems and policies, but also ensured the region's status in
international trade, for foreign businessmen can continue to
invest under a legal system they are quite familiar with.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Expects Remaining Khmer Rouge to Join Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh said here today that he expects the remaining
Khmer Rouge will join the government soon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the headquarters of the Funcinpec, one
of the ruling parties in Cambodia's coalition cabinet, Ranariddh
said that the remaining Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng may join the
government in the coming few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said "Let the Khmer Rouge come back into the national
society under the umbrella of the King (Norodom Sihanouk), who is
the head of state and father of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Asked about Ta Mok, Khmer Rouge's chief of staff, who is
reportedly conducting negotiations in Anlong Veng with a team of
the government officials, Ranariddh reiterated his support for
creating an international tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders for
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
A team of government negotiators has been in the Khmer Rouge
territory since February 14. Deputy Chief of Staff Niek Bun
Chhay said that the talks will be positive in the coming five
days.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh gave a positive comment to Khmer Rouge leader Khieu
Samphan's alleged support to the 14 clauses of the platform of the
National United Front (NUF), a recently-formed political alliance
that groups the Funcinpec Party, the faction of the split
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party led by Son Sann, the Khmer
Nation Party and the Khmer Neutral Party. Ranariddh is the
president of the NUF.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Khmer Rouge sent their message to him
expressing their hope to join the national community and their
worry that Anlong Veng might become another Samlot, where the two
coalition partners, the Funcinpec and the Cambodian people's Party
engaged in contest to win over breakaway Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The first prime minister also confirmed that he had a luncheon
with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, saying "this is a show of our
will to maintain political stability in the country."

<HEADLINE> New York Police Expected to Switch to New bullets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- New York police are expected to
switch to more lethal hollow-point bullets which appear to be
safer for the general public, the New York Times reported today
quoting an announcement of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
A hollow-point bullet expands on contact with human flesh, so
it kills or incapacitates more often than a conventional bullet.
And unlike a full metal bullet, it does not pass through a body or
ricochet, endangering bystanders.
</P>
<P>
"The hollow-point ammunition is the law enforcement standard in
every major metropolitan area. It protects both the police and the
citizens and replaces the dangerous military full-jacketed
ammunition," the report quoted Police Commissioner Howard Safir as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, after a series of shootings in which bystanders were
hit by police bullets, the department commissioned a study, firing
off 100,000 rounds of four or five different kinds of bullets, and
chose the hollow-point as the most effective. The department has
already earmarked 500,000 U.S. dollars to buy 9 million of the
bullets.

<HEADLINE> N. Mogadishu Religious Leader Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ali Dhere, the
dismissed religious leader in North Mogadishu, has been
reinstated as the chairman of the Supreme Islamic Penal Court.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Prof. Ali Mohamed Gedi, the
spokesman for the Chairing Committee of the Conflict Solving
Conference within North Mogadishu Communities.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali Dhere was relieved of his chairmanship position in
the Supreme Islamic Penal Court of North Mogadishu last October
when North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed issued a
decree reshuffling the whole Islamic legislation. Sheikh Ali
Dhere dismissed the decree as illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
The decree has since led to armed confrontations between the
supporters of the two leaders in North Mogadishu and all
the Islamic courts in the city has been paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
Instability has also increased in North Mogadishu where
thieveries and armed banditry have returned back to the streets.

<HEADLINE> Asian Investors Flock to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Asian
businesses are putting more money in Europe, hoping to get access
to advanced technology and skills, according to a report of the
Journal of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment by the developing nations of Asia
jumped to an annual average of 864 million U.S. dollars in the
1995-96 period from 100 million U.S. dollars in 1989-91.
</P>
<P>
Asian investments were mainly in the European Union, which is
the world's single-largest market for goods and services and the
globe's largest recipient of foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The top deal in the last three years was the 347 million
purchase of Britain's Copthorne Hotels Holdings Ltd. by Hong
Kong's CDI Hotels International Ltd. in 1995. The second-biggest
deal was Daewoo Motor Co.'s 340 million U.S. dollar acquisition of
a Polish truck manufacturer in the same year. Another company from
the Republic of Korea, Korean Petroleum Development Corp.,
followed with the third-biggest deal when it invested 324 million
U.S. dollars in Texaco Inc.-U.K. North Sea of Britain in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The attraction of Europe is the growth tied to Central and
Eastern Europe, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Asian companies also want access to Europe's advanced
technology and skills and the research and development programs of
its corporations, the report said. The top European destinations
for Asian company investments are Britain, Germany and the
Netherlands, with Central and Eastern European countries growing
in importance.
</P>
<P>
Asian investments have been in both manufacturing -- especially
in electronics -- and in services. Textiles and apparel, leather,
chemicals and toys are also popular sectors for Asian investors.
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian investors in Europe, Hong Kong was the leader
with a 340 million U.S. dollars annual average during 1992-94,
mostly in the Wholesale and retail trade.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea and Taiwan are close behind. Korean
companies have shifted from trading activities to specific
manufacturing sectors, largely in electrical and electronic
products, the report said.

<HEADLINE> OECD Refuses to Intervene in Renault Decision to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said today that it is powerless
to intervene in the plan by French automaker Renault to close its
assembly plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Belgium today decided to lodge a complaint against Renault with
OECD, which has a code on multinational cooperations opposing
abrupt closure of plant and mass layoffs without pre-warning.
</P>
<P>
OECD said that its code on multinational cooperations does not
have the power of law for punishing those who do not follow it.
</P>
<P>
Belgium accused Renault of failing to observe an OECD code
which says: "The enterprises which plan to bring to their
activities alterations that could have heavy consequences on
employment, especially in the case of closure, should inform it
reasonably beforehand to the representatives of workers and public
authorities."
</P>
<P>
But the code also accommodates that in certain "isolated"
cases, it can be hard for enterprises to inform in advance the
employees its decision to close a plant.
</P>
<P>
OECD said that it cannot directly intervene in the dispute
between Renault and the Belgian government, which it said should
be dealt with on the levels of governments, enterprises and unions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
It also said that it does not have the "mandate" to
"mediate" between the two sides of the dispute or "make
judgement on the behavior of this or that enterprise."

<HEADLINE> Asthma Medicine Could Harm Eyes, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The large doses of inhaled steroids
people take to control asthma can significantly raise their risk
of developing glaucoma, a Canadian study said today.
</P>
<P>
The study of 48,118 Canadian patients over the age of 65
reviewed prescription and treatment records for patients who
consulted ophthalmologists.
</P>
<P>
The study found that patients who used high doses of inhaled
steroids for three months or longer were 44 percent more likely to
have treatment for glaucoma or high pressure in their eyes than
people who did not use the steroids or used them in small doses.
</P>
<P>
A high dose is about 1,600 micrograms of inhaled steroids daily
(the equivalent of eight puffs from an inhaler), according to Dr.
Samy Suissa, the McGill University epidemiologist who headed the
two-year study.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no increased risk seen in patients who used
moderate amounts, below 800 micrograms a day, Dr. Suissa said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study appear in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, there has been a trend to increasing doses of
steroids. At least 10 percent of the patients studied were using
dosages of 1,600 or higher.
</P>
<P>
"The message we want to give is that people should not stop
using steroids...They are very effective. But those who use
steroids, they should have their eyes regularly examined," Dr.
Suissa was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
If high levels of steroids are essential for treatment, there
are drugs that can control the pressure in the eye, Dr. Suissa
added.

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged Congress to pass a bill making it illegal for
non-immigrant foreigners to carry or buy firearms and announced
that new proof-of-residency requirements for legal aliens buying
guns under current law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the call less than two weeks after a Palestinian
opened fire on tourists at the Empire State Building in New York
City, killing one people and wounding six before fatally shot
himself.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian had been living in a Florida motel for just
three weeks on a tourist visa before buying a gun there.
</P>
<P>
The new rules Clinton announced in the White House would
require a photo ID plus some other proof, such as utility bills,
that the applicant has been in the country for three months.
</P>
<P>
In today's ceremony, the president also resubmitted to Congress
"cop-killer bullets" legislation preventing the development and
manufacture of armor-piercing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president signed a directive requiring that
all guns carried by federal law enforcement officers be equipped
with child safety locks.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 124,000 federally licensed gun dealers in
operation in the country, selling millions of guns to American
residents. Deaths from street gun-fire and fire-armed robberies
often occur.

<HEADLINE> Border Blocade Hampers Swazi Supermarkets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Major supermarkets in Swaziland
have complained a remarkable drop in sales due to protestors' blockade
of goods coming in and out of the kingdom, Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
SABA quoted Radio Swaziland as saying that supermarkets in Mbabane,
the capital of Swaziland, are the worst affected by the blockade
sponsored by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) and
banned political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which is in suport of
SFTU, also reportedly took part in the siege, blocking trucks from
entering and leaving the tiny kingdom at two main border posts with
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the OK Supermarkets, one of the biggest
in Mbabane, said earlier that sales in his shop had dropped
by almost 80 percent this week. The fall had been worsened by a
national strike which lasted one month, he added.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU-launched nationwide strike was designed to force King
Mswati III to agree to multi-party democracy and improve working
conditions. enditem

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Proposes to Create Foundation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Council
(government) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have proposed to
create a Swiss Foundation for Solidarity to be financed with a
portion of profits from revaluation of the SNB's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Swiss government today in
Bern, no precise data can yet be released on money available to
the foundation since this depends on profits from revaluation of
the SNB gold reserves as well as on the timing foreseen for the
plan. But foundation assets of about seven billion Swiss francs
(about five billion U.S. dollars) are envisioned.
</P>
<P>
The SNB's gold reserves on hand are estimated at 2,600 tons.
Their bookkeeping value amounts to 5000 francs (about 3500 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram while their market value is about 17,000
francs (about 12,140 U.S. dollars) per kilogram. As foreseen by
the Swiss Committees for Economic Affairs and Taxes, such a
correction in value would allow a release of 14 billion francs
(about 10 billion U.S. dollars) in total. The release of such a
sum is liable to change in case the price of gold collapses due to
a surplus flow of gold on the market.
</P>
<P>
In order to start the foundation, Articles 38 and 39 of the
federal constitution must be amended, the SNB law must be revised,
and the legal basis for a public-law foundation must be created,
according to the press release. The Federal Council and the SNB
will strive to see that the foundation commences activity in 1998
if Parliament and the people agree.
</P>
<P>
As its name suggests, the press release says, the foundation's
goal would focus upon people in need, victims of catastrophes in
Switzerland and abroad, victims of genocide, torture, and other
violations of human rights (including victims of the Nazi
Holocaust and needy descendents) as well as support of
institutions involved in preventing the crisis situations
described.
</P>
<P>
As for the special fund of 100 million francs (about 71 million
U.S. dollars) created last week, it is for swift aid only to
victims and their descendents of the Holocaust.

LUANDA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola will achieve the goal of
substituting some imported products with home-made ones this
year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Industry Minister Manuel

</P>
<P>
Duque said production will be restored this year in one third

</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the government will increase the
tariffs for imported goods, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of industrial facilities in Angola have been
destroyed by its 19-year-old civil war and almost all products
the angolan people need have been imported. enditem

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Adult Education Meeting Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 delegates from the
Commonwealth Association for the Education and Training of Adults
(CAETA) today started a three-day meeting in Harare to discuss ways
of developing adult education and training in poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The conference will seek ways of bridging the gap between the
rich and the poor through education and training for self
reliance and economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
It will also deal with gender issues, health, agriculture,
worker's education, and access to various training methods such as
distance education and open learning.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Director and Resident Representative of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO) Anderson Shankanga said about one billion
adults worldwide, two thirds of them women, are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
He said programs on the empowerment of women should give
priority to expanding educational opportunities for women and
eliminating prejudices and stereotypes that both limit their access
to adult education.
</P>
<P>
He added an international meeting on adult education would be held
in Hamburg, Germany, from July 14 to 18, this year to discuss the
plight of adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chancellor of University of Zimbabwe Graham Hill said due
to many budgetary constraints, economic hardships and poverty in
general, many Commonwealth countries were finding it hard to make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''It is through education and training of adults that
we are able to reduce the degree of poverty for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
CAETA is an independent professional association which brings
together both individuals and organisations within the Commonwealth
who are concerned with education and training of adults. enditem

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Create Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a free trade area
will speed up the eventual creation of a common market in southern
Africa, experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
A professor of agricultural economics Glenn Magagula and economics
lecturer Vakashile Simelane from the University of Swaziland said in
a joint paper that the free trade protocol signed by member countries
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) last August was
a clear indication of the region's recognition of need to integrate
the region's economy and stimulate trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at a three-day consultative conference on
developing strategies for food security in southern Africa, they said
the majority of SADC states had now recognised that a process towards
elimination of all barriers to intra-regional trade was in the
region's best interest.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the protocol provided a framework for reform
measures aimed at the liberalisation of intra-regional markets and
implementation of mechanism for a phased withdrawal of tariff and
non-tariff barriers on goods and services originating in member
countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Strike at Hezbollah Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes rocketed this
afternoon guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in south Lebanon. There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli jet fighters, covered by another two planes,
carried out the raid around 4:00 p.m. (14:00 GMT) at Iglim
Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, an area often used by
Hezbollah militants as a springboard for attacks on the
Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli warplanes
fired two air-to-surface missiles at Wadi Mugaisbeh, between the
towns of Kfarmalki, Barti and Baslya in the area, some 60
kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The air raid followed frequent reconnaissance flights of the
Israeli warplanes at a low altitude over the areas of Nabatiyeh
and Iglim Al-Toffah in the central sector of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Israeli air strike at the same area since
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the radio station of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia reported this afternoon that a
position of the SLA in Jezzine, south Lebanon, was attacked by
the guerrillas, but no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
However, today's air raid did not go beyond a daily trade of
fire between the Israeli forces, the SLA and the resistance
guerrillas on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel has established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security
zone" stretching from the Lebanese-Israeli border northward, and
armed the 2,500-strong SLA to patrol the buffer zone.

BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will grant
Iraq as a gift 30 tonnes of medicine soon, the Iraqi news agency
(INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Manal Younis, chairwoman of the Iraqi General
Federation of Women, as saying that Italy made the offer during
her just-concluded visit to Rome.

During her meeting with officials of the Rome-based World Food

The United Nations has imposed sanctions against Iraq since
the end of the Gulf War in 1991 to drive Iraqi troops out of its
oil-rich neighbor of Kuwait. The embargo-stricken country has
since then been in bad need of food, medicines and other
necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> Germany Insists on Strict Adherence to Euro Criteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German government today stressed that
the convergence criteria for qualifying for the planned single
European currency, the Euro, must be "strictly" adhered to by the
European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Wednesday by German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel on the progress of the European Monetary Union, Bonn
painted a generally positive picture of the efforts being made by
EU member states in order to qualify for the Euro, which is due to
be launch on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of Greece all the member states are now
striving to fulfill the convergence criteria in the year 1997,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
States wanting to join the Euro club are required to meet five
criteria under the EU Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
One of the rules is that a member's inflation rate should not
exceed a 1.5 percent limit over the inflation average of the three
countries with the lowest inflation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland registered the
lowest inflation rates, averaging 1.1 percent. That means the
maximum inflation rate should be 2.6 percent. Ten of the 15 EU
members had achieved that goal, while Britain and Portugal, with
inflation rate at 3.0 percent, were slightly above it, according
to the Bonn report.
</P>
<P>
On the criterion for long-term interest rates -- two percent
above the average of the three states with the lowest rates, the
1996 maximum stood at 8.7 percent. Eleven EU members, the same 10
meeting the inflation rule plus Britain, met this requirement,
Bonn said.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU members' performance on the Maastricht
criterion on public finances was less good according to the
report. Only four countries, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, met the rule limits a state's budget deficit at a
maximum three percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The EU-wide deficit-to-GDP ratio averaged 4.4 percent last
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Bonn report also described EU countries' efforts
to meet the rule on national debt as "generally speaking
unsatisfactory". Under that rule, a EU state is required to bring
its overall national debt to less than 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn report comes about one year before the decision being
made over which EU member states can make the first wave to join
the Euro club. That decision will be based on complete economic
data of 1997.

<HEADLINE> US TV Stations to Switch to All-digital Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- All TV stations in the United
States can begin the transition from current analog technology to
all-digital broadcasting within the next decade thanks to the
production of a new line of professional television studio
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The new line of television studio equipment that Japan's
Sony Corporation introduced today can produce digital,
high-definition programming, is also regarded as the first major
product introduction for cameras, monitors and related equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Government set an industry-wide standard for digital
broadcasts last December, and later this month, the Government is
going to temporarily assign each of the nation's 1,600 TV stations
a second channel for digital, high-definition television
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that TV stations in the nation's 10 largest
cities have been required to install the new equipment quickly
and begin broadcasting digital programming within one year. And
at least four TV stations around the country are already operating
experimental high-definition systems.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials React Angrily With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
reacted angrily with Israel's decision to close four Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem, warning that this could kill the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police today served letters of warning to the four
offices, which Israel believed to be run by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA). Israel has declared that it would take
necessary steps if the offices did not shut down automatically.
</P>
<P>
The orders of closure were issued Tuesday night by Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. He said these offices had
violated the Oslo accords which barred Palestinian official
activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, PNA Minister of
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini denied the offices were linked
to the PNA. He blasted Israel's move as violation of peace accords,
warning that if Israel continued doing so, the PNA would not be
able to continue the peace path.
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, whatever the Palestinian National Authority will do
if Israel goes on with their policy, this peace process will
die," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman echoed the
warning, saying Israel's decision to shut down these offices
would lead to violence and confrontation. "If closing these
civil offices, they will have Hamas and Jihad in Jerusalem," he
said, referring to the two militant Islamic organizations which
have been launching attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the issue of Jerusalem should be settled
at the final stage of peace negotiations. He also urged the
Israeli government to be "realistic" on the issue, because "this
is a Palestinian city."
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials continued defending the decision to close
the Palestinian offices. Moshe Fogel, director of government
press office, said that the offices were in violation of the
Oslo accords. "We expect the Palestinians to live up to their
commitments and not to introduce any institutions or Palestinian
offices in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, brushed aside the threats of violence by the
Palestinian side. He said that Israel was "doing the right
thing" and would not be deterred by any kind of threats or
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel was demanding reciprocity from the
Palestinian side in order to proceed forward with the peace
process. "Before we proceed with our next step in the peace
process, we expect the Palestinians to do something they are
obligated to do, and among the things they are obligated to do
is closing these offices," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Fogel indicated that the Israeli government ordered closure of
the PNA offices because it would be impossible to carry out
further troop withdrawals in the West Bank in face of the strong
pressure from the rightist members within the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet is to hold a special meeting Thursday to
decide the scope of the first stage of the three-phase troop
redeployments, which should be completed within this week under
the Hebron agreement signed in January.

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Qatar today hailed the
establishment of diplomatic ties with Bahrain, according to a
report by the United Arab Emirates' news agency WAM from the
Qatari Capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari cabinet today welcomed an agreement signed by Qatar
and Bahrain to open embassies in either country and stressed the
necessity to boost bilateral relations between the two sides,
WAM said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain agreed Sunday to set aside their
long-standing territorial dispute and establish diplomatic ties, 26
year after the two countries gained independence.
</P>
<P>
The long-time dispute between Qatar and Bahrain is over
territorial water boundaries and a string of islands and reefs, as
well as Zubara in northwestern Qatar, where ancestors of Bahrain's
ruling family lived 200 years ago. The islands are under Bahrain's
control but are claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar brought the dispute before the Hague-based International
Court of Justice in 1991, while Bahrain insists on a regional
solution.

<P>
ATHENS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Athens' main "weapon" in its bid to
host the 2004 Olympic Games is the virtually universal support for
the city's candidacy from Athenians and the Greek people in
general, Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Avramopoulos, who is a member
of the committee responsible for promoting Athens' candidacy,
praised "the unity of spirit" prevailing among all parties
involved in the city's bid.
</P>
<P>
Avramopoulos expressed guarded optimism about the chances of
Athens being included on the International Olympic Committee's
(IOC) shortlist of four or five candidate cities for the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will announce the shortlist in Lausanne Friday. Cities
included on the shortlist will continue to vie for the event until
September 5 when the winner will be announced.
</P>
<P>
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said recently that in
addition to the necessary infrastructure, the eleven candidates
must be able to convince the selection group that the general
population backed a particular city's candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Italy Sign Agreement on Return of Axum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
today announced that an agreement was signed between the
Ethiopian and Italian governments on the return of the Axum
obelisk, a historical relic, taken 60 years ago by the fascist
Italy under Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
A statement quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency said, the
agreement was signed by Ethiopian Vice-foreign minister Tekeda
Alemu and his Italian counterpart Rino Seri.
</P>
<P>
A 13-member Ethiopian delegation led by the vice-minister has
attended the meeting convened in Rome by the joint committee set
up to facilitate the return of the Axum obelisk.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a communique issued by the two parties has
stated that the obelisk now standing in Rome will be returned to
Ethiopia before the end of 1997 and the Italian government has
agreed to work to this end in line with the accord concluded.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the return of the historical relic, including
transportation and the choosing of the site for its erection will
be done in accordance to the agreement, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry today also announced
that the Ethiopian government, upon the return of the obelisk to
its historical owner, will present a gift to the Italian
government as a token of the relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Axum obelisks are most striking relics of ancient Axum kingdom
established about 2,000 years ago in Axum, an ancient city
located 600 kms north of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
They are made of single blocks of granite carved in the
representation of multi-storey buildings. The Italian aggressors
looted one of Axum obelisk in 1937.

LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia needs 80 billion Kwacha
(about 62 million U.S. Dollars) to retrench public employees in
order to reduce public expense, Vice President Godfrey Miyanda
told parliament here today.

He said that this year 20 billion Kwacha is needed to retrench
3,000 public employees.

employees continue to account for a disproportionate share of the
budget and the government will correct this.

<HEADLINE> UK's Main Oppositions Agree on Reform Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's two main opposition
parties, Labor and Liberal Democrats published today a document
setting out a program for wide-ranging constitutional reform
during the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the present first-past-the-post system, votes are cast in
single member seats and victory goes to the candidate with the
highest number of votes.
</P>
<P>
At the 1992 general election the Liberal Democrats won just 20
seats in the 651-member House of Commons despite polling more than
one-sixth of all votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives have won overall majorities in four
successive general elections without polling more than 44 percent
of the vote in any of them.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of change in the opposition parties have been
considering the many options used in other countries - from
national lists to multimember constituencies and hybrids.
</P>
<P>
"There's been no trading of policy," said a participant. "It's
all been about finding the wildest possible areas of agreement."
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties also agreed on the main reforms,
which include referendums on devolution for Scotland and Wales,
and removal of voting rights for hereditary peers in the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreed program, they will be replaced, in time, by
life peer on the basis of the national vote in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader,
nor Labor Leader Tony Blair attend the launch of the agreement for
fear of turning it into an election issue.

PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) --- The Saudi Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ben Abdel-Aziz began today a two-day visit in France to seek
closer military cooperations between Saudi Arabia and France.
</P>
<P>
"We will grapple with the issue of partnership between Saudi

other sectors," said Prince Sultan after a meeting with his
French counterpart Charles Millon today.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, who is also vice prime minister of Saudi Arabia,

countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Prince Sultan and Millon refused to comment reports that
France is trying to sell its Leclerc armored vehicles to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Middle East, both Sultan and Millon

ATHENS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Battles are raging in the southern
Albanian town of Delvino between rioters and the army, while the
conflict is expected to spread to Sarande, according to a report
this afternoon from the Athens News Agency (ANA) correspondent in
Gjirokaster.
</P>
<P>
The wounded have been taken to hospital in Sarande and
eyewitnesses say there must have been casualties, although there
have been no deaths reported as yet.
</P>
<P>
Military reinforcements from Gjirokaster have been forced to
turn back as the roads to both Delvino and Sarande have been
blocked by demonstrators. Sarande has been surrounded and at any
moment the military is expected to move in against the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
A later ANA dispatch from Gjirokaster said that the operation
in Delvino began at 10:30 local time, when heavily armed troops
and plainclothes policemen moved into the town, saying that they
had no order to shoot.
</P>
<P>
When they saw armed civilians however, they reportedly opened
fire without warning, leading to a prolonged exchange of fire with
armed residents.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, reports said that oxygen bottles and other
medical supplies were being sent from Greek island of Corfu to
Sarande hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- License issuing offices for
big and small scale miners in Tanzanian will shift from central
Dodoma to the capital towards reducing red tape encountered by
applicants.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today at a four-day workshop on
priority work programs including mineral rights grants, safety
and environmental inspection and revenue collection in the city.
</P>
<P>
When opening the workshop, Minister for Energy and Minerals
Abdallah Kigoda said there have been internal and external
complaints from prospecting big and small scale miners caused by
bureaucratic practices by the Dodoma based offices which could
only be solved if the offices were transferred for close
supervision in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said bureaucracy, coupled with corrupt practices among
mineral officials had so far denied the nation the necessary
revenue apart from retarding development in the mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda cautioned there is need to have deliberate efforts in
creating conducive environment to improve the mineral sector
against the present trend whereby Tanzania is a mineral
extracting field whose benefits are enjoyed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He directed mineral officials in the country to start creating
ways of reducing license issuing red tape at district level.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned against application of dynamite in
extracting minerals which he said had so far caused serious
environmental destruction apart from claiming human lives.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, sponsored by the World Bank, is being attended
by 90 delegates from six mineral zones in the country and
government departments.

<HEADLINE> Rinderpest Epidemic Spreading in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An epidemic of rinderpest is
currently sweeping across the Kenyan border into Tanzania with
potentially devastating consequences for the eastern and southern
Africa, a U.N. report said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest February report of "Food Supply Situation and Crop
Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa" distributed by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that the epidemic has been
moving from endemic areas in northeastern Kenya and Somalia
across eastern and southern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that rinderpest would sweep through Tanzania
and on into southern Africa unless checked.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, last October an outbreak of a disease
with clinical signs of rinderpest was detected in the Nairobi
National Park.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Kenyan government notified the FAO of the
new outbreak of rinderpest which was later detected in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A survey indicated that the disease was affecting both cattle
and wildlife near the Nairobi National Park and the wildlife was
being affected more seriously.
</P>
<P>
In 1994/95, Kenya experienced an outbreak of rinderpest which
apparently affected only wildlife in the national parks of
southeast Kenya with a loss of about 50 percent of the buffalo
and 80 percent of the kudu populations in West Tsavo National
Park.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Kenya News Agency reported that Kenya
and Tanzania had succeeded in controlling a rinderpest outbreak
hitting the border areas between Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 head of cattle have been vaccinated and the
epidemic has been under control owing to the cooperation between
the two neighboring countries, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Issues Stark Warning on British Eurosceptics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan has warned Britain's ruling
Conservative Party that any attempt to play a Eurosceptic card in
the coming general election would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Guardian newspaper, Brittan
said that an anti-European electoral stance would not only fail
to woo voters but eventually undermine Britain's position in the
crucial negotiations of the European Union's (EU)
Inter-Governmental Conference as well.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, a former British Conservative minister in the 1980s,
said: "Those who think they can make Euroscepticism into an
election issue by putting clear blue water between Conservatives
and Labor are making a big mistake."
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that (the Conservatives') any move towards
Euroscepticism will be pretty rapidly followed by the Labor Party.
As a consequence, whoever wins the election will have a difficult
hand to play in the Inter-Governmental Conference end-game," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who is also EC's trade commissioner, argued that while
Europe had benefited from the British example, Britain had also
reaped significant benefits from its EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"Again and again we see the fact that countries the size and
weight of Britain play a minor part in negotiations, but because
of Britain's position in Europe it is able to play a major role
and has been successful in persuading the EU to take a liberal
line," he added.

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat has expected that the United States could impose some
pressure on Israel so that the Middle East peace process could be
brought back on track, but what he got during his Washington visit
was only oral criticism from President Bill Clinton and nothing
more.

construction of Jewish housing in Arab east Jerusalem.

Arafat said on Tuesday at the National Press Club, Washington,
D.C., that he has no alternative but to push the peace forward,
and just peace agreed by former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and himself. Today he repeated his determination for that
peace goal.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking for the moon. I am asking what has been signed,
what has been agreed upon, to be implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would rather have continued his work with Late Rabin
who was assassinated in November 1995 by a right-wing Israeli
Jewish extremist.
</P>
<P>
As for the incumbent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
the leader of hard-line Likud group, Arafat said he was pressured
by "the fanatical groups in his coalition."
</P>
<P>
As the result, he said, Netanyahu's policies have pushed the
Middle East situation on the verge of Danger.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Strikers Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 Swazi
agriculutral and forestry workers returned to work today after a
month-long stayaway called by the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions (SFTU), informed sources reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike, which began on February 3, was intended
to force the Swazi government to meet 27 labor and political
demands, including the lifting of a 24-year-old ban on political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite strike suspended after four top SFTU leaders,
who had been on trial on charges of spearheading the national
stayaway, were acquitted on February 26.
</P>
<P>
However, the present situation in the tiny kingdom appeared to
be far from normalized between the government and the SFTU, with
a meeting between the two sides's negotiating teams being
postponed this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted unidentified Swazi
officials as saying that the postponement of the meeting might
have been caused by government anger at the SFTU's participation
in blockading Swaziland's borders on Monday this week.
</P>
<P>
Sales in major supermarkets in Swaziland have reportedly
dropped sharply due to protestors's blockade of goods coming in
and out of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the SFTU, the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, which is in support of the SFTU, also reportedly took
part in the siege, blocking trucks from entering and leaving
Swaziland at two main border posts with South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Divests 182 State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 182 state-owned
enterprises were divested in Ghana by the end of 1996, including
18 joint ventures with foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Siegfried Sedziefa, public
relations manager of the Divestiture Implementation Committee, as
saying that the country's divestiture program is an ambitious
attempt to inject private capital and technology into the
economy.
</P>
<P>
It is also to reduce the size of public sector and improve the
performance of state-owned enterprises by mobilizing private
sector management, Sedziefa said on Monday in Accra, capital of
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian and foreign firms not on the register were invited to
participate in the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sedziefa, such firms are to submit the full names
of their firms, addresses and contact details, date of
establishment, and list of directors and shareholders or
partners.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to submit the names and addresses of bankers
and auditors, and a statement of their firms' capabilities, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Korea Peace Proposals Begins in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Republic of
Korea and the United States started their meetings here today to
discuss proposals for the proposed four-way talks aimed at a peace
treaty formally ending the war on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was pleasant, they were all very pleasant with
another," New York Foreign Press Center spokesman Kenneth Bailes
told reporters. Bailes observed the start of the meeting in a
conference room in Manhattan's Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's schedule was reportedly modest, the
meeting itself was significant because it was reportedly the first
time in more than 20 years for the officials from Pyongyang and
Seoul to have sat in the same room to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told reporters that the meeting began with members of
the three delegations shaking hands, exchanging small talks and
pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, described by the U.S. State Department as a "joint
briefing," stemmed from last April's proposal to DPRK by U.S.
President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-Sam
for four-way talks including China to work out a peace agreement
to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 war on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A witness told reporters that South Korean delegation head,
deputy minister for political affairs Song Young Shik told his
DPRK counterpart Kim Gye Gwan that Wendesday's meeting "is a
significant event." Kim is vice minister for forein affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation is headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Charles Kartman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the New York meeting was convened at
the request of Pyongyang, which wanted more information on
Washington and Seoul's proposals for the four-way talks.
</P>
<P>
But the actual negotiations are not expected to start until
July or so, a senior American official said earlier in the week.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Currency Depreciates Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian currency shed 33 Cedis
in one week, opening Monday at an average rate of 1,820 to one
U.S. Dollar from 1,787 last week, the Ghana News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted currency dealers in Accra, the Ghanaian
capital, as attributing the depreciation of the local currency to
high demand for hard currency to pay for imports, amidst low
export earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Cedi exchanged at 12 to one Dollar ten years ago, after
the country decided to fully liberalize the economy, now
considered by multilateral finance institutions as one of the
most vibrant on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report reaching here today, the CFA
Franc, which is the legal tender in 13 French-speaking African
countries, also dropped considerably, averaging 575 to one Dollar
from the nominal rate of 565.7, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Dakar, Senegal, on Tuesday, the currency exchanged at 560
(buying) and 590 (selling) to one Dollar, compared with 551 and
581, respectively, last week.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Settlements Violate International Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Setting up Jewish settlements in
any Arab lands, including East Jerusalem, is a violation of
international law and U.N. Security Council resolutions, Osama
al-Baz, political advisor to the Egyptian President said today.
</P>
<P>
It also contradicts with Israel's commitment to the agreements
on the transitional phase, Baz told reporters following the talks
between President Hosni Mubarak and visiting Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who arrived here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak has failed to convince Netanyahu of
complications and difficulties that might arise in future peace
talks if Israel is bent on building 6,500 Jewish homes in Har
Homa, a tree-covered hill in East Jerusalem, taken by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Palestinians and Israelis should avoid taking any
measure unilaterally which can derail the final status
negotiations," Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Under Palestinian-Israeli agreements and relevant U.N.
resolutions, such issues as Jerusalem, settlements, refugees,
pending border problems and economic cooperation are left to the
final status, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No party is allowed to adopt unilateral measures which could
affect the outcome of final status negotiations in one way or
another," he added.
</P>
<P>
Establishing Jewish houses in the Palestinian territories could
make the Arabs and Palestinians lose confidence about the peace
process and would in no way assist coexistence, the Egyptian
official said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after their two-hour talks, Mubarak
and Netanyahu disagreed publicly over whether the 1993 Oslo
agreements forbid new Israeli construction in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Article 5 of the Oslo agreements states that
no decision should be made on the status of Jerusalem until the
Palestinians and Israelis come up with an agreement in the "final
status" talks. But Netanyahu said it does not even mention
Jerusalem and concerns only with the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Labor government had postponed the settlement
under international pressure.

<HEADLINE> Canada Seeks WTO Panel on Australian Salmon Imports Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada will ask the World Trade
Organization (WTO) for a dispute settlement panel on Australia's
ban on imports of uncooked salmon, the Canadian government said
today.
</P>
<P>
The request for a dispute settlement panel will be made
formally to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body on March 20, the
government announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Australia introduced a new quarantine measure that
prohibited the import of uncooked salmon products, which requires
imported salmon to be either heat treated or canned.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Canadian exports of fresh, frozen or chilled
salmon were virtually banned from the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the dispute, Canada held a number of technical
discussions with Australia, but little agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Canada requested WTO consultations with
Australia to settle the problem. The consultations were held in
the following month, without reaching a resolution.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Australia announced that it would
maintain its current ban on uncooked salmon products.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's position is that the ban cannot be supported on
scientific grounds and is inconsistent with Australia's
obligations under the WTO," Canadian International Trade Minister
Art Eggleton said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian salmon producers in British Columbia have been
unfairly denied access to Australia's market for over 20 years,"
Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin said, adding that he "strongly
supports" the decision to request a WTO panel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinian Tenets Eliminating Israel Annulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The American Jewish community
here said today that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat informed
community leaders during their meeting that Palestinian tenets no
longer call for elimination of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, meeting with 11 Jewish leaders before holding talks at
the United Nations, said that the 29 offending paragraphs were
deleted because they were not consistent with the peace accords or
the Oslo agreement, spokesman Howard Squadron for the Jewish
leaders group said.
</P>
<P>
"He said publicly that the offensive paragraphs are not there
and have been annulled and that a Palestinian legal committee was
working on a revised charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Squadron said the Jewish leaders asked Arafat to direct
communications with the Israeli government and not to ask external
groups like the United Nations, the United States and the European
Community to intervene for support.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that there should not be a resort to external
pressures, but communications should be conducted directly between
the parties. (Arafat) was totally in agreement on that idea, so we
are very much consistent on that idea," Squadron said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat indicated that he would prefer to deal directly with
Israel and the controversial housing project the Israeli
government decided to carry on in east Jerusalem would not have
become a disputing issue if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had consulted with him beforehand, Squadron said.

<HEADLINE> Renault President Agrees to Consult Belgians on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the French automaker
Renault Louis Schweitzer said this afternoon that he will consult
"without delay" with the staff of Renault's Vilvoorde plant in
Belgium over his plan to close the plant, which will result in a
layoff of 3,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
Following a one-hour meeting with French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe, Schweitzer said that the consultations will focus on
measures of compensation or even redeployment of the plant.
</P>
<P>
He said that Renault will be committed to all the rules of the
European Union, France and Belgium over plant closure and mass
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe
expressed their displeasure over the way Renault decided to close
the Vilvoorde plant, as well as its plan to lay off 2,764 workers
in France this year.
</P>
<P>
Renault's plan triggered angry protests from Belgium and
criticism from the European Union, and has met with strong
opposition from both rightwing and leftwing parties in the French
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nine hundred Belgian workers from the Vilvoorde plant today
marched to a Renault plant in Douai, northern France, to protest
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said in a communique this afternoon that he has asked
Schweitzer to "engage without delay in all the useful
consultations within the framework of the Belgian law and European
legislation" with "all the negotiating partners concerned, the
staff of the enterprise, and the local and national authorities of
Belgium."
</P>
<P>
He said that he has also informed his Belgian counterpart,
Jean-Luc Dehaene, about the contents of his meeting with
Schweitzer and the promises the latter has made.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Renault to hold dialogue with the representatives
of its staff on its plan to lay off 2,764 French workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 130,800 cases of
cancer will be diagnosed in Canadians this year, and some 60,700
Canadians will die from the disease, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
This year's level of cancer cases is expected to be 36 percent
higher than that of 1987, and the number of deaths about 25
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
"The total number of new cases and deaths for all cancers has
risen largely as a result of a growing and aging population," the
federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 71 percent of new cases and 80 percent of
deaths this year will occur among those who are at least 60 years
old.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer will kill more Canadians than any other form of
cancer in 1997, 10,600 men and 6,300 women.
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer will again be the most commonly diagnosed
cancer among men, with an anticipated 19,800 cases, which is more
than double the level a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The most frequent diagnosis among women will be breast cancer,
with an estimated 18,400 new cases, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Mubarak's U.S. Visit Ultra-Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
upcoming visit to Washington at a crucial stage of the peace
process is of special importance, his political advisor Ossama
el-Baz said here today.
</P>
<P>
It transcends the significance of all previous visits, Baz
said on "Good morning Egypt" T.V. program.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process is now undergoing a crucial phase
because of the "new vision" of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu's government which showed readiness to commit itself to
previous agreements but "according to its own way."
</P>
<P>
"We will wait to see Washington's reaction to this and its
vision on activating talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks,"
Baz said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will make a five-day visit to Washington on March 10
for talks with President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with U.S. media institutions and a delegation
of the major U.S.-Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Mubarak will fly to Chicago for a
meeting with more than 120 businessmen and investors operating in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in the U.S. capital told the Egyptian MENA
news agency that the Egyptian-U.S. talks will also deal with
developments on the various tracks of the peace process following
the Israeli government's decision to build a Jewish neighborhood
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will examine a number of proposals on reviving
Syrian-Israeli talks, halted in February last year.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that drawing more U.S. investments to Egypt, the situations
in Sudan and Iraq, as well as regional security issues, will also
be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking Egyptian officials including Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa are now in Washington preparing for the visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States on
Thursday decided to cancel their annual joint "Team Spirit"
military exercise this year in a gesture to ease tensions on the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth year in a row that South Korea and the
U.S. have called off this major exercise involving 100,000 army,
navy and air force troops. The war games had been staged annually
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean Defence Ministry statement said the decision was
made on the basis of the overall security situation on the Korean
peninsula recently.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to cancel Team Spirit is part of efforts by our
two governments to build confidence and to create an atmosphere
conducive to the reduction of tension on the peninsula," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added the decision would have no impact on the joint defence
system of U.S. and South Korean forces, whose plans of staging
"Foal Eagle" exercise, "Focus Lens" exercise and other joint
military exercises in 1997 will not be changed.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after U.S. and South Korean
officials briefed representatives of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea in New York on proposed four-way peace talks
aimed at securing a formal peace treaty between the two
Koreas. Another round of talks will take place on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Several Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, answered questions
at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was organized by the joint press center of
the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
and the Fifth Session of Eighth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze-man, a renowned figure in Hong Kong's literary and art
circles, talked about Hong Kong people's expressions of grief over
the passing away of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is to return to the embrace of the motherland and
become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of
China, where policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy" will
be implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition, prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
today has been owned to the great concept of "one country, two
systems" put forward by Mr. Deng.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong people have also witnessed the great
benefits Mr. Deng's reform and opening up have brought to the
inland people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why Hong Kong people are so grateful to Mr. Deng,"
Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
When asked how to deal with the existing laws of Hong Kong
after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
Maria Tam Wai-chu, a prestigious lawyer from Hong Kong, said that
Hong Kong's existing laws, except those that contravene the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, will be kept.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 600 laws and more than 1,000 ordinances in
Hong Kong, all of which will be kept except a dozen or so
and several clauses which will not be kept in accordance with
relevant NPC Standing Committee decisions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Even a few provisions of some laws which are not suitable have
not been repealed, and they will be dealt with by the future Hong
Kong SAR, she said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reaffirms Opposition to NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today reaffirmed Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward expansion
plans in his annual message to the Federal Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he believed the enlargement of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization is against Russia's interests and is fraught
with dangers which could create a new split of Europe, Itar-Tass
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The presidential message says that without Russia, Europe has
never been and will never be able to create an effective security
structure.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called for firm mutual security guarantees, including
nuclear ones, a reliable mechanism for consultation and
decision-making with NATO.
</P>
<P>
The president insisted that these arrangements should be based
on a clear-cut legal framework.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time to adapt the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe to the new political realities on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed in November 1990 between the 16 NATO
member states and the six member states of the then Warsaw Pact.
Russia has been calling for the terms of the treaty, particularly
on weapons deployment, to be updated to take account of the
geopolitical changes in Europe since the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Yeltsin also said that he would exert every
effort to reach agreement on equitable and long-lasting
cooperation with the West at his summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in the Finnish capital of Helsinki on March 20.

When asked how the Provisional Legislative Council supports the
first chief executive of the HKSAR, Ho Sai-chu, who is a member of
the council, said the council will assist Tung Chee Hwa to do a
still better job with affairs in Hong Kong under the principles of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
Sinc Tung Chee Hwa was elected the first chief executive of the
HKSAR, he has done a great deal of work and won the endorsement
and support of the Hongkong people," Ho said. "We are fully
convinced that the HKSAR government has the capability to maintain
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
</P>
<P>
In her comment on Hong Kong's extremely high real estate
prices, Ng Chu Lienfan said Hong Kong's economy is a typical
market economy, and the high prices indicates a big demand.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, she noted, many transnational companies and
Hong Kong residents who migrated overseas have returned as they
regard the city as promising, and their demand for office and
housing spaces have pushed up the prices, which have already been
boosted by Hong Kong's limited land space.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong implement an economic policy of non-interference, she
noted. However, she added, if price hikes run so high as to affect
the banking and financial business, and overall economy, then
appropriate measure of interference by the administrative
department are required.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR will guarantee press freedom as explicitly defined by
the Basic Law, said Tsui Sze-man.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is no such a thing as absolute press freedom
in any country or region, he said that freedom should be protected
and restricted by the law.
</P>
<P>
The members all expressed their confidence in Hong Kong's
return to China and the implementation of the concept of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze-man said the principles and policy of "one country,
two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high
degree of autonomy" has laid the foundation for the settlement of
the Hong Kong issue, and the work of the Preparatory Committee for
the Establishment of the HKSAR, the founding of the Election
Committee, and the election of the chief executive and the
60-member Provisional Legislative Council won the trust of the
Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
In the views of Sze Cheung Pang, thanks to the set principles
and policies with the powerful support of the motherland, Hong
Kong and the interior areas will surely bring about common
development, and Hong Kong tomorrow will surely still more
thriving and prosperous.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Fails to Win Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's three-party government
today narrowly lost a confidence motion in the lower house of
parliament due to some ruling MPs' absence from the house voting.
</P>
<P>
The motion, tabled by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba seeking
a confidence vote for his coalition government, was defeated in
the 205-seat house as 101 MPs voted for and 92 against with others
abstaining from the voting held in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Such a motion required a majority of at least 103 votes in the
lower house to pass under the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government, which came to power in September 1995, was
reduced to a minority last December by a no-confidence motion
sponsored by the main opposition party, the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Some MPs of the ruling side were absent from today's house
session or abstained from voting, resulting in the defeat of the
confidence motion, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Deuba, who has been leading the coalition government formed by
his National Congress party, the National Democratic Party and the
Nepal Goodwill Party since September 1995, sought the vote of
confidence in the house under pressure from the opposition after
his government lost majority support in the house over two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Deuba's government survived a no-confidence motion sponsored by
the CPN-UML last December by securing only 84 votes against the
opposition motion in the 205-seat house.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the Deuba government would resign in the next
few days and the CPN-UML is likely to form an alternative
government.

<HEADLINE> EU Optimistic on China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) hopes the
terms of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
can be agreed by the end of the year, Vice-President of the EU
Commission Leon Brittan said today.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union firmly believes that membership of the WTO
on the right terms will be good for China and good for the world
trading system," Brittan said in a statement at the resumption of
formal negotiations on China's WTO membership in Geneva today.
</P>
<P>
The EU is determined to ensure that the issue remains at the
top of the WTO agenda throughout this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government responded positively to my request in
Beijing last November that the talks should be relaunched in
earnest," he said.
</P>
<P>
In January, the EU sent a large, high-level delegation to China
for exploratory talks on China's WTO membership. "This indicates
the importance we attach to the issue," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Brittan pointed out that although major obstacles of substance
still remain, the talks were conducted in a "positive atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the time has come to turn the new mood of
optimism into concrete progress on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that if all sides muster sufficient political
will, the terms of China's accession could be agreed by the end of
the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged China to make "bold and meaningful commitments" to its
market reform, noting that the EU believes the negotiations must
focus on trading rights, services and tariff and non-tariff
measures.
</P>
<P>
"Our distinctive approach is that if Beijing respects certain
basic obligations at the outset, fixed transition periods should
be agreed for China's acceptance of the remaining WTO
commitments," he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He added this approach recognizes China's special position as a
country that is still in transition from a planned economy to a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
China submitted its request for the restoration of its
membership of GATT (General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade) in
1986 and has since been engaged in relevant negotiations with GATT
and its successor the WTO.

yen (1.25 billion dollars), the first year-on-year rise since
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the surplus was down 23.1 percent on December's 820.7
billion yen.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the strong increase to a 26 percent rise
in overseas direct investment and net income from Japanese
investment in overseas securities to 518.8 billion yen (4.29
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the rise was the shrinking of the deficit
in services which fell 12 percent from 581.2 billion yen (4.81
billion dollars) in January 1996 to 513.7 billion yen (4.25
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus, however, fell 15.5 percent to
229.3 billion yen (1.9 billion dollars), extending its
year-on-year decline to 26 consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 17.3 percent to 3471.8 billion yen (28.9 billion
dollars) but imports jumped 20.6 percent to 3242.5 billion yen (27
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Call for Better Wild Bird Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE (Hebei), March 6 (Xinhua) -- The China Wildlife
Protection Association and a group of local and foreign experts
today urged society to develop habits of loving birds and nature,
asking people to pay attention to wild birds during the spring, to
learn more about them and to improve their conditions.
</P>
<P>
Chen Runsheng, the association's executive secretary general,
told Xinhua that wild birds have mostly been destroyed by people
killing and trafficking in them and that some species are on the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the experts, more than 100 in all, visited
Beidaihe, a scenic coastal city in north China's Hebei Province,
to have a look at a local nature reserve for birds.
</P>
<P>
Calling birds friends of human beings, the experts asked people
not to try to capture, buy, or eat wild birds and to let them live
and reproduce in nature.
</P>
<P>
All of society, especially young people, should develop an
interest in them and a habit of seeing birds as a natural part of
wildlife, they said.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate a new style of bird-watching: leaving nothing but
footprints and taking away nothing but photos," Chen Runsheng said.
</P>
<P>
The China Wildlife Protection Association was set up in 1983
and now has more than 30,000 members.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Stake in Hong Kong Banknote Printer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China Banknote Printing and
Minting Corporation (CBPMC) will purchase a small stake in Hong
Kong's banknote printer.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the deal has been signed between the CBPMC, a
subsidiary of China's central bank, the People's Bank of China
(POBC), and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which
exercises the functions of a central bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese banknote printer will pay 42.5 million HK dollars (
5.5 million U.S. dollars) for 3.82 million shares, or a
15-percent stake, in Hong Kong Note Printing (HKNP), which is
wholly owned by the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
HKNP prints banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks in
Hong Kong -- the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,
Standard Charter Bank and the Bank of China. The Hong Kong
government bought the HKNP plant from the British note printer De
La Rue in April 1996, putting an end to a 100-year practice of
entrusting note printing to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong government,
said HKNP would benefit from the new business relationship with
the CBPMC, which has expertise in banknote printing, including
designing, plate-making and printing of banknotes.
</P>
<P>
The CBPMC operates 15 printing and minting plants and a
technology development institute in China.

<HEADLINE> Reemployment Program to Benefit Unemployed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators from China's largest city claimed that Shanghai has
basically solved the problem of re-employment by providing new
jobs for 800,000 of the city's approximately one million laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Xu Zhiyi, director of the Municipal Economic Commission
of Shanghai, said that the main practice in the city is to set up
service center, provide education and vocational training for the
laid-off, and offered them information on employment.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the laid-off workers have found new jobs in the
service trade, such as commerce, property management, and
community household service," he noted.
</P>
<P>
For northeast China's Liaoning Province, which has one tenth of
the country's large and medium-sized enterprises owned by the
state, the establishment and continuous improvement of an
unemployment insurance system is an effective way in carrying out
the re-employment program.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Suzhi, deputy director of the Standing
Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress, more than
95 percent of the employees in the province's state-owned
enterprises have bought the insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
"In the past decade, Liaoning has collected a total of 1.06
billion yuan in unemployment insurance funds, and paid 580 million
yuan," said Chen, adding that most of the money was spent in
unemployment relief, medical care, vocational training and job
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated the re-employment program, 2.43 million
laid-off workers have been given new jobs, statistics indicated.
It is expected that the program will help create job opportunities
for another 2.5 million laid-off people this year.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 10 million surplus workers in China's
state-owned industry, and situation remains stark for
re-employment of the laid-off.
</P>
<P>
During a panel discussion with legislators from southwest
China's Sichuan Province, Labor Minister Li Boyong said that
governments at all levels and enterprises across the country
should attach importance to the re-employment program, and work
out policies to guarantee and promote the progressing of the
program.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pakistan Dialogue to Resume on March 28: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indo-Pakistan foreign
secretary level talks, stalled for the last three years, are
likely to be resumed here on March 28, Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by outgoing Pakistan High Commissioner to
India Riaz Khokhar, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed will arrive here on
March 28 for three days to hold bilateral talks with his Indian
counterpart Salman Haider, Khokhar told an Indian newspaper before
leaving for his new assignment as Islamabad's envoy to Washington,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The last round of foreign secretary-level talks between the two
countries was held in January 1994 in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Khokhar told the newspaper that Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan might send a reply to his India counterpart I.K.
Gujral's letter either today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Gujral had sent the letter last week congratulating Gohar on
his appointment as foreign minister of Pakistan and reiterating
the H.D. Deve Gowda government's readiness to resume a dialogue at
an appropriate level and on all issues of mutual concerns.
</P>
<P>
Khokhar said that since Kashmir was the "core issue" between
the two countries, Islamabad would try to seek an "amicable
solution to it first."
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is a fundamental issue for Pakistan and all other
matters are a consequence of it. How can you touch peripheral
issues and leave the fundamental problem unattended?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Kashmir issue could be put in cold storage to try
other issues including ways to boost trade, Khokhar is reported to
have said, "the other issues do not create tension. We want to
address the main issue first which creates tension and affects the
people of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"We can also talk on trade and other such issues but there is
no question of putting Kashmir in cold storage even for a moment,"
PTI quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Foreign Debt Breaks 200 Billion Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's foreign debt, for the
first time, broke the 200 billion Australian dollars barrier in
December 1996 quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
said today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest international investment survey, the ABS said the
net foreign debt rose to 202.367 billion Australian dollars
(158.85 billion US dollars) from an upwards revised 196.042
billion Australian dollars (153.89 billion US dollars) in the
September quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of net debt to gross domestic product was 40.3
percent, the highest level in three years, while in the September
quarter it was 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said in a statement
that in the first nine months since its coming into office, the
government had added 16 billion Australian dollars (12.56 billion
US dollars) to foreign debt, compared with 18 billion Australian
dollars (14 billion US dollars) in the last two years of the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot blamed an increase in
foreign takeovers of Australian assets under the current
government for the resurgence in debt levels, "Australia cannot
afford to keep losing so much of our national income without
compromising our economic independence."
</P>
<P>
Economists called on the government to fulfill its intention to
cut spending in the May budget, and warned the debt ratio could
blow out even further as the economy gained strength this year and
pushed out the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Bank senior economist John Peters said "the latest
snapshot of Australia's external debt position is a timely
reminder in the lead up to the May budget of just why the
government needs to continue to tighten the fiscal screws and
promote a higher level of savings."
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank economist Tim Moloney said "today's figures
should serve to sharpen the Treasurer's resolve to keep the
government's balanced budget objective on track."

KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Health Minister

At present, Malaysia's Medical Act contained provisions which

Modern and traditional methods of treatment should be combined
to produce a more complete system of treatment, the minister said,
adding not all western medicines were effective and not all
traditional medication were bad.
</P>
<P>
He said the combination of both methods of treatment was being
practiced successfully in several countries such as South Korea,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Forests Vital to Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
recently again called on its people to pay serious attention to
the protection of its tropical forests which occupies a decisive
position in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 12 million of Indonesia's 200 million people rely on
tropical forests for a living, Toehadi, head of the Forestry
Ministry's counseling service, said at a meeting on forests
Wednesday in Mataram, West Nusatenggara Province.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's total forests covering 144 million hectares, or
about 74.6 percent of its 193 million hectares of land, were
recently declared the earth's biggest and remaining functional
"lung" (apart from that in the Amazon of Brazil).
</P>
<P>
The country has been utilizing its forest resources on a full
scale in the past 20 years, beginning with the export of logs,
which in fiscal year 1978/79 earned the country a 41-percent share
of the world market for roundwood.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the forestry sector has become the country's third
most important source of foreign exchange, following oil and gas
and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The important role of forestry in the Indonesian economy has
prompted the government to strive for sustainable forest
management.
</P>
<P>
The move is considered timely since the country's forest area
has begun to decline due to the conversion of natural forests into
 agricultural land and resettlement areas, forest fires and
nomadic farming.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Forestry Ministry Kardjono Kadarsin said
earlier that the country's deforestation has taken a toll on about
1.3 million hectares per year.
</P>
<P>
In face of such a situation, the Indonesian government has
introduced many regulations, including cooperation with foreign
agencies, in a bid to maintain its natural forests.
</P>
<P>
Big strides were made in the 1970s when Indonesia analyzed and
divided its 144 million hectares of forests into four categories:
protected forests, conservation forests, conversion forests and
production forests.
</P>
<P>
The division aimed to ensure the survival of fauna and flora
for the benefit of future generations, to allow the country to use
its forests for employment and economic growth and to plan for the
economic activities and population growth of cities.
</P>
<P>
To enable the country to use its forests for employment and
economic growth, the government has begun developing more than 3
million hectares of timber estates and it plans to open 3.5
million hectares more soon, Forestry Minister Djamaloedin
Soeryohadikoesoemo said recently.
</P>
<P>
The government has also introduced the Indonesian Selective
Logging System, under which forest concessionaires are required to
ensure the sustainable exploitation of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The policies and measures have reduced the volume of tree
felling from 38 million cubic meters in 1989/90 to 25 million
cubic meters in 1993/94, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the importance of forests to the country's
economy, Soeryohadikoesoemo said about 2.5 million people are
working in the wood industry while 1.2 million others are employed
in support industries and businesses indirectly related to the
forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Forestry Ministry indicate that Indonesia's
forest-based industries have contributed 15 percent to the
country's total exports, making them the third largest foreign
exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's forestry policy in the Sixth Five-Year Development
Plan (1994-1999) stresses increased public participation in forest
development and conservation for the sake of the country's
economy.

State Tuanku Ja'afar said tonight that his country will endeavor
to cooperate with South Africa in every way, particularly in the

<P>
Describing relations between Malaysia and South Africa as
"excellent," the king said the Malaysian private sector finds
South Africa to be one of the most attractive investment
destinations and is confident that South Africa has all the
ingredients of an African tiger economy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries must strive for cooperation between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), he told a state banquet here

</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived here earlier today for a five-day state visit
to Malaysia, the final leg of his four-nation Southeast Asia tour,
after visiting Brunei, Singapore and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Like ASEAN, we believe that South Africa's integration with
the countries of the SADC will be a model of confidence-building,
peace and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia admires the South African government's high sense of
commitment to building a future based on justice and the sharing
of the hopes, aspirations and ideals of the African people, the
Malaysian king said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia followed with keen interest the
initiatives of South Africa toward cooperation and integration
between neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Accuses Rebels of Provocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military today
accused Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels of provoking
renewed hostilities in Buldon, Maguindanao Province in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's 6th Infantry Division,
said the rebels Wednesday fired three rounds of 81mm mortar shells
near the 39th Infantry Battalion's position in Barangay Karigaya,
Buldon.
</P>
<P>
He said MILF rebels also fired mortar shells at Army troopers
in Barangay Daguma, Bagumbayan, Sultan Kudarat Province the other
day.
</P>
<P>
So far no casualties were reported on both sides from the two
said attacks.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato called the attacks part of the rebel's campaign to
drive the soldiers out of the areas where government projects are
being constructed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that government troops will maintain a defensive
position in spite of the attacks in observance of a local truce
earlier forged by the military and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The government is presently negotiating peace with the MILF
after talks with the Moro National Liberation Front succeeded last
year.

<HEADLINE> China Going All Out to Build Farmland Irrigation Works (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China produced 48 billion kg of
grain in 1996, a year with serious flooding affecting many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the on-going session of China's legislature,
National People's Congress (NPC), attributed the good harvest to
nationwide efforts to build farmland irrigation works.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dengquan, a NPC deputy and vice-minister of water
conservancy, said some 20 million ha of arable land has been
flooded over the past three years, causing economic losses up to
220 billion yuan. However, China has set three records in grain
production from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite a marked improvement in water conservancy projects, the
Chinese government was unsatisfied with China's present irrigation
conditions, in which floods and dry spells still loom over a large
area in its endeavor to feed the world's biggest population.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, Premier Li Peng promised that
China decides to establish a special fund and increase its input
in agricultural production. And, according to the funding system,
the central government will be responsible for harnessing big
rivers while local governments will be in charge of smaller rivers
and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li urged local farmers to carry out farmland
improvement and water conservancy projects as well as improvement
of small drainage areas to minimize possible losses to be brought
by natural adversities.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Dengquan, the vice minister, China's farmland
acreage brought under irrigation is increasing at a rate of
330,000 ha annually at a time when crop acreage is decreasing by
the same amount amid rapid urban and highway construction, and
thriving township industry.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, he said, Some 100 million farmers have been
working at worksites of irrigation projects throughout China,
pouring in a total investment of 27.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Sichuan, China's most populous and a major agriculture
province, some 15 million people thrown in a total of one billion
work days during the latest winter-spring period on water
conservancy projects with 1.6 billion yuan in investment, a marked
increase over the previous years.

<P>
International financial organizations have also granted the
province 94 million US dollars in loans to help build two major
water conservancy projects in Sichuan. In addition, the provincial
government has spared 40 million yuan from its tight budget in
such construction.
</P>
<P>
Apart from government funds, local farmers have also been
encouraged to raise funds in the construction of irrigation
ditches, canals and other water conservancy projects. Some elderly
farmers even sold their ready-made coffins and the kids spared
their changes, described by Dai Xianlu, a farmer deputy from
Sichuan's Renshou County.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, which experienced serious flooding last year, reaped a
record high grain harvest in 1996 despite torrential rains that
caused 31.1 billion yuan in economic losses, the highest in
history.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhijie, provincial party secretary, also attributed the
good harvest to years of efforts in water conservancy
construction. Jia said as a leading grain producer, Hubei will
allocate two billion yuan annually over the next five years in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest China, which is frequented by dry spells,
Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and autonomous regions of
Ningxia and Xinjiang have joined hands and built 2,057 major
reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 14.12 billion square
meters to quench the thirst of crops.
</P>
<P>
The whole country is seething with enthusiasm to build
irrigation project and water conservancy items, which has find
expressions nationwide, either in east China's Anhui Province
where major floods or waterlogging claimed a heavy loss of lives
and economic damages in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe
River valleys, the four major river drainage areas, a large number
of emergency facilities such as buildings, bridges and highways
are being built.
</P>
<P>
The largest of these projects is the gigantic Three Gorges
Hydroelectric Project which is built to prevent turbulent water
flood from surging downstream Yangtze River and the Liaolangdi
Hydroelectric Project on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The river interception of these two projects due late this year
will signify a new historic period for building water conservancy
projects in China, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes Malaysia's Entry Into IORI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela tonight welcomed Malaysia's entry into the Indian
Ocean Rim Initiative (IORI), saying, "We look forward to further
joint actions in this forum."
</P>
<P>
Both South Africa and Malaysia carry the same conviction
through into the wider world, by promoting the role and
aspirations of the developing world in various forums such as the
BAH365AAA095S06PEQL21:3221:322099
Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth of Nations, Mandela said
at a state banquet hosted in his honor by Malaysian Supreme Head
of State Tuanku Ja'afar here.
</P>
<P>
The IORI, initiated two years ago, is now known as the Indian
Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) whose
first ministerial meeting is being held in Mauritius. It groups 14
countries bordering the Indian Ocean -- Australia, India,
Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Oman, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the IOR-ARC are to promote a sustained
growth and development of the region and member states and to
formulate and implement projects for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Praising Malaysia for being among the leading countries in the
global struggle against apartheid, Mandela, who arrived here
earlier today for a five-day visit, said Malaysia has "rich
experience" in uniting a diverse society on the basis of equity
and social advancement which is another common factor between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
On economic cooperation, Mandela said that within three years,
bilateral trade has more than doubled and Malaysia is now the
fourth largest investor in South Africa, overtaking many
long-established countries in the process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also congratulated Malaysia on its election as the
president of the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly,
describing it as a certain indication that Malaysia is willing and
ready to assume greater responsibility in global matters.
</P>
<P>
He said his mission here is to reaffirm and strengthen the
historical ties that bind the two countries.

HARBIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- More people in Harbin, the capital
of Heilongjiang Province, have taken an interest in the Hale-Bopp
comet, which comes around every 3,000 years and has become
brighter recently.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-Feburary, residents in most parts of Heilongjiang
have been able to see the comet without the aid of a telescope. At
3:00 a.m., many people get up to get a look at it, with many of
them driving to the suburbs to escape the glare of city lights.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Planetarium has more than 100 amateur star-gazers
every weekend who are shown video tapes on astronomy, and who
trace the movement of the comet and discuss comets.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of Hale-Bopp will coincide with a total solar
eclipse on March 9 in the province's Mohe County, a scene that
will not happen again for thousands of years, and many local
people are interested in watching it.
</P>
<P>
The number of people attending the planetarium's training
classes has doubled and it has been holding an exhibition on the
total solar eclipse and the comet.
</P>
<P>
The city's amateur star gazers have also opened a hotline to
answer questions on the solar eclipse and the comet, and the city
is planning a "popular science week", a winter camp, and a photo
contest for the solar eclipse. The city has also prepared about
100,000 solar eclipse observation cards for its people.

<HEADLINE> Development of Shipbuilding Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate the
development of its shipbuilding industry to make it a growth area
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Rongsheng, General Manager of China National Shipbuilding
Corp., made the call when attending the current session of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding has the potential to become another rising growth
area in the national economy, just like the electronics,
information and building industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding industry is a capital-, technology- and
labor-intensive industry, and its development will bring along
that of many other industries, Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted China's shipbuilding industry enjoys advantages such
as a mature production structure and well-developed technologies,
and adoption of international practices in operation, marketing,
technical standards and production management.
</P>
<P>
However, he say problems exist. While the production capacity
of large shipyards is less than sufficient, that of medium and
small ones is excessive, he said. What is needed, he said, is
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
To fuel the development of shipbuilding, its status as a
leading industry must be set, more funds should be instilled for
updating equipment and facilities, and special funds should be
appropriated into research and development.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted a demand peak over the next 15 years,
with annual demand ranging from 35 million to 45 million dwt
worldwide, Wang pointed out, adding this will provide historical
opportunities for China's shipbuilding industry.

HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Hong Kong
International Film Festival (HKIFF) will present some 40 local
films spanning from the 1940's to the 1990's in the Hong Kong
cinema retrospective section.
</P>
<P>
From the postwar years to nowadays, the Hong Kong cinema has

<HEADLINE> German Joblessness Hits New High in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's joblessness rose slightly
to another postwar record of 4,672 million last month following a
dramatic jump in January.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Labour Office said today that some 13,600 more
people were out of work in February than in January, but the
increase did not change the unemployment rate which stood at 12.2
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment figure dropped by 8,200 in western Germany to
just under 3.26 million, or 10.6 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
But in the eastern part of the country, it surged 21,800 to
over 1.41 million, a rate of 18.9 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labour Office, said
the fact that joblessness rose only slightly in February did not
reduce the urgency for action.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge remains unalterably great," he said, adding that
there were no simple answers to the employment crisis.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the gloomy picture, a report issued Thursday by
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed that Germany
lost a total of 504,000 jobs during 1996, one fourth of them in
eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an average of 36.51 million people had
jobs in 1991 while last year's average stood at 34.47 million,
which means more than two million have been lost over the five-year
period.

<HEADLINE> Reemployment Program to Benefit Unemployed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- While many workers who are laid
off by China's money-losing state sector have no idea where to
find new jobs, local officials at the ongoing NPC session have
brought with them some good news: more job opportunities thanks to
a nationwide reemployment program.
</P>
<P>
"As long as localities and enterprises can make optimal use of
resources instead of waiting for job opportunities, the laid-off
can be reemployed," said Teng Zhaoxiang, party secretary of Yichun
City, Heilongjiang Province, which was once troubled by
100,000-plus unemployed.
</P>
<P>
A city known for having the country's largest lumbering
industry, Yichun relied heavily on timber production. The city of
1.34 million people has been obliged to cut down timber output
since the 1990s following new restrictions on logging.
As a result, more than 32 percent of its 380,000 lumberjacks
lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the government report by Premier Li Peng, forestry industry
is listed as one of the five which are operating at a big loss or
experiencing great difficulties, along with textile, coal,
machinery and weapons industries.
</P>
<P>
To provide more jobs for the laid-off, Yichun City has offered
preferential policies encouraging the unemployed to go into
production, processing and sales of local mountain products as
well as crop production and livestock raising.
</P>
<P>
According to Teng Zhaoxiang, some 17,000 unemployed workers
were reemployed in 1996 and another 30,000 will be employed this
year. All laid-offs in the city's timber industry are expected to
be reemployed in three years.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Iron and Steel Complex is another enterprise which
has successfully carried out the reemployment program. According
to Ge Daiyi, the general manager, 34,000 out of the factory's iron
and steel workers were transferred to such trades as construction,
machine-building, transportation and catering industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yan, a woman laid off by the Chongqing factory, traveled
3,000 km to the northeast city of Harbin to serve Sichuan cuisine.
She is so successful today that she has started eight chain stores
there with 40 million yuan in annual revenues.

<HEADLINE> German Firms to Continue Job Cuts Despite High Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Many German firms plan to continue
shedding labor this year despite record post-war unemployment of
4.67 million in February, according to a survey published today by
the German Council of Trade and Industry (DIHT).
</P>
<P>
The survey of 25,000 German firms revealed that more than 30
percent of companies plan to reduce their workforce with only 10
percent planning to hire more workers.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, a third of the firms expect to make job
cuts and 57 percent plan to maintain their current work force,
while in eastern Germany, 30 percent are planning cuts and 60
percent keeping employment at the present level during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics released today showed that unemployment
rose slightly to a new high of 4,672 million in February after a
dramatic jump in January.
</P>
<P>
The February joblessness was 13,600 higher than January's 4.66
million, while the rate remained unchanged at 12.2 percent, said
the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Office, which tabulates the
monthly jobs data.
</P>
<P>
While the German economy was expected to benefit this year from
foreign demand, low interest rates and low inflation, the DIHT
noted that high unemployment would continue to strangle domestic
demand, which is needed to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The German government has forecast gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of 2.5 percent this year, after 1.4 percent growth in
1996. But many economists are sceptical about the forecast.
</P>
<P>
Zero GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1996 and economists'
projections of a 0.25 percent increase for the first quarter this
year have raised doubts about the economy's prospects.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Managers Need Motivation: Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate the pace
of setting up a mechanism aimed at both motivating and restraining
managers of state-owned enterprises, according to deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC), the legislature, which is in
session here.
</P>
<P>
The deputies described a lack of accountability on the part of
executives of state firms by quoting a popular comment to the
effect that "there are at present only factory directors who jump
the ship for another and no factory directors who jump out of the
window (to commit suicide)."
</P>
<P>
Huang Guancong, a deputy from a Shanghai electronics company,
said: "Without responsible managers, state-owned enterprises
cannot be rejuvenated even with the best of external conditions."
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, China must set up a motivation and
restraint system, under which those who perform well are rewarded
and those who do not are penalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to resolving the problem lies in establishing a system
that pegs the interests of business managers and factory directors
to the performance of their enterprises, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhiyi, director of the Shanghai Municipal Economic
Commission, said that the basis for such a mechanism is to foster
a contingent of market-oriented and professional enterprise
managers.
</P>
<P>
"This calls for greater effort on the part of economic and
personnel departments of the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wei Guangai, a trade union official of another Shanghai
company, said that the responsibility of the managers of small
state-owned share-holding enterprises are strengthened partly due
to the fact that they are elected by workers and are subject
to supervision by workers conferences.

<HEADLINE> Expert Proposes Building Information Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert today suggested
that China build its own information security system.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qian Jingren from the Chinese University of Science
and Technology made the suggestion when attending the current
session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
China plans to promote the development of electronic and
information technologies, said its minister in charge of the State
Planning Commission at the current session.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an information security system is an
important part of this process, Professor Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, an expert on electromagnetic field theories and microwave
technologies, said the explosive information flow brought by the
Internet indicates that the human race has entered the information
age, and network security begins to stand out as an issue meriting
serious attention.
</P>
<P>
Problems concerning security include computer virus, steal of
secret information, on-line fraud, transmission of unhealthy
information, and attempts to subvert other countries through
information transmission, explained the professor.
</P>
<P>
China is making fast progress in the information field. There
were only 2,100 computers linked up with the Internet at the end
of 1995, which sprang five-fold to 11,000 in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
To better develop information resources, Qian proposed that
China follow the example of other countries in enacting laws and
regulations on information security, strengthening management, and
make legislative and judicial explanations.
</P>
<P>
He suggested China increase research on key technologies and
equipment for a high-speed information network when introducing
foreign-made hardware and software, and formulate policies aimed
at protecting the national information industry.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the vast majority of China's high-speed
information networks have been built with imported technologies,
with most information flowing on them originating from overseas,
too.
</P>
<P>
"A more important thing is to learn to publicize China's own
national culture, achievements in economic development, and
industrial and agricultural products, and to develop its own
information resources in a well-organized way," Qian noted.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Blasts Israeli Provocations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Islamic
Waqf Hasan Tahboub said today recent Israeli practices in East
Jerusalem are meant to provoke Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Voice of Arab radio, he said
Israel's decision to close down four Palestinian institutions in
East Jerusalem is a provocative measure and reflects Israel's
continued attempt to Judaize the holy city by expanding settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
The minister also refuted the Israeli claim that Jews own most
of Har Homa, a tree-covered hill in East Jerusalem, where Israel
decided to build 6,500 Jewish homes soon.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is occupied land on which the U.N. Security Council
resolution 242 is applied and occupation authorities have no right
to make any changes in occupied parts," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said here Wednesday
during a visit to Egypt that 70 percent of Har Homa Mount is
"private Jewish land." He complained that the whole issue has been
"overblown."
</P>
<P>
Asked about Netanyahu's rejection of setting up a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital, Tahboub noted that outcome of
peace negotiations are not hinged on what the Israeli leader says
and that the peace process will continue.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are capable to declare the establishment of
their country with Jerusalem as its capital," he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, angry
over the Israeli decision which he deemed as a violation of Oslo
agreements, has threatened to declare the Palestinian state if
Netanyahu goes through with the Har Homa project.

<HEADLINE> Studies on Keichousaurus Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a large-scale
excavation this year to search for fossils of the Keichousaurus, a
creature that lived in shallow seawater some 200 million years ago
in what is now southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The lizard-like creature, which looks like a miniature
dinosaur, dates from the middle of the Triassic period, some 100
million years earlier than the dinosaur epoch.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, Chinese scientists will study the
evolution of the Keichousaurus, its living environment, and the
cause of its extinction. Restoration of fossils also will be done
during that time.
</P>
<P>
First found in 1957 in Xingyi, Keichousaurus fossils have
become targets for smugglers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city government confiscated some 700 of the illegally-dug
fossils, of which 226 have been appraised as rare relics.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xijin, who was in charge of the appraisal and is a
palaeontologist with the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and
Palaeoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said
that Keichousaurus fossils were found among fossils of other
ancient vertebrates such as the nothosauria, the peltopleurus and
the sinoeugnathus.
</P>
<P>
He said that these are the first reptile and fish fossils found
together in the same marine deposit.
</P>
<P>
There still exist many missing links in the organic evolution
of these remote ages, Zhao said, and any discoveries of an unknown
species "can fill in a blank." He added that palaeontological
fossils are rare in the world, so the findings at Xingyi are "all
the more precious."
</P>
<P>
A conservation area covering eight km has been set up at the
site where the fossils were found.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Provinces to Seek Sound Economic Structuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Provinces and municipalities
across China are either pondering over problems in economic
development or revising draft plans in a bid to put an end to
repetitive construction, which has cost losses of up to one
billion US dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
In the current session of the National People's Congress, local
leaders are convinced that the root cause of surplus production
capacity and debt-ridden state sector lies in indulging in
building large and all-inclusive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Although Premier Li Peng's proposal for economic restructuring
would result in some conflicts of interests between the central
and local governments and between different parts of China, local
officials are convinced that it is still a pressing task for China
to further improve economic structure and ensure a long-term and
healthy economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, about 93 percent of China's
industrial sectors resemble one another from one place to another.
There are more than 130 automotive plants across China, more than
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the on-going NPC session, Premier Li
Peng voiced the pledge of the Chinese government to "strictly
control" the launching of ordinary processing projects. "No
project will get approval if production capacity in that field is
already excessive, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his call for what he termed "structural
readjustment", already a catch phrase in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
and Long-Range Objective Through the year 2010, saying "not" to
launch new projects if existing capacity can be utilized in
reorganizing or transformating them.
</P>
<P>
Local officials voiced consent to Li's view. "If China does not
alterr this situation, it will possibly have a new round of
repetitive construction in a bigger scale and with more
investment," they said. All localities should take into account
long-term interests of the national development instead of their
immediate interests.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Provinces to Seek Sound Economic Structure (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zheng Silin, governor of east China's Jiangsu province, one of
the country's top economic powerhouses, offered his endorsement to
the central policy.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Jiangsu, which has a wealth of professionals but
a scarcity in natural resources, its development should be
concentrated on high and new technology sector, service industry,
and basic infrastructure and facilities, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ruihua, governor of south China's Guangdong province which
has been in the forefront of reform and opening-up, acknowledged
that his province has erred to put automaking at the top of its
pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong does not have any advantages in national
distribution of auto industry, and so we shall not make related
efforts this year," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the province has decided to put emphasis on the
light, textiles, and hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning province,northeast China, has been a traditional
industrial base, with the prop of heavy and chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no need for major readjustment of the
structure since Liaoning is expected to continue focusing on the
petrochemical, metallurgical, machinery and electronic industries,
the province still have a major task to upgrade its outdated
technologies and equipment and product mix, said Governor Wen
Shizhen.
</P>
<P>
Central and western region are likely to be the biggest winner
in this structuring drive. Thanks to the preferential policies
granted by the central government to reduce the gap between the
region and the eastern part of the country, experts say, the
region will have an opportunity to obtain new investment to
develop its resources-related industries.
</P>
<P>
With its salt, metals and petroleum and other abundant natural
reserves, Qinghai province on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau has strong
potential in making it a national base for the chemical and
nonferrous-metal industries, said Governor Tian Chengping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Governor He Zhiqiang of tropical Yunnan province
said that his province plans to go in for the tobacco industry,
mineral and biological resources development, and tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial governors held that readjustment of the economic
structure will be a long and changing process, since it is
inevitable that micro and macro interests, and local and overall
interests often conflict one another.
</P>
<P>
The economic restructuring should be sped up, and macroeconomic
measures improved, so as to give full scope to the leading role of
the market. And this is the an important guarantee for a healthy
development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa's Row with West over Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa's simmering
argument with the West on ivory trade will continue until the
10th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) set for June 9-20 here makes a decision.
</P>
<P>
All southern African countries now demand the resumption of
the trade of ivory and other elephant products while some western
animal rights groups are trying hard to oppose it, describing the
move as murderous.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on resuming ivory trade was first put forward by
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government of the 12-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) approved the proposal in
their summit in Maseru, Lesotho last August to downlist the
status of the African elephant from current Appendix I to
Appendix II.
</P>
<P>
Wild animals in Appendix I of the Convention are not allowed
to be utilized, while those in Appendix II can be sustainably
utilized.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if the status of African elephant is transferred
from Appendix I to Appendix II, the southern African countries
will be allowed to export registered stocks of raw tusks of ivory
to one trading partner.
</P>
<P>
In response, western animal rights groups are using their
political votes to put pressure on their governments to stop
helping organizations they label as supporters of the killing of
animals.
</P>
<P>
They have even extended their influence to donors involved in
the region, asking them to cut aid to countries defying their
dictates.
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), a major animal
rights group, is reportedly campaigning for discrediting Communal
Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The HSUS is also attempting to halt the funding for the
program from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the West is seeking to change the 10th CITES venue
from Zimbabwe to another country supporting the ban so as to get
a favorable CITES decision.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 delegates from 136 countries around the world are
expected to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Countries in southern Africa argued that unlike some areas on
the continent where elephants might face a danger of extinction
due to poaching and mismanagement of wildlife resources, southern
Africa has seen so huge an elephant population that it is now
causing a serious animal-human conflict.
</P>
<P>
Elephant in most parts of southern Africa is not an endangered
species, instead, it poses actually a danger to the region's
environment and human life because the significant increase of
their number is now out of control, said SADC government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Director of Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous
Resources of Zimbabwe Taparendave Maveneke noted that the number
of elephants are rising immensely in southern Africa and
constitute threats to the survival of other wild species and the
whole ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a herd of at least 65,000 elephants while its
carrying capacity is less than 30,000, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
People living in elephant-rich areas are trampled upon by the
huge mammal to death or maimed for life now and then, leaving
constant fear among residents there. Children are afraid of going
to school in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Houses damaged or crops and natural vegetation destroyed by
elephants are frequent stories carried in newspapers in the
countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since the ban on ivory trade in 1989, Zimbabwe has stockpiled
40 tons of ivory and lost 29 million U.S. Dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to lose about 500,000 U.S. Dollars
annually, Zimbabwean wildlife experts said.
</P>
<P>
The lost money could have benefited the cash-strapped national
parks department and other official social welfare programs in
the country, some Zimbabwean wildlife experts pointed out. "The
West puts animals before human beings," they complained.

LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of Zambia has

privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Commerce, Trade and Industry
Minister Alfeyo Hambayi as saying at parliament that the

Some parliament members expressed concerns that most

</P>
<P>
They said they are worried that if foreign companies are
allowed to extend their business into rural areas of the country,
it will spell doom for local shops there.
</P>

However, Hambayi confirmed the government encourages
competition and will not restrict companies from venturing into
any form of business. enditem

</P>
<P>
Local Government Minister Francis Lotodo launched here
Wednesday the Kenya Urban Transport Infrastructure Project which

<P>
He called for regular maintenance of infrastructure, adding

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has appealed to

<P>
The appeal was made in Kigoma on Wednesday by Tanzania

LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- About 60.6 million Nigerians have
been registered for the March 15 local government elections on
party basis, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 18.8 million more than the 41.8 million voters
registered for the 1993 polls, according to a "tentative
computation" by the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria
(NECON) of last month's voters' registration.
</P>
<P>
NECON has identified 1.4 million registered names as
fictitious, stemming from multiple registration and listing of
under-aged persons, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by the United Nations put the population
of Nigeria at 115 million by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The National Population Commission said in its report on the
final 1991 census that 45 percent of the country's population are
under age 15 and only three percent above the age of 64.
</P>
<P>
The eligible age for registration is 18 in the western African
country.
</P>
<P>
The census report has been submitted to Nigeria's head of
state General Sani Abacha recently.
</P>
<P>
NECON sources described the turnout of the registration as
"impressive", saying that it shows the enthusiasm of the people
toward the government's transition to civil rule program.

<HEADLINE> Beads for Calculation At Least 2,700 Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-six clay beads from the
Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-771 BC) have been identified as
those used for calculation, which dates the origin of the abacus
to at least 2,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was previously believed that the abacus was developed in the
Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), based on the earliest record about
it found in an arithmetic book from that period.
</P>
<P>
The beads, in green, yellow or white, were found in 1978 among
the palace remains at the Zhouyuan site in Baoji, northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, the birthplace of the Zhou people who
established the Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
Mostly round, the beads have a diameter of two cm and bear
traces of knife-cuts, polishing, and fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
No theories on the use of the beads had been put forward until
1984, when two local experts published theses claiming that the
beads were probably used for calculation.
</P>
<P>
Their conclusion was recently approved at a symposium held by
leading archaeologists in the province and the country's top
experts on the history of abacus.
</P>
<P>
The experts ruled out the possibilities of the beads being used
as toys, money, or a traditional Chinese medical instrument. They
say that the beads, including two on which are symbols related to
calculation, can be verified as the genuine originals.
</P>
<P>
The beads are identical to information in historical records
about the first beads for figuring numbers, which were green,
yellow or white, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the different colored beads
each represent certain digits: green stands for 9, 6, and 3;
yellow for 8, 5, and 2; and white, 7, 4, and 1.

<P>
It was the second time this week that arms allegedly concealed
by former rival factions were brought into light, only a month
after most arms held by ex-fighters were urged to be handed over
to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an ECOMOG statement as saying that the
weapons had been dug up in an abandoned mining town of Bungami,
formerly under the control of the defunct NPFL.
</P>
<P>
The weapons that were put on display on Wednesday included
dozens of rifles and machine guns, which were rusty and covered
in dirts.
</P>
<P>
The arrested described themselves as former NPFL fighters,
saying that the weapons had been buried by their commanders two
weeks before the disarmament exercise.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a former NPFL captain who has fled to Cote
d'Ivoire alleged that his ex-fellow fighters hid some weapons
from ECOMOG, which supervised the disarmament program.
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor denied the charges, saying that it was a
propaganda aimed at setting ECOMOG against him.
</P>
<P>
"There may be bigger hands behind this one but those hands are
going to fail. ECOMOG must win this war," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that indications show there are some external
forces whose aim is to destabilize the forthcoming election and
probably delay it for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, ECOMOG announced that it had uncovered a
large weapon cache buried at a diamond depository. The cache
included assorted rifles and rocket propelled grenades during a
raid following information received from the public.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were found at Lofa bridge, about 60 kilometers
west of Monrovia which was contested by the former United
Liberation Movement (ULIMO) factions before the disarmament
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of such huge quantity of weapons has tightened
the security situation in Monrovia. All vehicles are being
vigorously searched there and people are questioned if they
demonstrate unusual attitude, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Liberian peace process is currently progressing
toward general elections scheduled for May this year after the
successful disarmament of the formal warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor and two other major former factional leaders,
Alhaji Kromah and George Boley, have resigned from the ruling
Council of State to contest for the presidency in the forthcoming
national polls.
</P>
<P>
All three were former vice-chairmen of the interim government.

<HEADLINE> IMF Gives Ultimatum to S. Leone on Structural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today warned that unless Sierra Leone raises the pump price
of petroleum products and electricity tariff, IMF will suspend
the structural adjustment program (SAP) in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF ultimatum came not as a surprise, said an
official of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"They are also demanding that the government install water
meters on taps for the state-controlled Guma Valley Water Company
to pay off a 48 million-U.S.-Dollar World Bank loan," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "The present economic situation has denied the people
the capacity to face any increase in prices without corresponding
increases in their wages," Finance Minister Thaimu Bangura was
quoted by State Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said last night that he held relevant talks with World Bank
Alternate Executive Director Godfrey Goseb in Freetown last week.
</P>
<P>
Democracy has brought "great expectations" to Sierra Leoneans
only "in terms of an improvement in their living standards," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The government will therefore not introduce any measure that
will lead to explosive situations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government "cannot do without the IMF but is asking the
world organization to consider the economic, social and political
implications in drawing up its programs," he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Macao Sets up Body to Care for Increasing Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A special body was established in
Macao Wednesday to care for the increasing number of diabetes
patients, which is expected to reach 41,000 by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Macao Diabetes Association said that the
association will provide a wide range of services for patients and
local residents.
</P>
<P>
Those services will include hotline service, consulting,
giving out handouts, lectures on ways of preventing the
diseases and medical checkups.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the number of diabetes has increased sharply over
the past decade in Macao, which has an estimated 25,000,000
diabetes patients, or some six percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, 110 million people were found contracted with
the disease in 1994, and that number may grow to 240 million by

Doctors said that currently there is no way to root out the
disease, but it can be eased and prevented by altering bad living
habits.
</P>
<P>
"Diabetes is the cost of social development," said a local
doctor at a press conference Wednesday. "But the possibility of
contracting the disease can be drastically lowered if you
exercise more and are careful of your diet."

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Attention to Population Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A population expert said today in
Beijing that the government should pay close attention to the
problem of population aging, and take appropriate measures to
prepare for the arrival of a gerontological society.
</P>
<P>
Wu Cangping, a professor with the institute of population
theories of the People's University of China, one of the country's
leading academies, made this remark at the third plenum of the
Fifth Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the number of aged people will reach 130
million, or one tenth of the population, by the end of the
century, Wu said that China will soon enter a gerontological
society.
</P>
<P>
"The aging of population has posed a grave and urgent challenge
to China, a large country with comparatively backward economy and
culture," he warned. "This will affect our country's sustainable
development if no adequate measure are taken promptly."
</P>
<P>
Above all, efforts should be made to enhance the awareness of
the aging problem among the entire people, especially among
decision-makers and the middle-aged and young citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government move promptly to turn the
State Family Planning Commission into a "state population
commission," and regard the work concerning population aging as
one of its tasks.
</P>
<P>
"We must not miss the opportunity to make full preparations for
the aging of the population, which should cover the aspects of
thinking and theories, legislation and renovation of systems, and
materials, institutions and talents," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that new programs including social gerontology,
geriatrics, and geriatric nursing and psychology be set up in
higher education institutes to prepare talented personnel for the
need of the next century.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain the physical and mental health of senior
citizens, he said, a medical insurance system should be gradually
set up and perfected in both urban and rural areas, and a
nationwide fitness campaign be launched and promoted across the
country.
</P>
<P>
"By means of strengthening health care education for the entire
population, especially for the aged citizens, we can help more
people to enter and live their old age in good health and
achieve longevity," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity to provide adequate economic
guarantees for aged people both in the cities and the countryside
with a pension insurance system that has the widest coverage.
</P>
<P>
"We should set up a kind of social mechanism, under which the
aged people can enjoy the fruits of social progress, and try to
fix it through legislation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Signs Communique to Avoid Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan Wednesday night made a U-turn by signing a 22-point
communique of the military-dominated National Security Council
(NSC) against the coalition led by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP),
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who had been in confrontation with the military for
some days on the issue of secularism, was believed to have made
concession for the fate of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign minister Tansu Ciller gave
in under the military pressure and then persuaded her partner to
sign the communique to avoid the discontinuation of the alliance
between the RP and the True Path Party (DYP) that she chairs
herself.
</P>
<P>
Ciller reportedly said that she was under pressure from
both the military and her own party and asked Erbakan to
put a signature on the communique for the continuation of the
present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The military led by Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki
Karadayi worked out the 22-point communique designed to curb the
rising "fundamentalist" activities to the coalition
government following the February 28 meeting of the NSC.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion held that this was an "ultimatum" to the
RP from the military which has long been defending Turkey's
secular system.
</P>
<P>
The NSC meeting, chaired by President Suleyman Demirel and
attended by powerful civilian and military leaders, was called
as a result of a increasing threat directed at the secular
system of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Recent proposals by the Welfare Party led by Erbakan on
ordering women civil servants to wear Islamic-style head covering
and building a mosque in one of the main commercial squares in
Istanbul, the largest city of the country, triggered strong
criticism from Western-oriented Turks, especially the military.
</P>
<P>
A religious rally called "Jerusalem Night" held on February
1 in Sincan city, 40 kilometers west of Ankara, also caused
serious concern over the increase of the "fundamentalist" force
in the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has maintained a hard stance until Tuesday when he
sent back a senior general who brought the military-proposed
recommendations for his endorsement, leading to speculation that
a political crisis would be imminent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamist prime minister reversed his stance
after his junior partner Ciller threatened to discontinue her
cooperation with the Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
Ciller was quoted by local press as telling Erbakan that
"you should withdraw from the government if you don't sign
the communique."
</P>
<P>
Under the all-out help of her coalition partner, Ciller
averted several parliamentary ballots aimed at bringing her to
the Supreme Court to stand for trial on corruption charges, and
she is believed to continue seeking for protection under the RP
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Although Erbakan has signed the communique, the opposition has
no plan of stopping their confrontation with his Islamist party.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition leaders, including Mesut Yilmaz, Chairman of
the Motherland Party, would not like to let the opportunity
slip by calling for the resignation of the coalition government.

secretary-general of the China Islamic Association.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Koran is the most fundamental and revered
classic of Islam.

<HEADLINE> Rebel's Armory Found in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda official army has
discovered a rebel armory in a no man's area in northern Uganda,
a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Kazini, the commander of the fourth division of
Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), told The New Vision that
the ammunition discovered in the north of Ngom Oromo, Kitgum
District include 25 anti-tank land mines and 45 boxes of bullets.
</P>
<P>
The ammunition had been transported from Sudan by 300 rebels
of the Christian Lord Resistance Army (LRA) who vowed to topple
the government and was hidden in six holes dug in the ground for
the next LRA offensive, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
A former LRA member defecting to UPDF after the main forces of
his group had fled into Sudan informed UPDF of the batch of
ammunition and led government troops to the spot, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The major LRA remnants now retreat to their bases and find
shelters in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
LRA once had 2,000 soldiers in its ranks but now has only
hundreds of fighters, claimed the report.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kony, the LRA leader, is proposing to have peace talks
between LRA and the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Kintu Musoke, the Ugandan prime minister, told
parliament Wednesday that the government had decided to continue
the fight to quell LRA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Previous experiences indicate that Kony's suggestion for peace
talks is only a cover and an excuse for preparing another round
of fierce fighting, he said. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Proposals Made on Enhancing Management of Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A member of China's top advisory
body today proposed legislation enhancing administration of the
country's large migrating population in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
"A law concerning migration should be promulgated as soon as
possible," Mei Xiangming, vice-chairman of the China Association
for Promoting Democracy, said at a meeting of the ongoing fifth
session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that it will take some time to formulate a law,
the State Council may first issue a set of regulations on the
administration of migrating population, Mei said.
</P>
<P>
The member also set forth some other proposals relevant to
the issue.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials at all levels to take the issue of migrating
population as a major subject of promoting socialist material and
socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Labor market information should be released on a regularly
basis to help those who want to find jobs or do business away from
their hometowns make correct choices, he said. The administrative
departments should also organize and provide technical trainings
for the migrant workers based on market demand.
</P>
<P>
Mei went on to say that those floating people without essential
certificates should be sent back to their hometowns, and high
charges for residence, environmental protection and urban
management should be levied on their jobless family members.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all-round services should be provided to those with
necessary certificates that have paid the required fees, including
providing the necessary conditions for the children of the
migrants to attend schools, the member said, adding that the
system of residence permits should be reformed.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Arrives on State Visit to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela arrived here this afternoon on a five-day state
visit to Malaysia, the last leg of his four-nation Southeast Asian
tour.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by an 115-member delegation comprising
officials and businessmen, was received by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had already visited the Philippines, Brunei and
Singapore, all being members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
During his first state visit here since he became South
Africa's head of state, Mandela is scheduled to have an audience
with Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar and hold talks with Mahathir,
focusing on bilateral, regional and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is also scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the
Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations on "South Africa and
Malaysia -- A Joint Vision Towards the 21st Century" and another
at the Second South Africa-Malaysia Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who turns 79 in July, would highlight areas or
potentials in South Africa that could be tapped by Malaysian
investors such as in property development, privatization projects
and tourism, according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and South Africa will sign a number of agreements
during Mandela's visit which was aimed at strengthening bilateral
ties and economic cooperation, according to the sources here who
however declined to name what the pacts would be.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia established diplomatic relations with South Africa in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now a major trading partner of South Africa in this
region with total trade amounting to 883 million ringgit (about
353.2 million U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made two trips to Malaysia before the all-party South
African election in 1994. He forged close personal ties with
Mahathir who made an unofficial stop-over in South Africa in 1992
and his first official visit to South Africa in August 1995.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Reviews Amendments to Criminal Law  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Draft amendments to bring sweeping
changes to the country's 17-year-old criminal code were submitted
to the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress,
China's top legislative body, for deliberation today.
</P>
<P>
The 1979 criminal law comprising 192 articles is to be revised
into 449 articles, with a total of 257 articles added, according
to Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, who
made an explanation on the draft amendments at today's third
plenary meeting of the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
China is trying to work out "a unified and fairly complete
penal code through the revision," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It will represent a major step forward in improving our
country's penal system and judicial system, and will be of
important significance for making further progress in the rule of
law and in building a socialist legal system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tasks and basic principles as defined in the existing law
are correct and will not be altered, he said.
</P>
<P>
But some stipulations in the law are not specific enough and,
as some crimes have become more serious over the years and new crimes
have emerged, the existing law is no longer suited for the new
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
So, "it is necessary to amend, make additions to and improve
the criminal law to cater to the practical need of combating
crimes," he explained.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important revisions to the law is to further
clarify three major principles of criminal justice, namely: crimes
and punishment must be judged and meted out in accordance with
specific provisions of the law, all are equal before the law, and
punishment must be commensurate with crimes.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the establishment of the first principle,
provisions on analogy are to be deleted since such provisions
allow courts to judge crimes not defined by the law by referring
to most similar provisions in the law.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Reviews Amendments to Criminal Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The draft law states that a behavior defined as a crime by the
law shall be convicted and given punishment in accordance with the
law; while behaviors not defined as crimes by the law shall not be
deemed as crime and no punishment shall be meted out.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that "there is the necessity and conditions to
eliminate the analogy provisions" today as the draft contains
specific provisions for various crimes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, reiteration of the principle of equality of all
before the law in this criminal law has practical significance
despite the fact that it is provided for by the Constitution, the
senior lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Counter-revolutionary crimes in the existing law will be
renamed crimes of jeopardizing state security in the draft
amendments. All other crimes not named as crimes of
jeopardizing state security are categorized into crimes of
jeopardizing public security and harming the administration of
social order.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that, in the existing law, the judgment of some
counter-revolutionary crimes is based on the criterion of
offending "with counterrevolutionary purposes," which is hard to
verify.
</P>
<P>
This revision is made "with the state system and the
safeguarding of overall national interests in mind, and
from a legal point of view," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains more detailed provisions on punishment
reduction, release on parole, and punishment whose severity is
below what is prescribed by the law to prevent willful practices
by law-enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Justifiable defense" is loosely defined in the existing law
and is prone to lead to willful practices in law enforcement.
Victims and policemen are usually given penalties for defending
themselves under the existing law.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Reviews Amendments to Criminal Law (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To protect the rights and interests of victims and
law-enforcement personnel, and encourage chivalry for public
interest, several clauses are added to the law. New provisions
provide, for example, that those causing deaths, injuries and
other consequences as a result of defense against violent acts
that threaten personal safety shall not shoulder criminal
responsibilities; and that on-duty policemen shall be free from
criminal responsibility for using baton or weapons and causing
deaths or injuries in accordance with the law at a time of
violence or with personal safety being threatened.
</P>
<P>
There are new provisions on crimes that have just emerged or
will emerge in the future, such as those committed by the mafia,
organized terrorism, crimes of instigating ethnical hatred or
discrimination, money laundering, computer crimes, securities
frauds and intruding on commercial secrets.
</P>
<P>
Articles on capital punishment are virtually unchanged except
that a stay of execution as the maximum punishment for minors has
been reduced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Revisions are also made to articles on surrender, meritorious
service, speculation and profiteering, hooliganism, corruption
and malfeasance. Two chapters on violating national defense
interests and violation of duty by armymen are added to the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in the past 17 years, relevant departments have
spent 15 years revising or making additions to the criminal law --
the top legislature has so far promulgated 22 supplementary
provisions and decisions regarding the existing criminal law.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is based mainly on previous legislations and made
by having reference to foreign criminal legislation and world
trends in criminal legislation in a new period.

<HEADLINE> Urban Cooperative Bank Spring Up in Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- More than a hundred Chinese
cities will push their financial reforms forward this year, as a
result of the burgeoning of urban cooperative banks.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing urban cooperative banks based on the former urban
credit cooperatives is a significant measure China has taken to
reform its financial system and commercialize its banking sector,"
said Li Guochen, president of the Urban Cooperative Bank of
Shijiazhuang, a successful example of the experiment in the
northern Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
China first selected 35 cities for the commercialization
try-out last year. Six of them, including Shanghai, Shenzhen,
Shijiazhuang and Nanjing, have so far opened urban cooperative
banks.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the six banks reported smooth operation and
greatly improved credit management. As more strict and unified
controls were imposed on credit extension, the banks' assets
quality was also upgraded.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 5,000 urban credit cooperatives, and the
soon-to-be-restructured local banks will be able to better serve
local medium and small-sized ventures and urban residents, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Shijiazhuang Urban Cooperative Bank, for example, reported
better economic returns than other special banks in the city since
it opened last May. It also more strongly supported the city's
economic build-up by channeling most of its funds into local key
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
A unified national settlement system has also gone into
operation in Shanghai, hooking up all the six urban cooperative
banks, and speeding up the settlement among different regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft was destroyed and four
soldiers were killed this morning when Tamil rebels attacked an
air force base in Trincomalee and the Army's Brigade Headquarters
in Vavunativu in Eastern province of Sri Lanka, according to a
military spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that nearly 300 rebels had entered the base
from the rail track and launched mortar and small arms fire
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The air force successfully repulsed the attack by using air and
ground fire, however, an air force transport plane was totally
destroyed and four airmen were killed in the attack, he said.

rebels had removed the dead and injured when they retreated on
arrival of reinforcements.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Should Be Encouraged to Produce More Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from China's No. 1
grain producer say special efforts should be made to keep farmers'
enthusiasm in growing grain after the good harvest last year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Jilin province, northeast China, plan to sell to the
state 16 billion kg of grain this spring, according to Mi Fengjun,
a Jilin deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), which has
been in session since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By February 16, the state had purchased 11 billion kg of grain,
four billion kg more than last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The top issue now is to prevent the grain from spoiling,
including new grain with a high moisture content that has been
purchased and stored, and the five billion kg of grain waiting to
be purchased by the state, said deputy Zang Shengye.
</P>
<P>
He added that with Jilin's present transport capacity, the
grain cannot be transported out of the province promptly, and the
overflowing of grain storages will affect the purchase of summer
grain.
</P>
<P>
As an expedient measure, the provincial government has
encouraged farmers to reserve the grain still in their own hands,
and made the promise to buy the grain later while granting loans
to farmers for crop raising, said Governor Wang Yunkun who is
attending the NPC session in a non-deputy capacity.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Wang noted, the government has mobilized all
those working in grain reserving departments to sun the grain on
all open ground available to "ensure that not a single grain
goes rotting."
</P>
<P>
The governor added the province planned to expand its grain
storage capacity to 25 billion kg, its grain drying capacity from
the present six billion kg to 15 billion kg, and add new
facilities for grain transport.
</P>
<P>
With 5.3 million hectares of farmland and 25 million farmers,
Jilin has ranked first among all the Chinese provinces and regions
for 11 consecutive years in terms of the amount of grain for each
resident, the amount of commercial grain sold, grain export and
grain sold to other provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in South China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region enjoyed their first film festival this
past week.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day festival, which opened March 1st in Hengxian
County, more than 20 national films and a series of science and
educational films were exhibited that spoke to the farmers' lives
and were loved by them.
</P>
<P>
One film, titled Liu Hulan, told the story of a well-known
national heroine, who was village-born and devoted her life to
the War of Liberation (1946-1949).
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi farmers have difficulty watching a film due to
their remote dwelling places and the underdeveloped local
economy. The organizers of the festival promised to let every
farmer in Hengxian County, Yulin City and Dahua County, which are the
centers of the festival, enjoy at least one film during the
festival.
</P>
<P>
The local departments concerned are trying to hold various
rural film festivals at irregular intervals in winter when farmers
are not as busy.
</P>
<P>
The festival was co-sponsored by seven organizations, including
the local cultural department and the local committee of
nationality affairs, which will take effective measures against
film smuggling to ensure a prosperous and healthy rural film
market.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Approves New Child Support System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet
has approved an additional 1.2 billion Rand (272 million U.S.
Dollars) relief scheme to help three million poor children around
the country over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
All South African children under age six will qualify for a
new benefit if the primary care-giver meets the requirements of a
means test, Welfare and Population Development Minister Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi was quoted by today's Citizen paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
A simple and workable test that will identify poverty-stricken
households is being finalized, Fraser-Moleketi said.
</P>
<P>
The latest child support system, which will come into
operation on August 1 this year, will be paid at a flat rate of
75 Rand (17 Dollars) for a child per month.
</P>
<P>
The amount has been agreed on because it is slightly above the
household subsistence level for food and clothing for a child
under six years old, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mothers of babies who obtain the new benefit will be required
to regularly visit primary health care centers and this would
help in monitoring beneficiaries, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The South African Welfare Department currently paid out about
1.2 billion Rand a year in maintenance grants to 349,692
beneficiaries, Fraser-Moleketi said.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
expects to attract five billion yuan (about 600 million US
dollars) of overseas investment during the 1996-2000 period to
shore up its power sector.
</P>
<P>
Numerous heavy industries and raw materials resources have long
put a strain on Gansu's electricity supply, which threats to block
the inland province's ambitious development plan.
</P>
<P>
Gansu witnessed a record power shortage of 15 million kwh daily
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To ease the chronic power shortfall, the province has decided
to add a generating capacity of two million kw to the current five
million kw. Related projects are expected to cost 23.3 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Gansu started ushering overseas capital into the power sector
in 1994 and so far has used 589 million dollars of government and
commercial loans for a dozen projects. The province is currently
building a joint-venture power project -- a 600,000-kw unit in the
Jingyuan Electricity Plant -- with a US company.
</P>
<P>
Before the year 2000, the province plans to revamp two
10-year-old power complexes, the Liancheng Power Plant and the
Bapanxia Hydro-electric Plant, through joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Party Secretary and His Farmer Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- It was late at night, but Dai
Xianlu and Xie Shijie were still immersed in conversation.
</P>
<P>
Dai, a village Party secretary from southwest China's Sichuan
Province, and Xie, Party secretary of the province, are both
deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature, which is in its fifth annual session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It has become a custom for Dai to talk about farm production in
his county and changes in villages with the provincial party
secretary, who loves to make friends with farmers, whenever they
meet at NPC annual sessions.
</P>
<P>
Offering a citrus to Dai, who was in trim business suits with a
necktie, Xie said humorously: "From what you wear, I can say the
farmers' life is turning better day by day."
</P>
<P>
Dai said that "we farmers have 'three joys' last year, namely,
higher grain output and more income, no more 'IOUs', and no more
mono-culture mode," he listed.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Sichuan province scored good harvests, and the overall
grain output reached a record 47.058 million tons. The average net
income of farmers was 1,453 yuan, a rise of 295 yuan over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dai recalled that the per capita income in his village rose to
1,600 yuan last year from 1,280 yuan in 1995, while six township
enterprises chopped up an annual output value of 20 million yuan
were set up through fund-raising among the villagers.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all families in our village have built new houses
equipped with new television sets," he added. Some households have
access to telephones service and even cellular phones, or have
bought motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Xie nodded with smiles, while he was briefed on changes that
have occurred in villages. He praised Dai and his fellow villagers
for the progress they had achieved last year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he urged Dai not to be contented but go on
working harder for a still better life and catch up with those
affluent villages in the eastern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The village Party secretary acknowledged that last year's good
harvest has resulted in two diversed ideas among the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Some villagers think that it is easy to have good farm yields
again this year, while some other folks doubt if the grain output
can be increased further," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both ideas are harmful to agricultural production,
Xie said "we should have no letup in our work, and take more
effective measures to ensure steady farm yields and better
diversified rural economy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xie promised that the provincial government will
strive to ease the farmers' burden in accordance with the relevant
policies of the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of our province this year is to further increase the
grain output by 500 million kilograms and farmers' per-capita
income by at least 200 yuan," he told Dai.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women Have Long Way to Go Before Winning Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian women still have a long
way to go before achieving the goal of equality, said a report
released here today by the Canadian Labor Congress (CLC).
</P>
<P>
The 100-page report, on women's career lives in Canada, noted
that only 20 percent of Canadian women have full-time, full-year
jobs, compared to 40 percent of the country's men.
</P>
<P>
It showed that Canada has the second largest number of low-paid
women (34.3 percent) among all industrialized countries except
Japan.
</P>
<P>
And while Canadian women account for less than 20 percent of
those in the top 10 paying job categories, they represent more
than 70 percent in the lowest paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the jobless rate for Canadian women is "shockingly
high" -- 15.6 percent for young women, 13.4 percent for visible
minority women and 17.7 percent for aboriginal women, compared
with the national average of 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Despite women's gains over the last generation, the vast
majority remain stuck in low paying jobs with little hope for
advancement," said CLC Executive Vice-President Nancy Riche.
</P>
<P>
"The myth of women's equality is everywhere...This report
offers a painful reality check to these images," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The Women's Work report indicates that this systematic
discrimination (against women) is not disappearing. Apart from a
small minority of white professional women, women are losing
ground as 'restructuring' by both government and corporations
barrels along," Riche noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is a disgrace for a nation that likes to crow about its
number-one ranking from the United Nations survey on countries'
quality of life," she said.

KUNMING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, has pledged to help 2.45 million people in
underdeveloped Yunnan Province in southwest China shake off
poverty by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a newly signed Shanghai-Yunnan poverty relief
agreement, Shanghai is responsible for enabling the poor people
in Simao, Wenshan and Honghe prefectures to have enough food and
clothing, defined as a per capita income 500 yuan and per capita
share of grain above 300 kilograms a year.
</P>
<P>
Specific improvements in drinking water, primary education and
health care are also defined in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The central government has asked the developed eastern areas to
assist the underdeveloped western areas, hoping to balance
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government has designated 12 of its
districts and counties to support the three prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Personnel training programs are very high on the list. More
than 100 senior managers trained in Shanghai have made significant
progress back in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Education Commission donated teaching equipment,
and 10.28 million yuan to finance 23 primary schools and an
education fund in Yunnan Province. It trained 570 teachers for the
province last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission also sends experienced teachers, with plans to
establish two teachers training centers in Yunnan to improve the
province's elementary and vocational education programs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai allocates 10 million yuan annually to set up one or
two key poverty-relief projects in each of the 22 poor counties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, determined to tap the resource-rich province's
potential, will help modernize Yunnan's agriculture and animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to promote the development of township-run
enterprises in Yunnan and help market Yunnan-made products in
Shanghai and other parts of China.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Sign Up to Donate Corneas, Following Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Many Beijing residents have signed
up to donate their corneas to an eye bank after death, in tribute
to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
About 200 to 300 people have filled forms to register at the
Beijing Tongren Eye Bank to donate their corneas since Deng's
request to have his corneas donated was made public on February 20,
the day after the 93-year-old leader died, according to staff
members at the eye bank.
</P>
<P>
"We decide to donate our corneas because this way we can
express our sorrow for Deng's death and show respect to him," said
64-year-old retired official Bu Jinzhi and his wife, Zhang Anqi, a
senior editor at People's Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"Deng was a great man who gave himself entirely to the country
and the people. We're deeply touched by his philosophical view of
life and death," some 100 medical college students said after
signing up to donate.
</P>
<P>
About 4000 people have registered at Tongren Eye Bank since it
was established by Tongren Hospital in 1990, a staff member said.
</P>
<P>
However, Tongren and many other Chinese hospitals are short of
eyes and organs for transplants due to people's traditional view
that the remains of the deceased should not be dissected.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of patients become handicapped or even die because they
can't get organs for transplants in time. Many hospitals and
medical institutes can hardly carry out research on difficult
illness cases due to shortage of patients' remains," Beijing
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"As medics, we should take the lead in adapting customs and
changing traditions," the report quoted Huang Huiming, a doctor at
the Beijing Friendship Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Deng's requests to have his remains dissected for
medical research and his ashes scattered into sea, more than 500
people in east China's Nanjing City have joined in an organ
donation group. And 410 Shanghai residents signed up to have their
cremated remains scattered at sea, according to local newspaper
reports.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said here today that his ministry encouraged the
members of the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) to better themselves
academically to enhance the standard of professionalism within the
MAF.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing of two memoranda of understanding
(MOUs) between his ministry and two educational institutes, he

acquire professional qualifications.
</P>
<P>
"We should not take such a stand because there will be those
still willing to serve," he said, adding the armed forces would
still be proud of those who left the service if they were
successful in their respective careers.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chongqing  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The State Council today forwarded
to the fifth session of the Eighth National People's Congress a
motion on the establishment of Chongqing as a provincial-level
municipality directly under the authority of the central
government. Following is a brief introduction to Chongqing:
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is one of China's exceptionally large cities with a
history of more than 3,000 years. It is the largest economic
center, city and an important transportation hub in southwestern
China and on the upper reach of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the Shang Dynasty (about 16th-11th century B.C.)
and the period of the Warring States (475 B.C-221 B.C), Chongqing
was capital of the Ba State. It later became Ba Prefecture in the
Qin Dynasty (221 B.C-207 B.C.) and down through the Eastern Han
Dynasty (25-220). In the Sui Dynasty (581-618), Chongqing was made
Yu Prefecture and was later set up as Chongqing Prefecture in the
Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
In 1891, Chongqing was opened up as a trading port and in 1929
was officially established as a city. After the outbreak of the
War of Resistance against Japan, the Kuomintang government moved
westward to Chongqing and coastal industries were also moved to
the interior. In 1940, Chongqing was made a "wartime capital" by
the Kuomintang government and was the political, economic,
commercial, trade, financial, transportation, cultural and
diplomatic center at that time.
</P>
<P>
In the early years after the founding of the People's Republic
of China, Chongqing was home to the Communist Party of China
Central Committee's Southwestern Bureau and Southwestern Military
and Political Commission, as well as a municipality directly under
the authority of the central government.

<P>
In 1954, Chongqing was changed into a city at the prefectural
level administered by Sichuan Province. The State granted it a
separate power away from the province in making economic
development plans between 1954-1958. In the middle of the 1960s,
Chongqing was a major area for defense industry-related
construction and became an important national industrial base. In
February, 1983, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
designated Chongqing as one of the first group of cities to
experiment with restructuring of the economic system and as a city
with a separate power away from the province in making economic
development plans and with the status of a province in the
administration of the economy, and it was also opened up as a
foreign trade port.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing lies in the southeastern part of the Sichuan Basin,
measuring 208 km from the east to the west and 220 km from the
south to the north. Urban Chongqing, located in a hilly area where
the Yangtze River and the Jialingjiang River meet, has an area of
23,114 sq km, about four percent of the total area of Sichuan
Province. The city proper has an area of 1,534 sq km. Chongqing
now administers 11 districts and 10 counties and had a population
of 15.2 million at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal of the State Council, the
administrative areas under Wanxian Municipality, Fuling
Municipality and Qianjiang Prefecture will be incorporated into
Chongqing after it is lifted to the status of a provincial-level
municipality, raising its total area to 82,000 sq km and its
population to 30.2 million.

Chongqing has developed rapidly economically and socially since
the third plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Its gross city
product reached 74.3 billion yuan in 1995, a four-fold increase
over 1978. The per capita income for living expenses of urban
residents hit 4,053 yuan and that of farmers 1,554 yuan.
Chongqing's industrial and agricultural output in 1995 reached 144
billion yuan, with 120.1 billion yuan coming from industries. The
city's service sector reported an output of 24.7 billion yuan in
1995, about 33 percent of the local GDP
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chongqing has more than 2.1 million commercial
outlets and nearly 300 financial institutions. It has established
economic and trade relations with 110 countries and regions
throughout the world, with an annual import and export volume of
nearly 1.5 billion US dollars. A total of 1,500 overseas-funded
projects have been approved, with actual overseas investment
valued at 1.7 billion US dollars. The number of overseas-funded
enterprises now stands at 1,575.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou and Xiangfan-Chongqing
railways meet in Chongqing. The Chengdu-Chongqing expressway for
motor cars has opened to traffic and the Chongqing port's handling
capacity has reached 6.3 million tons. The Chongqing airport has
opened more than 30 domestic routes and direct chartered flights
to Hong Kong and Japan. The newly-built Jiangbei airport can
accommodate Boeing-747 passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing enjoys scientific and technological advantages in
West China. Currently, it has 340 scientific research institutions
of various kinds, 33 universities and colleges, and more than
350,000 scientific and technological personnel of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
If the State Council motion is adopted, Chongqing will join
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai as the fourth provincial-level
municipality directly under the authority of the central
government.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Starts Spring Sowing   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's major grain producers are
preparing for spring sowing, kicking off the nationwide drive for
another bumper crop after the record-breaking harvest of 1996.
</P>
<P>
South China, which enjoys a warmer climate and more rainfall
than North China, led the nation in seeding rice. Provinces in
Central and Northern China ready themselves for spring ploughing,
a crucial step for high output yields.
</P>
<P>
China is making a sustained effort to attain its ambitious goal
to feed its population of 1.2 billion. It set a historical record
in grain production last year with the national output topping 480
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Despite two promising consecutive harvests, the Central
Government remains prudent, and urged all localities to keep a
tight control on grain production early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the area sown to
grain crops in China will cover 1.68 billion mu (about 110 million
ha) this year. Some 60-70 percent of the land will cater to summer
crops. The gross grain output should remain at the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces,
one of the major grain-producing areas in China, the total acreage
of summer crops stands at three million ha.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi, which sells an average one billion kg of grain to the
state each year, pledged to stabilize the crop fields at 3.5
million ha and increase government allocation for agricultural use
by 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to sow
grain crops on 3.6 million ha of land this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Starts Spring Sowing  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farm households in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces started
tilling the land soon after the Spring Festival, which fell on
February 7. Provincial government of Fujian gave all-round support
for building 30 commodity grain bases, improving low-output fields,
and river harnessing.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the Ministry of Water Resources showed China
invested 32.2 billion yuan in irrigation projects last winter to
pave way for the spring ploughing.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces have distributed an abundant supply of fertilizer,
improved seed strains and farm chemicals. The price of many raw
materials are roughly same as that of last year, sometimes drifting
lower.
</P>
<P>
The progress of agro-science proved decisive in achieving last
year's record grain harvest. Statistics indicate the ratio of
success of the harvest attributable to scientific technique in China
climbed to 39 percent last year, an increase of five percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
And agricultural experts predict that agro-science will
continue to be a key factor in obtaining a good yield for this
year since the land area for crops can expect only marginal
expansion, and weather remains unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
More than one million farmers will be trained to master modern
techniques such as sparse-planting and seed-spraying methods,
which can raise the per-ha yield by 600 kg and 1,125 kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi is to plant hybrid rice on 666,000 ha of land this
year. Fujian will continue to popularize 10 high-yield
agro-techniques. Zhejiang will bring more land under irrigation,
improve 66,000 ha of poor land and build more agricultural
experimental plots.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Restructuring of UN, Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela today called for "rapid restructuring" of the
United Nations and for vigorous pursuit of the concept of the
Indian Ocean Rim in the process of establishing new world order.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech here, entitled "South and Southern Africa
into the Next Century" at the 16th Singapore Lecture, Mandela said
that the first challenge nations throughout the world now face is
the restructuring of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no gainsaying that no other body can give leadership
to the evolution of the new world order than the UN," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We in South Africa, along with the Organization of African
Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement are calling for a rapid
restructuring of this world body to ensure that continents and
regions of the world can play an effective role in the
restructuring of international relations," Mandela stressed.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the pooling of sovereignty rather than the
submergence of other nations by the most powerful, the UN must be
accorded its central place in the conduct of world affairs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The second challenge pertains to regional integration, Mandela
said, noting that among developing countries, much progress has
been made in consolidating such regional blocs as the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The concept of the Indian Ocean Rim should be pursued with
vigor, as the idea starts to address this challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African President also called for efforts to
"rekindle old relationships" between Africa and Asia, saying, "We
yearn to rebuild what was destroyed. We seek to forge strong
multilateral ties among our nations under the new and more
favorable conditions of freedom, technological advance and peace."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who turns 79 in July, arrived here on Wednesday on his
first state visit to Singapore. He met with Singapore President
Ong Teng Cheong and other senior officials after his arrival and
would meet Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong before winding up the
visit later today.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Tianjin Boosting Cooperation with Inland Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Wide-ranging economic cooperative
projects are on a roll between north China's biggest open coastal
city of Tianjin and the inland Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
the northwest.
</P>
<P>
A total of 151 agreements, involving trade, technology, ports,
capital construction and agricultural development have been signed
between the localities.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is a major port city in north China; Ningxia is a
leading base of natural resources and raw materials. Currently,
more than 80 percent of export goods in Ningxia are shipped
through the Tianjin port.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to its previous practice of providing free
assistance and expecting nothing in return, such as offering
donations to its inland counterpart, Tianjin is now engaging
Ningxia in hopes of benefitting from its potential market and
abundant mineral resources, Tianjin's Executive Vice-Mayor Li
Shenglin said on a recent tour to Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The two areas are economically complementary in many ways, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
This year, Tianjin will give priority to transferring products,
technology, equipment and information to Ningxia, which in turn
will supply Tianjin with energy, raw materials and labor,
according to Ren Qixing, vice-chairman of the Ningxia Hui
autonomous regional government.
</P>
<P>
Together, the two sides will set up a number of companies
engaged in building materials, chemicals and non-ferrous metals,
and will develop export-oriented agriculture, while Ningxia will
establish agricultural by-products bases for Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also jointly finance four industrial
projects, valued at about 70 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate bilateral economic ties, Ningxia and Tianjin will
set up a special committee to coordinate economic and
technological cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Fast Neutron Experimental Reactor Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to complete its first
fast neutron reactor power plant by the end of the century, in
order to meet its increasing energy needs.
</P>
<P>
The experimental fast reactor power plant, which will be built
at a total cost of 860 million yuan (about 103 million US
dollars), will be the largest high-tech energy project contained
in the state's "863" high-tech development program.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, believed to be more efficient and safer and with a
higher utilization rate of uranium, will develop a thermal power
of 65 MWt and an electrical power of 20 MWe, providing the
technical basis for the country's first commercial fast reactor
power plant at the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
"To build a fast reactor power plant is of vital significance
for China's energy development in the next century," said Yang
Tianlu, vice-president of the China Institute of Atomic Energy and
general director of China's fast reactor project.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will sharply raise the utilization rate of the
rare nuclear fuel -- uranium, from around one percent by the
existing pressurized water reactors to 60 or 70 percent in the new
fast reactors.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Mi, chief engineer of China's Fast Reactor
Research Center, the operational Chinese Daya Bay and Qinshan
nuclear power plants, both equipped with pressurized water
reactors, will continue to play an important role in meeting the
country's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
However, the senior expert expressed the view that large-scale
development of pressurized water reactors would be difficult in
China because of the country's limited uranium reserves.
</P>
<P>
Xu revealed that the feasibility study for the experimental
fast reactor has been approved by the government and the relevant
departments. And the basic design, site choice, environmental
protection, and construction blueprints have all passed examination.
</P>
<P>
According to schedule, the earthwork of the project will start
this October. Concrete will be pored in May 1998, and construction
will be completed by 2000. The fast reactor power plant will start
generating electricity for the power grid by 2003.
</P>
<P>
China's energy needs will be equivalent to one billion tons
of standard coal by the middle of the next century, according to a
research report on China's Energy Needs by 2050, which was jointly
produced by the China State Science and Technology Commission
and the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the widening gap between energy demand and supply,
China has to boost nuclear power development in the next century,
the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Doctors Call Off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan doctors of the
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) who commenced a 24
hour strike Wednesday called it off soon after the government
appointed a ministerial committee to examine their demands,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the doctors staged a four-hour token strike over
salary anomalies demanding the restoration of their on-call and
availability allowance of Rs 2,000 (35 US dollars) per month and
the payment of the new academic allowance to doctors engaged in
teaching undergraduates, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's protest strike which was a follow-up of the token
strike was called off as soon as the government intimated its
decision to appoint the Ministerial Committee to study the salary
anomaly dispute as the GMOA intended to create an atmosphere
conducive to a dispassionate study of the dispute, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the commencement of the strike Wednesday, many
patients who turned up at hospitals returned home disappointed and
dejected. They had hoped that the hospitals would function
following President Chandrika Kumaratunga's call to the GMOA to
act with responsibility and refrain from any course of action that
would imperil the lives of poor patients.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Air India has discontinued its
flights to Canada, Australia and South Africa following Civil
Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim's advice to pull out of
commercially unviable routes, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Besides, frequency on several destinations in Europe, including
Paris and Frankfurt, has also been reduced to cut losses.
</P>
<P>
Pulling out flights from these destinations was part of a new
route management strategy which is being implemented to make
operations commercially viable and profitable, Air India sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the company would now follow a dynamic routing
policy in line with seasonal fluctuations, they confirmed that the
Bombay-Delhi-Toronto, Bombay-Sydney-Perth and the
Bombay-Johannesburg-Durban flights have been scrapped for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
Some of the aircraft freed from these routes have been pressed
in new flights launched on the profitable routes linking India
with some Gulf countries and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The airline is likely to launch a flight to Spain in May or
June when the tourist inflow from that country to India increases.
</P>
<P>
The other destinations which are being discussed now include
Seoul and Brunei.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Impose Value Added Tax This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
determined to introduce a Value Added Tax (VAT) regime to increase
the national revenue this year despite strong opposition from the
business community, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Finance Ministry's VAT department said they
are busy in making all necessary preparations for the
implementation of the new tax as the government decided to impose
it from the coming 1997-98 fiscal year starting in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The department will begin to list the names of all businessmen
who come under the VAT tax net next month, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, businessmen here vehemently criticized the
government's decision on the new tax regime, saying that the time
is not ripe yet for the country to implement the VAT, which is
expected to replace various existing taxes including excise and
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
Hasty introduction of such a new regime without adequate
homework could put the whole taxation system into disorder, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(FNCCI) and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce (NCC), the country's two
leading business organizations, have urged the government to
improve the management of current taxation system instead of
imposing the TAX immediately.
</P>
<P>
But tax officials said there is no alternative to the VAT if
the government wants to counter the rampant tax evasion activities
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a VAT Department official, the government will
nearly double its annual tax revenue to around 200 million US
dollars under the new VAT system.

BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Depositors continued to withdraw
money from finance firms on Wednesday after the central bank
announced that 10 local finance firms faced serious financial
problems, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawals from all finance companies in Thailand topped
12 billion baht (480 million U.S. dollars) on Wednesday, bringing

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swedish Defense Minister
Bjorn Von Sydow said today that his country was not in a hurry to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Before heading home after his one-day visit here, Sydow said
Sweden would follow the non-alliance policy under the five-year
defense plan approved by the parliament last December.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government believed, the defense chief noted, that
there was nothing at present to press for changes in the country's
position on the defense matter.
</P>
<P>
Sweden would work closely with NATO under the Peace for
Partnership program, in ways such as its participation of the
NATO-led peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S.-Russia summit scheduled to take place
here on March 20, Sydow said he took the event as a serious
dialogue with Russia on NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
There was no sign worth worrying that the leaders of the two
big powers would redefine their territories of influence in Europe
while ignoring opinions made clear by other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to making the remarks before the press at the Helsinki
airport, the Swedish minister was briefed by his Finnish
counterpart Anneli Taina about the host nation's defense forces.

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua)-- The Capital Iron and Steel Corp has
been granted ISO 9002 certification by the China Classification
Society after verification of its quality system, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
ISO 9002 certification is conferred on manufacturers whose
products meet internationally-required standards, awarded by the
China Certification Society, one of the first 10 organizations
approved by the State Technical Bureau and the State Commodities
Inspection Bureau to domestic enterprises, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The certification demonstrates that the company's management

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
Colombia to resume its aerial spraying of illicit drug crops as
soon as possible and hoped that the suspension was not a policy
change.
</P>
<P>
Colombia quietly suspended spraying operations today in the
wake of a U.S. announcement that Colombia was among the countries
which were decertified as U.S. allies in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
today that the government made the decision when its estimates
showed a 32 percent increase in the cultivation of coca in
Colombia, making it the second largest grower in the world.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the United States has not received any
explanation for the decision to suspend the spraying, but "We hope
that this decision has been taken for technical reasons only and
not policy reasons."
</P>
<P>
He added, "We certainly urge a resumption of eradication
operations as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Polo, head of the Colombian National Drug Policy
office, said that spraying had been temporarily suspended until
the government reviewed all its anti-drug agreements with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington last Friday decertified Colombia for the second
year running as an ally in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government said that it rejected the U.S.
"unilateral and partial evaluation mechanisms in the fight against
drug trafficking."

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua)-- An international conference on
food-ingredient production will be held here from March 10 to 12,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
China's development potential in this sector has drawn many
overseas manufacturers to Food Ingredients China'97 which is aimed
at improving the industry through global exchange, according to
You Xin, president of the China Food Additive Association.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 overseas participants will bring many food
additives, including those China cannot produce. In addition,
finishing food products, equipment and the latest technology will
be displayed by more than 360 exhibitors, You said.
</P>
<P>
China is among the world's top exporters of citric acid and
aginomoto. It also turns out more than 10,000 tons of food
coloring and sweeteners a year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the country still lags behind the world's top level in
products such as preservatives, thickeners and emulsifiers, which
are necessary to enhance the quality and nutritional value of
certain foods.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its huge food market, China's annual
food-ingredient output value is only 12 billion yuan (1.4 billion
US dollars), compared with 4 billion US dollars in the United
States and 3 billion US dollars in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation in the food-ingredient and additives sector is
expected to push forward China's food industry, You said. Food is
China's third largest industry after machinery and electronics and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
The show at the Beijing International Exhibition Center is the
seventh of its kind for domestic food additive producers, but the
first time for international counterparts, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tserenpiliin Gombosuren, an
active political figure of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party (MPRP), announced on Tuesday he was quitting the party, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
As minister of external relations from June, 1988 to July,
1996, Gombosuren won high praise within the country and around the
world for his bold reform of Mongolia's foreign policy. He became
a member of the MPRP leading committee.
</P>
<P>
Gombosuren said in a statement that he withdrew from the former
ruling party because the MPRP failed to fulfill the internal
reform undertakings set before its 22nd Convention, from last
February 21 to 24.
</P>
<P>
At the Convention, the MPRP did not learn a lesson from its
failure in last year's parliamentary election, and did not analyze
it correctly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gombosuren, who was initially acknowledged by some public
opinion as a competitive candidate to run for the presidency this
year, was eventually not listed among candidates.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said several other parties were deliberating on
nominating Gombosuren as their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, Gombosuren noted that his decision to quit had nothing
to do with the forthcoming presidential election, and he had no
intention of joining other parties in the future.
</P>
<P>
Gombosuren is still chairman of the board of a joint venture
securities company.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will export 700,000
tons of chicken and is expected to earn 1 billion U.S. dollars
this year, according to the Brazilian Association of Chicken
Exporters.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 570,000 tons of chicken were exported, enabling Brazil
to get 850 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, its optimism is due, to a large
extent, to the announcement of the shipment of 100,000 tons of
chicken to Russia this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the largest importer of chicken in the world, which
imported 17,000 tons of chicken from Brazil last year.

<HEADLINE> Colombia, Belize Reject U.S. Evaluation on Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and Belize told the
Organization of American States (OAS) today that they reject the
United States "unilateral evaluation mechanisms" in the fight
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Colombian ambassador to the OAS, Carlos Holmes Trujillo,
told a meeting of the Permanent Council of the OAS that "Colombia
has reject and continues to reject, in principle, unilateral and
partial evaluation mechanisms in the fight against drug
trafficking."
</P>
<P>
He said, "It rejects them because regional and multilateral
strategies and United Nations agencies are in place to evaluate
the fight against drugs, free of political or economic interests
and based on objective criteria."
</P>
<P>
Trujillo added that his government rejects such mechanisms
which often pull relations between two countries into
confrontation instead of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government announced last Friday its decision
decertifying a number of countries, including Colombia and Belize,
as its allies in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The permanent representative of Belize to the OAS, Ambassador
James Murphy, also read a statement issued by Belizean foreign
minister Dean Barrow Tuesday, expressing "dismay" at allegations
his country had not cooperated in the fight against dug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"The government utterly rejects those allegations," the
Caribbean diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Belize remains committed to the fight
against illegal drugs and international crime, and will
cooperate fully with all legitimate regional and international
efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
But the Belizean foreign minister said that his government would
not be coerced into signing treaties with clauses that violate
Belize's Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
"The Belizean government counts on the full support of the
Belizean people for this stand in defense of Belizean sovereignty
and rights," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Third Plenary Meeting of NPC Fifth Session Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
convened its third plenary meeting today to review two draft laws
-- draft amendments to the criminal law and a draft national
defense law -- and other legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the NPC Standing Committee and
an executive chairman of the NPC Fifth Session, presided over
today's session.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made
explanations on draft amendments to the criminal law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the existing Criminal Law enacted 17 years ago has
played an important role in cracking down on crimes, safeguarding
national unity and security and social order.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, it has also played an important role in
defending the power of the people's democratic dictatorship and
socialist system, and the smooth progress of the cause of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, there do exist some problems in the law, and
its revision will represent a major step forward in improving the
country's socialist legal system.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments expand the Criminal Law to 449 articles
from the existing 192 articles.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
State Councillor and defense minister, gave explanations to the
draft national defense law at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The draft, comprising 13 chapters with 76 articles, stresses
the Chinese Communist Party's leadership over the armed forces,
and gives definitions on national defense duties of state organs,
the armed forces, border defense, the defense industry, defense
spending, and military ties with overseas.
</P>
<P>
A draft decision on matters concerning election of deputies to
the Ninth NPC and draft methods for electing Hong Kong deputies to
the Ninth NPC were also submitted to the NPC for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft decision, the number of deputies to the
Ninth NPC shall not exceed 3,000, with one deputy elected from
every 220,000 urban residents or every 880,000 rural residents.
The deputies should be elected before the end of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
A special election conference consisting of Chinese citizens in
Hong Kong will be held responsible for the election of 36 deputies
to the Ninth NPC, according to the draft methods.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, as the last item on the agenda, heard explanations
on a motion set forth the State Council on upgrading Chongqing
city in Sichuan province to become a municipality directly under
the central government.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian said the purpose of establishment
of Chongqing municipality is to give full play to its role as an
economic center in southwest China and the upper reaches of
Yangtze river.
</P>
<P>
The proposed municipality will have an area of 82,000 sq km
with a population of 30 million, making it the largest
municipality in China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,634 deputies attended today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on National Defense Submitted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first basic law in the
field of national defense today was submitted to the Fifth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature, for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on national defense had been discussed twice
by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
In a bill of joint signatures, Premier Li Peng and President
Jiang Zemin, who is also chairman of the Central Military
Commission (CMC), said that the law was intended to help build and
consolidate national defense, safeguard China's sovereignty,
unity, territorial integrity and safety, and ensure the smooth
development of the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
They said that the draft law, which was formulated under the
guidance of Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
ideas of military building in the new historical period, has
summarized the experience of China's building of national defense,
and is compatible with the demands of national defense and army
building under the circumstances of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, Vice-Chairman of the CMC, State Councillor and
Minister of National Defense, was authorized by the State Council
and the CMC to explain the draft law to the legislators.
</P>
<P>
"The law covers not only guarding and resistance against any
possible armed invasions from the outside, but also crackdowns on
any domestic armed rebellions or armed riots aimed at splitting
the motherland, subverting state power, and overthrowing the
socialist system," he noted, adding that such armed rebellions and
riots seriously threaten national sovereignty and unity,
territorial integrity and state security.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity to keep on a high alert against
"Taiwan Independence" and other activities that aim to split the
country.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that the armed forces of the People's
Republic of China shall be subject to the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, thus providing a legal guarantee for the
principle that "the Party commands the troops."
</P>
<P>
Chi pointed out that it is the successful experience of China's
armed struggle and building of national defense, and a basic
guarantee for the country's political and social stability, ethnic
unity and national security, to adhere to the absolute Party
leadership over the military.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Although the Constitution has stipulated the Party's leading
role in the country, it still has great significance to clearly
define the Party's leadership over the armed forces. This is a
principle with Chinese characteristics that must be insisted on,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that China will carry out a defense
policy of "active defense" and stick to the principle of
"self-defense by the entire people."
</P>
<P>
Chi said that it is a worldwide practice to set forth a
country's policies, basic principles and systems of national
defense by means of legislation.
</P>
<P>
"With the development of reforms, opening up and socialist
modernization drive, China is playing a more important role in
international affairs. However, some hostile forces have
deliberately fabricated the theory of 'China Threat', and tried
every means to damage China's global image," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that a law on national defense can clearly illustrate
China's peace-loving principles and policies for national
defense to the rest of the world, and help create a favorable
external environment for the country's reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
Drawing experience from other major countries in the world, the
draft law stipulates that the state should guarantee necessary
financial outlay for national defense in accordance with specific
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It also makes stipulations on the power of relevant government
organs in national defense, national defense assets, education
on national defense, national defense mobilization, and
protection of the servicemen's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that defense affairs in special administrative
regions be decided by the basic laws of the special
administrative regions and other relevant laws.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Lifting of U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called for the United
Nations Security Council to lift the sanctions applied to Iraq
since the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow press reported that Iraq Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister, Tarik Aziz, made the call during a working visit
to Moscow. He said it was time for the U.N. to consider lifting
the sanctions as the country had fulfilled its obligations in
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz criticized the United States and Britain for preventing
the U.N. from lifting the ban, at a joint news briefing given by
him and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Aziz claimed that the two countries' real purpose was to
"isolate and weaken Iraq," in order to "seek gains and maintain
their hegemony in the Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official praised Russia's "friendly, just and proper
stand" towards his country.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he hoped all restrictions on Iraq's oil exports
would be eliminated this year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister told reporters that a delegation from the
Energy Ministry would be sent to Iraq to prepare for trade
exchanges between the two countries after the ban was lifted.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a working visit.

<HEADLINE> Laos Plans to Propose New Border Pass with Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Laos is planning to propose a new
border pass that will enable Thais and Laotians to cross the
border freely, according to a report reaching here today from
Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Soutsakhone Pattammavong, director-general of consular affairs
of the Lao Foreign Ministry, was quoted as saying that the
proposal calls for a border pass holder to be given a two-week
visa to travel anywhere in Thailand or Laos.
</P>
<P>
This would cover all of Thailand's 76 provinces and Laos' 16.
Currently, pass holders can only travel within 25 kilometers of
their point of entry.
</P>
<P>
Laos plans to submit a draft proposal to Thailand for
consideration before the two countries meet on the subject, and
the meeting is expected to take place in Vientiane later this
month.
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal will be put to Laos' other neighbors --
Vietnam, China, Cambodia and Myanmar -- if the deal with Thailand
is successful, Soutsakhone said.
</P>
<P>
Soutsakhone said Laos will propose freer movement for
businessmen, including a multiple entry visa for border pass
holders, and equal treatment for passport holders.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Laos grants Thai businessmen multiple-entry visas
valid for six months, while Thailand only allows Laotian
businessmen double entry over a period of three months.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai side claims it's a matter of immigration
regulations," Soutsakhone said
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask Thailand to relax regulations on Laotian
visitors.
</P>
<P>
At present, Laotians who want to visit Thailand must produce a
bank statement showing they have at least 10,000 baht (about 400
US dollars) in their account to guarantee their return.
</P>
<P>
Soutsakhone said this is unrealistic because most Laotians are
poor and have no bank savings, and are thus discouraged from
traveling to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Upper House Adopts Law on World War II Art Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation Council, the
upper house of parliament, today passed a law on World War II art
trophy despite the government's opposition.
</P>
<P>
The legislation declares that art objects moved by the former
Soviet Union to the territory of Russia during and after World War
II belong to Russia's national property.
</P>
<P>
An Itar-Tass news agency report said the law was unanimously
approved with 140 votes.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, the Russian government said
Russia's unilateral claim of ownership of the relocated art
objects is against international accords and international law.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new law, the government noted, will
lead to serious political consequences as it fails to divide the
art objects along the line of aggressors and the aggressed.
</P>
<P>
Already passed by the Duma, or the lower house of parliament,
and pending the signature by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the
law has caused strong repercussions from Europeans countries.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Yeltsin, Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok
asked him to help return the art objects belonging to the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Election of HK Deputies Submitted for NPC Deliberation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election conference comprises Chinese citizens from the
Election Committee for the first HKSAR government, members of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are Chinese citizens of the
HKSAR but are not concurrently members of the Election Committee,
and members of the HKSAR Provisional Legislative Council who are
Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the 400 members of the Election Committee for the
first HKSAR government has a broad representation in Hong Kong. It
is suitable for the election conference to be based on Chinese
citizens from the Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
Considering the suggestion of most NPC deputies and CPPCC
National Committee members from Hong Kong, he added, the
membership of the election conference has been expanded to include
CPPCC National Committee members among Hong Kong residents who are
not concurrently members of the Election Committee, and Chinese
citizens among members of the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the method applies only to election of deputies
to the Ninth NPC from the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The election procedure stipulated by the draft method is: the
first meeting of the election conference will be called by the NPC
Standing Committee, and the meeting will elect a presidium with 11

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Election of HK Deputies Submitted for NPC Deliberation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese legislature, from
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be elected
before the end of January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of eight deputies over the current
number of Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, according to a draft
method on the election of deputies from the Hong Kong SAR to the
Ninth NPC. The draft method was submitted to the Fifth Session of
the Eighth NPC here today for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, made
explanations on the draft at the session.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft allocation plan for deputies to be elected
to the Ninth NPC, which is under deliberation by the NPC general
session, one deputy is to be elected from about every 220,000
urban residents and from about every 880,000 rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had a population of 6.31 million (all calculated as
city residents) in 1995, and in accordance with the draft plan,
the SAR should have 29 deputies to the Ninth NPC (it has 28
deputies to the Eighth NPC).
</P>
<P>
Given the special status of the SAR, Cao said, an extra seven
is added, making the total number of deputies 36.
</P>
<P>
The draft method stipulates the establishment of a deputies
election conference in the Hong Kong SAR, which will elect the

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Expected to Become China's Fourth Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, an industrial city in
southwest China, is expected to become the fourth municipality
after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin after the current session of
China's legislature approves a motion submitted today by the State
Council, China's cabinet,
</P>
<P>
In a proposal submitted for approval to the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National Conference (NPC), which has been in session
since last Saturday, Premier Li Peng termed it "an important move
to promote economic and social development in southwest China."
</P>
<P>
In explaining the motion on behalf of the State Council, State
Councillor Li Guixian recalled at the session's third plenary
meeting today Chongqing was designated by the State Council as one
of China's first cities to experiment with economic structuring on
an experimental basis, and granted equal status in the
administration of economy as that of a province in 1983.
</P>
<P>
To give full scope to Chongqing's rule as a major economic
center and further push forward economic and social development in
eastern Sichuan, the southwest China and the entire upper reaches
of the Yangtze River, he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Councillor said the move will also contribute to the
construction and relocation for the gigantic Three Gorges Dam
project which has been under way since 1993 with one million
people to be displaced. Moreover, the move will relieve Sichuan
from managing China's most populous province, covering a large
land area.
</P>
<P>
Li further noted that the conditions for upgrading Chongqing to
become China's fourth municipality are mature.
</P>
<P>
As the largest economic center at the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and a major port city with close overseas contact, he
said, it is also a center of communications, scientific and
technological, cultural and education in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
As a separate city under plan with decision-making power
directly granted by the central government, Chongqing has been
separated with Sichuan in economic goals and budget, which makes
it easy to tackle some knotty problems.
</P>
<P>
When Chongqing becomes a municipality, the area under its
jurisdiction will be 82,000 sq km with a population of 30 million,
the largest city in China.
</P>
<P>
With a history of more than 3,000 years, Chongqing was opened
as a trade port in 1891 and officially became a city in 1929. It
was a political and cultural center of southwestern China and
designated as a municipality directly under central government in
the post-liberation years in early 1950s. Afterwards, it was
changed into a city directly under the jurisdiction of the
provincial government in 1954.

<HEADLINE> Tour Party Robbed In Sri Lanka's Game Sanctuary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A tour party including two British
tourists were robbed Wednesday by an armed group in camouflage
uniforms who also hijacked their vehicle in Sri Lanka's national
game sanctuary Yala in the deep south, according to police sources
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the tour party had been accosted by seven
armed men who ordered them to alight from their vehicle. When they
showed reluctance the gang had threatened to shoot them.
</P>
<P>
The occupants had then alighted and handed over the vehicle to
the gang and proceeded to a nearby army camp and reported the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle, a jeep, was later found abandoned and set on fire
where it had got stuck in the mud in a stream in the sanctuary,
they said.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, a group of men similarly clad had threatened
some fishermen and stolen their provisions near the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
The sources suspect that the gang is a group of Tamil rebel
cadres who had penetrated the sanctuary from the North of the
country.

MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has committed to extend a 50 million US dollar loan to support the
Philippines' agrarian reform program, officials from the
Manila-based bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support the development of 75 to 100
agrarian reform communities in the country, preferably those that
have not received any support from other foreign agencies.
</P>
<P>
The agrarian reform communities are among the most
disadvantaged communities in the Philippines, lacking adequate
physical and social infrastructure.

It is for this reason the World Bank extended a 50 million US
dollar loan to the agrarian reform communities, while Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund gave another 50 million US
dollars for the development of these communities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a preparatory technical assistance grant of
250,000 US dollars was extended by the ADB to the project.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also dispatched a fact-finding mission early this year
to some communities in several provinces to look into whether
local government units have the funds and can carry out projects
and maintain physical infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's social reform agenda, the agrarian reform
communities were designated as conduits for agricultural
development, basic infrastructure development and
productivity-enhancing efforts.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Department of Agrarian Reform has identified 862
agrarian reform communities nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Deputies to China's Ninth NPC to be Elected Before January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A draft decision on the number and
election of deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
was submitted to the fifth session of the Eighth NPC for
examination.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, which is based on the Constitution and
the Election Law, nearly 3,000 deputies to the Ninth NPC will have
been elected throughout the country before the end of next
January.
</P>
<P>
The total number of deputies to the Ninth NPC will not exceed
3,000, the draft says. It also says that one deputy will be
elected out of every 880,000 people in the countryside and out of
every 220,000 people in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the draft decision:
</P>
<P>
In the provinces and autonomous regions with a very small
population, the number of deputies from each should be no fewer
than 15;
</P>
<P>
Taiwan province will temporarily elect 13 deputies from people
of Taiwan-origin in the provinces, autonomous regions,
centrally-administered municipalities and the People's Liberation
Army (PLA), and the remaining deputy quota Taiwan is entitled to
in accordance with law will be retained;
</P>
<P>
The PLA will elect 265 deputies;
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minorities account for around 12 percent of the total
number of NPC deputies, and for ethnic groups with a particularly
small population, there should be at least one NPC deputy for
each;
</P>
<P>
Of all deputies, 35 should be elected out of returned overseas
Chinese;
</P>
<P>
The proportion of female deputies should be bigger than that of
the Eighth NPC;
</P>
<P>
To ensure that a proper proportion of deputies is elected out
of areas and ethnic groups with a particularly small population
and out of areas with a concentration of people of various
circles, a certain quota out of the total number of deputies will
be allocated to relevant provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities by the NPC Standing Committee for election; and
</P>
<P>
A method for the election of deputies from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will be decided separately.

<HEADLINE> More People in China's Poorest Area Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Well over 500,000 people in
Xihaigu Prefecture, one of the poorest areas in China, escaped
poverty this year thanks to relief efforts by the Central
Government.
</P>
<P>
The two million people in the eight county prefecture in the
southern part of China's Ningxia Hui (muslim) Autonomous Region,
have suffered from soil erosion, hail, frost, flood, windstorms,
and recently a long-lasting drought.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the Central Government has allocated tens of
millions of yuan each year to develop the local economy of the
30,456 sq km region.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, grain output of Xihaigu
soared to 755 million kg last year, up 90.2 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 average grain and per capital income of residents in
Guyuan, the poorest area, increased by 90.8 percent and 52.2
percent, respectively, compared to the previous year.
</P>

improvement and spread of agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
The region has improved 14,333 ha of farmland, dug 43,000 water
wells, covered 17,200 ha of maize field with plastic film in a bid

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Call off Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a formal United Nations
Security Council meeting on Wednesday, Israel was urged strongly
by member states to call off its plan to build Jewish settlements
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 countries were enlisted as speakers at the
meeting on Israel's plan to build 6,500 homes in East
Jerusalem. The meeting is scheduled to run into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "a new colonial settlement", the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations, Nasser Al-Kidwa, described the
housing project as was one of a series of Israeli measures and
actions over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
These measures, he said, "constitute a clear policy aimed at
the continuation of the Judization of the city of Jerusalem,
changing its legal status and its demographic composition."
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community to protect and
uphold its will reflected in various U.N. resolutions, to restrain
Israel from continuing to ignore this will and from its persistent
violation of International Law.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the council meeting, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nation, Qin Huasun, urged Israel to
stop its plan to build the settlements.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that is bound to set serious obstacles to
the Palestine-Israel peace process and will be detrimental to the
Middle East peace process as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Jerusalem should be settled by the parties
concerned through negotiations on the basis of the relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral move contrary to this approach should be
avoided, since it will only further complicate the question
instead of rendering any help to its proper settlement, or to the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sergey V. Lavrov, permanent representative for Russia, said
Russia shared the negative response of the Palestinians, Arab and
Islamic States, and the international community to this
"inconsiderate and untimely step" taken by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli decision clouded the negotiating
environment in the Middle East, especially at the threshold of the
start in mid-March of talks on the final status.
</P>
<P>
"A co-sponsor of the peace process, Russia is convinced that the
situation requires action so as to avoid relapses to tensions in
Palestinian-Israeli relations similar to the events of last
September," he said.
</P>
<P>
United States Ambassador Bill Richardson said the U.S. "is
concerned by the decision announced by the Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe such activity is helpful to the peace
process," he said. "We believe that this decision undermines the
trust and confidence that is so badly needed if a lasting peace is
to be achieved."

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Kidnapping of Journalists in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Vitaly Ignatenko today condemned the kidnapping of journalists in
Chechnya as an act of political provocation against the new
leadership of the Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after addressing the State Duma,
Ignatenko said the Russian government would establish direct
contact with the leadership of Chechnya in order to settle the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported earlier in the day that four
Russian journalists were abducted Tuesday by unidentified gunmen
in Chechnya when they were heading home to the outskirts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen Interior Ministry confirmed the abductions, but
give no further information.
</P>
<P>
A Chechen, who acted as their driver and bodyguard, was not
taken and alerted the police.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapped victims are identified as Nikolai Zagnoiko of
Itar-Tass, Yuri Arkhipov, Nikolai Mamulashvili and Lev Zeltser of
government-run Radio Russia.
</P>
<P>
The captors, believed to be criminal gangs seeking ransom
money, fired shots at the car and took the newsmen away in another
car.
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time that journalists were kidnapped in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In January, two Russian television reporters were kidnapped and
held captive for a month before being released. Ten days ago, an
Italian photographer working for the Mandatori publishing house
was abducted in downtown Grozny while covering an official rally.
</P>
<P>
The increasing of abduction of journalists was becoming an
"international issue," the Russian deputy prime minister said,
adding that it is quite possible to solve the problem with the
participation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Russian Journalist Union (RJU) condemned the
event and described the situation in Chechnya as "violence of
raging crime."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the RJU called on all mass media not to send any
reporters to the Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping, usually for ransom money, is widespread in the
mountainous region which ended its 21-month armed conflict with
Moscow last August.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all men in the largely destroyed region are armed.
Russian journalists, foreign aid workers and ordinary citizens are
all targets of kidnappers.

<P>
DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) --A Japanese economic team on Wednesday
said the donor country would extend all possible cooperation to
Bangladesh, but hinted that future assistance could drop
significantly, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
The indication came from the Japanese mission that has been
attending a two-day consultation which began here on Wednesday to
discuss new development projects to be implemented with Japanese
loans.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting is being held after a two-year interval and
Bangladesh is likely to seek 610 million US dollars for eight
development projects, mainly in infrastructure and power sector,
from Tokyo in today's crucial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the Japanese team suggested that
Bangladesh concentrate more on "self-help efforts" for its
development endeavors, but said Japan would continue to consider
the case of Bangladesh as exceptional one.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting on Wednesday, the two sides discussed the
general issues of economic policy and the progress of projects
being implemented with soft loan from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the largest bilateral donors for Bangladesh,
offering on an average 200 million dollars annually to this
undeveloped country.

TIRANA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian troops have been on high

report from the Macedonian Information Center today.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, with a large number of ethnic Albanians in the
population along its border with Albania, has beefed up security
around its military facilities and increased patrols along the
border areas.
</P>
<P>
The measures, taken since a state of emergency was imposed in

inflows as the tension was escalated in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Cruenkovsik has called again

Force in the former republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N. resolution, the mandate for the U.N. force in
Macedonia will expire on May 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government insurgence in Albania was initiated by the
collapse of five once popular get-rich-quick investment schemes,
in which most Albanian families lost money.
</P>
<P>
Some angry protesters have turned violent, and have stormed
police, seized an array of weapons from state arsenals, and then
gone on a rampage of looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
European nations have expressed grave concerns over the
situation in Albania.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will no longer send
unskilled workers overseas, especially maids, from April next
year, according to official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Wednesday at a cabinet meeting chaired by
President Soeharto, said the sources.

The meeting concluded that there is a high overseas demand for
skilled Indonesian workers in various fields such as shipping, air

electronics, industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that out of almost one million Indonesians
working overseas last year, 38 percent were unskilled.
</P>
<P>
In the terms of money, the Indonesian workers abroad sent home
approximately 4.8 billion US dollars last year.

This year, the government expected to send some 1.2 million
workers overseas, who will receive an estimated combined total of
5.8 billion dollars for the year, said the sources.

workers around the year 2000, receiving a combined yearly income

HAVANA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is planning to restructure its
banking system to give the island access to international
financial markets, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth round-table meeting organized by the Cuban
government and the British publication "The Economist", Cuba's
National Bank President Francisco Soberon said reform included
institutional changes, technological modernization and the
re-training of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Cuba wanted to avoid the experience of former socialist
countries that created small private banks and financial
institutions, which were interested in short-term profits,
Francisco Soberon said.
</P>
<P>
According to the reform plan, Cuba will create a banking system
with seven banks under the strict supervision of a central
entity. The central body will incorporate 13 representative
offices of foreign financial institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said they would keep in close contact with
creditors of the island in order to normalize external financial
relations without taking on commitments, which would limit the
government's capacity to decide on how to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
New medium and long-term loan transactions would be formalized
with several countries and Cuba was continuing its talks with
those countries, Soberon added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the banking and financial institutions operating in
the country granted about 440 million U.S dollars worth of loans
to Cuban entrepreneurs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors who want to
obtain residence permits in Thailand will be required to buy
either government bonds or condominium units worth at least eight
million baht (about 320,000 US dollars), the Board of Investment
(BOI) of Thailand decided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Their spouses and children will also be required to invest at

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the third largest
centrally-administered municipality in China, has made big
progress in scientific and technological exchange and cooperation
with foreign countries,
</P>
<P>
Tianjin cooperated with foreign governments in 29 scientific
and technological projects in 1996, covering agriculture,
industry, health care and environment protection.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 foreign experts were invited to Tianjin last year
to advise locals in the fields of machinery, electronics,
textiles, light industry, agriculture, environment protection as
well as urban construction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995 Tianjin has embarked on a project to promote applied
technology by expanding foreign technology exchange.
</P>
<P>
The project has enabled the city to sign 33 technology
contracts with more than 20 countries and regions, with contracted
overseas funds surpassing 32 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such exchange and cooperation are expected to drive local
science and technology development forward.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Tianjin signed 32 technology-export contracts, valued
at 150 million US dollars, a 57 percent rise from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province to Be Self-Sufficient in Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu province
is expected to supply all its grain needs this year, according to
local government.
</P>
<P>
"If no severe natural disasters occur, we can be more than
self-sufficient in grain this year," said the local grain bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested a record eight billion kilograms of
grain. The local government plans to purchase 1.75 billion
kilograms from farmers.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted that the market demand for grain will be
1.5 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, an underdeveloped inland province, suffered from a
perennial scarcity of 500 million kilograms of grain annually for
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Responsive to the problem, local government adopted measures to
speed up farming development.
</P>
<P>
After constructing field terraces and improving irrigation, the
province has gradually narrowed the disparity between its large
population and insufficient farmland.
</P>
<P>
The per capita occupation of farmland in the province has
reached 0.66 ha.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spread of advanced farming techniques, such as
the use of plastic films and belt farming, helped increase grain
production.
</P>
<P>
Economic support for agriculture also increased. The local
financial agencies provided loans of 2.3 billion yuan last year
for grain production, up 21 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Call off Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a formal United Nations
Security Council meeting on Wednesday, Israel was urged strongly
by member states to call off its plan to build Jewish settlements
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 countries were enlisted as speakers at the
meeting on Israel's plan to build 6,500 homes in East
Jerusalem. The meeting is scheduled to run into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Calling it "a new colonial settlement", the Permanent Observer
of Palestine to the United Nations, Nasser Al-Kidwa, described the
housing project as was one of a series of Israeli measures and
actions over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
These measures, he said, "constitute a clear policy aimed at
the continuation of the Judization of the city of Jerusalem,
changing its legal status and its demographic composition."
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community to protect and
uphold its will reflected in various U.N. resolutions, to restrain
Israel from continuing to ignore this will and from its persistent
violation of International Law.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the council meeting, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nation, Qin Huasun, urged Israel to
stop its plan to build the settlements.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that is bound to set serious obstacles to
the Palestine-Israel peace process and will be detrimental to the
Middle East peace process as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Jerusalem should be settled by the parties
concerned through negotiations on the basis of the relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral move contrary to this approach should be
avoided, since it will only further complicate the question
instead of rendering any help to its proper settlement, or to the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sergey V. Lavrov, permanent representative for Russia, said
Russia shared the negative response of the Palestinians, Arab and
Islamic States, and the international community to this
"inconsiderate and untimely step" taken by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli decision clouded the negotiating
environment in the Middle East, especially at the threshold of the
start in mid-March of talks on the final status.
</P>
<P>
"A co-sponsor of the peace process, Russia is convinced that the
situation requires action so as to avoid relapses to tensions in
Palestinian-Israeli relations similar to the events of last
September," he said.
</P>
<P>
United States Ambassador Bill Richardson said the U.S. "is
concerned by the decision announced by the Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe such activity is helpful to the peace
process," he said. "We believe that this decision undermines the
trust and confidence that is so badly needed if a lasting peace is
to be achieved."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Family Planning Saves 20 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the successful family
planning in Indonesia, the government managed to save up to 20
billion US dollars in foreign exchange per year, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Assistant to the State Minister for Population Affairs Dr.
Djaelani said Wednesday in Bali island that Indonesia's total
population reached 200 million till early February 1997. A 1970
forecast put the total at 220 million this year, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
The smaller total, he said, was achieved thanks to the
successful family planning.
</P>
<P>
If Indonesia's per capita income amounted to 1000 US dollars
per annum, the government could have saved 20 billion dollars, he
said, adding that the population growth rate has been reduced from
2.32 percent in 1970 to only 1.9 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate will drop to 1.2 percent between 2000-2005, and
0.6 percent in 2020-2025, government officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show Indonesia's birth rate dropped to 1.7
percent in 1996 and the government is seeking a further reduction
to 1.5 percent by this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's population control policy was launched in 1970 with
the establishment of the National Family Planning Board, which in
1989 won Indonesia the United Nations' population award.

<HEADLINE> Chile Promotes Exports To Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chilean exports to Russia jumped
to 120 million U.S. dollars in 1996, six times the figure in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries totalled 146
million dollars last year, of which Chilean imports from Russia
amounted to only 26.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hector Casanueva, director of the Export Promotion Department
of the Foreign Ministry, said the Russian market is a big one
consisting of 150 million people and is the door to all the
republics that are members of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He said his department hopes to maintain an aggressive policy
toward emerging markets this year.
</P>
<P>
To this end, trade missions will be sent to Croatia, Ukraine
and Russia when Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza visits these
countries starting in late March, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Insulza will attend in Russia on March 28 the
inauguration of the "Corporation Tres Hontes" soft drink plant,
the first Chilean industrial company to operate in that country.
</P>
<P>
The company reportedly has also invested 30 million dollars in
Lithuania where products are being made for the Russian market.
</P>
<P>
Osvaldo Droppelman, president of the Chilean-Russian Chamber of
Commerce, announced that the two countries will sign an agreement
on cooperation in Moscow at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Third Confucian Family Temple Found In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of buildings first put up
in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) in the central part of east China's
Zhejiang province have been identified as the third Confucian
family temple.
</P>
<P>
Previously, historians believed that China had only two
Confucian family temples, one in Qufu in east China's Shandong
province, the birth place of Confucius, and the other in Quzhou in
the western part of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
But the Confucian family tree implied the existence of a third
family temple, in "Wuzhou", which, after detailed study by Chinese
scholars, turned out to be in present-day Juxi village, Panan
county, in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The scholars have found that the villagers, most of whom have
the family name Kong (the same as Confucius, who is referred to in
Chinese as Kong Fuzi), revere a group of ancient buildings which
they call the "Confucian Family Temple".
</P>
<P>
The temple began in 1255, with its existing buildings mainly
from the Qing Dynasty, built symmetrically along an axis and
facing north.
</P>
<P>
Carved hallways connect a front hall and a back hall in which
were hung the pictures of several generations of family members.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the scale, structure and direction of the
buildings are the strongest evidence that the site is a Confucian
family temple. Moreover, they identified Kong Baoquan, director of
the county People's Congress, who is from Juxi village, as a
descendent of Confucius, from the 74th generation. One of his
ancestors, Kong Duangong, a member of the 48th generation, moved
from Qufu, in Shandong, to Juxi.

<HEADLINE> North China Province To Invest Heavily in Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
plans to put 18 billion yuan into building a combined floor space
of 24.5 million sq m of flats this year as part of its housing
system reform in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Eleven cities directly under the provincial government will
implement "comfortable living" projects to provide standard flats
for moderate to low-income families and will build 1.5 million sq
m of flats.
</P>
<P>
This northern Chinese province led the nation in selling
government-subsidized flats to individuals, and this year, they
are expected to make up 80 percent of the total flats still
waiting to be sold.
</P>
<P>
As early as the beginning of the 1980s, Tangshan City, which
was almost leveled by a severe earthquake in 1976, was chosen by
the State Council as a pilot in the sale of government-subsidized
flats to individuals for large-scale reconstruction, and was
helpful in providing experience for preparing to spread the work
in Hebei and in the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Previously, housing mainly was welfare-oriented
government-owned flats alloted to individuals, with the monthly
rent per sq m kept very low.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the province has sold 77 million sq
m of government-subsidized housing, accounting for more than a
half of the government-subsidized housing authorized for sale.
</P>
<P>
The goal of providing comfortable living space has been reached
earlier than for people outside Hebei, with per capita living
space for urban residents now ten sq m.
</P>
<P>
The province has 421 companies involved in real estate
development, and has seen rapid development in the building
materials sector, of which the province has become a leading
producer.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that the province is preparing to establish a
new housing bank, whose purpose will be to provide better service
for housing construction.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been revising regulations and rules to
standardize housing construction, marketing, and management.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's camera industry witnessed
a rebound last year thanks to effective measures taken by the
authorities to invigorate the sector.
</P>
<P>
The industry's output increased by 35 percent from its 1995
level to surpass 45 million cameras in 1996, with pre-tax profit
rising by 80 percent. said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China exported about 40 million cameras last year.
</P>
<P>
The country has 28 camera firms, almost all of which are
cooperating with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled cameras used to flood China's market.
</P>
<P>
To help solve the problems caused by smuggled cameras, the
authorities issued regulations.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on imported cameras were reduced to 30 percent last
year from 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also encouraged foreign manufacturers to invest in
China instead of just exporting their products to China.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, five joint ventures were set up with Japan-based
camera manufacturers including Olympus, Minolta, Nikon and Ricoh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the eight domestic enterprises that survived the
rampant smuggling are now able to turn out a total of more than
five million cameras annually and make handsome profits.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic cameras market demand is estimated to be about
nine million in 1997 and is expected to grow in tandem with the
upgrading of people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 39 percent of urban households and a mere one
percent of rural ones in China have cameras.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Increasing Post and Telecom Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The increase in farmers' incomes
has given a push to post and telecommunications development in
Sichuan, China's most populous province, where rural areas
consider the sector a new pillar for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Luxian county, in southern Sichuan, for example, which is
located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, used to be a
backward region, but increasing demand from farmers for better
post and telecom services has helped the market prosper.
</P>
<P>
The local post and telecom bureau last year had revenues of
10.8 million yuan from the rural telephone business, while 200
million yuan in postal savings deposits brought a profit of 4.6
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the change to farmers' improved
lives. In recent years, farmers who sought temporary work
eldsewhere sent large amounts of money back home. In 1996 alone,
these farmers sent 680 million yuan back.
</P>
<P>
The increased revenues, in turn, helped local post and telecom
authorities to upgrade infrastructure to the tune of 15 million
yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Surrender to Philippine Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas have surrendered to the
Philippines Army in Labangan town in Zambaoanga del Sur in the
southern Philippines, the local newspaper Manila Bulletin said
today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 64 MILF fighters led by Commander Ananggo Sumandar
surrendered last week to the 57th Infantry Battalion under the 1st
Infantry Division, the paper quoted a military report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rebels also turned over to Army authorities high
powered guns, including 15 M-14 rifles, two AK-47 assault rifles
and a Thompson submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
Major General Romeo Pdiernos of the 1st Infantry Division said
he expected more MILF rebels would surrender to government forces
in view of the ongoing peace negotiations between the government
and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), has refused to accept a peace deal
concluded between the MNLF and the government but wanted separate
peace talks with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their long-delayed
exploratory peace talks on January 9 but the second round of the
talks have been stalled by sporadic fighting between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides made some progress during their low-level
negotiations late last month on how to monitor the implementation
of a limited regional ceasefire agreement in Buldon town in
Maguindanao province in Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the progress, both the MILF and the government
expressed optimism about the conclusion of a comprehensive
agreement ending hostilities between the two sides in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are still wide apart on their talking points
in the stalled exploratory peace talks which will be resumed in
April.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government group in the
country, with an estimated membership of more than 12,000.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A new highly efficient oil pump
has just been developed in China to replace the floating beam
pumps, which are still widely used but are not very efficient and
are energy consuming.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new oil pumps have a larger capacity than
the floating beam pumps and are more effective, and can be used
for a longer time. An added benefit is that they can be examined
or repaired without stopping the machine.
</P>
<P>
Li Hengguang, manager of Succeed Hi-tech Testing Form Complied
Co., Ltd, which developed the new design, said that feedback from
major Chinese oilfields indicates that the 100 machines now in use
are doing well.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil wells needn't alter anything if the oilfields
want to use the new machine.

<HEADLINE> Power from Inner Mongolia Lights One Quarter of Beijing Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia, which relied
heavily on Beijing for power supply only a few years ago, is now
lighting one quarter of homes in Beijing with power it generates.
</P>
<P>
Uligi, general manager of the Power Corporation of Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, who is in Beijing attending the annual
session of the National People's Congress, attributed the progress
to the region's strategy of developing its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Uligi said Inner Mongolia, which is several hundred kilometers
north of Beijing, used to rely on Beijing for electric power
supply when millions of tons of coal were waiting to be
transported to other parts of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
By now, Inner Mongolia has become an important power supply in
north China's power network, one of six such networks in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, the region generated 31.8 billion kwh of
electricity, 12 billion kwh of which was transmitted to the rest
of the country. This means eight million tons of coal are
transported out of the region each year through power transmission
lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major coal producers and produces, Inner Mongolia
boasts China's second largest coal reserves and produces 70 million
tons of coal annually.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Finalizes Income Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives Wednesday night finalized its version on the
income tax reform and promised to pass the bill on the third and
final reading as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The income tax reform program is the last part of the country's
Comprehensive Tax Administration Package (CTRP) to be passed by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
A timely passage of the entire tax reform package is among the
requirements of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to free the
country's economy from its supervision by June this year.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia promised that the lower chamber
will make a "best effort" to pass the CTRP component and submit
this to the Senate by March 13, the deadline given by President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Under the income tax proposal finalized by the House ways and
means committee, corporate taxpayers can choose either a 35
percent net income tax or a 15 percent adjusted gross income tax.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Exequiel Javier said the committee decided
to increase the net income tax to 35 percent from 33 percent to
approximate the rate adopted by governments in other countries in
corporate taxation.
</P>
<P>
For individual income taxation, a family of six will have a
total tax exemption of 184,000 pesos (7,022.9 U.S. dollars)
annually or 72,000 pesos (2,748 dollars) per working member and an
additional 10,000 pesos (381.6 dollars) per dependent.

STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- European Cup holders Juventus
recovered from one goal deficit to draw 1-1 with Rosenborg in
their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday night in
Trondheim, Norway.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, without either of the strikers who have started in
their European competitions, Alessandro Del Piero and Croatian
Alen Boksic, struggled in the first half. But they began to
dominate after halftime.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the home team opened the scoring in the 51 minutes
through Trond Soltvedt while the Italian side pulled back just two
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Christian Vieri scored the equaliser, and also created his
teams' first chance in the match. He broke through the Norwegian
defence on the left side and shot fiercely just wide of the post.
</P>
<P>
Juventus had many chances for the second goal, which could make
it easier for their Turin match in two weeks, but they failed to
grasp the chances.
</P>
<P>
However, coach Marcello Lippi said: "We had chances to win, but
I'm happy enough with the result."
</P>
<P>
Rosenborg, who earned their place in the last eight by beating
AC Milan 2-1 at San Siro, showed some world-class ball skills, but
they were lack of finishing.

All the 11 cities have been visited by the IOC's 15-member

advantage and disadvantage of each of the candidate.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Says Athens' Olympic Bid Supported by People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Athens' main "weapon" in its bid
to host the 2004 summer Olympic Games is the virtually universal
support for the city's candidacy from Athenians and the Greek
people in general, Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Avramopoulos, who is a member of
the committee responsible for promoting Athens' candidacy, praised
"the unity of spirit" prevailing among all parties involved in
the city's bid.
</P>
<P>
Avramopoulos expressed guarded optimism about the chances of
Athens being included on the International Olympic Committee's
(IOC) shortlist of four or five candidate cities for the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC will announce the shortlist in Lausanne Friday. Cities
included on the shortlist will continue to vie for the event
until September 5 when the winner will be announced.
</P>
<P>
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said recently that in
addition to the necessary infrastructure, the eleven candidates
must be able to convince the selection group that the general
population backed a particular city's candidacy.

<HEADLINE> US Congressmen Lash Out at NATO's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.S. House of
Representatives today lashed out at the U.S. government's plan to
enlarge the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of NATO will create a new division in Europe,"
affirmed David Obey, a senior Democrat who has followed NATO
affairs for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a House subcommittee hearing, the congressman said
that NATO's eastward expansion was "an arrogant decision we will
come to regret."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was determined to push the
expansion of the alliance into central and eastern European
countries by the year of 1999. The 16-nation alliance is to hold a
special summit in Madrid in July to start the process.
</P>
<P>
Russia, insisting that the move will threaten its security, is
strongly opposed to it. Clinton is due to meet with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin this month for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Obey thought that there is "a grave risk" that Russian
nationalists will exploit any Russia government decision to accept
"a movement east of the military borders of NATO."
</P>
<P>
"I think that could have profoundly negative consequences in
the long term," Obey said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion, he said, will "create a more tense no-man's land
between the newly defined NATO and Russia."
</P>
<P>
Obey questioned the decision also on other grounds. He
complained that the government made the decision to enlarge NATO
without consulting with the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the American public has been sufficiently talked
to, about this issue, so that they can make an intelligent choice
about how they feel about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Regula, a Republican congressman, also joined the
criticism, noting that the central and eastern European countries
should enter the European Union first before joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright argued for the U.S. position on the issue, saying that
"we are dealing with an entirely new world situation."
</P>
<P>
She stressed, "One of the great challenges... is to begin to
think about an entirely new way of organizing ourselves."

<HEADLINE> HK Tourney Makes Women Step into Rugby Sevens Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Women's rugby is poised to step
into the international spotlight at the weekend before the
(men's) World Cup Sevens when the inaugural Jardine Fleming Unit
Trust Hong Kong Invitational Women's Rugby Sevens kicks off at
Aberdeen Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
Twelve teams from around the world including one from hosts
Hong Kong will compete from March 15 to 16 in what is considered
to be the most prestigious women's rugby tournament ever held.
</P>
<P>
Overseas teams taking part are England, which won the 1994
World Cup in the 15-a-side event, Arabian Gulf, Australia,
Canada, Fiji, the Netherlands, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland,
Singapore and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The teams have been split into two pools of six, according to
a draw held here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Rugby Football Union has formed a squad with 10
players from four clubs. "Women's rugby has been developing very
rapidly in Hong Kong and we do hope that the coming tournament
helps the sport grow even stronger," said team captain Katie
Rhymer.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old civil engineer at Hong Kong's new airport site
at Chek Lap Kok said that she had been playing rugby for six
years, three years each in Britain and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With a background for the players as engineers, college
students, marketing personnel and accountants, the team had being
training for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
One of the fastest growing sports, women's rugby is recognized
at international level by 22 countries and regions. The Hong
Kong Invitational is the latest fixture on the women's annual
rugby calendar which also includes the Five Nations Cup and the
European Sevens.
</P>
<P>
And the event, together with the Carlsberg Cup 10s March 18-19
and the Second World Cup Sevens March 21-23, will arouse Hong
Kong with a rugby fever.
</P>
<P>
With three events in succession, "it will be the biggest 10
days of rugby ever seen," said Pieter Schats, Executive Director
of the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union.
</P>
<P>
As the center of Asian rugby, Hong Kong now has six clubs with
women's teams.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Action Plan on Satellite Communication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
adopted today an Action Plan which aims to improve significantly
the European Union's role in the provision of global satellite
communications services and applications.
</P>
<P>
The actions aim to focus the European industrial potential on
the new generation of global satellite systems, advanced services
and innovative applications which meet key user requirements in
the global Information Society, such as personal mobility, access
to the broadband evolution of Internet, fast response times, and
global connectivity.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in the Action Plan that global satellite
infrastructures will become a critical part of the world's
economic system.
</P>
<P>
"As a result," it said, "a strong and coherent satellite
communications industry and services sector is of high economic
and political importance for Europe."
</P>
<P>
The commission acknowledged that the European satellite
equipment and service industry was not well placed to achieve the
position in the commercial space sector needed to support the EU's
ambitions to remain a major player in this sector.
</P>
<P>
It warned that should Europe not react in a coordinated manner,
there is a high risk from being kept out of the most promising
market of service and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run this would have consequences on the European
position in launching services," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the revenues generated in the various
market segments (satellite, terminals and services) are expected
to reach 400 billion US dollars over the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Tories' Pensions Scheme to Place Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prime Minister John Major
announced today a plan to abolish the state earnings related
pension scheme and replace it with compulsory private pension
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he wanted to ensure the younger
generation had the extra security of a fund "built up in their own
names."
</P>
<P>
Such a scheme would allow people to build up their own personal
fund for their pension. The concept is in line with the Tories'
aim of increasing personal wealth and enabling people to build up
their own pool of capital assets and savings.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was approved Tuesday by a cabinet meeting. It is an
unfunded state-run pension plan, which makes payments on top of
the universal basic pension.
</P>
<P>
The Tory initiative is intended to deliver substantial public
expenditure savings over the long term, but there could be costs
to the government and taxpayers as the new system of private
provision is phased in.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would also counter Labor's vision of a
"stake-holder" society, by showing that the Tories would enable
people to have greater control over their pensions.
</P>
<P>
The Tories are anxious to trump Labor on social security, as
the opposition has promised that a Labor government would build a
"welfare and education system for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the scheme, Labor's shadow chancellor Gordon
Brown said, "The tax and spending problems with the Conservative
pension proposals is utterly basic: there are huge front end costs
which will run into billions of pounds and mean higher taxes for
everyone."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the cumulative public cost of
the scheme would reach 151 billion pounds (243.3 billion US
dollars) by the year 2040 which would have to be funded through
tax rises, even without setting aside money to guarantee basic
pensions if private funds failed.
</P>
<P>
Brown accused Tory of wanting to privatize state pensions and
putting at risk basic cover for people retiring in the future.

<HEADLINE> US to Donate 25,000 Dlrs for Iran Earthquake Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it is going to donate 25,000 U.S. dollars to Iran as
earthquake relief.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, in announcing the
donation, said Washington's problems with Tehran are "separate
with our willingness to help people in need."
</P>
<P>
Iran appealed Tuesday for international aid for victims of the
earthquake in Ardabil Province last Friday, which killed nearly
1,000, injured 2,600 and left 36,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the appeal, the United Nations reported that
U.N. agencies, Norway and Demark had pledged 515,000 dollars for
earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the money donated by the United States would not "go
to the government of Iran," but "to families of those who died and
to those who have been injured or suffered other losses."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Chiefs Consider Cuts in Fighter Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Chiefs of Staff of
the United States told Congress today that they are considering
cutting one of three multibillion-dollar fighter planes or sharply
reducing the overall number of fighters the Pentagon buys.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said the options include canceling the Air Force
F-22 fighter, the Joint Strike Fighter or the Navy FA-18 E and F
fighter, or reducing by 25 percent to 50 percent of the number of
planes the Pentagon purchases.
</P>
<P>
Another option is to go forward with all three fighter programs
over the coming decades, which would replace fighter planes that
were designed in the 1970s and are running up against competitors
that can outperform them.
</P>
<P>
Ralston said the estimated cost of the three fighter programs
would amount to 16 percent of total planned Pentagon weapons
spending and the proposed purchase of about 4,400 planes "is well
within our means."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will make a final decision in May when it releases
the "Quadrennial Defense Review," which will set the basic
military strategy and force structure into the next century.

NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Coffee futures prices soared to
new highs in New York for a third day today after workers at
Brazil's third-largest port continued their strike that could
delay shipments.
</P>
<P>
Green arabica coffee for May delivery soared 5.40 cents to
2.006 U.S. dollars a pound; March coffee soared as high as 2.275
U.S. dollars a pound before settling at 2.198 U.S. dollars, up
8.10 cents. That was the highest settlement since September 28,
1994.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the world's largest coffee exporter.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in January stepped up their exports of arabica
coffee following the price increases, the London-based
International Coffee Organization reported. That leaves little
coffee to be shipped now, analysts said.

LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government said here
today it was worried by Israel's demand to shut down four
Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem before Israel could carry

Jerusalem," the spokesman said.

<P>
"We urge both sides to refrain from actions which could inflame
what is already a very tense situation," he added.

four Palestinian offices 96 hours to close or face being shut
down.

WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
today toured West Virginia and promised federal assistance to the
communities ravaged by the worst flooding on the Ohio River in 33
years.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were forced out of their homes as large
areas of the five bordering states of West Virginia, Kentucky,
Ohio, Indiana and Tennessee were submerged under flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Powerful thunderstorms dumped more rain on flood-weary
residents of the Ohio River valley today, triggering flash floods.
</P>
<P>
Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon has requested federal disaster aid
for 13 all Indiana counties bordering the Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The continued flooding forced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to shut nearly 350 miles (588 km) of the Ohio River to all
commercial traffic.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from nearly a week of storms passed 50, with the
number of flooding deaths reaching 15 in Kentucky, five in Ohio,
five in Tennessee and one in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bill Clinton viewed the damage in his
home state of Arkansas from weekend tornadoes that killed 25
people.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary damage estimates for the flooding were in the
hundreds of millions of dollars and Clinton has declared parts of
states disaster areas.

half of his semiannual report to Congress.

<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 11.04, or 1.4

In the bonds market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury sank
from late Tuesday's 6.86 percent, the highest finish since late
January, as low as 6.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Proposes Unchanged 1997/98 Farm Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
proposed mostly unchanged farm prices in 1997/98 but maintained
its demand for a 1.4 billion ECU (1.6 billion US dollar) cut in
direct aid payments to cereals and oilseed farmers.
</P>
<P>
"With some small exceptions the proposals are for a maintenance
of existing prices and market arrangements, continuing the policy
of stability which has applied since the 1992 reforms," the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary impact of the proposals is a saving of 82 million
ECUs (94 million US dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The savings would be achieved through lower monthly increases
in intervention cereals and rice storage payments, which would be
cut in line with lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed last summer a cut in aid payments to
cereals, oilseeds and protein crop farmers to help fund emergency
aid for beef producers hit by the "mad cow disease" crisis. The
proposal was dropped by European Union farm ministers in October.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the EU's agricultural economy in 1996, the commission
said in general terms the improvement in the economic situation of
farming in the EU continued and was even strengthened for some
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Production of cereals in 1996 is estimated at some 202 million
tons, the highest level the EU has ever achieved and some 27
million tons more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to earlier expectations the level of sugar production
in 1996 was comparable with 1995 at 15.664 million tons.
</P>
<P>
First estimates put wine production in 1996 at around 174
million hectoliters, almost 25 million hectoliters more than in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Production of beef and veal fell by about 4 percent in 1996,
mainly because of the impact of the "mad cow disease" crisis.
</P>
<P>
Milk production in 1996 is expected to reach virtually the same
level as in 1995 (121.3 million tons).

<HEADLINE> Zairean Gov't Endorses UN Plan, Rebels Reject Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko
and Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo have endorsed the United Nations
five-point peace plan for Zaire, Zairean Foreign Minister Gerard
Kamanda Wa Kamanda announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan, which calls for an immediate cease-fire and
withdrawal of all foreign troops from Zaire, was drafted by the
United Nations special envoy for the Great Lakes, Algerian
diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun, and adopted by the U.N. Security Council
last month.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the government of the Republic of Zaire
demand the deployment without delay of an international force of
control to make operational the peace plan of Mr. Sahnoun and the
Security Council, to verify the application in the field of the
withdrawal of all foreign troops, including mercenaries," said the
declaration of the Zairean government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tutsi-led rebel forces today again refused to
reach a cease-fire with the government forces, saying that they
wanted to hold face-to-face talks with President Mobutu first.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Kongolo Mwenze, "minister
of justice" of the rebel alliance, as saying in the newly fallen
Zairean town of Kindu that a cease-fire should be the result of
negotiations and not a precondition of it.
</P>
<P>
"The plan of peace of the U.N. is in our favor, but to impose a
cease-fire, it is against us," he said.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that
if the warring sides of Zaire refuse to reach a cease-fire, an
international armed intervention in Zaire becomes necessary to
save tens of thousands of refugees caught in the fighting in
eastern Zaire.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat told the Security Council members today that "land
for peace" is the basis of the Middle East peace process and that
it should be observed.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters after conferring privately with
the members of the 15-nation council a few hours before the start
of a council debate on Israel's plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews
in Eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"My message today is how to implement accurately and honestly
what had been agreed upon, to prevent any provocations and
breaching of the United Nations and Security Council resolution,
which is the platform of the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We went to Madrid according to resolutions 242 and 338 and
land for peace. This is what we are asking," he added, referring
to the 1991 conference that launched the peace process and U.N.
resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973 that embodied the idea of
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
In similar remarks after conferring with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, Arafat said the new Israeli settlement was an issue not
only for the Palestinians but also "for the Arabs, for the
Moslems, for the Christians."

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Benefit From UK EMU Opt-Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Inward investment in the Irish
Republic would continue to increase if the country decided to join
the European Monetary Union (EMU) while Britain stayed out,
according to Ireland's biggest industrial group.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a 21 percent rise in pre-tax profits Tuesday, Don
Godson, chief executive of CRH building material group, said that
Britain's decision to stay out of the first phase of the EMU might
lead to a further increase in inward investment in Ireland from
companies which will not want to operate outside the common
currency.
</P>
<P>
"Ireland has been an attractive location for companies wanting
an English-speaking base in Europe. Interest rates of just under 6
percent for five-year money and forecast inflation of 2 percent
compare very favorable with the UK," Godson said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporation tax of 10 percent, low labor costs and
the ready availability of a well-educated work force have been
added attractions for many foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Inward investment in Ireland has risen sharply in recent years
with the country's economic growth rates among the highest for the
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Gross domestic product is forecast to rise by 5-6
percent this year.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Defends Comments on Stock Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan today defended his recent cautionary
comments on the soaring stock prices, saying that the Fed has to
worry about a lot of factors that could harm the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan warned investors last week against "excessive
optimism" on the stock market and jolted markets globally in
December with his comments about "irrational exuberance."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions today before an audience at the U.S.
National Association of Business Economists, Greenspan sought to
respond to complaints from some critics that he was improperly
meddling in market activities with his comments.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he was not trying to jawbone stock prices and
couldn't do so even if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very complex international market system with
millions of players in the game," Greenspan said. "There is no way
you can talk down or talk up prices or interest rates."
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to influence stock prices, the Fed chairman
said, he was letting investors know that securities prices were
among a number of factors the U.S. Fed considers in judging
whether the economy is overheating and inflation is becoming a
threat.
</P>
<P>
In an increasingly complex global economy, he noted, the Fed
must determine whether to raise interest rates to cool
inflationary pressures or ease credit conditions to keep the
economy out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
He said that investors, many of whom have experienced only the
market's remarkable rise in the 1990s, may not be prepared for a
period of falling prices and therefore may not be demanding enough
of a risk premium in their investment purchases.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's 1997/98 Budget Tabled in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's 1997/98 budget of
5,755 million Namibian Dollars (about 1,251 million US Dollars)
was tabled today in the National Assembly by Finance Minister
Nangolo Mbumba in the capital Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech, Mbumba said fiscal prudence would set
the groundwork for economic growth and prosperity of the country,
reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Mbumba told parliamentarians that the proposed total
expenditure is 148 million US Dollars, a 13.4 percent rise
compared to that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expected revenue for the period amounted to 1,130
million US Dollars, an increase of 15 percent over the 1996/97
budget, leaving an overall fiscal deficit of 121 million US
Dollars to be financed by borrowing and drawing on government
funds, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said the budget deficit is anticipated to be reduced
from 4.1 percent in the previous year to 3.7 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"This achievement demonstrates our determination of reducing
government's expenditure levels at a faster rate than the revenue
collections, relative to overall economic activity," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbumba stressed that the composition of expenditure
has shifted slightly in favor of capital and development
expenditure, including lending and equity participation.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Support to Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
today called for international efforts to help Palestinian
refugees to return to their homes, the UAE's official news
agency Wam reported.
</P>
<P>
International community should assume its responsibilities
toward Palestinian refugees who are living in the areas
controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon, and help them gain the right of returning to their
homelands, Wam quoted UAE's Minister of Finance and Industry
Ahmad Hamid Taer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks during his meeting with Peter
Hansen, Commissioner General of United Nation Relief and Works
Agency For Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) who is
visiting the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for ending the sufferings of Palestinian
refugees, saying international community should support the
Palestinians not only by financial efforts, but also through
moves to help them enjoy the right of returning to their
homelands, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 3.35 million Palestinian refugees
depending on UNRWA services will face serious cutback in services
unless the UNRWA is able to mobilize 50 to 60 million
U.S. dollars to meet its budget deficit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hansen's visit to the UAE is part of his efforts to gain
finaccial support from donor countries in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The UNWRA has been providing free education, health, relief
and social services to registered Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> German Nuclear Waste Transport Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The German nuclear waste convoy
arrived at the storage depot at Gorleben, the northern state of
Lower Saxony, this afternoon, with police forcing the way past up
to 10,000 anti-nuclear protesters.
</P>
<P>
The six containers carrying 750 tons of highly-radioactive
nuclear waste from Germany and France thus completed their 58-hour
trek by rail and road from a southern German power station after
delays caused by protests.
</P>
<P>
The lead truck reached the isolated village of Gorleben with
its windscreen covered in paint after a protester lobbed a
paint-bomb at it. Earlier, police used ladders to cut down
protesters hanging on ropes strung between trees on the route of
the nuclear convoy.
</P>
<P>
Protesters wept in rage or erupted in wolf whistles as the
convoy's journey ended.
</P>
<P>
The overall nuclear transport this year took six days' time
beginning last Friday, under the shield of a 30,000 police force
-- Germany's largest police operation since World War II.
</P>
<P>
The security cost was around 66 million marks, or some 40
million U.S. dollars, compared with 46 million marks last year.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear lobby in Bonn has said this serves as part of
their anti-nuclear-power strategy to drive up the nuclear price
through ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Being the country's largest single energy contributor, nuclear
power was reported to account for about 34 percent of Germany's
energy production in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Peter Haussmann today said that he saw no
reason to give up the concept of nuclear waste transport. Anyhow,
he added, this was not on the agenda of the cabinet. According to
him, another shipment of nuclear waste from France was possible
this year, although the schedule remained undecided.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Schroeder, state premier of Lower Saxony, said after
the arrival of the nuclear convoy that more rational energy
policies should be considered so as to avoid any more such nuclear
transport.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile praised the level-headedness and the resolution of
the police, who fulfilled their mission under "very, very
difficult conditions."
</P>
<P>
Protests over this year's nuclear transport began before the
shipment with demonstrations, disruption of train services through
sabotages of rail facilities, and stepped up later particularly in
the northern area, with people blocking railways and roads by
sit-ins, or with iron bars, tractors, barricades and even
trenches.
</P>
<P>
Police detained temporarily a total of several hundred
protesters in the whole process, during which several clashes
between police and protesters also occurred.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 10 kilometers from Dannenberg, where
the nuclear waste was unloaded onto heavy trucks Tuesday, militant
protesters at the village of Quickborn had been in skirmishes
today with police. Petrol bombs were thrown. Police also defused a
homemade bomb along the road the nuclear convoy later passed.
</P>
<P>
This morning, police used water cannons to disperse several
thousand overnight sit-inners near the exit road at the Dannenberg
railway station. More than 100 people were injured, and 38 were
temporarily detained.
</P>
<P>
The protest delayed the trucks' departure by six hours and
there were some brief stops in Gorleben as protesters were
water-blasted off roads. The 20-kilometer journey today from
Dannenberg to Gorleben took however three hours less than expected.
</P>
<P>
One demonstrator said the police had more difficulty this year
because the protest was better organized than last year and had
more support from the locals.
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear protest has expanded every year since the
nuclear waste transport to Gorleben began three years ago. One
critic described the event as "an annual nuclear pilgrimage that
has become part magnet for anarchic defiance of the authorities
and part token of Germans' deep concern over the perils of atomic
power."

it has approved a grant agreement for 6.3 million U.S. dollars to

climate change along their coastlines.
</P>
<P>
The grant finances a four-year project to strengthen the
region's capacity to monitor and analyze changes in climate and
sea level dynamics and to identify vulnerable areas, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the project will develop an integrated management

human resources to enhance the region's capacity to cope with
global environmental change.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be managed by the General Secretariat of the
Organization of American States, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the grant comes from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), created in 1991 to provide grants to developing
countries to finance projects activities to protect the global
environment. The GEF is jointly implemented by the World Bank, the
United Nations Development Program, and the United Nations

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Calls for Joint EU Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima indicated here today that the European Union (EU) countries
should work out an employment pact which will oblige all of them
to fight against unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after a one-day official visit
to Bonn, the new Austrian chancellor said the EU countries should
make the same commitment to combat unemployment as they do to
ensure monetary stability.
</P>
<P>
If not all EU states were obliged to fight unemployment,
migration movements might occur, "which all of us don't want to
see," Klima warned.
</P>
<P>
Klima held separate talks today with German President Roman
Herzog, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel.
</P>
<P>
Klima told reporters that among other topics, he had discussed
with Kohl the issue of future European security policy. He
stressed his country's determination to play an active role in the
common foreign and security policies of the EU.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he said, Austria would also take time to
think over its neutrality. His government wanted to follow the
development of the European security system first, and then submit
a report about all the possible options for Austria to parliament
in March 1998, Klima added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that there was no reason for Austria to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in its present form.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Waigel, both sides agreed that the
Maastricht Treaty criteria for joining the single European
currency, the Euro, and its start-up date of January 1, 1999
should not be changed.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said that the German government would make all possible
efforts in order to meet the conditions for participating in the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who himself until recently was the finance minister of
Austria, expressed the hope that a strong common currency in
Europe would also give an impetus to the job markets.

<HEADLINE> US Criticizes Israel for Closing Palestinian Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
criticized Israel for its shutting down of four Palestinian
offices in east Jerusalem, saying the move was "very difficult to
understand."
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in a week that the Israeli government
was under U.S. criticism. The first was when President Bill
Clinton accused Israel of building "mistrust" by its decision to
establish 6,500 Jewish homes in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This time, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, "As
the president and the secretary of state have both said, this is a
time when it is very important that the (Middle East) parties take
steps that will build confidence between them."
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore very difficult to understand why the Israeli
government made such a decision at this time when there is a
very difficult environment in the relationship with the
Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the closure
of the four Palestinian offices Tuesday on the pretext that the
operation of the offices violates peace agreements with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian top officials in Jerusalem charged that the
decision was designed to stir up conflict with the Palestinians.
