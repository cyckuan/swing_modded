<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today challenged developing countries to reject
the use of extra-territorial laws of developed countries which
inhibit free trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the sixth G-15 summit in
Harare, Mahathir criticized some western countries for
undermining the new world trade order by enacting policies in
total disregard of recognized international norms.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries must reject this challenge to their
sovereign right to be free to trade and invest where they wish
and which also threatens the expansion of trade and development
globally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, whose country will be the next chairman of the G-15,
noted that industrialized countries are taking advantage of the
new liberalized world trading environment to dictate trends in
world trade by imposing a lot of conditionalities on trade.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of globalization, developing countries have been
called upon to account for many things, be it the environment,
labour standards, investment laws, financial services or other
development issues," said Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater cooperation between the private sectors
in G-15 countries in order to penetrate the highly protected
global markets and to take advantage of the vast natural
resources available in the countries.

<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented human disaster
threatens to break out in eastern Zaire as more than one million
refugees are stacked in a small bay beside Lake Kivu, 30
kilometers from Goma, totally cut from outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that the refugees are
suffering from hunger, diseases and heavy rain, while fierce
fighting between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels has cut all
access to them.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
Sadako Ogata today launched an emergency appeal for the creation
of a human corridor in eastern Zaire to avoid the death of
thousands of people there.
</P>
<P>
The honorary consul of France in Goma, Patrick Lumes, today
launched a "desperate appeal" to the international community to
save the lives of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He told AFP that if a big emergency humanitarian operation is
not staged in 24 to 48 hours, an unprecedented human disaster will
break out.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today contacted
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and
European Union officials on how to avoid a huge human tragedy in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"These talks aimed to discuss the situation in Kivu and
examine how the international community could deal with the human
tragedy in the region emergently," said French foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
French State Secretary for Emergency Humanitarian Action Xavier
Emmenuelli said that France will send food, clothes, medicines and
other materials to the refugees with all means necessary, "even
by the way of Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) today sent a plane carrying 30 tons of medical materials
from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Uganda, which borders Zaire, to
distribute them among the refugees as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The European countries and South Africa are reportedly
considering to launch a military-humanitarian operation in eastern
Zaire to save the refugees.

<HEADLINE> BT Confirms Merger with US Phone Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications Plc
(BT) announced Sunday that it had agreed its merger with US
telecoms giant MCI Communications Corporation, the second largest
U.S. long-distance phone company.
</P>
<P>
The deal will create the world's second largest
telecommunications group and will be one of the largest mergers
ever transacted on world markets.
</P>
<P>
BT, the dominant player in the British market, already has a 20
percent stake in MCI, bought through a joint venture two years ago
for 4.3 billion pounds (6.9 billion US dollars), and will pay
around 12 billion pounds (19.2 billion US dollars) for the rest,
forming a new company called Concert.
</P>
<P>
Both firms said the deal was a merger rather than a takeover as
the new telecoms giant will have headquarters in London and
Washington with a management team derived from both sides. The
deal is subject to regulatory clearance.
</P>
<P>
BT had failed in its attempt to merge with its British rival
Cable and Wireless half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It said that the new company would have an annual revenue of 25
billion pounds (40 billion US dollars), an annual cash flow of
about 7.5 billion pounds (12 billion US dollars) and 43 million
business and residential customers in 70 countries.

LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- One of the British Conservative

reducing the government's Parliament majority to just one seat,

Porter, who had held his seat since 1983, died after a brief

heart and good humor" would be much missed at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
His death leaves the government in a precarious position with
the Tories expected to lose the forthcoming by-election in
Barnsley East, where Labor had a massive 24,777 vote majority in
1992.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Outside Forces Involved in Plotting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today
erected roadblocks and increased security checks as Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu accused "outside forces" of planning
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu
confirmed that there had been an intelligence warning against
possible terrorist attacks inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have intelligence alert about the possibility of
terrorist attacks inside Israel. We are taking necessary
precautions which will... cause discomfort to the citizens," he
said, appealing to the public to understand the discomfort
caused by the security measures.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also called on the Palestinian Authority to
coordinate more with Israel in checking the terrorist attacks.
"I have to say that we expect more from the PA, and I
also have to say that in this case, outside forces are
involved in launching terrorist attacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu did not elaborate what were the "outside
forces" mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that terrorists could launch headline-grabbing attacks
on buses or shopping malls, Israel security forces were put
on high alert today across the country.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the Public Security Ministry announced
that security forces across the country "are on emergency
status, making the maximum amount of manpower available to
foil possible terror attacks."
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks were set up at the main routes leading to
major cities, creating huge traffic jams. Security men also
increased identity checks in public places prone to terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government has issued warnings to its
citizens in Israel to take special precautions, especially on
Sundays, for fear that they would be likely targeted by the
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed off the Palestinian self-rule areas since
last week, citing reports that the Islamic extremist group
of Jihad attempted to launch suicide bombings to mark the first
anniversary of the alleged murder of its leader Fathi Shkaki
by Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
However, Jibril Rajoub, senior Palestinian security officer,
told Israel Radio today that Palestinian police had not
received any intelligence warning against any possible terrorist
attacks against Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is among three
southern African countries to benefit from a 500,000 U.S. Dollar
climate change mitigation study, which is being funded by the
Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).
</P>
<P>
The other two beneficiaries are Botswana and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The project is implemented throughout the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) Collaborating Center on Energy and
Environment based in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The official "Daily News" quoted a senior energy planner with
the center, Gordon Machenzie, as saying here today that the
climate change mitigation study will be based on the regional
technical options implemented in the emitting sectors like
energy, forestry, agriculture, industry and transport.
</P>
<P>
"The study will moreover enhance the capacity of Tanzania to
fulfill its reporting obligations as a party to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change as well as strengthening its ability
to take part in the associated discussions and negotiations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the project which is scheduled to be completed in
mid-1998, local researchers and planners will be mobilized to
collect and process data, construct scenarios on mitigation
options and eventually build local capacity.

<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading Israeli expert here
said today that Tel Aviv's failure to see itself as a peace
partner of the Arab countries would alienate the world and destroy
much-craved peace and security in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Director of the Israeli
Academic Center in Cairo Sasson Somekh said that the Israelis are
bound to face serious troubles if they fail to honor the concluded
agreements and move forward the stumbling peace talks before the
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference, which is slated
to be held in Cairo on November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is serious not just about
making the conference a success but also making peace in the whole
region. So Israel should come as an economic as well as peace
partner, otherwise, it will pay heavily," said the Israeli expert
versed in Arabic studies.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli delegation under Finance Minister Dan Meridor and
the Governor of Central Bank of Israel have confirmed their
participation in the gathering, which aims to promote a regional
development process integrating the Middle East nations into an
economic community in parallel with the ongoing peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the troubled Palestinian-Israeli talks had provoked
suspicion of a Palestinian boycott and even postponement of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his estimate about the prospect for Israel and
Palestine to make a deal, Somekh said Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is unwisely dragging his feet while other
parties' patience are running thin.
</P>

"It seems he has not made up his mind, but it is time to see
things right in the broader frame of the Middle East, and not just
Israel," said the director of the center, a branch of the Science
Academy of Israel.

<P>
While admitting that it is difficult for the Likud government
to please every Arab nation, he criticized the Likud leader for
being "not so very enthusiastic about the peace initiatives (made
by the former Israeli government and Palestine)."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu does not see what Shimon Peres sees, that peace and
security lies in a closer link and real development in the

<HEADLINE> Israeli leadership Lacks Vision: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Netanyahu has insisted on maintaining Israeli sovereignty over
the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war and tried to renegotiate the 1995 accord on the
long-projected but repeatedly-delayed Israeli troop redeployment
from the West Bank town of Hebron, thereby making recent talks
with Palestinians bogged down.
</P>
<P>
"There are more casualties along the stumbling peace track,
complete with violence, death and economic tumult," he added.
</P>
<P>
Somekh argued that while Israel can ignore the business
transactions with the Arabs which account for just about 10
percent of its total trade volume, it could suffer heavily as
mounting instabilities frighten off international investors and
strangle domestic economic strength.
</P>
<P>
"Now 50 percent of Israelis favor the government, but by then
100 percent will rise against it."
</P>
<P>
Arab-Israeli tensions have risen since Netanyahu edged out
Peres by less than one percentage point in the country's first
direct elections in May.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the expert blankly dismissed the much-feared
"Israeli hegemony" over the Middle East as mere visionary.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the Syrian concerns about war, Somekh said he
believed "there is no such possibility....Before things get too
bad, other parties in the world will certainly intervene."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, peace is not at hand, Somekh said. "At the
moment keep talking is the best we can do," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel staged maneuvers on the Golan Heights, saying
it was preparing for the possibility that Syria might launch a
limited war to put pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 businessmen, government officials,
representatives of international, regional and Arab economic
institutions as well as Arab funds from 99 countries will take
part in the third Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference. The two previous conferences were held in Casablanca
and Amman.

<HEADLINE> British FM Urges Israel, Palestine to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today urged both the Israelis and
Palestinians to move forward with an agreement on Hebron,
reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Israeli
counterpart David Levy, Rifkind said that Britain hopes that the
two sides will hasten their efforts to conclude an agreement on
Hebron redeployment, which will not be the end of the story, but
a new beginning of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who arrived here this morning, described British
positions regarding the Palestinian issue as "being
even-handed." "By that we do not mean that we are even-handed on
matters of principles," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind apparently referred to such things as the opening of
an archaeological tunnel near the Islamic holy site of Temple
Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the U.N. Security Council debates, Rifkind voiced
vehement condemnation on the move taken by the Israeli hard-line
Likud government.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled Syrian track, Rifkind made it clear that
behind-the-scene contacts are necessary for Syria and Israel to
renew each side's confidence in the other.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress will be possible not only through
public events, but also through what he called private diplomacy
that requires.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a lot of trust that has to be regained.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also met with President Ezer Weizman and Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this morning. He is due to meet
with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Gaza tonight.

HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister
Haradanahalli Deve Gowda today said next month's World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Singapore should
address issues of interest for developing countries in light of
the unfair current global trade environment.
</P>
<P>
Gowda told delegates to the sixth G-15 summit that the
ministers' meeting should take into account the challenges facing
third world countries in implementing provisions of the Uruguay
round agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Our view of the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in
Singapore is that it is a review conference aimed at addressing
areas of export interest to developing countries and at taking
aboard difficulties faced by them in implementing some of the
agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged G-15 members not to compromise their position on
liberalization of trade by accepting attempts by western
countries to reduce the time frame for implementation of
provisions of Uruguay round agreements.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on recent efforts by some western countries
to introduce new issues for discussion at the conference, which
would impact negatively on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for a collective G-15 effort to press for a new
generalized system of preferences which worked in favour of
developing countries.

LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian residents in Cote
d'Ivoire are to establish an international school in Abidjan,
capital of Cote d'Ivoire, to cater for the education needs of
their children and those of other English-speaking people.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million Nigerians are living in Cote
d'Ivoire, but there are few schools with English curricula except
the American International School in the french-speaking country
of west Africa, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The American International School is exorbitant and out of
reach of most Nigerians, hence the need for the Nigerian school,
the agency said, quoting Emma Nwafor, President of the IGBO Union
in Cote d'Ivoire which is embarking on the project.
</P>
<P>
The school will, among other things, teach the Nigerian
languages as a means of promoting the country's culture, the
president said in a fax massage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the union has concluded arrangements for the holding of
its second annual cultural day in Abidjan, which is to be chaired
by Ivoiran Minister of Culture Bernard Zadi next month, he said.

HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico today strongly
castigated the United States for unfair unilateral actions with
extra-territorial effects and urged the G-15 countries to counter
the actions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the law passed recently by the U.S. on Cuba
which affects the trade relations of third countries, Mexican
Foreign Minister Jose Angle Gurria told the G-15 plenary session
that the U.S. move has to be condemned.
</P>
<P>
Gurria is heading a Mexican delegation at the sixth summit of
the G-15 in Harare, which is discussing among other issues the
current international trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the summit also criticized the rich and
powerful countries, accusing them of using bullyboy tactics in
international trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico has already passed a law of its own as an antidote for
the unilateral actions taken by the U.S. and its discriminatory
practices with Cuba which are affecting relations of other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He invited other G-15 member countries to consider the
reaction and the laws passed by Mexico and follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the plenary session of the G-15 summit, Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe said, "we feel that it's wrong for a
state to transfer its hatred of another country and make it
affect its relationship with a third country and force countries
with a relationship with Cuba to stop relating with it."
</P>
<P>
He said G-15 countries are against such unilateral actions and
will study the Mexican response.

HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Africa's continued indebtedness
has weakened the continent's efforts to achieve economic growth,
Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the sixth G-15 summit, Ouyahia said because of the
huge debt, owed mostly to developed countries and international
financial institutions, some African countries could no longer
get further funding.
</P>
<P>
African countries owe over 300 billion US Dollars, a situation
that has plunged the continent into a crisis as most of its
export earning are now used to service the debt.
</P>
<P>
"The continued indebtedness of the south weakens possibilities
provided to these countries to benefit from international funding
and the difficult implications on implementation of economic
programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Problems afflicting Africa and other developing nations have
been interpreted by the west as a result of wrong economic
strategies and damaging policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner for
Humanitarian Aid Emma Bonino, on Sunday, urged the Rwandan
government to assume its responsibilities to ensure the safety of
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Bonino said that ensuring the safety of all innocent civilians
was the responsibility of the Rwandan government since an
"overwhelming" majority of the refugees were Rwandan citizens.
</P>
<P>
She also called on Rwanda to abide by international human
rights conventions, saying that the international community could
not tolerate any kind of unilateral justice or retribution on
innocent refugees.
</P>
<P>
"By the same token, Rwanda shall be held accountable for any
mass evictions, as well as for any ethnic abuse of innocent Hutu
refugees," Bonino said.
</P>
<P>
Bonino also called for the urgent opening of supply routes to
channel emergency aid to nearly one million Hutu refugees in
eastern Zaire, with safe passage through both the Kivu Lake and
the Goma airport areas, both reportedly under the control of
Rwandan forces.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 people, more than half of them children under 15,
have sat down to die in an area between the shores of Lake Kivu
and the refugee camp of Mugunga, north of Goma. They were without
food, clean water and medical assistance, said Bonino.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for political rituals...now there is only
time to act quickly, in relief of the innocent civilians in
danger, before a humanitarian catastrophe turns into an
international scandal," said Bonino.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation group supervising
the implementation of a cease-fire understanding between Lebanon
and Israel is to hold a meeting in a southern Lebanese town
Tuesday to consider a Lebanese complaint against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon lodged the complaint against the Jewish state over
the wounding of a civilian in Sunday's Israeli bombardment at
south Lebanese villages, the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency reported this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives of
the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, is to
hold the meeting at 11:00.
</P>
<P>
This will be the seventh meeting of the committee since it was
set up in accordance with the cease-fire understanding reached
between Lebanon and Israel in April, which ended a 17-day
Israeli blitz against Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's artillery bombarded hills and heights in Iglim Al
-Toffah, or Province of Apple, in south Lebanon Sunday, and
security sources said that more than 70 shells hit the area
within a span of six hours in the day.
</P>
<P>
Laila Hashim, a 33-year-old woman, was slightly injured in the
Israeli shelling at her village of loueizeh.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came in a retaliation for a bomb attack by
Lebanese guerrillas targeting a patrol of the Israel-backed South
Lebanon Army militia in the so-called "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-backed Amal Movement headed by Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri said in a statement that two of its
guerrillas were killed in a Thursday clash with an Israeli
patrol in the central sector of the so-called security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon resumed sporadic
bombardment at suspected guerrilla targets opposite the border strip
this morning,\ security sources in the area reported.
</P>
<P>
They said that the bombardment were accompanied by heavy
machine-gun fires in the vicinities of several villages. Israeli
reconnaissance jet fighters also flew over south Lebanon's towns.
</P>
<P>
Shellings and Machine gun fires by Israeli occupation
forces and the SLA militia, as well as hit-and-run attacks by
Moslem guerrillas constitute a daily scene at the last battle
front of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 850-squre-kilometer buffer zone in a
bid to prevent Lebanese guerrillas from launching cross-border
attacks on the northern part of the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Denmark, Uganda's Second Largest Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Denmark has become Uganda's
second largest donor after the United Kingdom and played an
important role in helping the east African country recover from
civil strife and develop economy since l987 when it resumed
cooperation with Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to data available in the Danish Embassy here, Uganda
got 290 million Denmark Krones (about 44.75 million U.S. Dollars)
in aid from Demark in l994. The figure was 250 million Denmark
Krones (DKK) (about 38.58 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The fund were aimed mainly at improving the living conditions
of the poorest, economic growth, social development and political
democratisation.
</P>
<P>
Taking last year for instance, 105 million DKK (6.48 DKK equal
to one U.S. Dollar), representing 42 percent of the year's total,
were distributed to improving road conditions so that the poor
people in the rural area can easily go to the markets in the
urban areas to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
In social development, Denmark granted Uganda 75 million DKK,
or 30 percent of the total, to improve the population's access to
social services, concentrating in particular on health service
and on the provision of clean drinking water in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In economic growth, Denmark gave Uganda 25 million DKK to
enhance agricultural production, which accounts for 51 percent of
the country's GDP and 95 percent of its exports earning.
</P>
<P>
As for assisting political democratisation, Denmark injected
20 million DKK, representing eight percent of the total,
to Uganda's democratic organisations and institutions
including the press and mass organisations, the constituent
assembly, the judiciary and others.
</P>
<P>
On other sectors such as education and sports, the small
European country with a population of 5.2 million granted 25
million DKK, representing 10 percent of the total to the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Danish Embassy here disclosed that a plan of assisting
Uganda for 1997 has been worked out.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Group Wants Military Intervention in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The French humanitarian group
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) is calling on the United Nations to
undertake immediate military intervention in Zaire to save more
than one million refugees threatened by an unprecedented human
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Since the last group of international humanitarian workers
were evacuated from Goma 48 hours ago, 1.2 million Rwandan and
Burundian refugees, as well as countless Zaireans, have been left
behind without assistance, and moreover, without protection," the
MSF said in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian group said that the U.N. should establish a
security zone in eastern Zaire, repatriate the refugees to Rwanda,
and guarantee their security there, while "disarming and
isolating" those responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Jacques de Milliano, vice-president of the MSF, said there was
no time to lose in launching a "political-military" operation
aimed at avoiding a repetition of the catastrophe of 1994, when
more than 50,000 refugees died of epidemics after fleeing Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
French troops intervened in 1994 to evacuate more than one
million Hutu refugees to safety in eastern Zaire from southwest
Rwanda, under the "Turquoise" operation.
</P>
<P>
However, MSF said, a new intervention should not be like the
"Turquoise" operation which was unilateral and "politically biased
and inadequate."
</P>
<P>
The MSF said it strongly opposed the building of new
"semi-permanent" refugee camps for Rwandan refugees along the
Zairean-Rwandan border, because these were used by Hutu extremists
in the past two years as military and political bases to plot
returning to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N. should waste no time in acting to assure
protection for refugees and Zairean civilians, access by
humanitarian rescuers and a disarming all fighting sides and
criminal elements in eastern Zaire's Kivu region.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for the death of half a million Rwandan
Tutsis in 1994 must be brought to justice, said MSF.
</P>
<P>
Most Hutu military men and militias responsible for the 1994
genocide in Rwanda are now hiding among the one million refugees
in eastern Zaire, intimidating refugees and killing those who want
to go back to Rwanda and Burundi.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home this afternoon after he held talks with Syrian
President Hafez el-Assad during a brief visit to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew to Damascus from the Zimbabwe's capital of Harare
where he took part in the 6th summit of the Group 15 held on
November 3-5.
</P>
<P>
During his short visit to Syria, Mubarak held talks with Assad
on the latest developments of the Middle East peace process and
the Israeli refusal to carry out the accords signed by the former
Labour government with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Syrian summit also addressed internal and regional
issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following the meeting, Mubarak
dismissed the Israeli concerns about the recent military assembly
in Syria and said it came as part of military drills to maintain
the efficiency of the Syrian forces.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he was very surprised at Israel's apprehension, as
the exercises did not mean military operations at all.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Syria was not a "surprise," but fell
within his constant contacts with his Syrian counterpart. "I have
not seen President Assad for some time."

<HEADLINE> Members of Punjab Provincial Assembly to Vote on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Raja Saroop Khan, governor
of Pakistan's Punjab province, today asked all members of
provincial assembly to attend the session of the Punjab Assembly
on November 14 to decide the fate of the restored Punjab chief
minister.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to all members of the Punjab Assembly,
the governor said that the Lahore High Court Sunday in its verdict
has restored Mian Manzoor Wattoo as Chief Minister of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the court decision, the governor asked Wattoo
to obtain the vote of confidence from the provincial house on
November 14.
</P>
<P>
Wattoo was dismissed from his office on September 5 last year
by President Farooq Leghari on advice of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto on reports that he had lost his majority in the provincial
assembly and his cabinet was not functioning.
</P>
<P>
Wattoo filed a petition in the Lahore High Court to question
the president's proclamation.
</P>
<P>
The court, after complete hearing of the case, restored Wattoo
as the chief executive of the largest and politically most
important province on condition that he wins a vote of confidence
from the provincial assembly within ten days.
</P>
<P>
If Wattoo fails to get majority from the assembly, the former
Chief Minister Sardar Nakai would be restored automatically.
</P>
<P>
Both the central government and Wattoo are trying to win over
the loyalty of members in the provincial assembly as the formation
of the Punjab provincial government will affect the fate of the
central government.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Maps Out Cultural Relics Protection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to
restore and reopen a group of cultural relics in an attempt to
preserve the ancient city's features, which have been endangered
by rapid urban construction.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four ancient buildings will be renovated, 50 cultural
relic sites will be opened, and ten major archaeological surveys
will be conducted in the next five years, according to the Fifth
Beijing Conference on Cultural Relics, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
A group of historical sites, traditional residences and old
shops will be placed under top protection, as they serve as a
record of the development of Beijing, one of China's famous
ancient capitals.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to prevent traditional layout of the city
proper from being destroyed by the construction of modern
buildings, experts on cultural relics protection said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a history of more than 3,300 years and has been the
capital for several ancient dynasties, leaving numerous
world-famous cultural relics, such as the Great Wall, the Ming
Imperial Tombs and the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Beijing listed some 100 cultural relics
under state and local government protection. 299 historical
buildings were renovated, including Tiananmen Rostrum, Yunju
Temple, the Summer Palace, and Beihai Park.
</P>
<P>
Beijing built 17 new museums in the past five years, increasing
the total number of museums to nearly 90.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 pieces of relics were unearthed. Meanwhile, Beijing
approved the establishment of four cultural relics auction
companies, turning it into an international auction center for
cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Party Decides to Continue Support to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the Congress
Party in India, at its meeting here today decided to continue its
support to the United Front (UF) government headed by Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
"Though there is no withdrawal of support, important things
have been stated in the resolution on Uttar Pradesh," said
Congress Party General Secretary Madhavsinh Solanki.
</P>
<P>
The Congress' new chief Sitaram Kesri called the CWC meeting to
review the party's support to the Deve Gowda government, which has
opposed to the Congress Party's candidate chief ministership in
Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The Congress was disturbed by the government's attitude and its
decision to reimpose the president's rule on Uttar Pradesh, where
no party could secure a clear majority in the assembly elections
concluded early in October to form a state government.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders of the Congress Party are also reported to have
shown their unhappiness over the government's economic and foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government is a minority government and it
could not maintain its rule if the Congress Party withdraws its
support to it.
</P>
<P>
Solanki said that the CWC meeting had adopted two important
resolutions including one on the political stalemate in Uttar
Pradesh, but he declined to say whether the CWC had put any
condition for continuing support to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep a watch (on the United Front government). Let
them behave," a CWC member Balram Jakhar said.

MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
called here today for a halt to the flow of illegal drugs in the
Asia and Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the appeal in his opening speech at the five-day
21st Meeting of the Heads of Narcotics Law Enforcement Agencies
for the Asia and Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were over 150 delegates from 50 countries
and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The formulation of stricter measures is needed to eradicate the
illegal drug trade which "menaces the most susceptible segments of
our population," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed alarm over the continued existence of
international illegal drug syndicates which seem to be undaunted
through the years despite concerted efforts by different
governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Every day, the international drug trafficking network
continues to erode the well-being of many people around the world,
including the people of the Philippines. We, therefore, must
sharpen the tools the international community can use to attack
this worldwide problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos also designated Justice Secretary
Teofisto Guingona as acting Chairman of the Dangerous Drug Board
to bolster the Philippine government's campaign against the
illicit drug trade.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The reinstated Chief Minister
of Punjab province of Pakistan, Manzoor Wattoo, will seek vote of
confidence in the Punjab assembly next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official Associated Press of Pakistan said today that
Governor of Punjab province Raja Saroop Khan will summon the
session of the Punjab assembly next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wattoo, who was dismissed from office in September 1995 by the
president on recommendation of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was
reinstated as the Punjab Chief Minister by the Lahore High Court
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the court also gave Wattoo 10 days to prove his majority in
the Punjab provincial assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to the rule, Wattoo must get the support from at
least 125 members of the provincial parliament which has 248
parliamentarians, otherwise, he must step down again.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Wattoo's restoration is a heavy blow to
the present government led by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as
Punjab is the most populous and important province in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Bhutto's supporters have filed a no-confidence motion,
believing that they can once again remove Wattoo, a wily
politician who has changed sides several times.

<HEADLINE> Museum at Peking University Received Rare Antiques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Korean art collectors today
donated 100 cultural relics to a museum at the prestigious Peking
University, including a 1,700-year-old green-glazed pottery lamp
featuring designs of birds.
</P>
<P>
Also among the relics are painted pottery pieces from the Han
Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), celadon from the Southern Dynasties
(420-589), and porcelain from the Tang (618-907), Song (960-1279),
Yuan (1271-1368), and Ming (1368-1644) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most eye-catching of the porcelain items in the
collection is that made at the famous Changsha Kiln, which
operated during the Tang Dynasty. The rare green-glazed relics
include water droppers marked with flower designs, running deer,
and toys shaped like children or animals.
</P>
<P>
Leading Chinese antique appraisers highly valued these pieces,
saying that such a collection of unbroken porcelain cannot be
found even in the provincial museum of central China's Hunan
Province, where the kiln was located.
</P>
<P>
The relics were sent to the Arthur M. Sackler Museum of Art and
Archaeology at Peking University by Kim Hyung Suk and Shin Hie
Chool, collectors from the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim Hyung Suk, 84, whose Chinese name is Liu Xiangyuan, came to
study in China at the age of seven. He joined the Chinese army to
fight with invaders in the War of Resistance Against Japanese
Aggression (1937-45), and became a member of the military advisers
committee of the Kuomintang government.
</P>
<P>
He later relinquished his military position and went into
business in Hong Kong. He returned his homeland in 1995, and is
now an advisor for a national ancient fine arts association.

<HEADLINE> Former "Emperor" Bokassa Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Jean Bedel Bokassa, the former
self-styled emperor of the Central African Republic, died Sunday
evening in a hospital in Bangui, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Bokassa's doctors and
relatives as saying today that 75-year-old Bokassa died of a heart
attack after three months of treatment in Cote d'Ivoire, at a
hospital for hypertension, heart, kidney and liver diseases.
</P>
<P>
His body was now in the morgue at Bangui, under police
protection to prevent an uncontrollable influx of visitors, said
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Charles, one of the 55 sons and daughters of the former
emperor, said his father's mind remained clear until the last
moment. If he had not died, the family would have sent him to
Japan this week for treatment.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should organize a state funeral for his
father in his native village of Berengo, 80 kilometers from
Bangui, where Bokassa once had an imperial court designed in the
style of Napoleon 1st of France.
</P>
<P>
Born on February 22, 1921, in Bobangui, in the Bantu tribe of
M'Bakas, Bokassa was the nephew of two heads of state of the
Central African Republic, and was a former soldier of the French
army, fighting in World War II in Europe, Indochina and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He received several French military medals including the Croix
de Guerre, the Medaille Militaire and Legion d'Honneur for his
military performances.
</P>
<P>
Bokassa became the chief of staff of the army of the new-born
Central African Republic in 1964 and overthrew his uncle, former
president David Dacko, on the night of December 31, 1965.
</P>
<P>
He was a great admirer of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and
proclaimed himself emperor on December 4, 1977, to the great
astonishment of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He ruled the country for 14 years and was overthrown by an
intervention by French parachute troops in Bangui, on September
21, 1979.
</P>
<P>
He lived in exile in France after being ousted from power. In
October 1986, he returned to his country where he was sentenced to
death for the massacre in 1970s of 100 school children, a charge
he rejected.
</P>
<P>
He received clemency in 1993, the result of an ordinance by
former president Andre Kolingba.

</P>
<P>
The total investments of the 101 projects could top 11.36
billion U.S. dollars, according Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA) today.
</P>
<P>
These projects will fall within seven main sectors, namely,

water.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector tops the list with total investments
amounting to 9.82 billion dollars, while tourism will come second
with total investments amounting to 845.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Water sector comes at the bottom with an investment of 12.1
million dollars.
</P>

state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1995 and 40 percent of its
total exports while the investment in the private sector has
tripled to 9.6 billion dollars by June against the figure in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The number of deals concluded by the private sector has grown
50 times over the last four years to 469,000 deals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Federation of Egyptian Industries
will refer to the conference three major projects, said Mohammed
Farid Khamis, head of the federation, a grouping of state-owned
industrial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The projects include building a resort on the Red Sea coast
with a total capital of 185 million dollars, setting up a
polyester factory to provide 350 job opportunities with a budget
of 170.7 million dollars to produce petrochemicals in north of the

<HEADLINE> Doctors to Decide Date of Yeltsin's Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin doctors will meet
later today to discuss preparations for Russian President Boris
Yeltin's heart by-pass surgery, his press secretary Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said the head of the cardiology research center,
Yevgeny Chazov, the head of the center's surgical department,
Renat Akchurin, the leader of the presidential medical center,
Sergei Mironov, the head of the hematology center, Andrei Vorobyev
and other Russian experts as well as prominent U.S. cardiologist
Michael DeBakey would attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The operation would be performed in the cardiology research
center by a group of surgeons led by Akchurin, the spokesman
said. He added that the presidential press service was to issue a
press release about Yeltsin's state of health later today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin himself made it public on September 5 that the Kremlin
doctors found out that he had heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
"The doctors, our doctors, recommended either an operation or
passive work. But I am never one to be content with passive
work. So it is better for me to undergo surgery and recuperate in
full, than to work passively," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The intended by-pass operation was confirmed by the Kremlin
doctors who attended the first meeting in the Central Clinical
Hospital on September 25.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mironov said the doctors needed six to ten
weeks to prepare Yeltsin for heart surgery, while Akchurin
declared that after six weeks of preparation he could foretell
that the success of the operation would be close to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the government, Akchurin
performed a similar by-pass operation on the present Prime
Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, eight years ago. According to
Chernomyrdin, the operation made it possible for him "to work
today and withstand colossal loads."
</P>
<P>
DeBakey, who is confident that Yeltsin will return to normal
activity after the operation, has stressed that the surgery was
necessary. DeBakey said the post-surgery convalescence period
would last from six weeks to two months.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of last week, Yeltsin cancelled all working
meetings in the Barvikha sanatorium, outside Moscow, for the
beginning of the final stage of preparation for surgery.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said last Saturday: "We have prepared everything
for the operation. But the exact date will be set by the
doctors. We have no right to intervene in this process."

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 delegates from China
and abroad gathered today in east China's Zhejiang Province to
discuss trends in world tourism and tourism education.
</P>
<P>
"Educate Educators," the third international workshop held by
the National Tourism Administration of China and the World Tourism
Organization (WTO), will focus on problems that have occurred in
China's tourism education program, and explore new ways for its
development.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Ramos, representative of the secretary general of WTO,
attended today's opening ceremony. He and other experts from
Britain, Australia and China addressed the group on trends in
tourism and tourism education both internationally and in China,
and modes for vocational education in the field.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become one of China's most vital industries,
yielding 210 billion yuan (over 25 billion US dollars) in
1995. Over six million people in the country were employed by the
sector, which received more than 600 million tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's tourism education system has been
strengthened to meet the increasing demand of the
trade. Currently, 138 colleges and universities have set up
departments of tourism studies, and more than 400 high schools and
vocational schools have similar majors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Swedish Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson, who is visiting China for the first time, said today he
was deeply impressed by China's rapid economic growth, and that he
believes the Chinese people have the ability to solve any
difficulties they encounter along the path of development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who warmly welcomed Persson to
visit China, said that he had visited Sweden in 1988, and was
greatly affected by the beautiful country and its advanced economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Persson's current China visit will
further boost Sino-Swedish friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Persson told Jiang that Sweden values the development of its
relations with China, and that the two countries have had close
cooperation in many areas, with good results, for a long time. He
added that Sweden hopes bilateral ties can continue to grow, and
that the two sides also will expand multi-lateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China will play an increasingly important role both in world
economics and global politics, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Sweden, as an important nation in northern
Europe, is the first Western country to open diplomatic relations
with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries, although geographically far
apart, have developed their bilateral relations greatly, and have
carried out fruitful cooperation in all fields since they forged
diplomatic ties some 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Especially in recent years, Jiang noted, the two countries'
leaders have maintained direct contact through an exchange of
visits, which Jiang hailed as invaluable for deepening mutual
understanding and pushing forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that China and Sweden have their own
advantages, with different national characteristics, that the two
countries' economies are strongly complementary, and that
bilateral trade has increased year after year.
</P>
<P>
Sweden owns some world famous transnational corporations, Jiang
pointed out, and some of them, such as ABB, Ericsson and Volvo,
have had successful cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that leaders of these enterprises are
accompanying Persson on his China tour will promote cooperation
between the two business circles.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed Persson on China's domestic economic
situation and the construction of its socialist market economy. He
asked Persson to convey his regards to Swedish King Carl Gustaf
XVI.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airline Faces New Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airline (PAL) is
facing a new wave of strikes as its flight attendants and pilots
threatened today to strike if their demands for wage hikes fail to
be met on November 11.
</P>
<P>
The threats came just as the PAL is beginning to restore its
normal operations after its 9,000 ground workers ended their
four-day strike Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the 6,200 PAL flight attendants and pilots
warned this morning that they are planning to walk out if the PAL
management fails to meet their wage hike demands on November 11.
</P>
<P>
The country's Flight Attendants and Stewardess Association
(FASAP) and the Airline Pilots Association (APAP) have agreed to
let Senate President Ernesto Maceda to broker negotiations with
the PAL management.
</P>
<P>
FASAP President Roberto Anduisa said his group along with ALPAP
and the PAL Employees Association (PALEA), which represent the
ground workers, will submit to the PAL management their proposed
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
Anduisa said the pay for PAL flight attendants and pilots is
much lower than the average salary for their counterparts in other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Anduisa criticized the PAL management for refusing to accept
the three unions' bargaining agreements on wage hikes for 1993 to
1995 and 1995 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Anduisa and ALPAP President Sotico Lioren said they will
call off the planned strike if the Supreme Court upholds their
bargaining agreements for 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The PALEA called an indefinite strike Thursday to pressure the
PAL management to open talks on their wage hike demand under the
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which disrupted many domestic and international
flights and stranded thousands of passengers, ended Saturday after
the PAL management agreed to begin 10-day negotiations on the
PALEA's 3.2-billion peso (123 million U.S. dollars) wage increase
demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a senior official of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the CPC should take
full advantage of its role as the leading force in promoting
material, ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, made the remark during his
inspection of local Party construction, and ethical and cultural
progress in east China's Jiangsu Province from October 25 to
November 3.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on local officials to combine the coordinated
development of material, ethical and cultural progress with
construction of the Party, by invoking the spirit of the Sixth
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee which was held
last month.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection of villages in Xuzhou and Wuxian cities,
Hu said that grassroots Party construction in rural areas must
concentrate on developing the rural economy, and building new
socialist villages that are both prosperous and civilized.
</P>
<P>
He told local Party officials that the key to implementing the
good policies of the Party is to have a group of leaders who can
guide the people in simultaneously developing the economy and
promoting cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Hu also viewed the Party's work in some large state-owned
enterprises, including the Xuzhou Engineering Machinery
Co. (Group), the Wuxi Little Swan Co. Ltd., the Yuejin Automobile
Co. (Group) and the Yangtze Petrochemical Co.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's role as the political core is the requirement of
establishing a modern enterprise system with Chinese
characteristics and also the guarantee of the reform, development
and stability of the enterprises, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
At present, it should be stressed that Party organizations in
enterprises take part in the companies' major decisions, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that studying and implementing the resolution adopted
by the Sixth Plenary Session must be priorities for the local
Party organizations.

Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim is expected to arrive here tomorrow for the
summit and representatives from the United Nation and European
Union would take part as observers, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka pointed out that foreign ministers of the seven
African countries would hold a preparatory meeting this afternoon
for the one-day summit.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the summit would be operated "within
the framework of mechanism for conflict prevention, resolution
and management" of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit will be held at the background of Zaire's
accusations that Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda were involved in the
Banyamulenge Tutsi uprising in eastern Zaire and when the Zairean
parliament voted to sever ties with the three countries late last
week.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan papers predicted earlier today that Zaire would attend
the regional summit perhaps because Nairobi has sent out
invitation.
</P>
<P>
However, Zaire announced last week that it would not attend
the Nairobi talks if the Rwandan troops are still inside its
territory.

HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Wheat harvesting is well
underway and the country should meet its projected figure of well
over 270,000 tons, the Zimbabwe Cereal Producers Association

</P>
<P>
ZCPA Chief Executive Peter Wells said the majority of the

''Weather conditions have been favorable if not the best to

This year's figure is 205,000 tons up on last year's figure of

<HEADLINE> Quality of Chinese Food Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Public
Health said today that thanks to the Food Hygiene Law adopted one
year ago, hygienic conditions in China's food market are gradually
improving.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued today in Beijing to the deputies of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, Chen
Minzhang said that the rate of food products which met state
hygienic standards during the first nine months this year had
risen by nearly three percentage points over the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Food Hygiene Law was passed on October 30, 1995, at the
16th session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Since the enforcement of the law, my ministry has launched a
series of national campaigns to crack down on food products which
are unable to meet state hygienic standards," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Statistic from 15 provinces across the country showed that the
number of quality examinations on enterprises manufacturing or
selling food products during the first nine months this year rose
by 18.67 percent over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a total of 2.7 million kilograms of food products
that either were fake, sub-standard, or had spoiled were
confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, a management system for health-care food products
has taken initial shape, with nearly 120 such products currently
under close examination by the Ministry of Public Health," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that more than 50 of the 120 products are expected
to become China's first batch of officially-acknowledged
health food products.
</P>
<P>
The minister conceded that there are still a number of serious
problems in the field of food hygiene, which have posed threats to
the health of the general public.
</P>
<P>
The focus of his ministry in 1997, he said, will be to improve
the quality of health food, food for infants and children, and
food products long haunted by poor quality.
</P>
<P>
"Control over the food and drink sector must be strengthened,
with special attention given to the quality of meat and meat
products," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity to enhance supervision of the
production of food containers, food packaging materials, and
disposable containers.
</P>
<P>
"This can help reduce the post-production pollution of the food
products," he explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudan and Uganda agreed to
renegotiate a peace agreement after the mediation by Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Sudan, Uganda, Iran and Malawi tried to
work out the details of the agreement in the third meeting aimed
at reaching the agreement. The result is that Sudan and Uganda
will renegotiate the agreement in December.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was quoted by Tehran radio as saying that peace to
be realized as a result of the agreement requires "efforts,
patience and self-restraint."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry this morning claimed a success in
hosting peace talks between foreign ministers of Sudan and
Uganda in a bid to settle their disputes.
</P>
<P>
It said that talks between Sudan and Uganda provided the
right atmosphere for settling dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tehran initiated the talks which went on till late Sunday
night. It was also attended by Malawi as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided that the next session will be held
in the Ugandan capital in a month.
</P>
<P>
The four sides also stressed the need to maintain the
present status quo and refrain from any measure which may
endanger the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the participating foreign ministers asked experts
teams to draft the final statement.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995, after accusing Kampala of supporting rebels in the north
of the country. Sudan, for its part, accused Uganda of backing
rebel groups in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In October, Sudan, Uganda and Iran reached a draft
agreement to settle border disputes between Kampala and Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda had signed an agreement to normalize
relations between the countries following mediation by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during his trip to Africa
in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli police have been
placed on emergency footing since Saturday night as the security
authorities received what they called concrete information on
plans by Islamic Jihad to launch terrorist attacks, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Road blocks were set up around the country and traffic jams
were reported at the rush hour after Shabbat because of the
step-up of security checks.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement Saturday, the police and Public Security
Ministry spokesmen said, "All the operational units of the
Israel Police as of tonight are on emergency status, making the
maximum amount of manpower available to foil possible terror
attacks."
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz met with senior officers,
including the commanders of all police districts, to review the
stepped-up security measures. It was not announced how long the
measures would remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the road blocks, police presence is to be
beefed up in public places that might be likely targets for
attack, the spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
"The police want to make clear that these measures are likely
to make things difficult for commuters, and there will no doubt
be tie-ups on the highways and in the cities," they said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said, "We will do
everything we can to minimize the possible discomfort to
drivers, but we hope the public will view the measures we are
taking with understanding."
</P>
<P>
Israel fears that the extremist Islamic Jihad group would
carry out attacks, including suicide bomb explosions, to mark
the first anniversary of the assassination of its leader, Fathi
Shkaki. The Islamic group accused Israeli secret agents of
murdering Shkaki in the Mediterranean island country of Malta on
October 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, Israel began to clamp a total closure on the
entire Palestinian territories and security forces were ordered
to be on extra special alert. The total closure remains ever

BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- During a recent inspection tour
in southern China, Chinese President Jiang Zemin called on local
officials to carry out the central government's poverty relief
policy and solve critical problems they uncover in their work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, viewed poverty-alleviation work in Guizhou Province
and Guangxi Autonomous Region from October 25 to November 3.
</P>
<P>
"To basically solve the feeding and clothing problems of poor
people in China's rural areas by the end of the century is a major
strategic program of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council," Jiang said on his tour.
</P>
<P>
"Objectives have become clear, determination has been made,
the tough battle must be dealt with well. (We) must strive for
complete victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Traveling over winding and bumpy mountain roads, Jiang visited
rural households and was distressed to see that some farmers still
live in thatched huts, with meager supplies of food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
He gave quilts to the farmers and urged local officials to
visit impoverished villages frequently and take care of the
practical needs of the masses.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President was pleased to see that marked changes
have taken place in some areas which were once very poor.
</P>
<P>
With hard work and government support, many rural people have
overcome poverty by making use of local resources and advanced
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
On October 28, Jiang visited a new village located in suburban
Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, and danced with the
villagers there.
</P>
<P>
The village consists of 23 households of the Miao ethnic group,
who formerly lived in high mountains and were subjected to harsh
natural conditions. They relocated to the new site in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was glad to see that all of the families have access to
electricity, tap water and television.

</P>
<P>
Sitting in the new house of a villager named Su Qiquan, Jiang
recalled that the Su family lived in a thatched hut when he passed
through the area six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The changes in your family indicate that even though you were
poor, you have a strong will. This is very important," the
president told Su.
</P>
<P>
While in the prefecture, Jiang also inspected tunnels, bridges
and railways along the new line currently under construction which
links Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, and Kunming, the Yunnan
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The railway winds through the mountains, covering 898.6 km and
running through 29 counties and cities in Guangxi, Guizhou and
Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that local governments will grab the
opportunity to accelerate economic growth and social development
in the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
He also spent time at some large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, noting that local officials must be responsible for
making the enterprises cater to the market economy through
economic reforms and technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
In some places, Jiang met with the People's Liberation Army,
armed police and local police forces.

Throughout his journey, the president emphasized the promotion
of ethical and cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Dhahran Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today
once again denied any "involvement" in the Dhahran explosion
which killed 19 U.S. soldiers and injured 386 others in Saudi
Arabia last June.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi warned against a
new American conspiracy to sow discord among Arab and Islamic
countries while referring to issues raised in the American press
alleging the involvement of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli lobby in the United States intends to
create schism among Moslems and thus come up with the above
scenario and similar scenarios such as involvement of Shiite
Moslems in the assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Describing as baseless a report carried by Washington Post in
this regard, Mohammadi said such false reports are part of
U.S. conspiracies against Moslems.
</P>
<P>
He once again denied that Iran has had any connection with
the explosion in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also dismissed allegations by Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials on transfer of Iraqi chemical
weapons to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said spread of such false reports by Americans are caused
by American concern over the growing regional role of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed condemned the recent statement made by the U.S. State
Department spokesman to the effect that Iran has no chance of
becoming involved in the talks between the rival Iraqi Kurdish
groups.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is Iran's geopolitical status, but not the
baseless statements of American officials, that determines Iran's
role in resolving crises.

College of Technology, Professor Olu Odeyemi, has advised the
Nigerian government not to rationalise universities in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting at the weekend, he said: "I want to appeal
to government not to rationalise universities in any way but should
expand on it. I will never, never support rationalisation of
university, but will even ask for more."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Head of State, General Sani Abacha recently ordered
an examination of the country's higher education sector, hinting
that the 37 universities of Nigeria will be merged to remove
duplicated faculties.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the cancel of tuition fee in the late 1970s of
causing an explosion in the number of students in Nigerian
universities, which further worsened the short of funds.
</P>
<P>
Odeyemi, a National Merit Award winner, said what nigeria
needs most now for growth is proper technological education,
which could only be achieved by establishing more higher
education institutions.
</P>
<P>
If the government is finding it difficult to maintain the
existing universities, it should introduce moderate tuition fees
to be paid by students, he said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Selection Committee for the first government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) caught the attention of
citizens in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In brief interviews with 26 citizens in the department stores,
teahouses, parks and schools on Sunday, 20 of them said that they
were glad that the Selection Committee was elected at the
just-closed Sixth Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In teahouses and parks, many of the citizens were reading
newspaper stories about the formation of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the main hall of the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology, there are some bulletin boards with detailed
information about the functions of the Selection Committee and the
procedures for selecting the first Chief Executive of SAR.
</P>
<P>
Ku Cheng-hui, a 49-year-old social worker, said that setting up
the Selection Committee and selecting the first Chief Executive of
SAR and the Provisional Legislative Council are top affairs in
Hong Kong in the coming months, adding that as a citizen of Hong
Kong, he would like to play an active role in supporting the work
of the Preparatory Committee and to contribute to the smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A former civil servant named Tsang said that he has kept a
close attention to the work of the Selection Committee because it
is unprecedented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old man said that under the colonial rule of
Britain, there has been no real democracy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Most of the interviewed persons held that the 400-member
selection committee are broadly represented among the Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
A man named Chan in Hong Kong Park told Xinhua that the members
of the Selection Committee are influential and well selected.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the Chief Executive selected by the
committee will benefit Hong Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
An optician named Chang noted that the Central Government in
Beijing did not interfere in the process of the formation of the
Selection Committee and the formation of the committee is open and
fair.
</P>
<P>
He said that the formation of the selection committee
represents the Chinese central governments' promise of "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Most of the people interviewed by Xinhua also expressed their
confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
A couple in their sixties at Hong Kong Park said that now Hong
Kong is stable and its economy is growing, there is no problem for
Hong Kong's smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: War Cries for Thai Poll: Best Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- With less than two weeks to go
before the November 17 general election in Thailand, each of the
major campaigning political parties has boasted to have best
remedies up its sleeve for the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
With a slow export growth at only 2 to 3 percent during the
first eight months this year, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)
index plummeting to a three-year-low and the consumer price index
on the rise, the offering of remedies for salvaging the country's
economy will definitely help win more popularity from the voters.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll shows that most people surveyed hoped
that the new government would be able to improve the country's
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the general public's concern, the political parties
seized every opportunity to publicize or advertise their platform
on economy through newspapers, at mass rallies or during
television debates.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party, led by former prime minister Chuan Leekpai,
and the New Aspiration party, led by caretaker Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, are widely
believed to be the two forerunners running neck and neck during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
They both have pinned much hope on a high-sounding economic
program to attract more votes.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party, whose campaign slogan is "honesty and
professionalism," promises, "we are ready to join hands in order
to bring about sustained prosperity for all the Thai people" and
to push the Thai economy to the world market.
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Chavalit's party has pledged to bring about
bright economic prospects to the country and good prices for farm
produce.
</P>
<P>
The Chart Pattana (national development) party, which is
expected to win the third largest number of seats in the new House
of Representatives, claims that its party leader, former prime
minister Chatichai Choonhavan, is "the one to clean the economic
mess."
</P>
<P>
Apart from convincing economic platforms, the parties have also
publicize their teams of economic professionals for the cabinet if
they become the core of the new government, expected to be a
coalition.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Calls to Stamp out Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today that it is time for the entire nation to make
a renewed resolve to uproot corruption and irregularities from
society once and for all.
</P>
<P>
Kim's remarks were made at a luncheon in connection with the
bribery scandals involving former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho and
Seoul City officials. Some 240 government officials attended the
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who had been defense minister until October 17, was
arrested on October 26 on charges of receiving 187,000
U.S. dollars in bribes in April last year from the Daewoo Heavy
Industries Company which asked in return for a state license to
take part in an army light helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
Four Seoul City officials were arrested recently on charges of
taking thousands of U.S. dollars in bribes from bus companies for
setting bus routes in favor of the firms.
</P>
<P>
Without uprooting corruption and irregularities, the president
said, there will be no national security, nor will the economy
develop to increase the country's international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The president declared that he will by no means tolerate a lax
discipline in officialdom as well as the anti-corruption campaign
during the remaining one year and four months of his tenure.

<HEADLINE> The Ups and Downs Of The Mighty Yellow River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The mighty Yellow River,
known as the "scourge of China", will take generations to tame,
experts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
And they have called for people living in the path of the
country's second longest watercourse to stay alert and vigilant
against disastrous floods.
</P>
<P>
One life-long river watcher warned about the terrible
consequences should the notorious Yellow River again burst its
banks, and spew its torrents into towns and cities that stand
below its water level.
</P>
<P>
But while the river has yet to be tamed it has also brought
great benefits to communities along its winding path.
</P>
<P>
The Hetao area, near the top of the Great Bend of the river in
the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia autonomous regions, is one area to
reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
As early as 2,000 years ago, people in the area built ditches
and canals to divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate their
fields.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the study of the Yellow River noted that the
utilization of the river in a concentrated way began in the early
1950s.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Chinese Government has built the Qingtong Gorge Reservoir, and a
number of water diversion projects to irrigate 780,000 hectares in
the Hetao area.

<HEADLINE> N-power Best Alternative to Meet Energy Demands: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Atomic Energy
Commission Chairman Dr. R. Chidambaram said today that nuclear
power was the best alternative to meet the growing energy demands
of developing countries like India.
</P>
<P>
There has no option for India other than going nuclear for
energy needs particularly when per capita energy consumption was
very low, he said while inaugurating a four-day international
symposium on "harmonization of health related environmental
measurements using nuclear and isotopic techniques" in Hyderabad,
capital of Andhra Pradesh, in southern India.
</P>
<P>
Environmental issues confronting large hydro-projects coupled
with limited scope of non-conventional energy like solar and wind
have complicated problems of energy scenario, he said.
</P>
<P>
While thermal energy would continue to hold prime place in
energy programs, the advantages of clean energy through nuclear
route should not be lost sight of, he further said.

short-term interest rates after lowering it by half a percentage

<HEADLINE> The Ups and Downs Of The Mighty Yellow River (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Yellow River Resources Committee, the amount
of irrigated areas in the Yellow River valley have increased from
800,000 hectares in 1949 to 7.3 million hectares, and the power
generating capacity at the river has climbed to 3.74 million
kilowatts, producing a total of 274 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
While bringing benefits to the people, the Yellow River has
also brought suffering to people.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, during the 2,500 years from
602 B.C.to 1938, the Yellow River burst its banks, and changed
course more than 1,500 times.
</P>
<P>
Between 1911 and 1946, the lower reaches of the river
experienced eight heavy floods, flowing at speeds of up to 10,000
cubic meters per second, with people referring to "the scourge of
the Yellow River".
</P>
<P>
Xu Fuling, an 83-year-old expert who began his studies of the
Yellow River in the 1930s, said, "It is a wonder that the Yellow
River has experienced heavy floods twice over the past 50 years,
but has not breached."
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean that the Yellow River will no longer bring
disaster to the Chinese nation," he said, calling for heightened
vigilance against the river.
</P>
<P>
Although people still have different views on the river, the
river now poses more questions for people to think about:
</P>
<P>
-- The overuse of the water from the Yellow River. In the past
24 years since 1972, the river has run dry in stretches for
several months in its lower reaches during each of the past 18
years, giving people a false impression of worrying more about the
lack of water than floods, and even weakening the sense of
anti-floods.
</P>
<P>
-- The rise of the river bed in the middle and lower
reaches. The river bed at Kaifeng City is about seven to eight
meters higher than the city.
</P>
<P>
With regard of the development of the Yellow River, experts in
the study of the Yellow River warned that floods and their
consequence for the river, if they occur, will be severe.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lianan, Chairman of the Yellow River Resources Committee,
said, "The Yellow River is the most difficult and complex river in
the world to harness, and we have not yet fully understood or
mastered it. Therefore, the harnessing of the river can not be
fulfilled by one generation, and it will be done by generation
after generation."

<HEADLINE> Asian Meeting on Remote Sensing Opens in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The 17th Asian Conference on
Remote Sensing (ACRS) was opened here today by Sri Lankan Minister
of Agriculture, lands and Forestry D.M. Jayaratne.
</P>
<P>
About 140 foreign delegates from 25 countries, together with an
equal number of local scientists participated in the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>

application of this technology in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jayaratne said that as a
modern technology for collecting data for a variety of activities
which are oriented towards the development of a country, Remote
Sensing has gained grounds very rapidly during the past few
decades.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the conference is for remote sensing
scientists of Asia as well those of Western countries to discuss
Asian problems relating to resource identification which will
contribute to national and regional development, according to the
conference sources.
</P>
<P>
The concept of Remote Sensing which was introduced to Sri Lanka
in the mid-1970s is now widely practiced in a number of government
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Is No Longer Symbol of Status in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 -- Mobile phones are no longer a symbol of
status and fortune, a recent survey in China's leading industrial
city, Shanghai has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The survey, co-sponsored by Shanghai Hongqiao Friendship
Shopping Center, Youth Post, and China News Service, shows that
only 3.3 percent of the mobile phone owners carry their phones as
a symbol of status.
</P>
<P>
Another 17 percent of the owners said that mobile phones, in
addition to helping people communicate more conveniently, can show
holders status and fortune to some extent.
</P>
<P>
But nearly 80 percent of the owners believe that mobile phones
are on longer linked with holders' status and fortune. They said
that mobile phones are now only viewed as a useful communicating
tool.
</P>
<P>
In today's Shanghai, people hold mobile phones on old bicycles,
or talk through mobile phones on crowded buses.
</P>
<P>
Years ago when mobile phones first appeared in Shanghai, some
businessmen put borrowed mobile phones on the conference table to
show the company's economic strength.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey adds that people today just put mobile
phones in bags with common personal belongings, no more purposely
showing off.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most mobile phones were bought by companies and
enterprises to equip the personnel.
</P>
<P>
But the survey reveals that only 29.5 percent of the mobile
phones are bought in this way now. Instead, 68 percent of mobile
phones are sold to individuals.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Subway to Upgrade Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mass Transit Railway
Corporation (MTRC) will undertake a project worth one billion HK
dollars (129 million US dollars) to upgrade its trains.
</P>
<P>
According to an MTRC official, by 1998, passengers will see the
first batch of the refurbished trains, and renovation of the
entire fleet will be completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trains would have a clean and modern look,
with the trademark red stripes removed.
</P>
<P>
New features would include a flashing system map with light
indicators showing the direction of travel, location of the train,
next stop, interchange terminals and which side the doors would
open.
</P>
<P>
The official said that wheelchair-bound passengers would be
accommodated at two designated areas on every train.
</P>
<P>
Wider gates, lifts or ramps and other facilities would be
available for handicapped passengers within two to three years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The driving cab which costs 30 percent of the project would
have split screen monitors allowing drivers to view all 170 meters
of the train without stepping out of the car.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said, eight of the 34 trains on the
Tsuen Wan line have had new signaling systems installed. Trains
on Hong Kong Island and Kwun Tong lines are expected to have the
system by early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ready Colored Cotton Sets Clothing Industry Spinning In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ready-colored cotton has been
grown in China, with a guarantee that the colors will never fade.
</P>
<P>
The colored cotton plant, which does not need any chemical
fertilizer or pesticide, has been successfully grown in Dunhuang
in West China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
Colors of the cotton include pale brown, light green and brown.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that though the yield per unit area of color
cotton is less than that of common cotton, it is profitable to
plant the color varieties, because the price of color cotton on
the world market is twice that of common cotton.
</P>
<P>
Clothes made of colored cotton have been in the fashion in
Europe and Southeast Asia, and it is predicted that color cotton
products will be the most popular products in world textile
markets in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Feitian Color Cotton Company, which began the test
cultivation of colored cotton in 1995, has decided to enlarge the
test area to 47 hectares next year. Meanwhile, it will start the
research of colored cotton spinning and weaving technologies.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Develops World's First 1-Giga DRAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Electronics
Company has developed a fully working die of 1-gigabyte dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) for the first time in the world, a
company official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 1g DRAM, developed with a total investment of 266.7 million
U.S. dollars over the last two years and five months, has 1.07
billion working cells and can store an amount of information
equivalent to more than 8,000 newspaper pages, 160 books, 400
still pictures or 16 hours of audio data, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Samsung's 1g DRAM adopted high performance 0.18-micron design
rules and CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) process
technology suitable for mass-producing super-fast,
ultra-large-scale integrated circuits with high speed and low
power consumption.
</P>
<P>
The 1g DRAM can operate at a speed of 30 nano seconds by
applying multi-bank synchronous structure in its design and
adopted a special new "redundancy technology" to reduce the mass
production defect rate.
</P>
<P>
The new device can be widely used in future-generation PCs,
work-stations, video conferencing systems with interpretation
ability, medical systems, satellite telecommunications, personal
digital assistants and other future digital multimedia products.
</P>
<P>
The latest development of the 1g DRAM reaffirms Samsung's
leading technological position in the memory market.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to remain in the lead of the world memory product
market at least until early in the next century," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1g DRAM will be commercially available around the turn of
the century, with full-scale production forecast for around the
year 2005, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Laser System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli defense industry
company, ELOP, has unveiled a new laser system designed for use
on the U.S. Army Comanche stealth helicopter, reported the local
daily The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The new laser system reportedly can both target the enemy and
gather data on range of the threat. The laser for the Comanche
combines a new laser technology, called diodepumped, with
eye-safety for the users, who are exposed to blinding laser beams.
</P>
<P>
"The laser system for range-finding and target designation
plays an important and central role in the helicopter's
targeting navigation system," said ELOP's president Jacob Toren.
</P>
<P>
ELOP entered the U.S. project after a giant U.S. defense
manufacturer failed to develop a similar system.
</P>
<P>
The Comanche built by two U.S. companies, Boeing and Sikorsky,
is set to be the first stealth helicopter using such laser system
in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Michael Richey, head of the U.S. Army systems engineering
project on the Comanche, said the U.S. Army plans to order 1,200
Comanche helicopters, with production to begin in 2006. Six
prototype Comanches are to be delivered to the army by 2001.

Bosnia

KUALA LUMPUR, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of
Bosnia-Herzegovina today appealed to Malaysia to maintain its
present number of troops in the Balkan state after the NATO-led
peace implementation force(IFOR)'s mandate ends on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina army
commander General Rasim Delic during his meeting with Malaysian
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid told reporters after the meeting that although
Malaysia has decided to maintain its 1,533-strong Malaysian
contingent (Malcon II) serving under IFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
it would depend on the "situation" after the expiration of the
mandate.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to adhere to whatever decisions taken at the
international level including a possible request to reduce the
number of our troops after the mandate is over," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bosnian general felt that the international force
would continue their presence in Bosnia probably in a different
form until a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid also said the first batch of Malcon III to replace
Malcon II would be despatched to Bosnia on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has sent its military officers to the Balkan state to
train the Bosnian army but it would be in the interest of the
Bosnians to send their officers for training in Malaysia as all
the facilities are here, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also involved in the United States-sponsored
"train and equip" program for the Bosnian army, contributing 10
million US dollars for purchasing military and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian General who arrived here today also called on
Malaysian Armed Forces Chief Gen Ismail Omar at his office.

<HEADLINE> Government to Control Internet Services in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Service providers of the
world immensely popular Internet operating in Kuwait will soon
have to market their services under certain conditions under a
proposed managing plan by Kuwaiti Ministry of Communications,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Underscretary of the ministry Salman Al-Roumi told local
daily Arab Times Sunday that Kuwaiti Communications Ministry is
intended to have full control of the main Internet up-link out of
which it will lease lines to anyone or any company that wishes to
be a provider.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be compulsory for the providers in the
country to operate under the dome of the ministry which will be
the sole main up-link to the Internet service.
</P>
<P>
"This operation will give us full control of the Internet in
Kuwait, as well as full control of the necessary equipment," he
said adding that "anyone who wants to be a provider wil have to
do so under certain conditions which we are currently drafting."
</P>
<P>
Two Internet service providers are currently operating in
Kuwait and the unmber is expected to be increased.
</P>
<P>
The fact that no one owns the immensely popular Internet
makes it difficult for a single organisation or government to
mount control on it and it is becoming increasingly controversial
in Kuwait. This makes it neccesary for the official authorities
to set up certain conditions for the providers to follow and
start governmental supervision over the services, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
According to Al-Roumi the ministry also contemplating drafting
 a law enabling it to contol certain aspects and services
readily available on the Intenet.
</P>
<P>
However, regarding to this, he said unless it could be
technically controlled, a law is no use. "If it is made possible
to cotrol the flow of certain information, the ministry will
formulate this idea," He said.
</P>
<P>
There are two providers of Internet services currently in
Kuwait and the number is expected to be increased to a mimimum of
10 or 20 in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Under the new operation, government will lease lines to
Internet providers and the providers will have the freedom to
take on as many subscribers as they wish.
</P>
<P>
This new operation was supposed to have been introduced about
six months ago, but accoding to Al-Roumi, it came up against some
technical and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the ministry has "progressed very well
with this project," Al-Roumi said.
</P>
<P>
The effort in mounting control on Internet services in Kuwait
is amidst frequnt appeals in the country for checking influence
of western satellite channels on the young generation.
</P>
<P>
Fears over growing addiction to western channels via
satellite attracted much attention of the media in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heads of schools and parents interviewed by a local newspaper
recently said satellite channels influence the young generation
to the extent of forcing them to imitate the West in every aspect
of life even if they are contrary to their own culture and
tradition.
</P>
<P>
The effort is also being made against a recent Gulf Council
Cooperation agreement on joint efforts in fighting against
western media which they described as broadcasting false reports
about their countries.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Uganda Fail to Reach New Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry
said here today that Sudan and Uganda failed to reach any new
agreement in pulling back their troops 100 kilometers from the
common border.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were expected to sign the agreement at the end
of a quadrilateral ministerial meeting, which started here
Sunday and was participated by foreign ministers of Sudan,
Uganda, Iran and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the Tehran-initiated talks went on
till late Sunday night and provided the "right" atmosphere for
settling disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Sudan and Uganda stressed the need to
create "amicable and peaceful" atmosphere on borders of the two
countries and pledged to exercise self-restraint until the next
quadrilateral session scheduled to be held in the Ugandan capital
of Kampala in a month, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The four sides also stressed the need to maintain the present
status quo and refrain from any measure which may endanger the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers asked expert teams to draft
the final statement on the basis of the agreements reached.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress in the negotiation, the main problem for
the peaceful settlement of dispute still remains. Sudan and
Uganda are still accusing each other of supporting rebels of the
other side.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995, after accusing Khartoum of supporting rebels in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Eria Kategaya, first deputy prime minister and foreign
minister of Uganda, told Xinhua "Sudan should first withdraw the
troops, stop any intrusion into Uganda and stop military training
of the rebels they supported against us."
</P>
<P>
However, he said at the meeting that his country wants peace
and tranquility with Sudan while claiming no any ambition for
other country's territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda would take practical gesture to implement
the agreement and like to see something meaningful from the
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Taha said that his country
attaches great importance to the settlement of the differences
between Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken practical measures to implement the agreement
in order to bring out security and peace between the two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
In October, Sudan and Uganda signed an agreement to normalize
their relations following mediation by Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani during his trip to Africa in September.

<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The international community is launching timid diplomatic
initiative when facing the human tragedy in east Zaire, where more
than 1 million refugees were abandoned to their own fate after the
international humanitarian groups fled the region last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exodus of the refugees is now continuing in eastern Zaire,
and the absence of infrastructures and food makes one believe that
a real human disaster is breaking out.
</P>
<P>
-- Looters are now ruling the Zairean city of Goma after
international humanitarian groups withdrew from the city. Naked
but armed, and singing songs praising death which they don't fear,
these looters have ransacked everything they want. Sometimes they
fire at the Rwandan troops at the border, and then flee with
unbelievable speed on trucks.
</P>
<P>
-- It is impossible for a humanitarian rescue operation to
succeed in saving more than 1 million refugees. With states, the
United Nations and non-governmental organizations combined, the
international community appears impotent to rescue 1.2 million
Hutu refugees, who are driven from their camps in eastern Zaire,
as well as hundreds of thousands of Zairean civilians thrown on
the road by fierce fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Sunday became
the first one to dispatch humanitarian aid to the 1.2 million
refugees in eastern Zaire facing the biggest human disaster ever
to be seen in history. A UNICEF plane carrying 30 tons of medical
products from Copenhagen will arrive in Kampala, Uganda, today.
</P>
<P>
The United States will send satellite photos taken above
eastern Zaire to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
to let it locate the 1.2 refugees.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Losing Speaker Candidate Files Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A losing candidate in
Kuwaiti parliament speakership battle had submitted a memorandum
to the National Assembly Sunday, challenging the Speaker's
election results and demanded the case be sent to the
Constitutional Court, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the eighth Kuwaiti elected parliament
on October 20, Jassem Al-Khorafi, a former member of parliament
(MP) and finance minister, lost the speakership election to Ahmad
Al-Saadoun, the Speaker for the two former terms, by a narrow one
vote of 29 to 30, with one abstention and Prime Minister Crown
Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah not being
present.
</P>
<P>
Khorafi raised opposition right after the result was declared
in the parliament session on grounds that Saadoun did not win the
majority of the 61 votes required to take up the post in
accordance with the Kuwaiti Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He insisted in his memorandum that Saadoun's election was
unconstitutional as it violated a number of clauses.
</P>
<P>
He asked the National Assembly to declare Saadoun's election
as "null and void" and to request the Constitutional Court to
explain and interpret the Constitution's articles pertaining to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Khorafi said it is evident that Saadoun did not obtain the
necessary votes to win by absolute majority, adding that he
needed to secure at least 31 votes from the 61 members including
the 50 MPs and cabinet members who also have the right to vote in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But constitutional experts said that the election was valid
based on the internal charter of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Khorafi challenges the application of the charter, insisting
that the constitution is far more supreme than any law or
charter including the National Assembly charter.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Kuwaiti parliament is likely to discuss the
issue when it reconvenes on November 19.
</P>
<P>
The parliament can refer it to its legal and legislative
committee after a brief debate or may decide to send it to the
Constitutional Court or rejected it all together, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the only country in the Gulf region that has an
elected parliament.
</P>
<P>
Male voters in the country elected the 50-seat all male
National Assembly on October 7. Women do not have the right to
vote or to be voted in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe, Mahathir Slam Western Countries for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe President Robert
Mugabe and Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamad have strongly
castigated western countries for trying to interfere with the
controversial multi-billion Dollar deal signed between them.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Mahathir condemned the western countries, which
they did not name, for trying to run the affairs of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Britain and the United States have commented on
the YTL contract, saying there was need for transparency in
inviting tenders.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted for heads of state and government to the
sixth G-15 Summit, the two leaders said developed countries
should stop interfering with the affairs of developing states.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Zimbabwe would continue to cooperate with other
countries from the south, despite protests from the developed
states whose main aim he said was to continue to dominate the
economies of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal worth 600 million U.S. Dollars, YTL will buy 51
percent shareholding of Hwange which supplies Zimbabwe with more
than 50 percent of its power needs.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mahathir, who is the incoming Chairman of G-15,
said western countries had no right to question Zimbabwe's
decision to sign the deal with YTL.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir asked why the developing countries should continue to
allow the western states to make money from their resources and
services instead of promoting trade among themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that at the next meeting in Kualar Lumpur in
1997 more heads of state and government would attend the meeting
to show their commitment to south-south cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Reportedly Requests Syria, Iran to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has requested Syria and Iran to help prevent
the extremist Islamic Jihad from attacking Israel, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post quoted diplomatic
sources as saying that the messages were sent through the
U.S. and Germany over the weekend following intelligence reports
of possible terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Netanyahu urgently summoned U.S. Ambassador Martin
Indyk to ask him to pass on the message to Damascus, apparently
via U.S. Ambassador to Syria Christopher Ross, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that Netanyahu transmitted a similar request to
Iran via Germany, which has close ties with Teheran. It was
still unclear whether the message was sent through diplomatic
channels or directly to Chancellor Helmut Kohl' intelligence
adviser Bernard Schmidbauer, who has been dealing with Iran on
sensitive intelligence issues.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot reported that Kohl promised
to help press Iran to check terror attacks and had dispatched
Schmidbauer to Beirut of Lebanon. Another Hebrew evening daily
Ma'ariv added that Israel had also warned Libya not to support
the anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu charged Sunday that "outside forces" were involved
in planning terrorist attacks against Israel, adding Israel was
making both security and diplomatic efforts to thwart the
attacks. But he declined to name the foreign elements.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Netanyahu deliberately did not name the
foreign sponsors, so as to avoid inflaming an already tense
situation with Syria, which in recent months redeployed troops
near Israeli border, fueling speculation of a possible military
attack.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli militant Islamic Jihad reportedly tried to
launch terrorist attacks in October to mark the alleged murder
of its leader Fathi Shkaki in Malta a year ago. But the security
alert in Israel has so far succeeded in preventing such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been working on emergency
footing since last month. Israel has reimposed the full closure
on the Palestinian autonomous areas in order to prevent the
infiltration of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, roadblocks were set up in the entrances to major
cities across the countries to increase security checks,
creating heavy traffic jams that cost the economy an estimated
16 million U.S. dollars a day. The security alert was eased
today, but the police maintained high vigilance.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Jihad, which is responsible for many attacks
inside Israel, has an office in Damascus, which was headed by
Shkaki before his assassination last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television reported Netanyahu convened the security
establishement Sunday night to discuss the measures being taken,
and approved their continued implementation.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to continue beefing up security
presence at shopping malls, bus stations, and other crowded
public areas. It also called for the public's understanding of
the discomfort caused by the security measures.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Develops Rice Strains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese farmers are trying
their best to develop rice strains for better harvests and have
achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's 'green' revolution started as early as the late 1960s
with many short-term and high-yielding rice strains imported from
the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) for use in the
early 1970s such as IR5, IR8, IR22, etc, according to a Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) report.
</P>
<P>
In parallel with imports of rice seeds, new varieties were
produced after the cross-breeding of imported and local rice seeds
and the hybrid strains have been made suitable to Vietnam's
farmland, ecological and climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has encouraged the production of
high-yielding rice seeds through scientific and technical
development programmes such as programme 02-01 in 1981-1985, the
foodstuff and food crops programme in 1986-1990, and the food crop
programme (kno1) in 1990-1995.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in the 1960s a group of 1,800 varieties was
selected for studies in northern Vietnam and since 1975 when the
country was reunified, more than 5,000 local and imported rice
strains have been crossbred. Particularly, in the 1991-95 period,
77 new rice strains were put into production, including 50
high-yielding strains.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the hybrid seeds, rice yield per crop increased from
2.12 tonnes/ha in 1975 to 2.85 tonnes/ha in 1985 and 3.62
tonnes/ha last year. This also helped vietnam to raise food
output from 11.82 million tonnes in 1976 to 15.8 million tonnes in
1985 and 27.5 million tonnes in 1995. This year, Vietnam is
expected to produce more than 28 million tonnes of food
grain.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Nine civilians were killed and
16 others seriously injured in a Kony rebel ambush in Northern
Uganda, "the New Vision" paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to colonel james Kazini, the commander of fourth
division of Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), the ambush
took place last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had planned to blow up the bridge at Kamura Fall,
some 220 kilometers north of Kampala, but their plan was foiled
by a nearby detachment, Kazini told a news conference yesterday
in Gulu, northern Uganda, showing a walkie-talkie communication
system captured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The ambush happened shortly after more than 200 UPDF soldiers
stationed at Kamura had escorted a convoy of nearly 100 vehicles
from Kamura, the colonel explained.
</P>
<P>
In another development, kony rebels have intensified their
harassments on civilians seeking protection from UPDF and
civilian camps established by authorities, and killed a certain
number of people, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls for Political and Social Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A Vietnamese newspaper 'People's
Army ' carried a commentary today calling for vigilance against
hostile forces and safeguarding the social and political stability.
</P>
<P>
The commentary elaborated the various means of sabotage and
pointed out that peaceful evolution might be conducted by
imperialists and hostile forces in Vietnam. "The peaceful
evolution and anti-peaceful evolution is the major forms of class
struggle and national struggle," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The commentary added that political stability is the basic
condition for economic development. It called on every member of
the party, the army to strengthen the defence against the 'schemes
and intrigues of the enemies.'
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the whole party, the whole army and the entire
people should heighten the vigilance against the 'peaceful
evolution' and 'the plots of conterrevolutionary rebellion.'
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the armed forces in Vietnam should play an
important role in the 'sharp struggles' in a bid to 'safeguard the
party, the state and the people as well as the socialist system
and revolutionary fruits.'

Helping each other is another important characteristic of
Heping District.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, 13 residents of Xinxing Street set up the country's
first voluntary community service association, and the district
now has a community service network that consists of 12 volunteer
associations and 256 branches in all neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Heping help each other with simple daily problems
like hair cuts, taking care of senior citizens and children and
repairing electrical appliances or gas ovens, and doing sewing.
</P>
<P>
Auntie Shen Zhimen, who lives at No. 13 Xinheli on Xinxing
Street believes "You help me, I help you, that's the way for
promoting ethical and cultural progress."
</P>
<P>
She showed Xinhua reporters a wooden plaque on the front of her
building that writes each household's special skill, and said: "I
myself am old and do not have any skill. However, I have enough
time to take care the children of my neighbors."
</P>
<P>
These days, over 80 percent of the buildings in Heping have
these wooden plaques, and Auntie Shen is only one of the tens of
thousands of volunteers in the district.
</P>
<P>
On Xinxing Street, most of the 6,000 old men and women are
reluctant to go barber shops or beauty parlors because the cost is
just too high, but those residents who know how to cut hair have
been offering to provide the service for the old folks over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Auntie Yu Shuhua is too old to do heavy housework, so her
neighbor Wang Xuedong does the work for her while the old woman
takes care of his children in exchange.
</P>
<P>
That is a quite normal instance of mutual-help in the
neighborhood.

XI'AN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The tree coverage rate in Yan'an,
on the Loess Plateau in the northwest China's Shaanxi province,
has reached almost 43 percent, a level higher than the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an Prefecture, characterized by hills and valleys, has long
suffered from scarcity of rain and severe water and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by the local government and residents, the
environment in the prefecture has been improved through the tree
planting drive.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the forest acreage in the area has
increased to 1.8 million hectares, including 170,000 ha of
economic forest, from just 530,000 ha in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bases for apricots, dates, apples, hawthorn and
Chinese prickly ash, have been set up.
</P>
<P>
During the large-scale afforestation, the local government has
helped residents use advanced technologies to raise the survival
rate of the trees to 85 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's most famous and
brilliant pop singers will give two performances in Beijing this
weekend to celebrate their achievements.
</P>
<P>
The event will look back at the evolution of China's modern pop
industry in the past ten years, and give audiences an idea how it
will develop in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Light music and rock'n'roll were banned in the Cultural
Revolution (1966-76) and regarded as capitalist elements to poison
the Chinese people. But they staged a comeback after the country's
reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, entertaining the masses
of people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the sector has been grown into an industry
that generates huge profits every year, and has frequent exchanges
with foreign music circles.
</P>
<P>
Because so many singers are interested in the event, the
organizers are staging two concerts to allow everyone to have a
chance of taking part.

<HEADLINE> Central China County Becomes Major Medicinal Materials Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A central China county, which
boasts over 1,300 wild medicinal plants and herbs, has become one
of the major medicinal materials production bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Xixia County, in central China's Henan Province, produces
580,000 kilograms of medicinal cornel each year, accounting for
one-third of the country's total. The county's production of
gastrodia, honeysuckle, Chinese thorowax and the root of
balloonflower, all rank the first among all China's counties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 the per capita income from
medicinal material-related industries in the county increased by
280 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county has placed great importance on the development of
medicinal materials. The acreage of medicinal materials has
expanded by 58,800 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The county now has more than 11,000 households which are
engaged in production of Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
To make good use of its medicinal material resources, the
county has established a Chinese medicinal material processing
factory, and a firm which produces medicinal wine. Both operations
have scored good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Xixia County's rich medicinal materials have attracted more
than 15,000 medicine business people each year.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the county introduced
140 million yuan in foreign investment to boost its economy.

<P>
The district has commended seven groups of model community
service volunteers in the past seven years, and awarded 13 people
the title of "Honorary Volunteer Model", and 140 the title of
"Model Volunteer."
</P>
<P>
Volunteers in the district did meet with some troubles that
touched off a discussion "the meaning of devotion."
</P>
<P>
One engineer repaired over 100 electrical applicances for
neighbors in a year. The trouble was that he could not afford to
pay for the spare parts and wondered whether he should get
reimbursed for the spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Dong Haoran, secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, said he believed that the spirit will never be
out-of-date, but that in the new situation, both selfless devotion
without regard for personal interests and giving consideration to
others and one's personal interest at the same time should be
advocated.
</P>
<P>
The district's residents have now reached a consensus that
devotion is not a one-way street, but that it involves two
persons, and that a volunteer could benefit from others' help at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
They believe that one should do what he can for others and that
there is a distinction between advanced volunteer workers and
ordinary workers.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary community service association in the district
stipulates that each volunteer should have a fixed amount of free
service, and that he can receive a certain amount of money for his
services. Low service fees and paid service should be promoted.
</P>
<P>
The regulation meets residents' needs for community service and
avoids economic loss for volunteers as well, encouraging them to
provide more services for others.

SOFIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Bulgarian president
Petar Stoyanov pledged today to unite all the political parties to
work for the country's economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the president of all Bulgarians," Stoyanov said
when he announced victory in a news conference late in the day.
</P>
<P>
He will no longer represent any political party from now on but
will represent the whole of Bulgaria, Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old former lawyer, candidate of the United
Democratic Force (UDF), won around 60 percent of the votes cast in
Sunday's presidential election run-off.
</P>
<P>
His rival Ivan Marazov of the governing Socialist Party scored
only 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov was born on May 25, 1952 in Plovdiv, the second
largest city of Bulgaria, and studied law at Sofia University. He
worked as a lawyer for 15 years in Plovdiv and became deputy
justice minister in the first UDF government from 1991 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
After 1993, he entered the UDF leadership and was elected the
opposition presidential candidate in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
He is married with two children. His wife, Antonina, is a
diplomat at the Bulgarian embassy in London.

<HEADLINE> US Company Westinghouse Keen on China's Nuclear Energy Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Sino-US relationship has dramatically improved over the
past six months," Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
He added that although he has not participated in the
negotiations, "prospects are good, because there are mutual
interests leading toward the ratification" of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement has yet to be ratified, Harvey said
Westinghouse desires to become a world-class supplier of nuclear
power plant systems and components to China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the US company has faced heavy competition
from French, Canadian and British rivals, such as Framotome,
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, in Qinshan, and the Daya Bay
nuclear power projects.
</P>
<P>
"As the father of the pressurized water reactor technology, we
are not afraid of fair competition," Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China's installed capacity of nuclear power will rise
from the current 2.1 million kilowatts to more than 20 million
kilowatts, and Westinghouse will make full preparations during the
2001-2005 period, Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse has established eight joint ventures in China,
with a total investment of 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Harvey said Westinghouse manufacturing technology will be used
to produce steam generators and turbine generators for the Qinshan
II Project.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, five CNNC engineers worked with Westinghouse
to study nuclear power technology. Recently, six additional CNNC
engineers were selected to participate in a design program in the
United States.

<P>
CHENGDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- US-based Westinghouse Electric
Corporation is eager to win from China's nuclear energy market
contracts which could be worth tens of billions of US dollars in
the next century, according to an official with the China National
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Westinghouse has expanded cooperation
with the Nuclear Power Institute of China of the CNNC for the
joint development of the "CAP600" -- a new-generation nuclear
power plant.
</P>
<P>
"CAP600," an advanced pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear
power plant, is believed to be 100 times safer than the
traditional plants, will cost 20 percent less, and have more
simplified equipment.
</P>
<P>
But Sino-US cooperation in nuclear energy development has yet
to enter a substantial stage, said Li Donghui, deputy general
director of CNNC's International Cooperation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the US government will display a sincere attitude
toward future cooperation, so that American and Chinese companies
can work smoothly together on a normal, healthy basis.
</P>
<P>
So far, the US government has not ratified the Peaceful Uses of
Nuclear Energy Agreement signed by China and the United States in
1985, which imposes legal restrictions on exports of certain items
of hardware and software by Westinghouse to China's nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
During a recent seminar held here, Dr. Francis J. Harvey, Chief
Operating Officer of Westinghouse's Industries and Technology,
said he wished for a fully-ratified agreement, as it benefits both
sides.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, there won't be any barriers to the commercial
cooperation in nuclear power development, Dr. Harvey told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the agreement are still underway. In late
October, the US and China held a new round of talk in Washington
to discuss this issue, Li revealed.

Dong Chunfu, director of the Working Office of Heping District,
said that each year the office conducts a survey among the
district's 15,000 households, in which each individual has to
answer questions about the kind of service he or she can offer to
others and what sort of help he or she needs most.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the office's staff have an overall understanding
of what the district's residents need most, and then they set out
to meet their needs in accordance with the list they made from the
survey.
</P>
<P>
"That explains why we can make the achievements we score at the

The choice of the "Top Ten Public Servants," the campaign of

</P>
<P>
The district's education centers have taken the responsibility
of offering training classes to different groups of people, from
the elderly to newly-weds and teenagers to displaced workers and
recently-released prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 2,000 retired officials, intellectuals, and
celebrities in the district have organized a large lecture group
to cover such subjects as foreign languages, the law, taxes, and
the way to be a good father or mother.
</P>
<P>
An official in the district government said that since the
beginning of the year, the district has spent 15 million yuan
enlarging and renovating the district's libraries, cinemas, and
children's museums.
</P>
<P>
The district's 15 theatrical troupes have been competing with

contests to humorous performances. The results of their work can

<HEADLINE> First Yugoslav Multi-party Elections End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The first parliament elections
in Yugoslavia since the settlement of the former Yugoslav crisis a
year ago ended Sunday evening after about 11,000 polling stations
in all 36 election constituencies closed at 8 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial and incomplete figures, 61 percent of
nearly 7.6 million eligible Yugoslav voters showed up in polling
stations Sunday to choose federal and municipal parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav federal elections commission member Milovan Zivkovic
said about 67 percent of the registered voters had come to the
polls in Montenegro and about 59 percent in Serbia, according to
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Zivkovic said the turnout of voters was satisfactory under
international norms.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's voting was the third parliament elections since Serbia
and Montenegro formed the rump Yugoslavia in April 1992, but the
first regular multi-party ones for the Yugoslav Parliament's Lower
House.
</P>
<P>
Deputies for the Yugoslav Parliament's Upper House are chosen
by the assemblies of Serbia and Montenegro in an equal ratio of 20
seats for each.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the turnout of voters in Serbia was smaller
because ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo
boycotted the voting for deputies in federal parliament, Zivkovic
explained.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight foreign observers from the United States and other
states from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) visited some of the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
The elections commission will announce the complete data for
all 36 election constituencies Monday afternoon, but official
results will not be due until November 7.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts and opinion polls indicated that Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Sociallist Party of Serbia
and two allied parties are expected to win a majority against an
opposition coalition.

Aliyev reiterated Sunday in the capital of Baku that the
Nagorno-Karabakh area is an inalienable part of the country.

Azerbaijan wants to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue by

independent or become part of Armenia, the Interfax news agency
quoted Aliyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president also criticized the vague attitude of the Minsk
Group, which has been mediating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
under the auspices of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Finland is the head of the group.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia reached a ceasefire agreement in May
1994 after six years of war triggered by the independence
announcement of the Nagorno-Karabakh area, whose population is
mainly Armenian ethnics.

<HEADLINE> Search Begins for Thailand's True Export Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A study will be made to
"correct" export figures of Thailand for this year and 1995, the
local newspaper Bangkok Post reported today, quoting Finance
Minister Chaiyawat Vibulsawasdi.
</P>
<P>
As exports for the first eight months of this year had grown by
only 2.4 percent, compared with 23 percent for the same period of
last year, the Economic Stability and Security Policy Committee
believes the 1995 figures may have been swelled by false claims
for tax refunds on exports, Chaiyawat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A committee would be set up to study both sets of figures and
try to find the truth, he said. The committee would be chaired by
Comchai Richupan, director-general of the Fiscal Policy Office,
with representatives of the Bank of Thailand and the Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat said that it was necessary to correct the records.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges Not to Ask for Debt Rescheduling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will unlikely ask
donor countries to reschedule its foreign debts, a move that could
cause much trouble to the economy, a senior government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki Usman, head of the Financial and Monetary Analysis Unit
of the Finance Ministry, said in Yogjakarta, Central Java, Sunday
that such a request would also reduce donor countries' confidence
in Indonesia, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Usman said that in the investment sector, a request for debt
rescheduling would have a far-reaching impact on the attainment of
high economic growth and the creation of job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In the short run, he added, it would cause prospective
investors to cancel their investment applications, thus worsening
the economy because creditors would be reluctant to give loans to
the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Intensifying domestic economic activities and improving the
competitive edge of export products would be far better than
rescheduling the foreign debts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, Indonesia's foreign debt
has passed the psychological level of 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's debt service ratio stood at 20 percent in fiscal
1995/1996 which ended last March 31.
</P>
<P>
Usman said the government was continuing its efforts to keep
the ratio down by boosting non-oil and non-gas exports.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Carry Out Employment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is soon
to implement a new employment-promotion program which is expected
to provide jobs to thousands of people during the current fiscal
year starting last July.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official said today that the program,
approved by the cabinet last week, puts stress not only on
acquiring skills but also on providing opportunities by launching
income-generating enterprises for trained hands.
</P>
<P>
A national commission under the prime minister will be formed
for the implementation of the program while a five-member
executive body will be directly responsible for running the
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the previous employment-generation activities in Nepal
failed as the trained manpower could do little without proper
credit facilities, marketing and support from the government and
the private sector, the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Committees will also be formed in each district and village to
promote employment-generation activities on the local level, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The new employment-promotion program will cover four areas
including skill development, agriculture, education and
miscellany.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Hold Talks With U.S. on Textile Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai trade officials will hold
talks later this week with U.S. representatives to seek
compensation for fabric export quotas cut by the U.S. side,
according to a Thai Commerce Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Effective on July 1 this year, U.S. authorities cut fabric
export quotas for Thailand after they found that shipment of
processed textiles from the European Union (EU) used fabric from
Thailand as the raw material.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous U.S. rules, the country which added other
finishing processes, such as printing and dying, was considered
the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
But under the new rules, the U.S. concludes that Thailand is
the country of origin because Thai fabric is used in the EU's
exported textile products.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand accepts the new U.S. rules, it will effectively
lose its U.S. quota, as part of Thailand's quota will be included
under the EU quota.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Commerce Ministry source argued that the country which
adds other finishing processes to Thai fabric should be declared
the country of origin of products exported to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Thailand will seek compensation for the damage
caused by the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
Unless the talks scheduled for November 7-8 produce results,
Thailand will raise the issue with the World Trade Organization
(WTO)'s textile monitoring body, a move Thailand hopes would lead
to the abolition of the U.S. rules of origin, the Thai Commerce
Ministry official said.

<HEADLINE> Vehicles Cause More Pollution in Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 percent of
pollution in New Delhi, capital of India, is caused by vehicles on
the roads.
</P>
<P>
In their book "Slow Murder the Deadly Story of Vehicular
Pollution in India," two researchers of the Center of Science and
Environment, Awing Sharma and Amunita Roychaudhary, said that
vehicular pollution in the capital is slowly poisoning the
residents in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The book identifies four major causes for vehicular pollution
in the country's cities --- outdated vehicle technology and
unwillingness on part of the automobile industry to accept
emission standards, bad fuel quality, poor traffic management and
planning, and poor maintenance of existing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Two-stroke vehicles, which are based on poor technology, are
among the most inefficient fuel burning engines that cause more
pollution. Two wheelers comprise 65 percent of the country's total
vehicular population and 69 percent of Delhi's, the book says.
</P>
<P>
Roads in cities are overcrowded with motor vehicles as there is
no proper public transport system. This encourages people to buy
personal vehicles, which worsens the emission situation as motors
emit more when they move at a slow speed, the book further says.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bank to Cool Down Overheated Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank has issued an
edict for the banks to stop disbursing loans against share
certificates in a bid to cool down the overheated capital market,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the directive to stop advance to the
borrowers against share certificates was a temporary measure to
contain the stock market which has been wild bull for the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
As per the earlier provision, the banks sanctioned loans to the
tune of 40 percent of the average market price of shares. Anybody
can take the loan by keeping his share certificates with the
banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank circular followed a comment by Governor
Khorshed Alam, who said it should be investigated where the huge
money is coming from.
</P>
<P>
The two stock markets of Bangladesh have been witnessing an
extraordinary boom for the last few months as prices of many of
the scrips have skyrocketed without adequate backing from the
company fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The All Share Price index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, the main
bourse of Bangladesh, jumped to 2986.29 points as on October 31,
from 959.05 on June 30 this year. The index on Sunday further
climbed up to 3352.10 points after two trading days.
</P>
<P>
The action of the Bangladesh bank, however, is seen by some
stock analysts as a step which would leave a "very little" impact
on the businesses in the buoyant capital market.
</P>
<P>
"The advance from the banks to the borrowers against share
certificates is not significant," said a stock commentator, adding
that most of the investors in the capital market purchase shares
with their own money.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Power Industry Develops Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Wind, water and sunshine have
joined forces to help the Tibet Autonomous Region score marked
achievements in developing a local power industry.
</P>
<P>
Geological survey shows that Tibet lacks coal and petroleum
resources, but has rich hydro-power, geothermal and solar energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the region now has built some 500 small
hydropower stations, with a total generating capacity of 150,000
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Another 15 hydropower projects, now being undertaken, will add
30,000 kilowatts to the region's total generating capacity when
completed. The projects will also raise the region's annual
electricity production by 166 million kilowatt-hours.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has more than 600 geothermal energy resources sites. The
potential of geothermal power generation stands at 800,000
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Ninety kilometers away from the regional capital of Lhasa, the
Yangbajain Geothermal Power Station, the country's largest, went
into operation in 1988. The stations supplies 50 million
kilowatt-hours of electricity to Lhasa annually.
</P>
<P>
More foreigners have invested in the development of Tibet's
geothermal resources, with the total amount reaching nine million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the 1990s, Tibet has made a success in using
solar energy to generate electricity. In recent years, the region
has built solar energy greenhouses with a total floor space of
more than 50,000 square meters and solar houses with a total floor
space of over 40,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Tibet also has built more than 4,000 square meters of solar
energy water heaters and over 4,000 sets of photo-electric lamps.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 wind-power generators, with a combined capacity
of 100 kilowatts, have been installed in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> US Power Company Wants to Invest in Nepal for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The American power company
Enron Corp. is considering to invest in Nepal's hydro power sector
and export electricity to China, Nepal's northern neighbor,
senior officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would be a breakthrough for the development of the
abundant water resources in Nepal which so far had seen its
southern neighbor India as the only market for its surplus hydro
power, they said.
</P>
<P>
Enron Corp. last month put forth a 9-billion-US dollar proposal
to the Nepali government outlining its intention to invest two
major hydro power projects in the country on
build-own-operate-transfer (BOTT) basis, the officials was quoted
by a local newspaper as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The American power conglomerate expects to spend 800 million
dollars of that amount on the 402-megawatt Arun project in eastern
Nepal with the rest going to West Nepal's Karnali project with a
generating capacity between 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that an expert committee of the Water Resources
Ministry is studying the proposal of the American company.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to sling high-voltage transmission lines
across the Himalayas and link up with the nearest power grid in
Chengdu of Southwest China's Sichuan province, about 2,500 km away
from Nepal, a Nepali expert said.
</P>
<P>
Of the over 8 billion dollars earmarked for the Karnali
project, Enron plans to spend two billion dollars to build the
transmission lines to China, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, private water resources experts here have questioned
the economic feasibility of the Enron proposal, citing the
difficulties of slinging power lines across the Himalayas, the far
distance between Nepal and inland China and the rapid power sector
development in China.

<HEADLINE> Key Research Projects Promote China's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Key projects to tackle problems
in scientific research have helped promote China's China's
economic growth over the past five years, according to a senior
government official.
</P>
<P>
The overseas edition of today's People's Daily quoted State
Science and Technology Commission Vice-Minister Deng Nan as saying
that the projects undertaken in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995) reported greater progress in programming, scales and
economic returns than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1991 to meet the needs of China's economic
construction, the projects focused on nine technological sectors,
including agriculture, use and development of natural resources,
energy, major equipment, transport, raw materials,
high-techonology, the light industry, textiles and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that a total of 180 key projects were planned during
the period, with investment totaling more than nine billion yuan,
compared with 76 projects and an investment of 6.76 billion yuan
in the Seventh Five Year-Plan period (1986-1990).
</P>
<P>
She added that some 60,000 research findings were applied to
production, with accumulated economic returns topping 60 billion
yuan in the past five years, compared with 10,000 findings and 40
billion yuan in the previous period.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 percent of the 60,000 findings met advanced
world standards, with 5,000 made in new products and new
techniques.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, she said, a total of 473 new strains of grain,
cash crops and vegetables were applied, with an increase of
more than 30 million tons in China's grain production and the
farmers' income doubled in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, breakthroughs were
also made in railway transportation and optical fiber
telecommunications, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some projects for 600,000-kilowatt thermal generators,
500,000-volt AC transformers and two-million-watt low temperature
nuclear reactors have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Achievements have also been made in high-tech for coal and oil
exploration, and the petrochemical and metallurgical industries,
Deng said.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party to Review Support to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Congress Party's highest
policy-making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), will
meet here today to review its support to the United Front (UF)
government and discuss other related issues, Congress sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The UF government has refused to support Congress Party's woman
candidate Mayawati for the chief ministership of Uttar Pradesh,
where president's rule has been reimposed recently since no
political party won a clear majority in the state assembly
elections last month.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party high command has been under tremendous
pressure from Uttar Pradesh's Congress Committee to withdraw
support to the UF government. The UF, which holds a minority of
seats in parliament, formed the central government by relying on
the Congress Party's support.
</P>
<P>
The Congress rejects the re-imposition of president's rule in
Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The CWC would also review the policies of the UF government on
other issues including economic reforms and foreign policy. Some
senior Congress leaders have expressed their unhappiness over the
government's handling of economic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party is reportedly divided on whether to continue
to support the UF government.
</P>
<P>
While former union minister Rajesh Pilot and former Maharashtra
state Chief Minister Sharad Pawar were in favor of continuing the
party's support at this stage, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee
President Jitendra Prasada and some other CWC members maintained
that the party should not compromise on Mayawati.

<HEADLINE> Foreman, Morrison May Fight Next February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Talks are afoot to match
heavyweight legend George Foreman against HIV-infected Tommy
Morrison in Australia next February.
</P>
<P>
In a bout in June 1993, Morrison beat Foreman by unanimous
decision and captured a vacant World Boxing Organisation (WBO)
title.
</P>
<P>
47-year-old Foreman defeated fellow American Crawford Grimsley
to defend the heavyweight title of the World Boxing Union (WBU)
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
27-year-old Morrison floored American Marcus Rhode three times
in 98 seconds in the first round on the same day here.
</P>
<P>
The fight would have been stopped if Morrison had suffered
uncontrollable bleeding, as a step to prevent HIV infection by
blood.
</P>
<P>
Morrison had retired from boxing in February when he tested
positive for the virus which can cause Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrone (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
But he announced his comeback last month to raise funds for his
foundation aimed at better treatment for children with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said after the match that he wanted to fight Foreman
again "if the opportunity presents itself."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would take on Morrison, Foreman vowed to "fight
anybody, anywhere, anytime for a certain amount of money."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reforms Municipality-owned Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's municipal
government is to hand over control of hundreds of small
municipality-owned enterprises. They are to be run instead by
their local districts or counties.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the measure shows the municipal government's
determination to concentrate more energy on the development of
large-sized enterprises and groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city has 1,203 small enterprises,
directly administrated by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
However, most of these enterprises have fallen behind in
economic reform, due to problems in administration structures, and
are trapped by poor economic performances.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government decided to switch these small
enterprises to direct administration by their local district or
county governments. It is seen as a way of pushing them into
facing market competition.
</P>
<P>
The first group of small enterprises to be turned over to
administration by local districts or counties instead of municipal
government, belong to Shanghai Light Industry Group.
</P>
<P>
The 52 small enterprises, together with 26,000 employees and
870 million yuan's (about 105 million US dollars) worth of assets,
have been put under the control of Hongkou, Luwan and Minhang
districts.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipal government's plan, 200 small light
industry enterprises will be reassigned to local districts and
counties this year, and the rest of the city's small enterprises
are to be treated in the same way next year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that after then, the city will focus on the
running of several enterprise groups to make them more competitive
in both domestic and overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> Moi Urges Mandela to Stop Arms Sale to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has made a plea to South Africa to suspend arms sale to
Rwanda until its troops are withdrawn from eastern Zaire, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone discussion with South African President Nelson
Mandela, Moi noted that arms sale to Rwanda would forestall a
possible escalation of fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader pointed out that the situation in Central
Africa would be reviewed at a regional summit to be held in
Nairobi on Tuesday and he promised to brief Mandela on the
outcome of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper quoted Mandela as saying
in Pretoria last Friday that the Tutsi-dominated army is entitled
to defend their country from incursions by Hutu rebels based in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The raging battle in eastern Zaire pits Zaire's national army
and allied Rwandan Hutu fighters against armed Tutsi rebels in
Kivu provinces adjacent to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses Rwandan troops of taking part in the fight
in eastern Zaire which Rwanda has denied.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Holds First Post-Balkan War Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia held its first
federal and municipal elections on Sunday since the end of
four-year Bosnian war, and the current ruling alliance is forecast
to win.
</P>
<P>
As many as 61 percent of the 7.6 million voters from Serbia and
Montenegro, the two remaining Yugoslav republics, cast their
ballots in the 36 voting constituencies to elect the members of
both federal Citizen Chamber and municipal councils, as well as
the Vojvodina Autonomous Province Parliament and the Montenegro
Republic Assembly, the federal election committee said.
</P>
<P>
The elections, which are also the first time since the United
Nations lifted the economic sanctions on rump Yugoslavia this
year, are very important to the future of Yugoslavia, according to
President Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of ruling Socialist Party
of Serbia (SPS).
</P>
<P>
"I am certain the elections are of great significance for the
stability of the whole (Balkan) region," Milosevic told reporters
after voting in the capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time for Yugoslav people to elect their
parliament members directly since the former Yugoslavia
disintegrated in April 1992. The SPS, with its coalition, won the
first two elections held in December 1992 and February 1993
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The federal election committee will announce the outcome in
three days.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Finance Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Finance
Minister Professor Simon Mbilinyi has resigned, after President
Benjamin Mkapa accepted his resignation on Sunday, appointing
Daniel Yona to hold the portfolio on acting basis.
</P>
<P>
Yona is at present the Minister of State in the President's
Office (for planning) and vice-Chairman of the National Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mbilinyi tendered his resignation on Sunday in what was
described as a move to "strengthen solidarity in the (ruling)
party and the government".
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Dodoma, Central Tanzania, by the
president's press secretary Patrick Chokala said that Mbilinyi
was resigning to let state organs investigate allegations of
corruption levelled against him.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement reaching here today from Dodoma,
President Mkapa accepted the resignation with regrets, saying
Mbilinyi has done a commendable job since his appointment in
November, last year.
</P>
<P>
The president lauded Mbilinyi, saying he was instrumental in
the promotion of the government's capacity for self-reliance and
the restoration of donors' confidence in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said he was accepting the resignation on
"civil grounds" put forward by Mbilinyi.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister's resignation comes after several months
of speculations following a controversy on tax remissions
allegedly extended cooking-oil earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary probe committee was appointed to look into the
issues, following allegations of some 900 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 1.5 million U.S. Dollars) having been given out
as an inducement to the minister and some other top government
and the ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) officials to review the
taxes.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report by the team said there was circumstantial
evidence implicating Mbilinyi in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The probe team also implicated the minister in a taxation
scandal involving fish fillet exports from Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The report is scheduled to be tabled in the National Assembly
in Dodoma later this week.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Company Invests in Highway Construction in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Road King Infrastructure
Limited of Hong Kong will invest 316 million yuan in building
highways in Yulin City, southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The company has already spent 3.5 billion yuan undertaking 13
road construction projects in interior areas of the mainland,
including the construction of expressways in Shenzhen and
Guangzhou cities, as well as in Jiangsu Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between the Hong Kong company
and Yulin City government, the money will finance the construction
of 65.36 km of highways in Yulin, which actually costs a total
investment of 452.7 million yuan. The remaining part of 136.7
million yuan will be met by Yulin City.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that on completion of the highways,
the Hong Kong partner will receive a certain percentage amount of
the vehicle tolls collected from the respective highways for a
period of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, which faces Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in the
east, and links to the western areas of China, has geographical
advantages with the impending return of Hong Kong to the embrace
of the motherland, and the completion of the Nanning-Kunming
Railway.
</P>
<P>
William Zen, Chairman of the Hong Kong company, has shown a
strong interest in constructing transport facilities in Guangxi
after on-the-spot investigations in Yulin. Included is the
building of a new expressway from Guangxi's capital of Nanning to
Guangzhou via Yulin.
</P>
<P>
Local officials pledged that with more inflow of investment
from Hong Kong, they would work fast with highway construction
around Yulin.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Urge Australia to End Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian opposition
leader Lim Kit Siang today called on Australia to take concrete
measures to end racial discrimination against Asians.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian members of parliament (MP) from all political
parties should take a common stand to demand that Australia do so,
Lim said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
He added that Australian Prime Minister John Howard should
also repudiate the anti-Asian speech of Queensland independent MP
Pauline Hanson in the Australian Parliament on September 10.
</P>
<P>
Lim noted that although the Australian Parliament passed a
motion last week opposing racism, Howard had aggravated the
situation by refusing to denounce Hanson's anti-Asian speech.
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that Howard has continued to ignore calls
that he must take a strong stand to condemn Hanson's anti-Asian
speech and outburst, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim also said the time has come for Asian governments to make
clear that they expected Howard to take concrete measures to end
the anti-Asian outburst in Australia.

<HEADLINE> ''Free Trade Must Be Really Free'': Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's leading daily ''the
Herald'' today slammed trade protectionism by developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary entitled ''free trade must be really free'',
the paper says, free trade benefits all parties, but it has to be
really free, not the sort of massaged version that the most
powerful developed economies seem keen to impose on everyone else
so they can keep their edge.
</P>
<P>
Added to this is the need to recognize that developing
countries might need help, in the form of short-term and modest
protection, to establish new industries or at least to sell the
goods they produce best on the world markets, it says.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the G-15 summit in Harare yesterday saw leaders
examining the problems of the new economic order inaugurated with
the world trade organization (WTO), it says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses, there are several problems that must bed
resolved, and resolved speedily, if free trade is to benefit all,
not just those who already have the money.
</P>
<P>
First is the problem of protectionism by advanced economies.
There is a deplorable desire, especially in election years, for
some highly developed countries to have their bread buttered on
both sides: open markets for their goods coupled with
protectionism for their less efficient industries, it says.
</P>
<P>
''So we get people demanding that the third world sells off
everything it has to those with the money, citizens and companies
of advanced economies, while quotas are imposed for everything
from beef to textiles that the third world can sell and desires
to sell,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
It points out non-tariff barriers are perhaps the easiest way
to protect relatively inefficient industries in the developed
world. Insisting on certain labor and environmental rules, for
example, has been tried.
</P>
<P>
At the same time commodity prices are manipulated to a greater
or lesser degree to keep prices of raw materials low for the more
industrialized. Throughout the 1980s, and even today, this was a
smart way to export inflation from the first world to the third
world. Economists talk about inflation being dead. Unfortunately
they are wrong, far too much inflation is unfairly shared through
the continually declining terms of trade imposed on the third
world by its major customers, it says.
</P>
<P>
It is also important to realize that new industries in the
third world need help to compete. Protectionism is one answer,
the one chosen by the U.S. when it was a developing nation
battling to compete with the European giants, it notes.
</P>
<P>
Among the analysis of the problems presented at the opening of
the Harare summit were calls for concrete programs that would
solve these. This is where the representative group of g-15
leaders have to lead. A common front to implement workable
solutions is required, the paper stresses.

NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from seven African
countries including Zaire, Uganda and Rwanda have confirmed that
they would attend the regional summit to be held here tomorrow,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Expected at the summit are leaders from Ethiopia, Cameroun,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, host Kenya, representatives of
the Organization of African Unity and the South African envoy to
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya-sponsored summit followed escalating fighting in
eastern Zaire with the interim Zairean parliament voting to sever
ties with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted government officials as saying that at the
top of the summit agenda would be Zaire's accusations that
Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army is fighting alongside the local
Zairean Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the regional leaders would impress upon
the Rwandan government to show restraint if it is true that
Rwandan troops are fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan Army Chief of Staff Sam Kaka said last
Saturday that his troops never deployed inside Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday summit is the only prominent diplomatic initiative
to seek ways to solve the deepening crisis in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fog Delays Airplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Capital International
Airport is operating normally today after a day of disruption
caused by a blanket of fog which carpeted the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The heavy fog delayed 47 incoming and 120 departing flights at
the Beijing airport on Sunday morning, leading to nearly 10,000
passengers being held up at the airport.
</P>
<P>
But sources said that the airport resumed normal operations in
the afternoon. And the drizzle today indicates circumstances are
still improving, though there is still light fog.
</P>
<P>
Early from 2:00 am yesterday, a heavy fog, starting in the
southeast suburbs, soon loomed over the whole of Beijing and
affected the normal operation of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The airport had to cancel all coming-in and out-going flights
until 11:40 am when the weather began to improve.
</P>
<P>
By 2:00 pm, most of the flights were operating normally again,
as the ground visibility improved.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts warn local residents of traffic safety problems
due to the drizzle and light fog today.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a fog at the airport also caused the
cancellation of all coming-in and out-going flights for a period
of time.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China has restored many
historical sites connected to Sun Yat-sen, the forerunner of the
Chinese democratic revolution, in his home province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The restoration work commemorates Sun's 130th birthday which
falls on November 11.
</P>
<P>
Workers have repaired the meeting place of the first national
congress of the Kuomintang, the party once led by Sun, which
played the leading role in overthrowing the rule of the Qing
dynasty in 1911.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the Republic of China was founded, and Sun
was elected temporary president.
</P>
<P>
Other sites include the Marshal Hall, uprising headquarters,
army academy, and Sun's former residence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese District Becomes Model For Community Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1980s, a number of the district's residents were
living in old housing, with sewage pipes that dated back to before
New China was founded in 1949. Some houses had no heating or
running water.
</P>
<P>
But when the district government built a pump station in the
southern part of the district and replaced old pipes, 100,000
people no longer had to worry about the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the district government began to set the task of doing
12 things for local residents every year that they most needed.
</P>
<P>
Han Jinhua, an official at the district waterworks, always
carries tools and a notebook with him. In the past decade, he has
visited all 256 residents committees in the district and filled 12
notebooks making notes on water supply conditions. He was
nicknamed "Water God" by local residents for having solved 100,000
people's problems.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lin, director of the District Natural Gas Station,
passed out three times from fatigue while working around the clock
so that local residents could have gas as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiangong, manager of the Coal Company, was called the
"Angel of Warmth" by local residents. He has personally seen that
several dozen tons of coal carried to residents' homes.
</P>
<P>
To promote socialist ethical and cultural progress, officials
must set an example first, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jiefangqiao Street used to be a troublesome place. To change
the situation, Gao Zhengshan, secretary of the District Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, worked 12 hours a day and didn't
rest on weekends or holidays.
</P>
<P>
He returned to work only three days after leaving hospital
after his left kidney was removed. He solved housing problems for
families, but his own four-member family still lives crowded into
an old two-room flat.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, residents-committee-run enterprises
repaid its debt of two million yuan and earned 3.1 million yuan in
profits last year.
</P>
<P>
"As for the problems we have, Gao Zhengshan has them too,"
local residents say. "But, as for Gao's conscientiousness, we have
none. We admire such cadres."

<P>
Gao is only one of a number of officials who are known and
respected by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Whenever it snows at night, Si Changhe, deputy chief of the
Heping Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security and
Traffic Administration, always shows up at work before six
the next morning to put coal ash on the road.
</P>
<P>
When the winter of 1988 began closing in, many residents in the
district did not have enough coal and cabbages to carry them
through the winter. Zhang Haosheng, the then district government
head, told district officials, "We cadres will not buy coal and
cabbages if one single family does not have enough coal or
cabbages."
</P>
<P>
More than 500 district officials helped sell cabbages in the
daytime and transport coal for local residents at night when the
supply work reached its peak.
</P>
<P>
Residents were moved by the officials' behavior and suggested
that they be commended for their good work. The suggestion was
then put into practice. In February 1989, the first "Top Ten
Public Servants" were selected and given awards by the residents.
</P>
<P>
The list of names and backgrounds of the candidates were
printed in the Tianjin Daily and ballot boxes set up at all 12
street committees.
</P>
<P>
The voting system is like placing cadres in a glass bottle,
putting them under scrutiny every minute, officials commented,
noting that they had to do their work well and not relax for a
second.

<P>
TIANJIN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Heping District in
the center of Tianjin say they don't feel the indifference and
other forms of discomfort often encountered in a metropolis, and
enjoy community services that they provide with their own hands.
</P>
<P>
The developing economy, stable society, harmonious relations,
service network, clean environment, and good atmosphere are the
results of the hard work of both the officials and ordinary folk
in this district of 500,000 people in Tianjin, the largest port
city in north China.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, there was a special awards ceremony in Heping
District - but there were no certificates, no flashbulbs, no
commotion. There were, however, flowers and people everywhere, and
ten district officials were selected as "Top Ten Public Servants"
by district's residents.
</P>
<P>
The awards ceremony was the idea of local residents, and it has
continued for eight years, with 740 officials having been selected
as "good public servants".
</P>
<P>
Public services in China used to be provided by enterprises or
individual government institutions. But with a market economy
being created, a number of social functions have been transferred
to individual communities, and people have begun to want more and
better community services.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all this, the Heping District Government felt
that residents would not live better simply if more services were
provided and more problems solved.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Occupying Zairean Land, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today once again denied
occupying Zairean territory and said that it will attend a
regional conference Tuesday in Nairobi, which will discuss the
human disaster facing one million refugees in eastern Zaire and
the on-going fighting between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels
backed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a spokesman of the
Rwandan Patriotic Army as saying in the Rwandan border town of
Gisenyi that Rwanda "does not have any interest in entering
Zaire."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Rwandan governments wishes to
have the 1.1 million Hutu refugees in Zaire to return home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rwandan government said today that Rwanda is
ready to "cooperate" with the international community "to help
Zaire solve its present internal crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government said in a long communique that Zaire is
trying to "cover up the acts of genocide" against the ethnic
Tutsis in Zaire by "hurrying in making people believe the idea of
a conflict between Zaire and Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda admitted last week that its troops had participated in
fighting in eastern Zaire between Zairean forces and Tutsi rebels,
the Banyamulenges.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has forced the exodus of one million refugees from
their camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda army spokesman, Emmanuel Ndahiro, said that Rwanda
will attend a foreign ministers' meeting of the Great Lakes
region, or a regional summit to be held Tuesday in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"As to know whether Zaire will come, this is another
question," said Ndahiro, who gave a press conference to foreign
journalists today in Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is reportedly continuing in Goma and Bukavu, two major
Zairean cities in Kivu region, and Rwandan troops today prevented
foreign journalists from crossing the border into Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"At any moment our soldiers did not go to Goma. We have a very
strict rule. If one soldier crossed the frontier, he should be
punished," said the spokesman of the Rwandan army.
</P>
<P>
One million refugees are now stacked in a small bay beside the
Lake Kivu in eastern Zaire, facing an unprecedented human disaster
with hunger, disease and the rainy season which can cause
wide-spread epidemics among the refugees.
</P>
<P>
All international humanitarian workers have fled eastern Zaire
to Rwanda, leaving the refugees in a completely helpless
situation.

The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a spokesman of the
Zairean government as saying today in Kinshasa that "the
motorboats of Rwanda crossed the Lake Kivu so that the elements of
the Rwandan Patriotic Army could attack Goma."
</P>
<P>
He said that these motorboats, the number of which was not
disclosed, carried the sign of "Donnot use for military ends."
</P>
<P>
Lake Kivu is located along the Zairean-Rwandan border and is
some 30 kilometers from Goma, which fell Friday to the Tutsi
rebels who are backed by Rwandan troops.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Boguo Makeli, said that Zairean troops also have
seized from Rwandan troops some arms which have the print of
"Made in USA" and "Made in Austria."
</P>
<P>
He said that these weapons belonged to the Ugandan army,
expressing his wonder why they were in the hand of Rwandan army.
</P>
<P>
Makeli also accused some former members of the South African
security force of fighting for Rwanda, without providing further
details.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman rapped the South African government of Nelson
Mandela for selling arms to Rwanda "to kill the Zaireans."
</P>
<P>
Mandela rejected criticism arising in South Africa itself about
an arms sale contract he signed with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"There is an army just at the (Zairean-Rwandan) frontier which
killed one million people in Rwanda (in 1994). It is armed by
certain countries and is preparing for return to Rwanda to commit
new massacres. I would not allow that this army return to this
country where the people don't have the weapons to defend
themselves," said the South African president.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Hutu military men and militias fled to Zaire in
1994 after committing a genocide against the Tutsis, in which at
least half a million people were killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arrearages Affect U.N. Reforms, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. failure to pay the
money it owes to the United Nations has hampered the reforms and
the peacekeeping efforts it demanded the United Nations to carry
out, according to a draft U.S. State Department study, which the
Washington Post has attained and revealed in its Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. contribution formulas, which are based on national
wealth, the United States should pay 25 percent of U.N. general
budget annually and 31 percent of expenditures for global
peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, under the pretext of slow pace of
reforms to the United Nations, has held up the money it should
have paid to the United Nations and the arrearages have amounted
up to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The still-confidential State Department study, which is subject
to revision, concludes that U.S. failure to pay the money have two
major adverse effects on the American campaign to induce the
United Nations to reshape multinational peacekeeping in an
accordance with the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
First, the United Nations is left so strapped for funds that it
must borrow heavily from its peacekeeping budgets to meet
day-to-day expenses, leaving nothing to finance reforms in the
peacekeeping area.
</P>
<P>
And second, Washington's influence with other U.N. members has
eroded and made them increasingly reluctant to support U.S. ideas
about reform.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis has undermined the ability of the United
States and the United Nations to carry out some (peacekeeping)
reforms," the study says. "Furthermore, given its role in the
financial crisis, the United States is not a credible advocate for
some financial reforms..."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said: " these are the principal findings of
a review being conducted by the State Department to assess how
much progress has been made in implementing the policy goals
outlined by the administration two years ago."
</P>
<P>
The policy goals here refers to the President Decision
Directive-25, issued by President Bill Clinton in May 1994, which
listed a number of conditions for U.S. participation in
peacekeeping operations that included potential importance to U.S.
national interests.
</P>
<P>
But as a result of U.S. arrears, U.N. member countries are
reluctant to contribute troops because the United Nations is unable
to reimburse them.
</P>
<P>
Officials of other countries are critical of U.S. failure to
meet its obligations and resistant to U.S. calls for reforming the
management of peacekeeping and reducing the officially set U.S.
share for peacekeeping costs to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Some member states have questioned whether the United States
is truly interested in U.N. reforms or simply driven to reduce the
U.N. budget, and hence the U.S. contribution, to save money. In
both of these cases, U.S. credibility has been called into
questions," said U.S. diplomats interviewed for the State
Department report.
