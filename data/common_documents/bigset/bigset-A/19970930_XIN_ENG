<HEADLINE> EU Divorce Rate at Record High, says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one third of all
marriages in European Union (EU) countries will fail and the
number of marriages is also decreasing, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
One out of four EU marriages is ending in divorce and the rate
is escalating, according to a report published by Eurostat, the
EU's statistical office in Luxembourg.

figure rises to 22 percent for those who married in 1970 and 27
percent in 1980, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Marriages are most at risk in Belgium and Sweden where more
than half of all couples will probably divorce. The divorce rate
is also high in Finland with 49 percent, the United Kingdom with
45 percent and Denmark with 41 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Final Accounts of HKSARG Land Fund Trust Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Trustees of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) Land Fund
Trust announced here today that the operation of the Land Fund was
normal and good results have been achieved during the 15-month
period ended June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement today, the trust will submit its
final accounts to HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa tomorrow and
is to be dissolved on the same day.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the net assets of the Land Fund amounted to
197.1 billion HK dollars (25.3 billion U.S. dollars), reflecting
an increase of 85.87 billion HK dollars (11.0 billion U.S.
dollars) or 77 percent over the end of March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The investment surplus for the period was 21.53 billion HK
dollars (2.8 billion U.S. dollars), representing an increment of
84 percent over the accumulated surplus of last year. During the
period, HKSARG's share of land premium income increased by 64.34
billion HK dollars (8.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the accumulated investment surplus was 47.1
billion HK dollars (6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Land Fund was handed over by the Central Government to the
chief executive of the HKSAR on July 1 when the HKSARG was
established.
</P>
<P>
The trust was set up in August 1986 for managing HKSARG's share
of land premium income through diversified commercial investment
activities.
</P>
<P>
After over 11 years' prudent management and effective
operation, the net assets of the fund soared from just 772 million
HK dollars (99 million U.S. dollars) to 197.1 billion HK dollars
(25.3 billion U.S. dollars), the chief executive of the trust,
Chung Shui-ming, told a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Weathering one after another financial turbulence and keen
competition from the industry, the fund has realized an annual
rate of return of 9.09 percent, one percentage point higher than
the annual inflation rate. "We have been very successful in
achieving satisfactory returns in the past 11 years," Chung said.

<HEADLINE> EU, ACP Relations Should be More Political: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today said that consultations on the future of relations
between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries
should be more political and differentiated.
</P>
<P>
Joan de Deus Pinheiro, the EU development commissioner, made
the remark at a two-day conference held in Brussels on the future
of relations between the EU and ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that it seemed necessary to give their relations "a
more marked political dimension by conducting a more effective and
more detailed dialogue on political matters."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to introduce the principle of
differentiation and to support actively the regional integration
efforts in ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner announced that on the basis of the
consultations held so far, the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, would present to the EU member states by November
1997 political guidelines for the future relations with ACP
countries.
</P>
<P>
A convention was signed in 1975 in Lome, capital of the African
country Togo, by 46 ACP countries and the then European Economic
Community to provide financial aid to ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between EU and ACP countries should start before
the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Rejects Opposition Call for Wage Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government today rejected an appeal by main opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) to raise wages in order to boost domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition said an increase in wages would drive up
costs and prices when there was already reluctance to invest in
Germany. They also believed such a move would cause companies to
further reduce their workforce to save money.
</P>
<P>
But SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said only strengthened
domestic demand could boost the economy and, in turn, create more
jobs and attract more investment.
</P>
<P>
He added wages have hardly been raised in real terms in western
Germany since 1989.
</P>
<P>
"If wages hang too far behind an increase in productivity, this
becomes a burden for domestic demand."

<HEADLINE> WTO Committee of ITA Hold First Meeting in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The WTO Committee of
Participants on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology
Products held its first meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The 43 participants will discuss expansion of product coverage
and reduction of non-tariff barriers. They are to submit their
lists of additional products for inclusion into the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) between October 1, 1997 and December
31, 1997. They are also to start consultations on divergences in
classifying Information Technology (IT) products.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants said that they have started the
implementation of the ITA on July 1, 1997, as scheduled in the
agreement reached on March 26. India, Israel and Turkey have
completed domestic ratification and have started implementing the
ITA recently, according to a spokesman of WTO, the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, which is not yet a WTO member, said it had
started implementing the ITA on an autonomous basis on July 1,
1997. The Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and the Slovak Republic
said they will implement the agreement after completion of
domestic ratification procedures. The ITA tariff schedules of
Panama, which became a WTO member early this month, and Latvia,
which is negotiating its membership, will have to be verified.
</P>
<P>
The 43 ITA participants are Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, the
Czech Republic, El Salvador, Estonia, the European Community (15
countries), Hong Kong of China, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel,
Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway,
the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Singapore, the Slovak Republic,
Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Turkey, and the United
States. They share 95 percent of the world trade in information
technology products, which stood at about 600 billion US dollars
in 1995 (correct).
</P>
<P>
The ITA provides for the "staging" of tariff reductions in four
equal rate reductions (25 percent each time): the first cut from
July 1, 1997, the second cut from January 1, 1998, the third cut
from January 1, 1999, and the fourth cut, complete elimination of
duties, from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the ITA committee is scheduled on October
30, 1997.

across China.

He said the report adopted by the congress has reviewed the
struggle of the Chinese nation over the past 100 years from a
historical perspective, and has looked into the future to make a
comprehensive plan for the cross-century development of China's
reform and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"It is our Party's political announcement and guiding document
in leading all Chinese people to forge ahead into the 21st
century," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the other cross-century significance of
the congress lies in its election of a new CPC Central Committee
and the Committee's leading body -- the Political Bureau and its
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The results of this congress have won hearty support of all
Chinese people, and have been highly valued in the international
community as well," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory is the
soul of the congress, he said, and the issue of the banner is of
critical importance.
</P>
<P>
"This issue is vital to the consolidation and development of
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
is directly related to the fundamental interests of all Chinese
people," Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
During the congress, he said, the Party has decided to write
explicitly in its Constitution that Deng Xiaoping Theory is its
guiding ideology and must be steadfastly followed.
</P>
<P>
"This not only has fully displayed our determination to advance
along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
pioneered by Comrade Xiaoping, but also represented the common
aspirations of the people of various ethnic groups across the
country," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Currency Reserves in  Unusual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's foreign currency
reserves have drastically dropped to two months import cover in
contrast to the four months usually expected this time of the
year, a banker said today.
</P>
<P>
"This is something new because i think it has never been that
low since 1994, and especially after tobacco exports which
usually boost the reserves," said first banking corporation
official Andy Hodges.
</P>
<P>
It has always been the central bank's target not to go below
four months import cover.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of August the country's foreign currency
reserves had risen to five months import cover since the opening
of the tobacco marketing season in April.
</P>
<P>
Hodges suggested various factors, including the reduction in
tobacco exports or an increase in imports in the run up for
christmas, as possible causes for the drop.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco marketing season ended last week with a total
sales figure of 185 million kg worth five billion Zimbabwe
dollars, after sales had been revised four times during the
auction period due to reduced yields resulting from excessive
rains.
</P>
<P>
Last year 202 million kg exported earned the country in excess
of eight billion Zimbabwe dollars in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. dollar equals to 12 Zimbabwe dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stockbrokers have noted that the local unit had
been under pressure since the announcement by the reserve bank of
Zimbabwe that the Zimbabwe dollar was about five percent
overvalued in July.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will end the
year at around 13 according to stockbrokers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Comedy Contest Set to Tickle Funny Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to host a
national comic dialogue contest next month to tickle the funny
bones of its people and prove its a nation that does know how to
laugh.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Lion award, the top award in the field of comedy,
will be presented to those jokesters who can make their audience
laugh loudest and longest, organizers told a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
In ancient China the comedy routine was one of the favorite
traditional entertainments -- sometimes beating Beijing Opera
hands down. The stage performance is usually given by two people
who are trained to tell funny stories, crack jokes and imitate
various noises.
</P>
<P>
But the popularity of the genre has waned in the 1990s,
overshadowed by trendier entertainments such as Karoake and VCDs.
</P>
<P>
There are currently only 40 professional comedic artists still
performing comic dialogue in China. Many of them are elderly.
</P>
<P>
The contest, organized by the Ministry of Culture and the
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, is meant to revive the art
form, said a Culture Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Arts departments across the country have been told to organize
writers and performers, especially young people, to get involved
in the fun.
</P>
<P>
But some people said that lack of formal education among the
comic dialogue artists will affect the future of the genre in the
21st century. Mediocre talent and lack of a sharp sense of humor
are the two biggest pitfalls for Chinese comics, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: France, U.S. Face Confrontation over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States
are facing confrontation over a 2 billion U.S. dollar deal signed
by the French oil group Total with Iran, to develop a gas field in
the Gulf, which could expose the French group to U.S. unilateral
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt today
warned the United States against taking rash action against Total,
and reiterated France's rejection of the d'Amato law, which bans
everybody in the world from making oil deal with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The United States today formally launched an inquire into the
contract announced by Total on Sunday, and a U.S. State Department
spokesman said Washington regrets that Total has signed such a
deal.
</P>
<P>
In association with the Russian oil company Russe Gazprom and
the Malaysian company Petronas, Total will explore with the
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) of Iran a giant offshore gas
field in southern Par in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, which is 70 meters under water and is estimated
to have 8,000 billion cubic meters of gas reserve, will start
producing gas by 2002, according to Total.
</P>
<P>
This contract, which allows Total to have 40 percent of the
shares of a future oil consortium to be produced from the gas
field, also makes the French oil group the first cooperator of
Tehran in hydrocarbon and oil development and trade.
</P>
<P>
This latest action by Total was a defiance of the U.S.
unilateral banning of all oil deals with the Islamic republic,
which it accused of "supporting terrorism" and should be banned
from getting capital to purchase weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Washington institutionalized the unilateral ban by adopting the
d'Amato law in August 1996, which says that the United States will
punish all those -- at home and abroad -- who deal more than 40
million U.S. dollars with Iran and Libya in oil and hydrocarbon
sector, the economic lifeline of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Washington had expressed its irritation several times over
negotiations held between Total and Iran on oil development, and
said sanctions were likely against the oil group.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions could include a total banning of exports to the
United States of products by the company in question.
</P>
<P>
The law, named after Republican Senator Alfonse d'Amato who
proposed it, has never been applied since being signed by
President Bill Clinton, although Turkey was subjected to U.S.
investigation over its activities in Iranian oil sector last year.
</P>
<P>
France and most European Union countries rejected the law, as
well as its brother law of Helms-Burton Act, which bans foreign
companies from making deals with Cuba.

"The d'Amato law is America's. So it should be imposed only in
America and upon American companies," said the French foreign
ministry spokesman, "The valid sanctions of international law are
those taken by the United Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with daily Le Monde published today, the
president of Total Thierry Desmarest said that his company had
obtained approval and support from the French government and
"European authorities" before it signed the deal.
</P>
<P>
A Total spokesman said that the contract signed with Iran does
not "transgress any international rule or law", and pointed out
that there does not exist any internationally recognized organ
which restrains world countries from developing trade relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We working on a contract which conforms with our industrial
criteria as in about 15 other countries," said the spokesman
without specifying which countries these are. He also said that
Total will continue to work from its strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Total's investment in North America is relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
France and most other European countries have adopted
anti-boycott policy against the United States in case the
Americans impose sanctions upon European companies with unilateral
laws.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Protests Against Jewish Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Arabs will
not accept Jewish settlements in Ras Al-Amud in East Jerusalem,
said a senior Palestinian official here today.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the PNA Cabinet minister for Jerusalem
affairs, made the remark while leading a group of demonstrators to
protest Jewish settlers in the center of Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the Palestinians will not accept the so
called compromise agreement reached between the Israeli government
and the American millionaire Irving Moskowitz to replace the
settlers with seminar students.
</P>
<P>
Three Jewish families left on September 18 the two houses in
Ras Al-Amud they occupied four days before after the Israeli
internal compromise. Ten seminar students moved in the same day
who were joined by 10 security men at night.
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz, an American Jew who bankrolled the Jewish settlers,
claimed that he bought two houses from Palestinians long time
ago. The claim is now being challenged by a Palestinian back from
Romania who said he is the owner of one of the houses.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement in Ras Al-Amud triggered Palestinian
protests in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peace supporters, including members of the Israeli "Peace Now"
group which opposes Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, now keep
several tents open in Ras Al-Amud to continue their protest.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that he would like to sit as long as he can with
the members of "Peace Now" and other protesters because the
Palestinian could never accept Jewish settlers in Ras Al-Amud.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Rate in US Unchanged Despite Income Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The poverty rate in the
U.S. last year remained about the same as in 1995 although
Americans' real income went up for the second year in a row, the
U.S. Census Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
An annual report released by the bureau said the number of poor
Americans totaled 36.5 million in 1996, about 13.7 percent of the
nation's population. It compared with 36.4 million and 13.8
percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the poverty threshold for a family of four in the
country was 16,036 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said the overall poverty rate for children in the
the U.S. was 20.5 percent and 10.8 percent for those aged 65 and
over, essentially unchanged.
</P>
<P>
But the number of children under age 18 lacking health
insurance grew quickly to 10.6 million last year from 9.8 million
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There were no significant changes in 1996 in poverty rates for
whites, blacks, Asians or persons of Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
The report said that real median income of U.S. households rose
by 1.2 percent from 35,082 dollars in 1995 to 35,492 dollars last
year. It was the second consecutive annual increase for household
incomes in metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, households in these areas had not had an increase
since 1989.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Cases on Rise in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of malaria cases
in Africa has over the past 10 years increased from 100 million
to about 270-480 million, Director of Africa Regional Office
(AFRO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebrahim Samba said
today.
</P>
<P>
His speech was delivered at a three-day malaria control
workshop which started here today to develop detailed plans of
action including advocacy and social mobilization activities
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the situation is now being complicated by
increasing malaria epidemics in eastern and southern Africa and
chloroquine resistance in countries such as Malawi, Kenya and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He said WHO had adopted a regional malaria control strategy to
reduce social and economic losses caused by malaria.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the decision of the Executive Board to
increase support for malaria control in Africa, WHO made
available nine million U.S. Dollars for accelerated malaria
control in the region in 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
An additional nine million U.S. Dollars will also be made
available in 1998 and 21 additional countries will benefit from
this allocation, he said.

vigorously in South-South cooperation projects with a view to play
a bridging role between the developed and developing countries.

least-developed countries, Korea has participated in bilateral
cooperation projects with the Economic Commission for Africa(ECA)
since 1995, and planned to undertake a Programme for the
Development of Africa for the period of 1998 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
On environmental issues, the foreign minister said his country
welcomed the adoption of the Programme for Further Implementation
of Agenda 21 at the 19th Special Session of the General Assembly
and stood committed to faithly participating in its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said his country's proposal to conduct a
feasibility study on the transfer of publicly-owned technology was
supported by developed and the developing countries alike, and the
result of the study would be presented at the sixth session of the
Commission on Sustainable Development next year.
</P>
<P>
Through these efforts, the foreign minister hoped to expedite

<HEADLINE> Taliban Claim Capture Airport of Rivals' Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia and their rival forces for the control of
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of Kabul, was continuing today
amidst claims of success by the both sides, Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's spokesman Mohammad Haqqani claimed that they had
captured the airport of Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the
anti-Taliban northern alliance following their three-pronged from
east, west and northern sides of the city, the Afghan sources in
Peshawar, northwest Pakistan, said this evening.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the Taliban's claims, spokesman of the northern
alliance Dr. Talib said that the alliance's forces had repulsed
the militia's strong offensive and caught some of the Taliban's
commanders, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, no independent confirmation of the claims by the both
sides was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, Mazar-e-Sharif has been under the
attack of Taliban, who now control two thirds of the Afghan
territory.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line militia briefly controlled the Mazar-e-Sharif
airport, about 18 km east of the city, early this month, but were
forced to retreat in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, which comprises Uzbek warlord Abdul
Malik, Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad Masood and the
Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat, has been battling the Taliban in western,
northern and central Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Most Americans believe
global warming is a serious threat and they are ready to support
international efforts to curb carbon emissions, said a poll
released today by the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted by the Mellman Group, 72
percent of voters would support an international agreement to
reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the voters said global warming should be a
priority issue for the U.S. government, and 80 percent respondents
said they would be willing to pay five U.S. dollars a month more
for cleaner energy alternatives such as wind and solar power.
</P>
<P>
The poll was released a week before a White House conference
intended to raise public awareness on the global warming.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will host a day-long conference on
October 6 to try to build support for his effort to get an
international treaty for countries to reduce their heat-trapping
carbon emissions from burning coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government also is in the process of determining the
targets and timetables for reducing emissions it will seek in the
climate change treaty negotiations that are to end in December in
Kyoto, Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright met with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
here this morning prior to her scheduled session with
representatives of Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. State Department, Albright has worked
"assiduously" over the last few weeks to restart direct talks
between Israel and Palestine and hopes that her meeting with Levy
and Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas later today will produce
results.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process came to a standstill in March after
Israel decided to go ahead with Jewish settlement expansion in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Alleged Massacres Condemned in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- North Mogadishu faction
leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, has condemned the forces of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid for committing massacres against the communities of
Rahanwein in the regions of Bay and Bakol of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu quoted Ali Mahdi Mohamed last night as
saying that Hussein Aidid's men are carrying out what he called
genocide and eradication activities against the Rahanwein
communities.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has called on the United Nations, international and
regional organizations to keep an eye on what's going on in Bay
and Bakol regions of southwestern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the consequences of the alleged genocide
will remain in the history of Hussein Aidid's men.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
spokesman spoke about mass killings against the innocent
supporters of the RRA in those regions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, told the journalists
yesterday afternoon that 19 villages consisting of more than
1,500 houses inhabited by the Rahanwein people were set on fire
by the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 260 innocent civilians including women and
infants were killed and some of them were burned in their houses
in the past three days in the villages.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle has called on the international community to help the
people in Bay and Bakol regions and send an investigative body to
the area.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a spokesman for Hussein Aidid's government
described the allegations by the RRA as purely fabricated lies.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, said that their forces
in the region sometimes clash with what he called bandits armed
by the Ethiopian government forces in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
Afrah, Interior Minister of Hussein Aidid, said if there were
any killings, the Ethiopian-manipulated elements of RRA whose aim
is according to him to destabilize the region have carried out.
</P>
<P>
There's no independent confirmation about the opposing
allegations regarding the matter concerned.

<HEADLINE> Partnerships in Housing Need Urged at Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September (Xinhua) - The local Government
Association (LGA), National Housing Federation (NHF) and the
Chartered Institute of Housing have joined forces at the first day
of the Labor Party Conference to get the message across that
partnership matter.
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the conference this year is the vote on the
proposed Partnership in Power reforms, designed to build a
successful partnership between the party and new Labor government.
</P>
<P>
The document Making Partnership Work released here today
recognizes that many successful partnerships exist, but that a
strategic approach to working together is vital if the current
scale of housing need is to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, in 1996 almost 117,000 families were
accepted as homeless by local authorities and nearly 42,500 home
owners had their properties repossessed.
</P>
<P>
The number of new and refurbished homes started for social
renting in 1996/97 was 42,000 - the lowest since 1945 and less
than half the lowest estimates of demand.
</P>
<P>
Government spending on social housing fell by 61 percent
between 1980 and 1997, the biggest cut endured by any public
service.
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter of the workforce is in part-time employment,
and the figure is set to grow. One in four households has no
member at work and cannot access the private housing market.
</P>
<P>
The three partners, central and local government and registered
social landlords, each have a vital, though different, role to
play, the document concluded.

<HEADLINE> "Full Employment for the 21th Century", Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 29 (Xinhua) - British Chancellor
Gordon Brown today promised "job for all" and tax refunds to make
work pay for those on low wages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening day of the Labor Conference, Brown
committed the Labor Government to achieving full employment for
the first time since it came to power last May.
</P>
<P>
"Full employment for the 21th Century," he declared with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
A commentator at the conference said, the pledge is the
centerpiece of the biggest shake-up in the welfare state since the
Forties.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor hinted that everyone who wants a job should be
able to get one with a new low 10p tax rate to be unveiled in next
Spring's Budget.
</P>
<P>
Those on benefits would be forced to train or get work under a
drive to prevent idlers spending life on the sole, he said.
</P>
<P>
A radical tax credit scheme would top up wage packets so people
are better off in even lowpaid jobs instead of unemployed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Chancellor also signaled a new plan to make
Britain fairer by saying helping the less well-off is the
Government's "top priority".
</P>
<P>
"No Labor government can stand by despite all the talk of
ending the hereditary principle in Parliament when in our society
the children of the poorest have poverty and failure thrust upon
them simply because their parents were poor," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chancellor believed the way to redistribute wealth
is not to pile taxes on the rich but to give the poor the skills
to do better.

NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today spoke highly of China's foreign policy, describing it
as "independent" with full respect to other countries'
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China, unlike some other countries, never interferes in other
nations' internal affairs, said Moi at the 48th Chinese National
Day reception held by Chinese embassy here today.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time that Moi has attended Chinese embassy's
reception of this kind since he took power as a president in

</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the African continent,
especially in comparison with western countries, said Moi, warmly
recalling his three visits to China and the visit in return by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"I note with satisfaction the warm and cordial relations
existing between Kenya and China which form the basis of mutually
beneficial cooperation between our two countries," said Moi,
while calling for closer Sino-Kenya ties.
</P>
<P>
China is "a remarkable country" with which Kenya has been
expanding cooperation projects in trade, technical transfer,
education and culture, he said, urging Chinese business people to
invest more in Kenya directly or through joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his sincere congratulation on the success of
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
earlier this month and the smooth return of Hong Kong sovereignty
to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"At the international level Kenya will continue to support the
policy of `One China' by which we believe the aspirations of the
Chinese people will be fully realized and respected," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Kenya An Yongyu said China is also "in
firm belief that Sino-Kenyan friendship and cooperation will keep
good momentum and go on with vigorous strides."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Punish Illegal Foreign Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia will impose
punishments on foreigners staying illegally in the country
beginning October 16, a high-ranking Saudi official announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel Aziz said in a
statement today that his country will continue an extensive
campaign against violators of residence regulations and those of
illegal entry, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the campaign will not stop until illegal
foreign residents and those residing with expired visas are
deported.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia urged in early August all foreigners staying
illegally in the kingdom to leave for their home countries
immediately and set October 16 as the deadline. Those who leave
before the deadline would be exempt from imprisonment and fines.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline illegal foreign laborers would face a
two-year imprisonment and a fine of up to 27,000 U.S. dollars,
according to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Nationals abeting illegal stay would be punished with a
sentence of six months in jail and a fine of 27,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia launched the campaign three years ago to apprehend
those who breach residence laws and deport them to their native
countries. The kingdom deported about 300,000 illegal expatriates
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry also warned citizens and local
companies against employing violators or assisting them in a way
they could continue their illegal stay.
</P>
<P>
Every year, millions of Muslims from all over the world flocked
into the kingdom to perform Haj pilgrimage, but some continue to
stay illegally after the festival.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat has expressed hope that the
tripartite Palestinian-Israeli-U.S. meeting in New York today will
have fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to newsmen here today, after meeting with
Tunisian President Zeinul Abidine Bin Ali, he said that a meeting was
to take place in New York today under the sponsorship of U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, between Mohamed Abbas (also
known as Alias Abu Mazen), Secretary General of the Executive
Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levi.
</P>
<P>
"We hope", he said, "that something new will come out of this
meeting, but at the same time, we believe that the Israeli
government will not authorize its Foreign Minister to take
decisions on important and urgent matters."
</P>
<P>
Arafat went on to say that his talks with President Ali were
important, constructive and positive. They discussed issues
obstructing the peace process. It is the Israeli government, he
said, that is adopting a new stance refusing to implement the
agreements signed in the U.S. White House.
</P>
<P>
These agreements, he stated, are not bilateral but
international, having taken place under the sponsorship of U.S.
President and signed by each of the U.S., Russia, the EU and
Norway, and in the presence of representatives of Japan, Egypt and
Jordan. It is not within the power of Netanyahu or his government
to evade the implementation of these agreements.
</P>
<P>
President Arafat, on the other hand, spelled out the
determination to solve the outstanding issues such as the
redeployment and withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Palestinian
territories according to the agreed timetables.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left Tunis this afternoon, concluding a 24-hour visit to
Tunisia, on his way to Morocco on a similar visit. Arafat had
visited Algeria Sunday before he came to Tunis.

<HEADLINE> Planned Teachers' Strike Illegal: Kenyan Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
declared teachers' strike set for Wednesday "unlawful" after its
allowances hike offer was rejected by the 24,000-member Kenya
National Union of Teachers (KNUT), the sponsor of the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has made all efforts to end the row
over teachers' pay, "it is clear that the stalemate between the
Ministry of Education and KNUT still persists and there is no
sight to any mutual settlement," Minister for Labor and Manpower
Development Philip Masinde told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, he called on the KNUT to get to the negotiation table
with the government to seek for solutions "amicably." It is
believed that the strike would hurt the ruling Kenya African
National Union in the impending general elections.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo dismissed on Friday the
15-to-100 percent rise in allowances announced by the government
on Thursday, vowing that teachers' 200-percent salary increment
demand should be met otherwise the strike is on schedule.
</P>
<P>
In response, the government said that it is not in a position
to adequately remunerate public employees, including teachers,
due to economic pressures and financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
The 200-percent wage increase means that the treasury spends
50 percent of its annual revenue on salaries for teachers alone,
the governmental argued.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, KNUT issued a seven-day strike notice, saying that
teachers of the country would down their tools on October 1 if
their demands were not met by September 30.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the government announced to raise teachers'
salaries by 10 and 28 percent, which was immediately rejected by
a furious KNUT, describing the move as "an insult."
</P>
<P>
Teachers are among the lowest paid professionals in the
eastern African country, but carry considerable political
influences especially in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Leaders Paving Way for Stop-gap Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressional
leaders were trying to smooth the way for a temporary spending
measure to avoid the government shutdown when fiscal year of 1997
expires at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has sent to President Clinton three of the 13
bills to outline new budgets for the federal departments and
agencies when the new fiscal year begins October 1. But none has
been signed into law as yet. U.S. government agencies could be
forced to shut down temporarily without renewed funding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is again resorting to a stopgap spending bill
to extend current funding until lawmakers finish and Clinton signs
the rest of the bills.
</P>
<P>
The interim bill, expected to be rushed through the House of
Representatives and the Senate quickly, give the lawmakers until
October 23 to work on the rest of regular spending bills.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leader Tent Lott and Democratic leader Tom
Daschle today expressed a desire for a "clean" stopgap bill free
of controversial riders that could sail through both chambers on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Neither side, especially Republican congressional leaders,
wants a repeat of the tortuous partial government shutdowns during
a fiscal showdown two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996 paralyzed
portions of the U.S. government for a record 27 days, resulting in
a torrent of public rage directed mostly at the Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Vows Not to Succumb to External Pressures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua)-- Laurent Kabila, visiting
president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) here today
vowed that he will not succumb to external pressures to
democratize quickly in his country.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Kabila during a meeting held at the
state house in Lusaka with Zambian president Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, accompanied by several ministers of his government,
arrived here this morning on a three-day visit at the invitation
of Chiluba, which is his first visit abroad since he became
president of the former Zaire after he overthrew the late Mobutu
Sese Seko' regime four months ago.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kabila confirmed that there has been some
external forces pressuring him to democratize quickly and to
establish a human rights commission of inquiry to probe suspected
masscres of Ruwandan refugees occured in last May.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking through an interpreter, Kabila said that he
will not succumb to such pressures, adding that he sees no reason
why external forces should condemn a three-month old government
while they failed to condemn the dictatorship in the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have urged Kabila to establish a democratic
government and hold general elections as soon as possible and
some of them even declared that if Kabila doesn't do so and
refuses to cooperate with a U.N. human rights commission to probe
the massacres, he will risk losing vital aid from the west.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who came to Zambia for diplomatic and spiritual
support, also expressed his willingness to resume the bilateral
cooperation between the two countries which was jeopardized over
the past years.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chiluba said that DRC has a lot of problems left
behind by the Mobutu regime which needed to be solved before
democratization.
</P>
<P>
"Take every step carefully without rushing until you move
along with all the people in your task to demorcratize," Chiluba
advised.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also pledged Zambia's continued support for DRC in an
effort to rebuild the country's economy and other sectors.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is making
final efforts to iron out differences between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority over settlements as the three parties are
going to meet here later today, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
American mediator Dannis Ross shuttled Sunday and today between
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Adbas, a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Levy Sunday night to discuss issues concerning
the resumption of Israel-Palestinian peace talks after a six-month
lapse marked by violence and recrimination.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister told Ross that security "is our
No. 1 issue."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had a meeting with Levy in preparations for the three-party talks.
U.S. officials said that Albright had worked very hard in an
effort to reopen the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
An announcement is expected later this afternoon after the
three-party meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians sought to include in the statement a provision
strongly discouraging Israel's expansion of settlements on the
West Bank while Israel resists the inclusion, diplomatic sources
said.

<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all cut their early losses and ended mixed today, helped by the
recovery of the dollar and the rebound into positive ground of
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market ended on a weak note after
a lackluster session following Friday's record high, but off
lowest levels as the Dow rebounded. The FTSE-100 index seemed to
find solid support at the 5,200 level, ending 6.0 points down at
5,220.30.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the market's bullish sentiment had faded
after the UK government played down talk of a more positive
position toward European economic and monetary union over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed marginally higher,
up 3.33 points at 2,988.96. A recovery in New York helped to boost
sentiment in Paris as the market managed to reverse earlier
weakness which was triggered by profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks closed 23.49 points higher at
4,104.27 on the DAX-30 index. Dealers said that the market was

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Active in Nairobi Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The 95th annual Nairobi
International Show, the largest fair in eastern Africa, started
today with vigorous participation of about 20 Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65 foreign firms and 250 local firms, together with
governments of Nigeria, Uganda, Germany and India, took part in
the six-day show, which is traditionally treated as the
shop-window of Kenya's agricultural and industrial progresses.
</P>
<P>
Local people were seen crowded in quite a few Chinese firms'
stands, where colorful garments, toys, bedclothes, shoes,
umbrellas, medicines, small-sized machines are on display and
sale, most of them at very competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lin Company Ltd, from China's Hebei Province, said it is
expecting a good turnover at the fair. Qi Lin sold goods worth
about 480,000 Shillings (90,000 U.S. Dollars) at the 1996 show
which also lasted six days.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyan people like Chinese goods very much," said a Chinese
saleswoman, who has stayed in the eastern African country for
some two years.
</P>
<P>
However, several Chinese newcomers in Kenya complained that
they are facing difficulties on capacity-limited Kenyan market
and some of their goods are hard to be sold due to unsuitable
prices and different consuming habits.
</P>
<P>
Chinese products have enjoyed strong performence in the annual
show since 1980s.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, private firms from Israel, the U.S., Iran#,
Syria and Australia are exhibiting at the fair.
</P>
<P>
The number of local firms and foreign governments entering
the 1996 show stood at 236 and eight respectively.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince Leaves on Visit to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal left here today for Washington on an official visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hassan would hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton to
review international and regional efforts to overcome obstacles to
the Middle East peace process and ways of bolstering bilateral
relations, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The prince would deliver a message from Jordan's King Hussein
to Clinton, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan quoted Hassan as saying that his visit was a
response to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's efforts
in reviving talks between Palestinian and Israeli senior officials
during her recent week-long Mideast trip.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazan, deputy of Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy are meeting in New York together with Albright
in an effort to work out arrangements for the resumption of
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been stalled since March this year when Israel
broke ground for the building of the controversial Jewish
settlement in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, being the
second in the Arab world after Egypt to have normalized relations
with the Jewish state. It helped mediate the Hebron accord between
Israel and the Palestinians in January, under which Israel should
evacuate from most areas in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government lauded the kingdom's role in Mideast
peace-making and has granted it some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
the forms of debt write-off and economic and military aid.

<HEADLINE> US to Enforce Iran Sanctions Law Against France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it would enforce its tough Iran sanctions law over a
new deal between Tehran and the French oil company Total.
</P>
<P>
The United States applies the sanctions law, approved last
year, because "such investments make more resources available for
Iran to use in supporting terrorism and pursuing missiles and
nuclear weapons," State Department spokesman Christopher Bush told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Washington made the threat after Iran signed a contract Sunday
with a consortium of French, Russian and Malaysian oil companies
to expand the South Pars gas field estimated to hold 300 trillion
cubic feet of gas. The field is in the Persian Gulf adjacent to
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The companies are Total, a French oil giant with 40 percent
participation in the deal, and Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of
Malaysia, with 30 percent each.
</P>
<P>
The gas contract worth 2 billion dollars goes against the 1996
Iran-Libya sanctions law which requires President Bill Clinton to
penalize any foreign company investing 20 million dollars or more
in the gas and oil sectors of these two countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the architect of the Iran-Libya
sanctions law, said Total and its consortium partners should be
sanctioned "to the fullest extent of the law."
</P>
<P>
"This law is a vital weapon for cutting the flow of hard
currency to Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, challenging U.S.
enforcement of the law, said today that the United States had no
right to impose sanction on the French company Total for the gas
contract with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said France's European Union partners backed Paris's view on
trade with Iran. "All of the EU is solidly behind our position."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
France and its European partners had consistently opposed what
they saw as an attempt by the United States to extend its laws
beyond its border.

<HEADLINE> Labor Must Never Let Divisions Happen Again: Sawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Delegates at the
Labor Party Annual Conference today were urged to learn from the
past and looked into the future.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Partnership Into Power debate at the conference,
Tom Sawyer, general secretary of the party, said that in the past
"we haven't always been united."
</P>
<P>
"When we have divided we have lost the peoples trust," he said.
"You all know what happens when parties lose the trust of people.
They get punished at the ballot box."
</P>
<P>
"We have been punished and we have never had two terms of
office," Sawyer added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the past, Sawyer said that after every single term,
the divisions in one form or another had opened up between the
party and the government.
</P>
<P>
The result was that Labor lost in elections. He said, "We must
never let that happen again."
</P>
<P>
So there is a "health warning" against almost two decades of
Labor's opposition. "That is why what we are putting right today
we are asking you to add the missing links," Sawyer added.
</P>
<P>
Having learned from the past, Sawyer said the Party must find
ways of working which would build the party up rather than weigh
it down.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the goal of Partnership in Power "is to
create ways of working which promote partnership and not hinder
it".
</P>
<P>
This would be the "foundation for another Labor victory and
another," he said.

BRIGHTON, England, September 29 (Xinhua) -- England's bid to
host the World Cup in 2006 backed by the government, leading
British businesses and football fans throughout the nation is
recognized at the Labor Party Conference.
</P>
<P>
The English Football Association is putting together a strong
and effective case for why the tournament should come to the home
of football in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Alec Mcgivan, director of the World Cup 2006 Campaign, said
today, "The decision of bid for 2006 has not been taken lightly.
English football is once again a good news story. Twenty-two
million people are watching League football every season."
</P>
<P>
"Over 130 international stars are playing in The FA Premier
League. More women and children are coming to the game than ever
before," he added.
</P>
<P>
One campaigner at the conference said that it is the
combination of professionalism and passion that best sums up what
England can give to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has given his backing to the bid:
"Britain approaches the millennium with a renewed sense of
purpose, and with high hopes for the future. I believe that our
country has the vision, the enthusiasm and the commitment to host
an excellent World Cup in 2006."

WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved the first popular AIDS drugs --
Glaxo Wellcome's Combivir consisting of both the oldest anti-HIV
drug, AZT, and lamivudine.
</P>
<P>
People infected with HIV now have to take more than a dozen
pills a day, at regimented times. Many complain that the schedule
is hard to stick to.
</P>
<P>
"Combining these two drugs, which are commonly prescribed with
one another, into one tablet could decrease the number of pills
people with HIV have to take daily," the FDA said in a statement
today.
</P>
<P>
The Combivir pill contains 300 milligrams of AZT, sold as
Retrovir, and 150 milligrams of lamivudine, sold as Epivir.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that Combivir had the adverse side effects as the
two drugs used alone -- nausea, diarrhea, anemia, low white blood
cell count and effects on the pancreas and nerves in the hands and
feet.

<HEADLINE> UNICE Sets Guidelines for Industrial Sub-Contracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
enterprises finally got something to more than protect themselves
with as the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of
Europe (UNICE) today published guidelines for industrial
sub-contracting.
</P>
<P>
UNICE Secretary General Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz described
application of the guidelines, developed in conjunction with the
European Commission, as contribution to increasing the
competitiveness of all European enterprises, especially SMEs, the
initials for small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, first proposed in 1994 and formulated by
purchasers and suppliers representing more than 15 million
European companies large and small, are intended to establish the
basic principles and recommended framework for partnership between
parties throughout the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines outline "best practice" for terms of payment,
quality and industrial property rights and also serve as a
reference for parties negotiating sub-contracting or specific
sectoral agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of partnering is cooperation between a supplier
and a purchaser for mutual benefit," said the UNICE secretary
general who termed the guidelines as a set of self-regulation
rather than legislation.
</P>
<P>
Both the supplier and the purchaser can benefit from their
cooperation if they both respect the guidelines and there does not
have to have a winner and a loser in business dealings,
Tyszkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
Late payment has been a headache for SMEs in their past
dealings with large companies whereas the UNICE guidelines
stipulate that contractual terms of payment should contain a
clause whereby the supplier is automatically entitled to interest
at an agreed rate if the purchaser fails to pay the correct amount
on time.
</P>
<P>
The SMEs, employing less than 250 people by UNICE standard,
account for 97.3 percent of the more than 15 million companies now
active in Europe.

</P>
<P>
The department said that the single-family homes sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000, down from 818,000 in

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has accepted a preliminary report by an interdepartmental
commission on causes of the accident on the Mir space station, the
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Technical and human errors were blamed for the collision of the
unmanned Progress cargo ship with the Mir space station, as well
as for a number of subsequent crises which occurred aboard the
station, Yeltsin's aviation and space adviser Yevgeny Shaposhnikov
said after meeting the president.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Yeltsin was not inclined to overstate the
crew's error for they have been working in difficult conditions
and accomplished a number of hard tasks prior to the collision.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the president was satisfied with the current
situation on the Mir space station, Shaposhnikov said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is to publish an editorial in Wednesday's
edition to mark China's National Day on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Headlined "Forge ahead with full confidence and pioneering
spirit," the piece describes the 48th founding anniversary of the
People's Republic of China and the convening of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) as the Chinese
people's "double happiness."
</P>
<P>
It called the year 1997 "a year of great significance in the
history of the People's Republic," for it has witnessed the smooth
return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1 and the great
success of the 15th CPC National Congress earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
At present, it said, China's national economy has maintained a
sustained, rapid and healthy growth, while the country's reform
has been carried out in a deep-going way and opening-up drive has
been extending.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, new steps have been taken in promoting the socialist
ethical and cultural progress and building the socialist democracy
and legal system, as well as in army building and expansion of
foreign relations, the article added.
</P>
<P>
"With the people's living standards on the rise steadily, our
country has taken on an extremely vigorous and exciting look," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success of the 15th National Party Congress
and guided by the congress' dominant theme, China's reform,
opening-up and socialist modernization drive is bound to open to a
more splendid chapter, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Senior Official on Economic Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim said today that Malaysia's economic growth
next year would be less than the projected 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth for 1998 would not be less than 6.0
percent, but less than the projected 8 percent, Anwar, who is also
the finance minister, told editors of local news organizations at
a briefing here today, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We will be comfortable with a growth of 7 to 7.5 percent, but
even if we reduce growth to 7 percent, we can still achieve full
employment, given that there have been no reports of major
bankruptcies, closures or lay-offs," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economic growth this year, according to Anwar's
prediction a few weeks ago, would be 8.0 percent. The country had
a growth of 8.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the 1998 Budget would be used as a barometer to
gauge the government's fiscal discipline in tackling the country's
current macroeconomic problems and added that in addition to
recent measures to reduce the current account deficit, such as
deferring major infrastructure projects, the budget would aim at a
more sustainable long term strategy to maintain the nation's
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
He issued a directive to all government bodies, including state
governments and statutory bodies (including self-financed
agencies) to cut down on their spending with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also directed that proposed overseas trade missions be
canceled with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
These new measures are in addition to a recent move to cut
government expenditure by two percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Budget will be reflective of the government's total
commitment to manage our economy prudently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the lessons learnt from the recent speculative attacks
against the Malaysian ringgit, Anwar said that given time,
Malaysia would be able to recover from the doldrums following
recent efforts to improve the current account deficit, such as
cutting down imports of lumpy items, and deferment of some major
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit has fallen over the past two months from about 2.52
against the U.S. dollar to 3.2405/55 at today's close, a fall of
more than 20 per cent against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange has also dropped by about 40
per cent in terms of market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said, "The depreciation of the ringgit and
bearish sentiment on the stock market do not reflect our economic
strength or fundamentals, but I am hopeful that given time, the
situation can improve."
</P>
<P>
He did believe that raising interest rates would be a solution
to the problem, saying, "The last option is to leave it to market
forces. They may not be always rational, but this is a temporary
measure."
</P>
<P>
Anwar assured that Malaysia's economy was strong and stressed
that his government would resist any attempts to disrupt the
economy.

<HEADLINE> "Unique Character" Acceptable to Quebecers, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Most people in the Canadian
province of Quebec think recognition of the province's "unique
character" is as good or better than being certified as a
"distinct society", a new poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is still not enough for them to accept the Canadian
constitution, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of Quebecers say the September 14
declaration by nine of Canada's 10 provincial leaders that
Quebec's "unique character" should be protected is as good as the
"distinct society" recognition.
</P>
<P>
Another eight percent of those surveyed say the newly-coined
phrase offered more than the old one, which was proposed in the
failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional reform
packages.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four percent say that "unique character" offered less
than "distinct society", while 14 percent didn't know or didn't
respond.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 44 percent of Quebecers don't consider the new
recognition enough to make them accept the 1982 constitution,
which was patriated from Britain under the Trudeau government and
was never endorsed by Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the Leger and Leger firm from
September 18 to 23 among 1,002 Quebec voters, and is considered
accurate to 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found continuing majority support for Canadian
unity among Quebec voters.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three percent of the voters say they would vote "No" in a
referendum on Quebec sovereignty, while 46 percent would vote
"Yes".

It highly praised the Chinese Communists for having lived up to
the expectations of the Chinese people and accomplishing the job of
summarizing past experience and preparing for the future during
the 15th National Party Congress and the following First Plenum of
the 15th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The congress and plenum have made the strategic decision to
hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an
all-round advancement of the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the 21st century. They also have
elected a cross-century collective leadership with Comrade Jiang
Zemin at the core, which is strong, powerful and enjoys high
prestige among the people," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the leadership of the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, the article
said, people of all ethnic groups across China are fully confident
that the ultimate goal of economic development will be achieved
and the country will have a brilliant future.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that the first duty now is to study,
publicize and finally implement the gist of the 15th national
Party congress, unify the thinking of officials and the people
across the country, and combine the forces of all Chinese people
to accomplish various tasks laid down by the Party congress.
</P>
<P>
"We must help everyone in the country to understand what the
15th Party congress means to China's future, as well as to their
own destiny," said the article. "The general public will follow
the truth voluntarily and one-heartedly once they understand it."
</P>
<P>
It also reminded Party organizations at all levels and Party
members across the country that the success of the Party's cause
relies upon the masses of people and their support.
</P>
<P>
"If we want the people to comply with the Party's political
line, principles and policies, we must first trust them, respect
their initiatives, take good care of their livelihood, and always
be ready to help them out of trouble," it said.

Noting that the various tasks put forth by the 15th Party
congress are honorable but arduous, the article said China now
faces both golden opportunities and serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
It urged governments at all levels to carry forward the Party's
fine tradition of hard-work, combine the guidelines of the Party
congress with local realities, and adopt both a creative and
down-to-earth style of work.
</P>
<P>
"We should abandon empty talk and formalities and emphasize
practical work and effective results, ensuring that the principles
and policies adopted by the Party congress are implemented in
every region, department and unit," it suggested.
</P>
<P>
The editorial finally noted that historical experience in
founding and developing New China has proved that both the future
and destiny of the country are closely related to the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the Communist Party adopted the correct line,
principles and policies, our country enjoyed prosperity and
promising prospects," it commented.
</P>
<P>
It added that the 15th CPC National Congress has brought a
brighter future to socialist China by offering a glorious guiding
banner, setting a clear development goal and making the Party
stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
rally more closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, work hard and forge ahead with pioneering
spirit, to score more victories in the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics," the editorial concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Official on Government Role in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The role of Hong Kong
government in achieving economic growth is "to create a
business-friendly environment for business to flourish", a Hong
Kong senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise Yue made the remark
when officiating at the opening of the Business License
Information Center (BLIC), which is established as part of the
government's effort to help business.
</P>
<P>
Outlining unbroken economic growth for Hong Kong over the past
three decades, Yue said, "while we have every reason to be proud
of our economic achievements, the government does not lay claim to
be the maker of the success."
</P>
<P>
The task of the government is "not to direct development and
usurp the role of businessmen in making business decisions,
breathing down their neck on what they should or should not do,"
she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Our task, first and foremost, is to create a business-friendly
environment for business to flourish, for businessmen to maximize
their entrepreneurial talent," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in his 1996 budget speech
reiterated the government's determination to become as
business-friendly as possible by the introduction of the Helping
Business Program, which focuses on cutting government red-tape,
streamlining regulatory activities and improving public services
to the business sector.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the BLIC is a direct and practical way to
helping our business," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, there are 450 different licenses and permits that
are related to business operations of all kinds. These licenses
and permits are administered by 36 different bureaus, departments
and agencies. Some of the licensing requirements cut across
several licensing authorities.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the BLIC, businessmen can now look to
a single agent who can give advice on the full range of licensing
requirements for the business they intend to set up, the secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
The center will be particularly useful to small and
medium-sized enterprises which make up the vast majority of the
business community and often cannot afford the service of
business advisers and lack the means to identify licensing
requirements, she said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Army Needs To Be Updated: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia needs to increase its
spending in order to develop new technology to create and produce
modern armaments to equip its army, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of people from literary and art circles,
Sergeyev said the Russian army would stop buying military
hardware of old models and would gradually start to equip itself
with new armaments and hardware in 2001, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister warned that if Russia "does not provide
modern armaments and military hardware for its army, it will
become an exhibition army."
</P>
<P>
The danger of the outbreak of a large-scale war would grow
following the depletion of energy resources in the world. In
preparation for that, the Russian Army "should be strong and
should possess high combat efficiency," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
As for the military reform, he said the Russian army planned to
reduce its command structures in 1997-1998.

<HEADLINE> WFP Delegation Ends China Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the United
Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) has ended its week-long visit
to China to inspect WFP-funded projects in Qinghai and Gansu
provinces, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegation members left here today for the People's
Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK) to see the effects of famine
in areas hit by natural disasters. Other delegates are returning
home or to Rome, where WFP headquarters is based.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegates talked with officials from
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and local governments in the
areas which received project funding.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said they are satisfied with the results of the
WFP projects completed in Huangzhong County of Qinghai, and
Jingtai and Gulang counties in Gansu. They also visited Ping'an
and Hualong counties in Qinghai, where a new WFP-funded project is
to be initiated soon.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Jacques Graisse, executive director of the delegation,
told Xinhua that the China tour has left a lasting impression on
all the delegates, and they have been deeply moved by the great
efforts made by the Chinese people and government in
poverty-eradication.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The purpose of this visit is to let the donors, such
as the United States, Canada, Australia and the Republic of Korea
(ROK), see for themselves the effects of WFP-funded projects in China,
and to have a better understanding of the real situation in
China's poor areas."
</P>
<P>
WFP-funded projects in China are the largest in terms of scale
and benefits, compared with those in other developing countries,
he said, noting that China can be a model for implementing similar
projects in other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to MOA officials, since 1979, WFP has agreed to give
food aid to 59 projects in China, valued at 768 million US
dollars. Of these, 48 have been completed, nine are underway and
one is to be launched.
</P>
<P>
Over 22.3 million people in 184 Chinese cities and counties
have benefited from WFP's work.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China still had 58 million people in
absolute poverty, most of whom live in mountainous areas or
ethnic minority regions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Oppositions to Continue Joint Candidacy Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Two major opposition parties in
South Korea announced today that they will extend their
months-long talks on a single candidacy to produce definite
results.
</P>
<P>
The talks were scheduled to be completed by the end of
this month (September).
</P>
<P>
"We have earnestly negotiated fielding a single opposition
candidate in December's presidential election," said a statement
issued by the parties on the last day of the scheduled negotiations.
"But now we need more time," it said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) and
the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), however, failed to
decide how long they will extend their talks. They will meet again
possibly Thursday to define the extension period.
</P>
<P>
The extension was decided after it was discovered that Kim
Jong-pil, leader of the second largest opposition ULD, was suffering
from loss of popularity among the five declared presidential
contenders. His counterpart, Kim Dae-jung of the main opposition
NCNP, is leading the popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
Through the negotiations, the two parties are reported to have
agreed on a way to share power in the event either one of them
wins in the December 18 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The parties are also reportedly pushing for a constitutional change
in favor of a parliamentary government system as a campaign pledge.
</P>
<P>
But no progress has clearly been made in talks about who to put
forward between the two Kims as the opposition's joint candidate in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The two veteran politicians, both in their early 70s, have said
the coming election is their last chance for a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP claimed the two parties almost agreed to field Kim
Dae-jung as the opposition's choice in the election, while
promising Kim Jong-pil with strengthened premiership under the
proposed parliamentary government system.
</P>
<P>
But the ULD dismissed the claim, saying nothing has yet been agreed
concerning the single candidacy.
</P>
<P>
ULD leader Kim Jong-pil hinted that he may break the
partnership with the NCNP and run in the election separately.
</P>
<P>
He has recently ordered his party to form a party presidential
election committee to prepare his own campaign.

<HEADLINE> Lee Hoi-chang Takes Over Ruling Party Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Presidential candidate lee
Hoi-chang of South Korea's ruling New Korea Party (NKP) was
elected president of the party at its national convention today.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a former Supreme Court judge, joined the NKP early last
year before the April parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of power in the NKP is expected to boost the
political status of candidate Lee, who is suffering a loss of
popularity among the people due to allegations that his two sons
intentionally lost weight to evade military service.
</P>
<P>
To enhance party unity, representative Lee Han-dong, leader of
the party's conservative Minjong faction, who lost the party
presidential nomination to Lee in July, was named party chairman,
the number two post in the NKP.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains to be seen if Lee will successfully promote
party harmony after his election. A group of his opponents
reportedly plan to leave the party in support of former Kyonggi
governor Rhee In-je, who left the party to join the presidential
race on his own.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, reports claim that several members of the party's
largest Minju faction who supported Lee's rivals in the July
nomination race are also considering quitting the party, unless Lee
succeeds in improving his ratings by next month.
</P>
<P>
At today's convention, Lee strongly warned his opponents in the
party against any moves harming party unity.
</P>
<P>
"With the presidential election only 80 days away, the party
has not been gearing up for the vote, or facing the challenges
from outside and inside," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, who maintains his links with the ruling party as
honorary party president, urged party members to rally behind Lee
in the December presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has been embroiled in a huge intra-party feud
since Lee was elected as its standard-bearer. Citing Lee's falling
popularity ratings, his opponents are exerting pressure on him to
withdraw from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Recent public surveys show Lee's approval rating as ranking
third, far below front-running Kim Dae-jung of main opposition
National Congress for New Politics, a veteran opposition leader,
and the 49-year-old Rhee.
</P>
<P>
Today's Taegu event marks the first time that a ruling party
has held a national convention in a provincial city.
</P>
<P>
Political observers interpret the move as a wooing gesture to
voters of Taegu and North Kyongsang Province, an area where none
of the five presidential candidates were born.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Police Urged to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Police in the 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC) should strengthen
their cooperation in the fight against crime if the region is to
be successfully integrated, a Zimbabwean minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said efforts toward
regional integration in economic and other spheres would fail in
an environment where cross border crime and related activities
have been rife.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing delegates to a Southern African Regional
Police Chiefs Cooperation (sarpcco) extraordinary meeting in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
''Sarpcco, therefore, provides the pillar on which the success
of all other forms of integration rest as we all look forward to
take full advantage and maximize the benefits of the existing
peace within the region,'' said Dabengwa.
</P>
<P>
The fruits of cooperation in the fight against cross border
crime, the minister noted, were beginning to be seen.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,576 stolen vehicles were recovered during the
first phase of Voyager Four operation, an exercise aimed at
dealing with cross border vehicle thefts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 143 car theft suspects were arrested under the
operation which involved Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> US Criticism of China's Birth Control Misplaced: Former PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States' criticism
of China's family planning policy and its efforts to influence the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations' policies towards Burma and
Cambodia are misplaced, Australian former Prime Minister Malcolm
Fraser said today.
</P>
<P>
"These countries are not going to be told by the United States
what they ought to do and why they should do what the United
States says," the former prime minister said at a luncheon in
Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
China's family planning policy is effective; it has stopped a
potential 90 million births a year, the Australian Associated
Press said in a report on Fraser's speech.
</P>
<P>
"Good relationships are a process of consultations and cooperation.
It's not a process of one large country telling other countries how
they ought to perform, how they ought to behave," said Fraser, who
was Australia's prime minister during 1975-1983.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the United States to stop trying to dictate
to Asia over human rights and to give China greater recognition as
a major economic power.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said the United States should stop blocking China's
entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"As the Chinese economy grows, China is going to have a
great effect on raw material prices, raw material supplies ... on
trade and on markets worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China should be a member of all the world's major economic
institutions, I believe, as quickly as possible," the former prime
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Fraser stressed that Australia's future lay with Asia, saying
the country will be a better one with multi-cultures flourishing.

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Opens Deng Xiaoping Theory Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University in the
Chinese capital officially opened a course on Deng Xiaoping
Theory today.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, a stop during Deng's famous southern tour in 1992
when he gave speeches on accelerating reforms and opening-up in
China, opened the course in 1994, the first Chinese city to do so.
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m., classroom 109 of Beijing University was filled
with enthusiastic students. Some teachers also stopped by to hear
today's lecture by Wu Shuqing, an economist and former president
of the university, who talked about the primary stage of socialism
and the policies of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Combining theory and true life examples, Wu's lecture received
laughter and applause. When the lecture was over, many students were
reluctant to leave, raising questions about public ownership to Wu.
</P>
<P>
"What a wonderful course. It quenched my thirst," said Chen
Wei, a student majoring in political and administrative
management.
</P>
<P>
"I've found answers to many of my questions," said Zhang Biao,
another student. "And I am full of confidence in my country's
future."
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhan'an, head of the Marxism College of the university,
told Xinhua that five departments have included Deng Xiaoping
Theory in their curriculum.
</P>

Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guideline for the whole Party and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"My purpose is to make Deng Xiaoping Theory understandable
among the students, and let it solve real problems," professor Wu
said.

<HEADLINE> More Green in Shanghai's Downtown Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial
and industrial center of Shanghai has squeezed 129 green areas out
of the grey rooftops of houses in its downtown areas this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Municipal Government, in conjunction
with the renovation of old city proper, Shanghai has built 129
green areas this year, exceeding the target set by local leading
officials at the start of 1997 that 100 green areas be built in
the downtown this year.
</P>
<P>
In the Pudong New Area, a central green space covering 100,000
square meters has been built on the site of former run-down
houses, where more than 3,200 families lived. The project cost 800
million yuan (96.39 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other urban districts such as Hongkou and Luwan have also
sacrificed valuable business space for the beautification project.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has built 1.73 million square meters of public
green areas this year, and more are expected to be built in the
downtown by the end of the year, increasing the total number to
more than 140, the official noted.

<HEADLINE> Bridges on Yangtze Play Pivot Role in China's National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- On average, a new bridge was
thrown across the Yangtze River, the longest in China, in each of
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
These new bridges have made the river belt the most dynamic
economic powerhouse in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, a cross-river highway-railway bridge is being built
in Wuhu of east China's Anhui Province. It is expected to cut
short the length between Xiamen Special Economic Zone in southeast
China's province of Fujian and the Chinese capital of Beijing by
800 km, serving as a link between northern and southern China.
Upon completion in 2000, it is to become a pivot of communications.
</P>
<P>
China has built five bridges on the Yangtze River with a total
investment of 10 billion yuan since the country launched a
campaign to boost economic development along the Yangtze five
years ago, said an official with the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Three other cross-river bridges, being built at Jiangyin,
Nanjing and Chongqing cities, will open to traffic in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the number of bridges under
construction or to be planned on the Yangtze River will be
increased to 36, and this is something unprecedented in the world.
</P>
<P>
Along with the bridge building boom, more harbors have emerged
along the section of the Yangtze between Shanghai and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have seen construction of 100 new harbors,
and 16 of them are opened to foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
With improvement of infrastructure, the gross domestic product
(GDP) of eight riverside cities with Pudong New Area as a
pacesetter grew at an annual average of 15 percent in recent
years, much higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed that areas along the Yangtze River will be
the economic stars in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of Jiangxi, Anhui and Hubei, which enjoy
favorable geological positions, were among the fastest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang Bridge, which strides over the middle reaches of
the Yangtze and opened to traffic In 1993, serves as an important
link on the Beijing-Kowloon Railway trunk line.
</P>
<P>
The new bridges have helped speed up construction of state key
projects. Xiling Bridge handles 50,000 tons of building materials
a day for the Three Gorges Project which is underway and is
believed the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Though the history of bridge building dated back to ancient
times, China lagged behind other countries in contemporary age
until 1957 when it built its first bridge on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The second bridge, with a span of 6,772 meters, was completed
in 1968 in Nanjing, setting a world record. Before long, a
much longer one which has a 10,497-meter-long railway and a
5,647-meter-long highway, was built in Wuhu, becoming the world's
longest.
</P>
<P>
Some bridges were built with funds raised by non-governmental
organizations and even by farmers.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception Marks 48th National Day (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today hailed
the recently-concluded 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party as a great milestone in the history of the Party
and the country, saying that the event is bound to have a
far-reaching impact on China's future development.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks at a grand reception he hosted in the
Great Hall of the People this evening to mark the 48th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan,
Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, Li Lanqing and Rong Yiren
were among those present at the reception.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 will be an important year carrying out the
guidelines of the congress and implementing the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) in a comprehensive way," Li said while proposing
a toast.
</P>
<P>
China shall continue to implement the policies and guidelines
set forth by the Party Central Committee by conscientiously
promoting economic structural changes and a shift in the mode of
economic growth, maintaining the sustained, rapid and sound growth
of the national economy, and bringing about all-around social
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that measures should be taken to strengthen
agriculture so as to have an even better harvest next year.
</P>
<P>
As the reform of state-owned enterprises is a priority of
China's economic restructuring at present and in the days ahead,
he said, greater efforts should be made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
To do this well, he added, leaders should have a strong sense
of the policy, proceed from the specific conditions of different
localities, act in compliance with the law governing economic
development, respect the will of the people and actively advance
the reform in a down-to-earth manner while constantly summing up
the country's experience.
</P>
<P>
Financial work should be managed well and precautions should be
taken against financial risks by further intensifying financial
restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall further improve socialist democracy and legal system
and actively advance institutional reform. And we shall further
intensity our efforts to build a diligent and honest
administration and fight against corruption, and take effective
and comprehensive measures for overall control of public
security," the premier emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Governments and leading cadres at all levels should do even
more to care for the well-being of the people, and especially help
the needy workers and peasants to overcome their difficulties in
making a living, he noted.

"We are convinced that under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and the leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the Chinese people of all ethnic
groups, through hard work in united struggle, will certainly score
new achievements next year in reform and opening-up and the
socialist modernization drive," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, he noted, the
policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy have been
implemented and the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has been performing well.
</P>
<P>
The recent annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the
International Monetary Fund, which were successfully held in Hong
Kong, have increased the international community's understanding
of Hong Kong and have shown that the status of Hong Kong as an
international financial center is highly valued and people are
confident in Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for Macao's return to the motherland in 1999 are
progressing smoothly, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"To resolve the Taiwan issue in accordance with the policy of
`peaceful reunification and one country, two systems' is our
principled position," he said, expressing the hope that Taiwan
authorities will set store by the overall national interests and
begin political negotiations with the mainland under the one-China
principle at an early date.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many difficulties we might encounter on our road
of advance, the goal of complete national reunification will be
finally achieved," he said.

<P>
Marked progress has been made in raising the productive forces,
increasing the overall national strength and improving the people's
livelihoods, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, China's economy has maintained a good momentum of
growth, with price increases continuing to drop. Despite severe
drought in quite a few areas this autumn, this year's harvest
looks promising on the whole, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the reform of state-owned enterprises is in
full swing, which has resulted in improved economic returns and
some positive changes.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic cooperation with the outside world has continued
to expand while the import and export trade has kept growing," he
noted, adding that China's foreign exchange reserve has also
increased by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
There is an amply supply of commodities in the urban and rural
markets and the people's quality of life has continued to improve,
he said, noting that new achievements have been scored in the
areas of science and technology, education, culture, public health
and sports as well as in the building of the nation's defense
system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, great efforts have been made to promote socialist
ethical and cultural progress and strengthen the socialist
democracy and legal system. China's diplomacy has also made
progress and the country's international status has been further
enhanced with each passing day, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The entire country is now a land of prosperity with economic
growth, political stability, ethnic harmony, social progress and
people living and working in peace and contentment, the premier
said.

"Though we have scored tremendous progress, we should always
soberly keep in mind that China is still a developing country in
the primary stage of socialism. With uneven regional economic
development, there are still more than 50 million people without
adequate supply of food and clothing," Li said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he acknowledged, with the structural readjustment
of the economy and the further advancement of the reform of the
state-owned enterprises, the task of re-employment for laid-off
workers is becoming tough and public security in some areas is
still not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Certain unhealthy phenomena like corruption continue to pose
serious problems, he said, adding that "we must face up to the
problems on our way ahead and are working in earnest to solve
them."
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Li said, the world is rapidly
moving in the direction of multi-polarization, which has become an
undeniable historical trend.
</P>
<P>
The development towards multipolarity serves the interest of
peace and development and is conducive to the establishment of an
equitable and rational new international political and economic
order and the maintenance of the legitimate rights and interests
of all countries, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the Chinese government will unswervingly
pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, oppose hegemonism,
safeguard world peace, and promote the cause for human progress.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to establish and develop, on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, friendly relations and
cooperation with all countries in the world, and together with the
people throughout the world work hard for the establishment of a
new world of peace, security, cooperation and prosperity," the
Chinese premier concluded.

PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned what it
called ``foreign intervention in Iraqi territory,'' after Iraq
accused Iranian planes of bombing two military bases of an Iranian
opposition group inside Iraq on Monday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt reaffirmed
France's support to Iraq's efforts to keep its territorial

</P>
<P>
Backed by the United States, Turkey has been repeatedly launching
military operations in northern Iraq against the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
``We are worried about the foreign military intervention in Iraqi
territory. It is in effect a fragile region where foreign operations
can have grave destabilizing effect,'' said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed worry over the safety of the civilians in
northern Iraq, now frequently subjected to military actions from
troops of Iraq, Turkey as well as Kurdish groups.
</P>
<P>
``We are equally worried about the consequences (of these
military actions) upon civil population (in the region), who have
already been severely tested. France is particularly attached to the
sovereignty of the states and it reproaches all violation of this
principle,'' said the spokesman.

ISLAMABAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban

of Mazar-i-Sharif have offered enemy fighters an unhindered escape
from the city, said reports monitored here today.
</P>
<P>

"We are trying to further tighten our net so the opposition are

</P>
<P>
Late Monday Taliban forces were reported to be a mere five km

was also audible to the north and west.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi asserted that Taliban fighters were now "digging in" in
their current positions, although he could not give exact details
on the location.
</P>
<P>
He said the gains were made following a massive late-Monday
afternoon Taliban attack on the opposition's seat of shadow
government, and the forces were now attempting to make "gradual
advances."
</P>
<P>
However no independent information was immediately available on
Tuesday's military developments in Mazar-e-Sharif, which is also
the only Afghan city not held by the hard-line militia.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading American newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Brightening economic fortunes are spreading to more
Americans, extending increasingly to racial and ethnic minorities
and reaching farther down the economic ladder as the nation's
economic recovery moves briskly through its sixth year, a number
of reports indicate.
</P>
<P>
-- Delighted at a 2 billion U.S. dollars contract signed
between a French oil company and Iran, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin of France rejected an American law that claims the power to
impose sanctions even on non-American companies investing more
than 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Income for the typical American household rose in 1996 for
the second consecutive year, the Census Bureau reported Monday,
signaling that the nation's economic expansion is spreading its
benefits more widely across the population. But the gap between
the rich and poor continues to widen.
</P>
<P>
-- With Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acting as
mediator, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed Monday to
revive their stalled peace talks by returning to discussion of
issues such as releasing Palestinian prisoners, redeploying
Israeli forces from parts of the West Bank and providing an
airport and seaport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A "fast track" compromise was reached between the Clinton
administration and Republican leaders. The deal, which removes a
provision strengthening labor rights, is expected to result in
Senate Finance panel approval today of legislation giving the
president authority to negotiate trade agreements on an expected
basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Finance
Hailemelekot Teklegiorgis today said Ethiopia needs Kuwait's
support in its economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during talks with the visiting Kuwaiti
parliamentary delegation which is currently paying a five-day
visit to Ethiopia, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said, Kuwait has demonstrated great will to
assist Ethiopia's bid to improve its national economy, and he
recalled that the Kuwaiti government has provided 25 million U.S.
Dollars for the reconstruction of Addis Ababa international
airport.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Kuwaiti delegation Mubarak Al-Khurinej, on his
part, expressed conviction that Ethiopia would continue to
support the United Nations resolution urging Iraq to release
Kuwaiti war prisoners, compensate for gulf-war victims and return
looted property.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Ethiopian government to work toward the
implementation of the resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti delegation arrived here Saturday. It was received
Monday by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Ethiopian
President Negasso Gidada separately.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- American pop music superstar
Mariah Carey recently discussed her life and work in an interview
with a prestigious Beijing newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But unlike its conventional practice, the interview was
conducted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese people are buying Internet access, which
has given a great number of Chinese PC users more computer options
and introduced them to the joy of traveling on the Information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to listing on the Internet, the Little Swan Corporation,
a namebrand washing machine producer in Wuxi city, east China, had
its output value increased by one fifth in the first half of this
year and invited two foreigners to be its deputy general manager
and assistant to the general manager.
</P>
<P>
Internet was introduced to China in April 1994. A month later,
a domestic system was opened, providing four categories of
service, including science and technology, education and
communications for 150,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 100 various kinds of non-governmental
computer service centers have sprung up across the country to
help Chinese PC owners onto the net.
</P>
<P>
The domestic system has been diversified to meet growing
needs. A program to exchange information on the supply and demand
for idle equipment and means of production was launched in June
this year by the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture has opened a network
featuring information on flower trade. Other networks in operation
cover tourism, family teaching and food sales.
</P>
<P>
Last June, China opened the first anti-cancer club on Internet,
by which, cancer patients can obtain advice from specialists, and
exchange views on treatment.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, only 150,000 PC users in China have been connected
with the Internet. The figure in other parts of Asia was as high
as three million, said Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary-general of
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He believes that there is a great potential for computer
network development in China in the coming years.

BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 compatriots
from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Taiwan and
Macao, overseas Chinese and nationals residing abroad mounted the
Tian'anmen Rostrum yesterday after attending a national day
reception in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At the rostrum, which overlooked a sea of flowers,
lanterns and an exuberant crowd, they talked about the great
development and bright future of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud of the prosperous motherland," said a Chinese
from Germany, who brought his wife and child to Beijing. "I came
back to China every a few years, and each time I got here I was
surprised by the big changes I saw."
</P>
<P>
A 70-year-old Taiwan resident, whose family has its origin
in east China's Fujian Province, said, "I believe our motherland
will finally achieve its unification."
</P>
<P>
He added that the "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan"
principles are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
"My friends and I are all against 'Taiwan independence'," said
the man, who had just listened to Vice-Premier Qian Qichen's
speech at the reception, in which Qian said that the Chinese
government will continue to protect the legal rights of
Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China will enter the 21st century with a

<HEADLINE> France Says Government Has No Role in Total's Iran Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
played no role in the signing of a 2 billion U.S. dollar gas
contract between the oil company Total and Iran, French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said today.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Total contract with Iran "purely commercial and not
political," Rummelhardt said the French government "neither
approves it, nor authorizes it, nor stops it.
</P>
<P>
"Total is free to sign this contract, as long as it respects
French and international laws," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is an apparently softening of tone by Paris after Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin severely criticized the U.S. for trying to
impose its domestic laws upon other countries.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation between Total and Iran on signing oil deals was
raised by U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright when she met
with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine in New York on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ambassador to France Felix Rohatyn also reportedly
lodged a protest with the French Foreign Ministry last week for
Total's decision to sign the contract.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it is considering imposing sanctions on Total for
its violation of the U.S. Iran-Libya sanctions act, also called
the D'Amato Act.
</P>
<P>
The act bans all companies throughout the world from investing
more than 40 million dollars in the oil and hydrocarbon sector of
Iran and Libya, which Washington has accused of backing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac avoided commenting on the U.S.
threat to impose sanctions on Total because it was a contract
signed by a private company, said members of the presidential
staff.
</P>
<P>
The staff members added that Chirac has repeatedly expressed
his disapproval of the D'Amato Act, which he considers
"non-conforming to international law."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Christopher Bush, a State Department spokesman,
said on Monday that the U.S. intended to apply the D'Amato law
fully.
</P>
<P>
"Our position on any investments in Iranian gas and oil fields
is clear: Such investment makes more resources available for Iran
to use in supporting terrorism and pursuing missiles and nuclear
weapons," said the spokesman.

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The end of September
witnessed the simultaneous launching of the Chinese and English
versions of Microsoft's latest Internet browser, Internet Explorer
4.0 (IE 4.0), in Beijing and San Francisco in the US state of
California.
</P>
<P>
This ended the trend of Chinese-made versions of the world's
leading software producer appearing later than the
English-versions.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony today, Duh Jia-Bin, president of Microsoft
(China) Co., Ltd, said Microsoft has all along been seeking to
speed up the development of the Chinese version of its software.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, from Windows 3.1 to today's Internet
Explorer 4.0, the time lag between the launch of Chinese and
English versions has rapidly decreased from two years. And the
majority of the development work of the Chinese version of IE 4.0
was done in China.
</P>
<P>
"IE 4.0 integrates the personal computer and the Internet,"
making it easy for users to search for information either on their
PC or the Internet, Duh said, adding that "this is an expansion of
Microsoft's concept `Imformation at Your Fingertips.'"
</P>
<P>
Seven major Web sites, such as Data Communication Bureau,
People's Daily and China Economic Information, have been
pre-installed as Active Channels in Chinese IE 4.0 and are just
one click away for users.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Microsoft has more than 300 authorized sales agents,
and has a direct technological support relationship with 30-plus
software developers, and 30-plus central government organs and
banks.
</P>
<P>
Duh said he believes the expansion of Microsoft's China
business demonstrates its confidence in the country's huge market
potential and rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Bill Gates, Microsoft president and CEO, has paid four visits
to China in the past two and a half years. Beijing receives a

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Anti-rape Bill Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today signed long-delayed anti-rape bill into law which
redefines rape as a crime against persons and no longer as a crime
against chastity.
</P>
<P>
Ramos described the new law as "a strong confirmation of the
continuing commitment of the Legislative and of the Executive to
pursue social reforms to benefit our disadvantaged sectors."
</P>
<P>
The signing into law of the anti-rape bill is a culmination of
over seven years of legislative work, with the active
participation of organized women's groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the old laws, rape was viewed as a forced assertion of
male dominance over women, and the crime was associated with the
subordination of women to men in the society.
</P>
<P>
With the reclassification of rape as a crime against persons,
the government and its instruments of justice can now file and
pursue a rape case on their own, unlike before when usually only
the victim herself or her next of kin could file a case.
</P>
<P>
To comprehend the full significance of the new law is to
understand the added suffering imposed upon the rape victims who
bear the burden and shame of having to prove that they are not
willing parties to the crime, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the shame felt by so many victims," he said, "they
usually chose to remain silent rather than be further dishonored
during tedious and well-publicized investigations."
</P>
<P>
The new law also recognizes that rape and other social ills
will be reduced only if other preventive and corrective measures
are put in place.

stability and we are full of confidence in Hong Kong's future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hu explained the gist of the 15th National Congress of the CPC
to the young people, saying that one of the important aspects of
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory is to
continue to forge ahead the reunification course based on the "One
Country, Two Systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's future and development will depend on
the younger generation. Therefore, Hong Kong's young people should

CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly higher today against the US currency in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 71.97 US cents from 71.87 US
cents yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said today that the travel allowance scandal

"The further it blows up, the more seriously offshore investors
are seeing and thinking about it," said Stuart Moore, St George

<HEADLINE> UN Regrets over Taliban's Detention of European Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Head of the U.N. Special
Mission for Afghanistan Norbert Holl today expressed "deep regret"
over the detention of a European commissioner by the Islamic
Taliban militia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
European commissioner for humanitarian aid Emma Bonino and her
entourage, who were on a two-day visit to Afghanistan, were
reportedly detained late Monday by the Taliban authorities for
over three hours for taking pictures of women.
</P>
<P>
The incident is "jeopardizing a personality enjoying diplomatic
immunity and representing the European Union," said Holl, who held
talks with Bonino upon her arrival here from Kabul Monday evening,
in a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
"Bonino came to Afghanistan on purely humanitarian grounds in
order to collect first-hand information on the economic, social
and human rights situation in Afghanistan, including the situation
of women," Holl said.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary arrest of Ms. Bonino and the treatment which she
had to endure has unfortunately complicated the relationship
between the Taliban authorities and the European Community."
</P>
<P>
It may be noteworthy that the European Community and its member
states are the largest donor to Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two thirds of Afghanistan's
territory and the capital of Kabul, have vowed to impose a strict
Islamic law in the war-torn country. In areas under Taliban
control both photography and filming of "living creatures" is
strictly banned.

<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14 countries have
signed the memorandum of understanding for "Africa One" submarine
cable network for direct telephone ties among African countries.
</P>
<P>
The project, estimated to cost three billion U.S. dollars,
will provide direct telecommunications interconnection between
African countries instead of the present system of routing

dollars annually, the Daily Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cable link would be one of the several infrastructure
building blocks along with satellite systems and terrestrial
networks that are planned for building the global information
infrastructure of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Africa One" coordination committee is made up of Nigeria,
Cameroun, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia and

<HEADLINE> Jordan Considers Doha Summit Chance for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has said it
considered the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic summit a chance to save the stalled Middle East peace
process, the Omani news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali told the news
agency during his visit to Oman that the forthcoming conference
due on November 16-18 in Qatar should be treated as an
opportunity to solve political differences between the Arabs and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Majali also stressed that his country will take part in the
summit which has been opposed by some Arab countries because of
an expected Israeli participation.
</P>
<P>
Majali arrived in the Omani capital of Muscat Saturday for a
three-day official visit to discuss economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he met with Qatari senior officials and
discussed with them the MENA conference, which has divided the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian National Authority have
announced their boycott of the conference in protest against the
deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace talks. Syria and Lebanon had
boycotted all the previous three conferences.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia also favored a
boycott, saying that they would not appear at the conference
unless major achievements are made in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, most of other Arab states adopt a wait-and-see stand
toward the conference. Qatari officials said they have not received
any refusal from these countries.
</P>
<P>
The controversial conference to include Arab states, Israel
and their partners in the industrialized world was launched in
1994. Its last session was held in Cairo last November.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Continue Settlement Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that despite the announced
resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Israel will
continue building settlements at the stage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a ceremony in his office on the
sale of Bank Hapoalim, Netanyahu said that Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had only agreed to discuss
the concept of "time-out" of Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's tough comments came one day after U.S. secretary
of State Madeleine Albright announced in New York that Israel and
the PNA agreed to resume peace talks to break the six-month
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's strong remarks apparently dampened the
newly emerging optimism about the peace process, which both
sides have just agreed to resume after a six-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu stressed the need for the PNA to continue
its fight against terror, adding there could be no real peace
talks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to discuss the concept of time-out, and each
side has of course its own views. I think the important thing is
that we have argued for a long time that peace and terror cannot
coexist," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been insisting that our Palestinian partners fight
terrorism, I think that is the principal framework of the
agreement that was reached yesterday. If they fight terror, we
will continue with the peace (process), if they don't, we won't
continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of peace talks was announced after the
U.S.-brokered talks between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
and PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). The two sides are
expected to resume the talks on implementing the interim
agreements on October 6.
</P>
<P>
This was the first breakthrough since the July 30 Mahane
Yehuda twin suicide bombings and the September 4 Ben Yehuda
triple bombings in Jerusalem, in which 25 people were killed and
over 300 other wounded.
</P>
<P>
The wave of terror attacks, carried out by the anti-Israeli
militant group Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), aggravated the
already tense situation between the two sides which was caused by
Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in
March.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said in New York that while the PNA agreed to resume
cooperations in all fields including fighting terrorism with
Israel, it thought that Israel must refrain from taking
unilateral steps, including the closure of Palestinian self-rule
areas, settlement activities, land confiscation and demolition of
Arab houses.
</P>
<P>
In her comments on Netanyahu's statements, PNA Minister of
Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi said that the peace negotiations
could not continue unless Israel stops all building
settlements. "This is the bottom line as far as all Palestinians
are concerned," she said.

At the conference, heads of more than 400 large enterprises from

and countermoves of the economy globalization.
</P>
<P>
Wang introduced that at the just-ended 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, President Jiang Zemin expounded the
theory of the socialist market economy, indicating new development
of the theory.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the minister said, China will give state sector
strategic reorganization, aiming to create some major enterprises
with competition beyond region, industry and ownership.
</P>
<P>
China henceforth will speed up the reforms of infrastructure
fields like resources and transportation, and open the finance,
trade and service areas gradually, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China will also amplify the foreign-oriented legislations to
promote the transparency of the foreign trade system, in a bid to
create favourable conditions for foreign investors participating
in the Chinese market competition, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statements received warm welcome from the
participants of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The International Industrial Conference, a gathering of
high-ranking leaders of the global industrial enterprises
initiated in 1957, was held every four years in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> UAE Puts Ceiling on Wedding Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cabinet of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) has approved a draft law putting a ceiling on
wedding expenses in the Gulf country, official newspaper Emirates
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which sets dowries at a maximum of 20,000
dirhams (some 5,500 U.S. dollars) and limiting wedding parties to
one day, is aimed at curbing soaring wedding expenses which have
become a heavy burden to the UAE's youth.
</P>
<P>
The draft law which also sets a 30,000 dirhams (about 8,200
dollars) limit on divorce compensation is part of the
government's effort to promote marriage among its nationals.
</P>
<P>
Wedding expenses in the UAE averaged at 100,000 dirhams (about
27,000 dollars) and wedding parties usually last for days. The
high wedding cost forced many local men to take foreign women as
brides.
</P>
<P>
UAE officials worry that the native population will decline
further if UEA men continue to marry foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The natives only constitute one quarter of the country's 2.4
million population as the rest are expatriate workers mostly from
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up a marriage fund in 1992 to help
local youth who could not afford to marry.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Cabinet approved the draft law in
line with instructions of UAE's President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
al-Nahyan.

replacing the existing southwesterly winds, according to Victor
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical
Services Administration (PAGASA) blamed the southwesterly winds
for bringing the heavy smoke from the raging forest fires in
Indonesia into the Philippine shores.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to worry in the longer-term due to the
forthcoming prevalence of the northeasterly winds," Victor Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
The southeasterly winds will blow the bulk of the smoke from
Indonesia instead towards the Malaysian Peninsula and adjacent
areas for the next two to three days, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to PAGASA's observation reports, there was a
short-lived improvement Monday in the horizontal visibility to
about 10 kilometers in the southern Philippine provinces of
Palawan and Zamboanga.
</P>
<P>
But Palawan is now back again to a low visibility situation,
showing a clear range of only four kilometers, while in Zamboanga,
visibility is reduced to five kilometers.
</P>
<P>
But the visibility condition over the rest of the southern
Philippines has already normalized to greater than 10 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Jews Continue to Be Israeli Majority : Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jews will stay the
majority in Israel for the foreseeable future due to continued
immigration and high birth rates in certain Jewish sectors,
according to newly-released government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 State Statistical Abstract issued Monday indicated
that the country's Jewish majority would be guaranteed for at
least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Israel's population increased by 140,000, of whom
88,000 were Jews. Some 71,000 new Jewish immigrants arrived in
Israel last year, including 59,000 from former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli current population totals 5,863,000, of whom 80.2
percent are Jewish, 14.9 percent Muslims, 3.2 percent Christians,
and 1.7 percent Druse.
</P>
<P>
Although immigration remained one of main factors contributing
to the population increase in Israel, the number of immigrants
continued the decline since the 1991 peak, as 5,000 fewer
immigrants arriving in Israel last year compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of children born in Israel rose 4 percent in
1996 from 1995 to 121,300, representing 21.3 births per 1,000
people. Jewish women gave births to 83,700 children, or 69
percent of the new births last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Current-Account Shortfall Down Sharply in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by strong exports, the
current-account shortfall of South Korea narrowed sharply to 714
million U.S. dollars in August from the 3.6 billion dollars
registered a year ago, said the Bank of Korea (BOK).
</P>
<P>
Following a continuous double-digit export growth in July and
August as well as the dropping import in August, the cumulative
deficit for the first eight months this year fell to 11.83 billion
dollars from last year's 15.77 billion dollars .
</P>
<P>
"If this trend continues, the nation's current account
shortfall is expected to reach about 14 billion U.S. dollars in
1997, falling below the central bank's earlier forecast of 17
billion dollars for the year," said Paeng Dong-joon, a BOK
manager in charge of research.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a record-high deficit of 3 billion dollars in
January, the nation's current-account shortfall dropped for five
consecutive months to 241 million in June. The red-ink figure
soared again to 977 million in July.
</P>
<P>
The weakening South Korean won against the U.S. dollar and
the business boom in the United States and Europe had caused the
nation's export surge, said the BOK official.
</P>
<P>
In August, South Korea enjoyed a 116 million dollars surplus
in its trade balance, a turnabout from the 310 million dollars
deficit in July, making the trade deficit for the first eight
months of the year amount to 6.26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the shortfall in the invisible trade balance rose from
629 million dollars in July to 727 million dollars in August
because of the enormous amounts of payments related to overseas
travel by South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Korea's foreign-exchange holdings amounted to
31.1 billion dollars at the end of August, down 2.5 billion from
the previous month, the central bank said.

</P>
<P>
Produced by the Beijing Forbidden City Film Co., it is the

Chinese embassies and consulates abroad," said Zhang Heping,
general manager of the Forbidden City Film Co..
</P>
<P>
"The short film is also a gift for the 48th anniversary of new
China," he added.
</P>
<P>
The film has 52 shots, including a dozen selected from old
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television
believed that the film version is bound to contribute to the
patriotic education of the public, especially children.

<HEADLINE> PNA Launches Drive to Save Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Higher Education Ministry is launching a campaign
to ensure university studies for 40,000 Palestinian students who
face financial problems.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on today's Israeli English
newspaper The Jerusalem Post, PNA Higher Education Minister Hanan
Ashrawi said she needed to raise 5 million U.S. dollars a semester,
or 10 million dollars a year, to ensure that the students who
can not pay for the tuition will continue their studies.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing an institutional breakdown in the public and
private sectors, and the last thing we need is for students to
go out into the streets," she said, adding that she would try to
prevent students from striking to protest plans to raise the
university fees.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Palestinian students pay an average of 350 dollars
per semester, about 25 percent of the real cost, in
tuition. Student leaders and Palestinian officials have been
negotiating to prevent a steep rise in tuition.
</P>
<P>
The students claimed that they have been hurt by
deteriorating economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, due to the consistent closures imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials have pledged that university students would pay
the current rates, while new students will pay an undetermined
increase that will be counted against a rate to be set in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi maintained that she has to raise the fees, although
she would also make sure that the students can afford the
tuition. She pointed out that the PNA cannot raise funds to
maintain current tuition fees, because it has not instituted a
tax to pay for higher education and has not succeeded in
obtaining funds from donor nations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ashrawi is raising money from European Union
nations. She revealed that so far she had won a pledge of 1
million dollars from Holland, one tenth of what the universities
need for the new school year.

<P>
ALMA ATA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Abishevich Nazarbayev met here today with General Andre Nikolayev,
the visiting Russian President of the Frontierforce Commander
Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent State and Director
of the Federal Border Service, on Kazakh-Russian bilateral
relations and border issues.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev told the press after the meeting that the border
defence sectors of the two countries are prepared to draft accords
on their border and border defence in a bid to ascertain the
legal status of their common borders.
</P>
<P>
Law breakers are currently committing activities such as
smuggling and drug trafficking between the countries, which have
greatly harmed the border security and economic development of the
two countries, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Nikolayev noted Russia and Kazakhstan have decided
to take joint steps to solidify border security by cracking down
on all the illegal activities so as to safeguard the interests of
the two countries and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking from Kazakhstan to Russia and then to Europe
through the Central Asian countries is very rampant, and to
counter it, countries concerned are trying to co-ordinate their
actions, Nikolayev added.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day working visit here, Nikolayev also met with
Kazakh defence minister Mukhtar Kapashevich Altynbayev.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Vows to Defend Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has warned it was ready to defend the ports in the capital
Freetown if the West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) tried to
attack them.
</P>
<P>
a report reaching here quoted a statement of the junta on
Monday as saying that it would react "positively" if thet ECOMOG
force attempts "to take over two major ports as well as other
mini ports" along the entire coast.
</P>
<P>
The statement is seen as a response to ECOMOG Field Commander
Max Khobe who declared on Sunday that the naval wing of his unit
"will intervene in full force to enforce sanctions and embargo
mandated by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS)".
</P>
<P>
Economic santions and embargo were approved by ECOWAS at its
summit last month as a means to force the junta to return power
the legitimate government it ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Khobe, who did not specify when intervention would take place,
said "The naval boast will police the length and breadth of
Sierra Leone's territorial waters to make sure that even canoes
and trawlers don't dodge the ECOMOG net."
</P>
<P>
"We are taking over from the air and infantry wings of ECOMOG
and the naval ships will now carry out most of the military
operations effected by the ECOMOG jets," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, if ECOMOG follows through on the
statement, it could lead to an imminent clash between ECOMOG
forces and the Sierra Leone army, which by all indications would
be bloody.
</P>
<P>
Several clashes have been reported since the embargo was
enforced, with ships at the freetown ports accused of unloading
armes and ammunition attacked by ECOMOG planes.
</P>
<P>
The junta has deployed troops with anti-aircraft equipment at
the main commerical port in the east of Freetown, where it
alleged ECOMOG air raids had killed dozens of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
The other port, the government wharf, is in the central
business district which is the base of Sierra Leone's small naval
wing.

<HEADLINE> Rice Shortage Forces Liberians for Substitutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Acute shortage of rice, the
staple food of Liberians, has forced the rural people in the
country to look for other substitutes which are few available.
</P>
<P>
The people in some of Liberia's rural areas, particularly
those bordering Cote d'Ivoire, have the only choice to eat
cassava, a plant with tuberous roots, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the heavy reliance of cassava, farmers were
exposed to the current crisis and now selling vegetables at
inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
In some towns, the deplorable road conditions make transport
difficult, and in the remote areas the dilapidated pick-ups,
which are the only means of transportation, take days before
reaching the markets.
</P>
<P>
Residents there have to storm the markets in the early hours
of the day just to grumble for the limited supply of cassava.
</P>
<P>
Food shortage in these areas has something to do with the
return of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries#,the
report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 Liberians fled the country during the seven
years of civil war launched by Charles Taylor, who became the

<HEADLINE> New Panel to Probe PNA Corruption: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A new committee headed by
Speaker of the Palestinian Council Abu Ala is to be formed to
investigate the alleged corruption within the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israel's English daily Jerusalem Post reported today that the
panel would include PNA Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein,
Attorney-General Fayez Abu Rahme and several appointments to be
made by PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Palestinian sources as saying that Arafat is
encouraging the investigation as part of his drive to demonstrate
to Palestinians that he wants to root out official corruption.
</P>
<P>
A report by PNA auditing office claiming that 326 million
U.S. dollars of public funds, or 40 percent of PNA budget, were
misused or wasted in 1995 by PNA ministers, created a political
uproar within the PNA.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the Palestinian Council voted to give Arafat one
month to dissolve his Cabinet and appoint a new one. It also
recommended bringing two ministers, Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Sha'ath and Civilian Affairs Minister
Jamil Tarifi, to trial for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has since come under increased pressure from the
Palestinian public and international donors to take actions
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
A committee appointed by Arafat later found that although no
money had been squandered, serious financial, legal, and
administrative violations existed.
</P>
<P>
One day after the council's vote to demand the dissolution of
the whole PNA Cabinet, 16 PNA ministers tendered their
resignations to Arafat, who has so far refused to accept the
resignations. The latest move taken by Abu Ala seemed to be
aimed at increasing the pressure on Arafat to take quick actions
to clear the PNA's image.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Benefits Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The fact that the Yangtze
River will be diverted in early November to allow for construction
of a gigantic dam will provide wide-ranging opportunities for both
Chinese and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors will benefit from increased opportunities resulting
from the fact that the market for funding, equipment and
technology will rapidly expand along with construction of the
temporary dam.
</P>
<P>
Two parallel earth and stone cofferdams will be constructed to
block the main stream of the Yangtze, the country's longest
river. The second stage will involve the construction of the dam
and generator rooms which will cover 630,000 sq.m. between the two
cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
The second stage construction will represent the investment
peak, and the Three Gorges Dam will involve a static investment of
90.05 billion yuan, with total costs for the project expected to
hit 200 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 billion yuan in funding will be needed prior to the
year 2007, including the 35 billion yuan which will be expended
prior to the year 2003. The China Yangtze River Three Gorges
Project Development Corp. will continue to use wide-ranging
fund-raising methods to obtain overseas funding, including export
credits, selling shares and commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
Equipment purchases will reach a peak once the river is blocked
and intensified construction of the dam will require more advanced
machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Equipment purchases will account for close to 33 percent of
total construction costs for the Three Gorges Dam. Some 70 percent
of equipment needed for the Three Gorges Project has been
purchases from overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six generators, with a generating capacity of 700,000 kw
each, will be installed in the Three Gorges water control dam. On
September 2, 1997, two European conglomerates were awarded
contracts for 14 generators in early September this year, with the
remaining 12 generators to be manufactured by Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Chinese experts are currently conducting
feasibility studies about the possibility of installing an
additional six generators on the right bank of the river might
possibly offer new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Technological cooperation and exchanges will also increase
along with rising demand for new high technology and expertise
needed to construct the dam.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Monday that the new
tax policy of his government favors the middle class. In a

<HEADLINE> PNG Finance Minister Dumped Following Trips to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's (PNG's)
Prime Minister Bill Skate has dumped Finance Minister Roy Yaki
from the cabinet for domestic and diplomatic reasons, saying he
was deeply concerned about Yaki's recent trips to Taiwan which
might cause diplomatic problems in relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister said he was deeply concerned about Yaki's
numerous trips to Taiwan recently. This may cause diplomatic
problems in the relationship between PNG and China, as the Skate
government strongly respects the one China policy of the People's
Republic of China," said a document reaching here today from the
prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Skate questioned the competence of Yaki's short period as
finance minister since the new government was formed in mid-July,
accusing Yaki of lagging behind in the preparation of next year's
budget, which is due to be delivered in November.
</P>
<P>
"We have always recognized China and have dealt with Taiwan on
a commercial basis only, by virtue of Taiwan's growing economic
power. This should never change PNG's current foreign policy on
China," the prime minister was quoted by the document.
</P>
<P>
"Any visit by government ministers or officials to Taiwan
should be treated as private and should only be undertaken after
prior approval has been obtained from my office," the prime
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yaki, who was in Hong Kong attending a World Bank meeting on
Monday, was also toppled as leader of his People's Democratic
Movement (PDM) at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced as finance minister by his colleague and former
public service minister Iairo Lasaro.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was most critical of Yaki's recent trips to
Taiwan to allegedly discuss the sale of the government airline Air
Nuigini," the Australian Associated Press said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Focuses on State Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai No.9 Knitwear
Plant, a state-owned enterprise which manufactures the popular
brand-name underwear "Sanqiang", lost its market dominance in the
late 1980s and has faced increasingly fierce competition since the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The company's management decided that an attack strategy was
the best way to promote the enterprise. The plant assumed control
of seven debt-ridden enterprises and established the Shanghai
Sanqiang Holding Group between 1991-1996..
</P>
<P>
The merger raised the plant's economic strength and its assets
have increased 11-fold over the past six years, with sales revenue
rising 13-fold and profits 101-fold. Sanqiang is now regarded as a
model of how to reform China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China currently has some 87,000 medium to large state
enterprises, many of which have failed to adapt to the market and
continue to lose money despite financial support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Related enterprises are being reformed in accordance with
government guidelines, and tens of thousands of small enterprises
which mainly produce consumer goods will either be merged, annexed
with profitable companies or bankrupted.
</P>
<P>
Some 58 pilot cities were slated for intensive enterprise
reforms in 1996, with 1,099 state enterprises forced into
bankruptcy and an additional 1,192 involved in mergers.
</P>
<P>
All sides have benefitted in cases of mergers. Konka, a
profitable television manufacturer in Shenzhen, merged with two
loss-making television plants, one in northeast China and the
other in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Three years later, in
1996, the Konka Group chalked up sales of over 805 million yuan,
including profits of 10 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
China's leading economists agree that the dismal economic
performance of most state enterprises can be blamed on poor
management. They point to rags-to-riches private enterpreneurs as
glowing examples of just how crucial management can be to the
success of an enterprise, and insist that a modern management
system must be formed to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and June 1997, the State Council designated 100
large state enterprises as pilot ventures for introducing a modern
management system, with local governments designating an
additional 2,598 ventures for similar programs.
</P>
<P>
The system features a standard corporate management structure
with boards of directors, and incentive and restraint mechanisms
for owners, managers and laborers.
</P>
<P>
The Qinchuan Machine Tools Group, a company in Northwest
China's Shaanxi Province which led the nation's machine tools
manfacturing sector in terms of 1996 profits, has clearly
delineated ownership from management. The group's board of
directors concentrates on planning and project investments, with
managers devoting themselves to production and management.
</P>
<P>
Similar experiments are ongoing in all the pilot enterprises
and some have been granted assets management power, according to
Wang Zhongyu, Chinese minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The SETC agenda calls for a number of qualified pilot
enterprises to become limited liability or joint-stock limited
companies during 1996.

<P>
The State Council and local governments are fully cognizant of
the fact that most state enterprises are burdened by heavy debt
and a number of enterprises have turned some debt owed to the
state into the state capital fund.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the asset liability rates of 131 enterprises
trying out the measure have dropped by an average of 2.5
percentage points," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises whose products enjoy good sales but which lack
funds for renovation will be allowed to seek funds directly from
both domestic and international markets by listing on stock
exchanges and issuance of bonds.
</P>
<P>
Priority support will be given to trans-regional, trans-trade,
large enterprises groups with different types of ownership to
enhance their competitiveness on domestic and international
markets.
</P>
<P>
These more aggressive reform policies have begun to show
results. In the first half of this year, China's state-owned
enterprises scored a 7.2 percent increase in value-added output
from last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, the chief economist at the State Statistics Bureau
said that sighs of state enterprises recovery first showed through
at the end of 1996, when the rate of floundering enterprises
dropped from a peak of 45.6 percent to 32 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The trend makes Qiu optimistic over further improvement in the
performance of state enterprises, believing that with the
deepening of economic reform, more state enterprises will become
assets rather than liabilities, contributing to rather than taking
from the state coffers, and playing a front line role in China's
economic development.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Convicted Business Tycoons to be Pardoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
decided today to grant special pardons to seven business tycoons
including owners of Samsung and Daewoo groups who were convicted
of bribing former President Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
The pardons, subject to the approval of President Kim
Young-sam, cover Chairman Lee Kun-hee of Samsung, Kim Woo-choong
of Daewoo, Choi Won-sok of Dong-ah, Chang Jin-ho of Jinro, Lee
Joon-yong of Daelim, Kim Joon-ki of Dongbu and Lee Kun, executive
of Daeho Construction Company.
</P>
<P>
They were sentenced to one to four-year jail terms earlier this
year with a rather long suspension while former Presidents Chun
Du-hwan and Roh Tae-woo were sentenced respectively to a whole
life and 22 years imprisonment for mutiny and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam was quoted as saying earlier this month
that he will release his two jailed predecessors before his term
expires next February.
</P>
<P>
The government's move today was interpreted as a way to help
revitalize the nation's sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The government today also decided to pardon 16 other business
executives who have been convicted of embezzling corporate money
or evading tax.
</P>
<P>
The special pardon bill, however, does not cover politicians
and officials involved in taking bribes from the businessmen or
arranging bribes for former presidents Chun and Roh.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Maldivian President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom warned against global warming at the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which met in the
Maldivian capital of Male lately, according to news reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Gayoom told the 200 scientists and experts who attended the
gathering that if the international community did not stop global
warming with a sense of urgency the Maldives and many low-lying
nations would have to face a dismal and alarming future.
</P>
<P>
The main economic activities of the country are fishing and
tourism, both of which depend on the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives has taken several measures to protect its fragile
environment, including building coastal defenses, banning coral
mining and protecting endangered species.
</P>
<P>
However, the president expressed disappointment that not enough
had been done internationally to protect and preserve the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Monks Protest Against Devolution Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Buddhists this
morning launched a sit-down demonstration in the center of Colombo
in protest against the devolution proposals of the government.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, sitting in the vicinity of the Viharamaha
Devi Park, said "the reason of the package is to satisfy Tamil
extremists."
</P>
<P>
The placards held by the monks said, "no more talks with the
brutal LTTE terrorists" and "against the devolution package."
</P>
<P>
Some monks distributed leaflets to passersby. A large crowd of
people gathered at the venue to show their support to the monks.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was launched by the National Sangha Sabha
(National Association of Buddhists) and the National Joint
Committee, an organization of 56 associations in the country.
</P>
<P>
It started at 9:00 a.m. local time and was scheduled to end by
noon. Quite a number of policemen were deployed at the scene to
maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said it is very difficult for the government to
push through the proposals if it cannot gain support from the
Buddhists. Buddhism is quite influential in Sri Lanka's social
affairs and politics.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were also protesting against remarks made by
Ports, Telecommunications and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On commenting the Interim Report of the Sinhala Commission, the
minister and government spokesman said the report was "the biggest
conspiracy against the Sinhala people."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say, "The Sinhala Commission report will very
soon be consigned to the dustbin."
</P>
<P>
Piyasena Dissanayake, secretary of the National Joint
Committee, said the statement made by the minister raised doubts
as to whether his stand with regard to the Interim Report
represented the government's attitude towards the report.
</P>
<P>
He said the demonstration was launched to compel the minister
to withdraw his statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sinhala Commission, composed of 12 members, was appointed
by the National Joint Committee to examine problems that are
related to the Sinhala people.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Report, the first report of the Sinhala Commission
since it was established two years ago, has rekindled a
nation-wide political controversy by opposing the devolution
proposals of the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the devolution proposals, more autonomy would be given to
the Northern and Eastern provinces, where the Tamil rebels have
been fighting a guerrilla war for a separate state since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Market Economy Trickling Toward Border Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The best way to escape
poverty lies not in growing crops, but in developing an "economic
forest," China's southern borders believe, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of Yunnan province's Jinpin and Luchun
bordering Vie Nam have gradual faith in market economy, though
they are cut off from the outside world by inefficient
transportation and communication.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, farmers rushed into the mountains to plant
citronella, as it became a hot product on the international market
and its oil worth more than 12 US dollars a kilogram. They thought
the way to wealth had been found, but the price plunged to 2.1 US
dollars a kilogram. Most farmers fell into econmic plight.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, banana farmers in Luchun County had a bumper harvest,
but heavy rain had ruined the shabby roads, and they could do
nothing but allow the fruit to rot away in the field.
</P>
<P>
However, the local officials understood that the government
should act as a bridge between poor farmers and the market, and
began to help farmers map out projects according to the market's
ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
So far, large plantations of rubber trees and other tropical
fruit trees have been established throughout Jinpin and Luchun as
a result of careful market investigation. And private capital and
local finances have been invested in these projects.
</P>
<P>
The products will be delivered to big cities within and outside
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The local government is trying their utmost to build a standard
road system and combine farmers together with corporations which
will help transport farmers' produce to market if they think it
profitable.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Trade Deficit Reaches 9 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland's trade deficit in the
first seven months of this year reached 9 billion U.S. dollars, an
increase of 2.4 billion dollars over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit to European Union countries accounts for 5.5
billion dollars of the total, according to the figures released by
Poland's Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economy estimates that exports from Poland will
be 27 billion dollars while imports will be 40 billion dollars in
1997, resulting in a trade deficit of 13 billion dollars, which
far exceeds the 9.4 billion-dollar target the government set for
the year.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Ministry of Economy said that various elements
stimulating imports have contributed to the rise in trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The elements include increased foreign investment, the
abolishment of border duties on imports and the reduction of
average tariffs from 7.45 percent to 5.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the country's economy needs to be
propped up by the inflow of foreign capital and import of capital
goods, which accounted for 80 percent of the total imports in the
first six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The key to curbing the rapid increase in trade deficit lies in
raising competitivity of Poland's products and their prices, the
experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external
economy
earned "a handsome income" of 17 billion Singapore dollars, or
around 11.7 billion U.S. dollars, last year, up significantly from
the 11.7 billion Singapore dollars (about 8 billion U.S. dollars)
yielded in 1990, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the income earned by the Republic from abroad
comprises earnings from capital investment, labor, and
intellectual property, namely, patent fees and royalties.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the money came from foreign assets, as income from
these investments increased to 16.9 billion Singapore dollars from
11.6 billion in 1990, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, although investment abroad by Singapore
companies had increased, the pace had not kept up with that of
Singapore-based multi-national corporations (MNCs).
</P>
<P>
Citing the result of a study by the Statistics Department, the
Straits Times report said that half of the total direct investment
was undertaken by Singapore-based MNCs, which means that MNCs
helped bring in a significant part of Singapore's overseas
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Harbor in Northeast China To Issue B Shares Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhou Harbor in Northeast
China's Liaoning Province is expected to issue B shares around the
end of October and A shares next year, today's China Daily
quoted the Orient Group Co., the harbor's biggest shareholder,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou's quota of 100 million B shares has been approved by
securities authorities of the central government and the stocks
will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said officials of
Orient, which is based in Harbin, capital of northeast
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou Harbor opened in 1986 under State ownership and was
transformed into a joint-stock company in late 1995, when Orient
bought 30.4 percent of its ownership.
</P>
<P>
A series of efficiency-oriented reforms followed the
shareholding transformation.
</P>
<P>
Handling capacity of the harbor was raised to 4.5 million tons
by the end of last year from two million tons in 1995, with
profits soaring to 65 million yuan from 20 million yuan, according
to Orient Group Vice-President Guan Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
He said Jinzhou's listing would reflect Orient's increasing
interests in raising capital through the stock market to fund
development and expansion.
</P>
<P>
Orient was the first company in Heilongjiang to obtain the
local government's approval to issue stocks and is one of Chinese
first private companies to have a listed subsidiary.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Resolve Dam Dispute with Slovakia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime minister
Horn Gyula said today that a ruling by the world court on
Hungarian-Slovak feud over a dam on the Danube River provided
prerequisite for the two countries to reach a "mutually acceptable
solution."
</P>
<P>
Horn told the Hungarian Congress that he had sent a letter to
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar proposing talks "in good
faith" at the end of October at the latest on how to implement the
ruling by the U.N. International Court of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The talks could end years of wrangling between the two
countries over the giant Bos dam they agreed to jointly build on
the Danube, their border river, to generate electricity in 1977.
</P>
<P>
However, Hungary unilaterally suspended the work on its side in
1989, and abrogated the bilateral agreement, citing environmental
reasons in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia responded by modifying the original designs and
diverting the Danube water to Slovak territory to feed a power
station at Gabcikovo for its own use.
</P>
<P>
They went to the International Court in 1992. After almost five
years of investigation, the court ruled on September 25 that both
countries had violated the agreement they had signed in 1977, and
that they should pay each other damages.

PANAMA CITY, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States will

</P>
<P>
The Albrook air base, located five kilometers from the capital,
will be the first U.S. wide-ranging military facility in the

</P>
<P>
Under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter accords, the U.S. should hand

and withdraw all its military presence from there by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
A key U.S. military base in Latin America, Albrook was a battle
facility from 1920 to 1961. It became the headquarters of the
Inter-American Air Force Academy in 1943 and had trained 30,000
specialized troops for Latin American countries before it was
turned into a settlement area for U.S. militarymen in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, 1989, Albrook was one of the vital centers for
U.S. invasion of Panama to overthrow the Noriega government.

In September 1955, U.S. troops retreated from Davis and Espinar
bases in the coastal province of Colon, 70 kilometers west of the

this year, but that it is of the quality and variety the ministry
was expecting to see in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that China plans to improve the continuous casting
ratio -- a major indicator of the metallurgical industry's
technological level -- from 53 percent last year to 75 percent by
2000, which was already a rise of six percentage points over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China hopes to build at least five more iron and
steel works up to international standards in the remaining years
of this century. But, he stressed, technological renovations of
the existing enterprises rather than construction of new ones will
be the chief means of upgrading China's iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
China has 106 iron and steel works rated as medium or
large-sized, most of which were started in the early and mid-1950s
with Soviet assistance, or earlier, as in the case of the Anshan
Iron and Steel Co. in northeast China's Liaoning Province, which
was built by the Japanese in 1917.
</P>
<P>
Only Baoshan in the south and the Tianjin Pipe Company in the
north meet international standards for technological processes,
technology and production capacity.
</P>
<P>
"To get the job done, you need money and the best kind of
technology and you have to make proper arrangements for
re-employment of those workers laid off as a result of the
technological upgrading," Liu said. "The job is tough and
time-consuming, but given the specific conditions of China, that
is the only alternative."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Steel Industry Aims For Quality, Variety (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The industry will open up more opportunities for foreign
investors, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Five iron and steel heavyweights, including Panzhihua Iron and
Steel Co. based in Sichuan Province, Anshan Iron and Steel Co. and
Daye Iron and Steel Co. based in Hubei Province, are getting
quoted either on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, or have issued B
shares on the domestic stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiaoning, deputy director of the ministry's Economic
Research and Development Center, said that the ministry is
launching a series of schemes to promote quality control, increase
the variety of products, and encourage use of technology that is
cost and energy effective while environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
"The overall plan is to ensure that 90 percent of China's
rolled steel meets international standards by 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the last couple of years have witnessed a constant
increase in the production of quality steel products, "such
products are still in limited quantity relative to the
ever-expanding demand on the domestic market," the expert noted.
</P>
<P>
He cited a range of products now in acutely short supply on the
domestic market: galvanized sheets, tin plate, cold-rolled
sheeting, cold-rolled silicon sheeting, oil pipes, as well as
varieties specially for use in automobile, electric power,
petroleum and chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, he said, China plans to meet 95 percent of its own
needs for rolled steel; the figure is 70-80 percent for
technology-intensive, high value-added steel products. Besides,
the country will become 80 percent self-sufficient in automobile
sheeting and 75 percent in oil pipes.
</P>
<P>
This year, Chinese enterprises are producing an extra two
million tons of steel good enough to replace imports, including
cold-rolled steel, oil pipes, container sheets and sheets for
shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Baoshan Iron and Steel Company,
technologically one of the best in China, is striving to build up
over the next few years an additional annual production capacity
of two to three million tons of sheets used in the country's
automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yang said, import of steel products will remain
important at least in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is only 60 percent self-sufficient in
galvanized sheeting and 30 percent self-sufficient in tin plate.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country imported 16 million tons of steel
products, 15 percent more than in 1995. It exported five million
to six million tons of steel, which was insignificant compared
with its huge output.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Hits Another Low, Stocks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah fell
Monday to a new historic low of 3,220 against the U.S. dollar and
the stock prices trailed down, dealers and brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers attributed the rupiah's fall to a combination
of improving rupiah liquidity, increasing dollar demand and a
sharp fall in other regional currencies, especially the Malaysian
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah dropped to a new low of 3,320 in the afternoon,
compared with the day's opening of 3,125/3,235 and Friday's close
of 3,100/3,122. It closed at 3,215/3,220 Monday.
</P>
<P>
One state bank chief dealer said many local corporate companies
entered the market Monday looking for dollar. As no local players
sold dollar, overseas operators could easily push down the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index, the main
indicator of the local share prices, fell 0.7 percent or 3.682
points to close at 546.238. Total turnover was 185.23 million
shares worth 83.17 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said the market was dull Monday, with most
investors staying on the sidelines following the rupiah's collapse
and failed expectation on rates cut.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said Monday that the
government will avoid making the Indonesian currency either too
strong or too weak against the U.S. dollar in helping the rupiah
reach a new equilibrium in the wake of the recent currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting here that nobody could now tell at which
level the rupiah's value would settle down.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and more than 25 percent since January this year following
offshore speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local
companies to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Stop-gap Bill For New Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved today a temporary spending bill that will
keep funding for federal departments and agencies, preventing
another government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the stop-gap measure with a vote of 355-57
which was widely expected. And the U.S. Senate was preparing to
match the House's action Tuesday, hours before the midnight
deadline when the current budget expires.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved one day before the new fiscal year
begins on October 1, will keep U.S. government departments and
agencies working at current levels through October 23. They would
lose their funding and be forced to close temporarily without the
stop-gap bill.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. House and Senate have agreed on legislation
that outlines spending on military construction projects, keeps
money flowing to Congress and its legislative functions, and a
massive measure providing 248 billion dollars for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Even if President Bill Clinton signed all three bills, that
would leave a dozen federal departments and scores of agencies,
without money cash, unless there is temporary funding.
</P>
<P>
Neither side, especially Republican leaders, wants a repeat of
the tortuous partial government shutdowns during a fiscal showdown
two years ago. The shutdowns had resulted in strong public rage
which mostly directed at the Republicans.

<HEADLINE> New US 50-Dollar Bills to Circulate Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The redesigned 50-dollar
bill will circulate on schedule starting from October 27 despite a
tiny printing flaw, the U.S. Treasury Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The new 50-dollar bill features an off-center, enlarged
portrait of U.S. Grant, the 18th U.S. president, on the front and
an updated engraving of the U.S. Capitol on the back.
</P>
<P>
It also has a large high-contrast numeral on the back, designed
to make the bill easier to identify for older people and others
with poor vision.
</P>
<P>
The 50-dollar bill is also packed with features designed to
thwart counterfeiters. These include a watermark to the right of
the portrait, an embedded polymer security thread that glows
yellow in ultraviolet light, and color-shifting ink in the numeral
in the lower right hand corner of the bill's front.
</P>
<P>
After printing 150 million bills between late May and late
August, the U.S. government discovered that about 20 percent,
about 30 million dollars, had a small break in the lines around
the portrait.
</P>
<P>
The flawed notes are under seal and a determination about
whether they can circulate will be made later. In the meantime,
the Treasury Department said enough flawless notes will be
delivered to Federal Reserve banks around the country to begin
distribution on October 27.
</P>
<P>
The introduction follows the debut of the redesigned 100-dollar
note last year. A new 20-dollar bill is also expected next year.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine to Resume Interim Committee Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestine agreed
here today to resume negotiations in the interim committees with
the objective of setting a mutually agreed target date for
high-level peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a trilateral meeting between U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and PLO negotiator Abu Mazen in a downtown hotel here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "productive," Albright told a press
conference, "Clearly we've come together with a common purpose and
aim -- to continue our efforts to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian
peace based on the principles agreed to at Madrid and in the Oslo
Accords" reached in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"We all agreed that it is essential to re-energize the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to create the kind of
environment necessary for those negotiations to succeed," said
Albright, who met with Levy before the three-party talks.
</P>
<P>
These negotiations will begin the week of October 6 with a
meeting of the Joint Liaison Committee chaired by Levy and Abu
Mazen, she said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will return to Washington
for the week of October 13 to work together with U.S.
participation on the elements of getting the overall peace process
back on the track, she added.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in the Mideast has been on the hold for about
six months since Israel began Jewish housing expansion in East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Israel has most recently expressed its willingness to resume
contacts with Palestine as it felt that the Palestinian Authority
had taken "preliminary steps in combating terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Albright called today's meeting a "medium step" towards
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and said "the road ahead is not an
easy one."

<HEADLINE> Former Legislators Back Campaign Finance Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of former U.S.
Congress members are urging their ex-colleagues to overhaul
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
Led by prominent Republicans who recently retired, 81 former
lawmakers today issued a statement pushing for fund-raising
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 33 Republicans and 48 Democrats sought a ban on "soft
money" -- largely unregulated donations that are supposed to be
used only for generic party activities, but were obviously used to
help candidates during the last election cycle.
</P>
<P>
They argue that such a ban and other curbs would "assure the
American public that the nation's campaign finance system honors
our nation's ideals."
</P>
<P>
The issue of campaign funding, and how both parties broke the
rules in last year's elections, has become a focus of the
controversies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have been accusing Democrats of misdeeds in last
elections, while they themselves are also facing similar
allegations. Republican leaders have made clear their displeasure
with a proposed soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
Republicans routinely outpace Democrats in fund raising, soft
money in particular. Statistics from the Federal Elections
Commission show that in the first half of this year, Republicans
have raised more than three dollars in soft money to every two
collected by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leader Trent Lott opposes the soft-money ban
in a compromise measure drafted by Senators John McCain, a
Republican of Arizona, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat of
Wisconsin. The head of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee, Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, has vowed
to kill the measure.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A wildfire that started in
northern California Saturday destroyed up to 100 homes and
buildings and forced some 1,500 residents to flee homes.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, sparked by a motor home's generator, burned about
5,800 acres (2,355 hectares) of mountainous terrain in the heavily
wooded Sierra Nevada by early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 residents in Oregon House and nearby Dobbins were
forced to evacuate the rural area. Hundreds were staying at packed
schools in nearby Brownsville and will not be allowed home for at
least two days.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,140 firefighters were fighting the blaze, aided by air
tankers, helicopters and bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another blaze sparked Saturday night in the
foothills about 117 kilometers north near the town of Ponderosa
Skyranch, had charred about 1,000 acres (about 400 hectares). The
blaze was 50 percent contained. No homes had been destroyed in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
A third fire that burned 1,600 acres (650 hectares) in central
California was also contained Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Raps US for Imposing Its Own Law on World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today severely criticized the United States for imposing
its own law upon other countries and warned Washington against
interfering in cooperation between the French oil group Total and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The American laws apply themselves in the United States, they
are not applied in France," said Jospin on TF1 television channel
this evening in a clear reaction to the U.S. announcement that it
will consider imposing sanctions upon Total for signing a 2
billion U.S. dollar contract with Iran to develop an offshore gas
field in the Persian (Arab) Gulf.
</P>
<P>
With a domestic law -- the d'Amato law -- in force, the United
States bans any country from dealing more than 40 million U.S.
dollars in oil and the hydrocarbon sector with Iran and Libya, two
countries Washington accused of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of the European Economic Community is united in
position which is ours because nobody accepts the idea that the
United States could impose its law on a global scale," said
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the American laws adopted by the U.S. Congress for
Americans should not be addressed to Frenchmen or French
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The private French or foreign enterprises decide freely on
their investment. They are not controlled by us and this is the
case of Total," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the political situation is turning for the better
in Iran, and French companies don't want to be the last to enter
its oil market.
</P>
<P>
"The famous d'Amato law is perhaps valid for the Americans, but
the United Nations has not decided to put an embargo upon Iran as,
for example, it has done it for Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a spokesman of the European
Commission in Brussels said today that any application by the
United States of the d'Amato law against Total will be "illegal
and unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Blames Israel for Crisis in Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa today blamed Israel for the current crisis in
the Middle East peace process and urged Israel to change its
positions for the benefits of the peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks in an address to the general debate of
the United Nations General Assembly as the United States was
stepping up its efforts for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, eight Arab ministers and Palestinian
negotiator Mahmoud Adbas (Abu Mezen) earlier in the day in New
York in preparations for the peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians later today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister claimed that Israel's settlements
policy in the occupied Arab territory was "making a mockery of
legal accords" and "pushing things to confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"The most apparent manifestation of this crisis is that the
concept, consequences and bases of the peace drive are being
completely blown off and squandered," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Trust has been replaced by doubt," Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy defended Israel's policies during the same debate
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that his government welcomed U.S. efforts to revive
the stalemated peace process with the Palestinians but was no
longer willing to "pay the bloody price" in the name of peace.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the current crisis resulted from mounting
violence in the region.

<HEADLINE> UN Postpones Enactment of Travel Sanctions on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today decided to postpone until October 30, 1997 the
enactment of measures restricting the travel of senior officials
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
and adult members of their families and sealing UNITA offices.
</P>
<P>
Those other measures including prohibition of the flight of
aircraft by or for UNITA, and the supply of aircraft or their
components to UNITA, and the insurance, engineering and servicing
of UNITA aircraft were to be imposed Tuesday, September 30, unless
the council was informed by the secretary-General that UNITA has
taken concrete and irreversible steps to comply with the council
demands.
</P>
<P>
The council affirmed its readiness to review the imposition of
those measures and to consider the imposition of additional
measures if UNITA failed to meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the need for UNITA to comply fully with
all obligations set out by the council's resolutions. The required
actions include the demilitarization of all of its forces, the
transformation of the radio station Vorgan into a non-partisan
broadcasting facility and full cooperation in the normalization of
state administration throughout Angola.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Race Advisory Board to Meet Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Presidential apology would
have to extend beyond slavery and address segregation, because the
institution of segregation endured for so many years after slavery
ended, U.S. President Bill Clinton's Race Advisory Board Chairman
John Hope Franklin urged in a radio interview today.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of apologizing for segregation was made in some
of the 600 pieces of mail sent to the White House and the offices
of Clinton's advisory board on race since June. The board, which
Clinton charged with analyzing a slavery apology, will meet for
the second time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The most rigid apartheid laws this country has ever seen were
passed in this century," Franklin told the American Urban Radio
Network. "What are you going to do about all of the examples and
practices of degradation and humiliation and segregation practiced
in the 20th century? An apology for slavery is not going to do
it."
</P>
<P>
Clinton appointed the board in June to spend a year gathering
information on the country's racial climate that he will use to
compile a report on race.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said that, for now, it is unlikely that
Clinton will apologize for segregation, the same response it gave
to the suggestion for an apology for slavery.
</P>
<P>
"If you must do something now, today, the president doesn't
think any kind of apology would be productive at this point," said
spokesman Joe Lockhart. The matter will be referred to the race
advisory board, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Judith Winston, the advisory board's executive director, said
the board would explore an appropriate response to the whole
question of apologies, but was "not spending a lot of time on
that."
</P>
<P>
Under so called Jim Crow laws, enacted by Southern states in
the late 1800s, separate facilities were required for blacks and
whites and the practices were bolstered by the Supreme Court's
1896 decision that upheld Louisiana's "separate but equal"
facilities on railroads.
</P>
<P>
Segregation endured even after the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown
v. Board of Education decision, which called for integration of
schools. It was officially eliminated by the Civil Rights Act of
1964, although civil rights activists argue that its vestiges
linger today in such areas as education and housing.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Turn Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices of smaller
companies were pushed higher today on Wall Street, as the market
gained some strength before Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting on
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.25 points to 7,991.43.
The barometer of 30 blue-chip companies started the day with a
28-point deficit before quickly turning higher.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 470.56 million
shares as against 501.69 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 8.12 to 953.34; the
NYSE composite index rose 3.78 to 498.98; and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 12.74 to 1,694.98.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.43 to 451.31,

The American Stock Exchange composite index, which is dominated
by smaller companies, rose 4.82 to 694.66, surpassing last Monday's
record mark of 689.94.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to a morning report showing that
consumer spending rose a modest 0.3 percent in August -- down from
a 1 percent spurt in July -- despite a healthy 0.6 percent gain in
personal income.
</P>
<P>
Few analysts expect a change in monetary policy Tuesday by the
central bank, which hasn't raised any of its key lending rates
since March.

<HEADLINE> French PM Criticizes Algerian Gov't, Condemns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today criticized the Algerian government for using violence
in order to put down a Muslim insurrection.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned what he called the "scandalous violence" of
Islamic extremists in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a French prime minister to openly
criticize the Algerian government for years. France has maintained
a low-profile policy toward Algeria, although it is the biggest
economic supporter of Algeria, providing Algiers with 1 billion
U.S. dollars of subsidized loans each year.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of Algeria, the very great difficulty is that we
don't know what is really going on in Algeria.... We see well a
hideous terror, a violence which develops against the people, but
it is extremely difficult to identify what is going on," said
Jospin during an evening interview with the TF1 television
channel.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Algeria, there is "fanatical and violent
opposition which is fighting against a power which itself uses a
certain way of violence and the force of state."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we should be careful (in making policy toward
Algeria)," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said last week that only
Algerians themselves can restore order and security in their
country, and that it is extremely difficult for outsiders to
interfere in the Algerian conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian extremist Armed Islamic Group (GIA) last week
threatened to launch new terrorist attacks against France because
of its support to the Algerian government.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM in Bonn to Seek Support for EU Membership Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of
Turkey said here today that it is unjust to exclude Turkey from
the enlargement process of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who began today a three-day visit to Germany, made the
remark in a speech to Germany's umbrella organization of chambers
of commerce DIHT in Bonn this evening. He is scheduled to meet
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried by the German Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper today, Yilmaz said that given its military, economic and
political status, Turkey was an "indispensable element" of the EU
policy in regions like the Middle East, the Balkans and Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that Ankara believed that some
artificial barriers were being set up to keep Turkey out of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey expects Germany's support in its efforts to become a
full EU member," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said earlier this month
that Turkey should first resolve its dispute with Greece over the
divided island of Cyprus and human rights concerns stemming from
its conflicts with separatist Kurds.
