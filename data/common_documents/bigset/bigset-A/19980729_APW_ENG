	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Partial election results released
Wednesday by Cambodia's top independent monitoring group confirmed
that strongman Hun Sen's party had staked a lead over his rivals,
but apparently less than the boasted landslide.
	   With official results slowly being compiled, the figures of the
Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia were scrutinized
to balance claims by the Cambodian People's Party that it had
crushed the opposition in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   The main opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, have called the process a fraud and threatened to paralyze
the government, plunging the tragedy-stricken country into another
round of turmoil.
	   Hun Sen, who has kept a low profile since Sunday's vote, was to
travel Wednesday to the northern province of Siem Reap for talks
with King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's father.
	   Thun Saray, COMFREL's president, said his group was ``ready to
do investigations to provide proof'' into reports of irregularities
alleged by Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and others.
	   COMFREL said that with 56.3 percent of the vote counted
nationwide, 40.5 percent had gone for Hun Sen's party, 32.8 percent
to the royalist FUNCINPEC headed by Ranariddh, and 14.2 percent to
the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   But it remained difficult to determine how the popular vote
would translate in dividing up the 122 National Assembly seats.
	   In the two multiple-constituency provinces where COMFREL was
able to determine seats, Kampot and Svay Rieng, three in each went
to Hun Sen's party. The party has claimed four in each.
	   If the COMFREL figures are mirrored in the official count by the
National Election Committee, the final result could look more like
50-odd seats for the CPP, rather than the 67 the party is claiming.
	   Under those figures _ which many Cambodians disbelieve _
Ranariddh's party would get 42 seats and Sam Rainsy's just 13.
	   Ranariddh, deposed as co-prime minister by Hun Sen in a bloody
coup last year, and Sam Rainsy have denounced the claimed results
as a fraud and demanded recounts and re-balloting in some areas.
	   They have threatened to boycott the National Assembly,
preventing the two-thirds attendance needed to hold meetings.
Leading officials of Hun Sen's party have suggested they join a
coalition or see the current government continue another five
years.
	   International observer groups generally endorsed Sunday's vote,
when an estimated 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters
cast ballots, and counting Monday as free and fair enough to
reflect the general will of the Cambodian people.
	   But they offered their judgments before the final count, which
may still take days. Several also noted that the pre-election
period was marred by violence, including murder, and intimidation,
mostly against opposition supporters.
	   The U.N.'s human-rights office released a report Monday saying
it was investigating reports of an additional 12 killings in the
final week of the campaign to see if they were politically
motivated.
	   Ranariddh's royalist party won U.N.-organized elections backed
by 20,000 peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in
1985 under the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the
genocidal Khmer Rouge, refused to accept defeat and threatened
civil war.
	   The two men formed a co-premiership, which shattered last year
when Hun Sen deposed the prince in two days of fighting in the
capital. Both men have called the arrangement a recipe for
instability and refused to form another.
	   Unlike 1993, the Khmer Rouge is virtually extinct. Thousands of
rebels have made peace since 1996 and voted Sunday for the first
time in their lives. Two seats in areas dominated by them have
reportedly been divided between the CPP and the Sam Rainsy Party.

American women crush Chinese swimmers

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ On the first night of swimming team
dual meets at the Goodwill Games, American women gave a strong
performance, beating their Chinese counterparts 88-34.
	   Americans Jenny Thompson and Cristina Teuscher each won two
individual events on Tuesday, set a games record and swam on a
winning relay.
	   China's swim team has been tainted by drug scandals almost from
the time its women started setting world records in 1994, and the
United States complained bitterly about performance enhancers from
the beginning. Even as recently as last week, four Chinese swimmers
were suspended for two years for testing positive.
	   But there was little indication the Chinese were enhancing their
performances Tuesday.
	   American team captain Lea Maurer, the 1998 world champion in the
100-meter backstroke, swam a strong opening leg in the first event,
the 400 medley relay, helping the U.S. team take a 7-0 lead.
	   The only real setback of the night for the American women came
in the 800 freestyle when China's Yan Li and Ping Luo finished
first and second respectively to pull into an 8-8 tie in the team
standings. First through third places are awarded 5, 3 and 1
points.
	   It didn't stay close long, however, as the United States then
reeled off six consecutive 1-2 sweeps for a 62-17 lead.
	   Thompson won the 50 and 100 freestyles and was a member of the
winning 400 freestyle relay. Her 100 time of 55.56 seconds was a
games record.
	   Teuscher also won two individual events, the 400 freestyle and
the 200 in a games record, and swam third on the freestyle relay
that also set a games record.
	   Maurer won the 100 backstroke and finished second behind Shelly
Ripple, also of the United States, in the 200.
	   In the opening women's dual meet, the World All-Stars defeated
Germany 64-58 as Inge DeBruijn of the Netherlands and Penny Heyns
of South Africa each set two Goodwill records.
	   Boxing was a U.S. showcase, with three quarterfinal victories
over fighters from Cuba _ including a world champion.
	   Roberto Benitiez, who is ranked No. 2 in the United States,
outpointed flyweight champ Manuel Mantilla 12-8.
	   Another U.S. boxer, 20-year-old Teaunce Shepherd, beat
Rudinelson Hardy of Cuba 16-3 in the opening featherweight bout at
the Theater at Madison Square Garden, before American Ricardo
Williams Jr. beat Cuba's Damian Austin 6-2 at light-welterweight.
	   ``At the beginning of the fight, I felt like I had to establish
my jab to get some respect from my opponent, and it worked,''
Shepherd said. ``There's an intimidation factor involved with Cuban
boxers, an aura, but I feel like it's coming to an end.''
	   Also posting victories were flyweight John Medina of the United
States, who edged world championship bronze medalist Omar Varvaes
of Argentina 9-8; and American Jermain Taylor, who beat
light-middleweight Nurzhin Smanov of Kazakstan by the same score.

Music firms file suit in Japan against satellite broadcaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nine music recording companies have filed a joint
suit in Japan seeking 135 million yen (dlrs 957,515) in damages for
alleged copyright infringement by digital satellite broadcasts, a
recording industry spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The suit, filed Tuesday in Tokyo District Court, accuses two
firms of broadcasting uninterrupted, copyright-protected music in
accordance with a pre-released schedule, said Junichi Ebihara, a
spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of Japan.
	   The association says the broadcasts allow potential compact disk
buyers to make illegal, digital quality copies of hit CDs, costing
recording companies business. But Daiichikosho Co., a music
software provider named in the suit, denies its programming breaks
any laws.
	   The action could prove a test case in the murky legal area where
producer rights meet high technology.
	   Daiichikosho spokesman Yuji Yamamoto said his company has no
intention of pulling the plug on the disputed programming, but has
begun reviewing its practice of publicizing detailed broadcast
schedules.
	   Fellow defendant Japan Digital Broadcasting Services Inc., which
carries the music channel on its SkyPerfecTV service, declined to
comment. JDBS is owned, in part, by Australian media mogul Rupert
Murdoch and Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp.
	   The suit was filed by Avex Inc., BMG Japan Inc., Fun House Inc.,
King Records Co., Toshiba-EMI Ltd., Universal Victor Inc., Victor
Entertainment Inc. and Warner Music Japan Inc.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A 17-year-old ranked No. 2 in the United States
kept a very good day for U.S. boxers at the Goodwill Games rolling
Tuesday with a decision over a world champion from Cuba. Roberto
Benitez outpointed flyweight champ Manuel Mantilla 12-8.
	   It was the fifth quarterfinal victory for U.S. fighters on the
second day of boxing, and the third over a Cuban foe. Another U.S.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Scottie Pippen, who helped the Chicago Bulls win
their sixth National Basketball Association title last month,
underwent back surgery at a Chicago hospital this week, a procedure
his doctor said is not career-threatening.
	   Dr. Michael Schafer, chairman of Northwestern Memorial
Hospital's department of orthopedic surgery, performed the back
operation Monday.
	   He performed similar surgery on Pippen in 1988.
	   ``I was very pleased with the surgery. The operation was
successful, and I expect Mr. Pippen will have no trouble in
resuming his career,'' Schafer said in a statement Tuesday from
Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton.
	   Pippen, a free agent, expects a rapid and full recovery without
an effect on his playing career, the statement said.
	   ``He's fine,'' Sexton said Tuesday night, adding that Pippen,
who is a free agent, should be out of the hospital Wednesday.
Recovery time, he said, is expected to be 12 weeks.
	   ``The medical people gave us glowing reports and we're
optimistic it shouldn't have an effect on the way he plays
basketball,'' Sexton said.

McGwire hits his major league-leading 45th home run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 45th
home run following Ray Lankford's grand slam in the eighth inning,
but Darrin Jackson's slam in the top of the ninth gave Milwaukee a
wild 13-10 victory over St. Louis on Tuesday night.
	   McGwire, who entered the game with just one hit in his last 20
at-bats, added to his team-record home run total with his 100th RBI
of the year. He also had a single, a walk and a sacrifice fly in
five trips to the plate.
	   His 408-foot solo shot in the eighth inning off left-hander Mike
Myers followed Ray Lankford's 17th homer of the season, which put
the Cardinals ahead 9-8. It was McGwire's second opposite-field
homer of the year.
	   David Weathers (4-4) got two outs for the victory, and Bob
Wickman pitched the ninth for his 16th save.
 &UR; Reds 13, Braves 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, the Atlanta Braves set up four Cincinnati runs
with a sloppy second inning, and Mark Wohlers had another
out-of-control relief appearance that let the Reds pull away.
	   Reds right-hander Pete Harnisch, making his second start since
signing a contract extension, left the game after three innings
because of a strained right tricep.
	   Atlanta's Kevin Millwood (11-6) also lasted three innings in
another poor road performance. The right-hander gave up five runs
and five hits as he fell to 4-3 with a 7.08 ERA in road games.
	   The Reds had a lot of help as they won for only the second time
in 12 games. Atlanta made three mistakes in a four-run second
inning that put Cincinnati in control, and Wohlers set up a
seven-run eighth inning because he once again had trouble throwing
strikes.
	   Wohlers threw only 10 strikes in 31 pitches. He retired three
batters, gave up one hit and walked five.
 &UR; Giants 7, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Kirk Rueter pitched a two-hitter and singled in the
go-ahead run, and Bill Mueller added a two-run double in a five-run
seventh inning to give San Francisco a victory over Montreal.
	   Rueter (11-6) allowed only a one-out infield single to Terry
Jones in the first inning and Orlando Cabrera's leadoff single to
center in the ninth. He struck out four and walked two.
	   Rueter, who lost his three previous starts since the All-Star
break, got his first RBI of the season with a single off Javier
Vazquez (3-9) in the seventh.
 &UR; Dodgers 7, Phillies 3 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi hit two-run homers
as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   Brian Bohanon (4-6) gave up eight hits over seven innings,
walked one and matched a career high with seven strikeouts. It was
his second win in four decisions since he was traded to Los Angeles
by the Mets on July 10.
	   Karros and Mondesi each went 2-for-4 and scored a run, and Gary
Sheffield went 2-for-3 and drove in two runs as the Dodgers won for
the 10th time in 15 games.
	   Tyler Green (6-8) lost his fourth straight start for the
Phillies, giving up six runs and six hits in six innings.
 &UR; Mets 7, Padres 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, John Olerud and Brian McRae homered and drove in
three runs apiece to lead the New York Mets over the San Diego
Padres.
	   The Mets, who have won seven of nine games, snapped San Diego's
five-game road winning streak.
	   Hideo Nomo (5-8) won his third straight start and got his third
victory for New York since debuting with the Mets on June 9. He
gave up three runs on three hits and struck out eight in five
innings.
	   Andy Ashby (14-6) lost his bid to become baseball's first
15-game winner. He gave up four runs and six hits in six innings.
 &UR; Astros 7, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Sean Bergman pitched eight strong innings and hit a
two-run double as Houston beat Florida.
	   Craig Biggio and Carl Everett each had a pair of hits and an RBI
as the Astros improved to 4-0 against the Marlins this season.
	   Bergman (10-5), who allowed two runs and seven hits, was
replaced by Trever Miller after allowing Todd Zeile's two-run homer
with no outs in the ninth.
	   Kirt Ojala (1-1) went 5 2-3 innings, allowing seven runs (only
two earned) and six hits.
 &UR; Rockies 12, Pirates 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Larry Walker homered twice and had an infield single
to take over the NL batting lead as Colorado defeated Pittsburgh.
	   It was Walker's 18th career multi-homer game and his sixth
against the Pirates, who have lost four of five. Walker has at
least two hits in eight of Colorado's last 10 games to raise his
average to .340.
	   The Rockies, winners of seven of eight, gave Pedro Astacio
(9-10) a 7-0 lead after two innings and Walker's 14th homer made it
8-0 in the fifth before Pittsburgh rallied for six runs in the
sixth.
	   In a game featuring the NL's top three hitters, Pittsburgh's
Jason Kendall went 1-for-4 to drop to .339, and Colorado's Dante
Bichette went 2-for-5 to remain at .336.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Eric Davis hit a three-run homer as the Baltimore
Orioles overcame a five-run deficit to beat the Detroit Tigers 6-5
Tuesday night.
	   Lenny Webster also homered for the Orioles, who broke a two-game
losing streak to improve to 15-3 since the All-Star break.
	   Gabe Alvarez hit his first career grand slam for the Tigers.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (4-6) allowed five runs in the first, but
then pitched five scoreless innings for Baltimore. He gave up seven
hits, struck out two and walked one.
	   Armando Benitez got the final two outs for his 14th save.
	   Bryce Florie (5-5) gave up two runs and four hits in two
innings, including Mike Bordick's tiebreaking RBI single in the
sixth.
 &UR; Blue Jays 8, Rangers 3
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens won his eighth straight decision and
Jose Canseco hit a two-run double as the Blue Jays handed the
Rangers their fourth straight loss.
	   Clemens (13-6) allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 2-3
innings, walked two and struck out four.
	   The Blue Jays broke open a 3-3 game with three runs in the
sixth. After Ed Sprague doubled, Alex Gonzalez gave Toronto a 4-3
lead with an RBI single. Rangers starter Aaron Sele (12-8) then hit
Tony Phillips with a pitch and walked Shawn Green before Canseco
doubled in two runs.
	   Shannon Stewart hit a two-run homer in the eighth for Toronto's
first inside-the-park homer since Paul Molitor against Texas in
1995.
	   Sele lost his third straight decision, giving up six runs and
nine hits in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Devil Rays 1
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle matched the major league record for
home runs in July with 15, and James Baldwin pitched 6 2-3 strong
innings as Chicago ended Tampa Bay's best-ever five-game winning
streak.
	   Belle's 32nd homer this season was also his 14th in 20 games.
The long drive to right-center in the fifth followed a walk to
Frank Thomas by Rolando Arrojo (11-7) and made it 4-0.
	   Chicago scored twice in the second Greg Norton's RBI double and
a fielding error by Devil Rays second baseman Miguel Cairo.
	   Baldwin (6-4) won for the fourth time in five decisions,
allowing four hits and losing his shutout in the seventh on Wade
Boggs' double and Quinton McCracken's run-scoring single.
	   Bill Simas pitched a perfect ninth for his 10th save.
 &UR; Twins 3, Royals 0
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Brad Radke pitched 7 2-3 shutout
innings and Todd Walker tied a Minnesota record with his ninth
straight hit.
	   Radke (10-8) gave up four hits, struck out two and walked one.
He didn't allow a runner past first base until Mike Sweeney doubled
with two outs in the eighth.
	   Walker hit an RBI single in the second inning to tie the team
record for consecutive hits set in 1967 by Tony Oliva and matched
in 1985 by Mickey Hatcher.
	   Walker also matched the Twins' record of reaching base in 11
straight plate appearances.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 25th save.
	   The Twins scored all their runs in the second off Glendon Rusch
(6-13), who didn't give up a hit after the third inning but still
tied Oakland's Tom Candiotti for most losses in the AL.

Time-bomb damages transport official's house outside Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A time-bomb that police suspect was planted by
extremists opposed to Tokyo's international airport exploded at the
home of a former aviation official Wednesday, triggering a fire
that slightly injured him.
	   Makoto Harunari, 47, suffered minor burns on his left leg while
battling the fire started by a blast at 3:15 a.m. at his home's
front entrance in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, police said.
	   The fire was quickly put out, and no other major injuries, a
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   No suspects have been arrested or identified, but the spokesman
said it was possible radicals opposed to the Narita International
Airport were involved.
	   Investigators have found a lead cable and batteries _ equipment
often used in time-bomb guerrilla attacks, he said.
	   Harunari, chief of Maritime Industry Division of the
Transportation Ministry, was a negotiator in international aviation
talks until 1992, though his position did not involve negotiations
with anti-airport radicals.
	   The airport at Narita, 65 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, has long been a focus of protests by farmers who feel they
were not properly consulted when it was built in the late 1960s and
1970s. The airport opened in 1978.
	   The sometimes violent protests were often joined by leftist
radicals who feared the government secretly planned to use the
airport for military purposes.
	   Sporadic attacks by leftist radical groups against the airport
continue. Early in June, a predawn explosion destroyed two buses
used to ferry passengers to the airport. Another bomb exploded at
the home of an airport official in April. No one was hurt in either
blast.

Singapore authorities see rise in drug syndicates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore authorities have broken up 19 drug
syndicates so far this year, nearly double the number caught during
the same period last year, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Central Narcotics Bureau was quoted as saying by The Straits
Times that the increase was due to improved intelligence and more
intense enforcement efforts.
	   The agency smashed 10 such syndicates during the same period in
1997.
	   In the latest action, narcotics officers seized over 1.8
kilograms (4 pounds) of heroin, along with methamphetamine and
other drugs, in an operation that ended early Tuesday. Some 30
Singaporeans in a syndicate working out of a public housing
apartment were arrested.
	   Under Singapore's tough drug laws, any adult caught with 15
grams (0.53 ounces) of heroin can be executed for drug dealing.
More than 180 people have been hanged since the law was imposed in
1975.
	   Singapore has repeatedly defended its drug laws, arguing that
the tough measures have brought the problem under control.

Cargo handler says recovery program ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The main cargo handler at Hong Kong's troubled
airport boosted its operations on Wednesday, and said it was
slightly ahead of schedule for returning to normal operations.
	   While airport officials managed to iron out most problems at the
passenger terminal shortly after the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok
airport opened July 6, cargo-handling has been a much tougher
problem.
	   A series of problems at its new terminal forced the main cargo
handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to limit imports and
exports, and to reopen some facilities at the old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   Both the government and the cargo handler have come in for
scathing criticism from legislators and businessmen who fear the
problems will further hurt Hong Kong's economy. Air cargo is an
important industry, and Hong Kong already is suffering from
recession and unemployment that has risen to a 15-year high of 4.5
percent.
	   Over the weekend, the cargo handler began accepting one pallet
of general cargo per passenger plane arriving at Chek Lap Kok. On
Wednesday, it began permitting two pallets.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of the cargo handler, said in
a statement that prior to the increase, it had averaged more than
2,700 tons of cargo a day for the previous seven days.
	   He said the company was making steady progress, and was slightly
ahead of schedule for a four-phase plan it announced earlier this
month.
	   The plan called for cargo handling to be at 75 percent of the
normal capacity of 4,000 tons a day by the end of July, using
facilities at both the old and new airports; full capacity using
both airports by mid-August; and 100 percent capacity using only
the new airport by the end of August.

Ministry urges Thai mothers to save money by breast feeding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai health officials say mothers could
save money during the country's economic crisis by breast-feeding
their babies.
	   ``On average, a Thai mother could save about 2,500 baht (dlrs
61) a month by breast feeding her baby for the first four months,''
said Dr. Siriporn Kanjana, director of the Health Ministry's bureau
of health promotion.
	   She said on Wednesday the savings would come from not having to
buy infant formula, bottles, detergent and water.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in modern
times. More than a million people are now unemployed, and most
others are looking for ways to economize as inflation is expected
to reach about 11 percent this year.
	   The World Alliance Breast feeding Action group is launching a
Breast Feeding Week starting Saturday, and has chosen ``Breast
feeding: The Best Investment'' as the theme of this year's
campaign.
	   Dr. Siriporn said only about 50 percent of Thai mothers breast
feed their babies. With more women entering the work force, many
have come to view breast feeding as backward, she said.
	   Dr. Viraphong Chatranond of Bangkok's Sirirat Hospital said that
increasing use of infant formulas is partly responsible for a
decline in intelligence quotients among Thai children, according to
Wednesday's Bangkok Post newspaper.

	   In Phoenix, Sammy Sosa hit his second grand slam in as many
nights for his career-high 41st homer, but the Chicago Cubs lost to
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Sosa, who has four home runs in three games, had the longest
streak of homers without a grand slam from the start of his career
_ 246 _ before he hit one Monday night.
	   He hit another in the fifth inning Tuesday, becoming the 16th
major leaguer to hit a grand slam in consecutive games and second

	   Foreign ministers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan,
South Korea, the European Union, and the United States held a
special meeting with Ohn Gyaw on Tuesday, asking him to relay a
request to his government that the impasse be resolved and the
diplomats be allowed access to Suu Kyi on the highway outside the
capital.
	   ``We have our ways to deal with the impasse,'' Gyaw told the
news conference, as the other ministers sat next to him. ``As far
as I know here health is in good condition. Also, we have arranged
for some food and facilities to be available.'' He said an
ambulance was also standing by, but Suu Kyi's supporters have said
she would not use it.
	   The government in Myanmar has accused Suu Kyi of staging a
publicity stunt to draw attention during the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations meetings in Manila. Ohn Gyaw told the news
conference Wednesday that Suu Kyi had left the capital without
saying where she was going.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who left Manila
Wednesday morning after attending the conference, said the United
States would hold the Myanmar military responsible for the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright had said earlier.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said in a
statement Tuesday that her food is running out and that she should
be allowed to proceed before her health fails.
	   ``The provisions in the car, water and edibles, are nearly
exhausted,'' the statement said.

Nuclear tests, Asian crisis seen dominating Australia-U.S. talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis and the
recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan are expected to dominate
top-level diplomatic and defense talks this week between the United
States and Australia, senior Australian officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
arrive in Sydney late Wednesday to attend the latest round of
Australia-United States Ministerial, or AUSMIN, talks. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen is already in Sydney.
	   They will meet Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan on Friday aboard the Australian
warship HMAS Watson. Senior military officials will also attend the
talks, which are the most senior regular talks between the two
countries and are held annually.
	   Australian officials said this year's talks will take place
``against a very different regional environment'' to those of last
year.
	   ``The Asian economic crisis and the nuclear testing by India and
Pakistan bring a very changed situation to our discussions,'' said
a senior Australian diplomat, on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We'll be meeting against some fairly major dramatic events
that have taken place that would affect ... the security and the
economic stability of the region.''
	   Talks would concentrate on the strategic outlook for the region
and the Australia-United States relationship.
	   ``Australia needs to work together with the United States and
the countries of the region, both bilaterally and in international
organizations, to help meet the challenges that have become
apparent in the region,'' said the official at a briefing.
	   ``We will be looking to the dialogue at the meeting to develop
practical and sensible, forward-looking ways to meet those
challenges.
	   ``Ministers are aiming to reaffirm and carry forward the
Australia-U.S. alliance as a cornerstone or our security and
prosperity, which is a key element of Asia-Pacific security and
stability.''
	   Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday said the government will
also use the talks to protest against U.S. moves to subsidize
agricultural exports in traditional Australian markets.
	   ``We are obviously unhappy about some of the protectionist
policies of the Americans in agriculture,'' Howard said Wednesday
in a radio interview.
	   Earlier this month, the United States announced it plans to buy
surplus wheat from domestic farmers and to give it to needy
countries, including Indonesia and Sudan.
	   Australia's farmers are the most efficient producers in the
world, with the lowest level of export subsidies, Howard said.
	   ``It is an insult to them when despite that efficiency ... they
find other countries with enormous financial muscle pushing them
out of third world markets,'' Howard said.
	   Howard will host a dinner at his Sydney residence for the
visiting Americans.
	   A joint communique was expected to be issued after the talks
Friday.

Obuchi pieces together cabinet to tackle economic problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Incoming premier Keizo Obuchi worked Wednesday to
piece a Cabinet to attack Japan's economic woes, appealing in
person to a former prime minister to take the high-profile job of
finance minister.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally ask elder statesman Kiichi
Miyazawa, 78, later Wednesday to take the helm of the powerful
Finance Ministry and to call on a handful of other ruling party
veterans to fill out the Cabinet's top posts.
	   Obuchi, who last week was voted president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, is nearly certain to be elected prime minister
when Parliament convenes on Thursday since the LDP has a
comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house.
	   The incoming premier said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert
in finance and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled
financial sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left
over from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   ``He has a deep understanding of the problem and is trusted
internationally. I want to ask him from the bottom of my heart'' to
accept the post, Obuchi told reporters.
	   Miyazawa, a former Finance Ministry official, also speaks fluent
English and is well known internationally, traits that would help
him present Japan's policies abroad. The Tokyo stock market rallied
on Wednesday when it looked like he would take the job.
	   Three of Japan's leading newspapers reported Wednesday that
Miyazawa would accept the offer, citing sources close to Miyazawa.
But the veteran politician, who held the finance portfolio once
before, remained coy in public.
	   Miyazawa was quoted by national broadcaster NHK as saying he
would like to decline the offer, and that the position should go
instead to former LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato. Kato is seen
as a likely successor to Miyazawa as leader of an important faction
in the party.
	   But few believed Miyazawa would actually say no when Obuchi
formally offered him the post. Japanese politicians often turn down
a position several times publicly before accepting a formal offer
as a way of improving the terms of the offer or securing a better
post for a political ally.
	   Obuchi has pledged to put together an ``economic reform
Cabinet.'' He has said he would appoint a political heavyweight as
finance minister to lead Japan out of its worst recession since
World War II.
	   Other key posts in the new cabinet were also expected to go to
ruling party veterans.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
The post functions as chief of staff and chief spokesman for the
prime minister.
	   Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister, according to Kyodo news.
	   The only glitch in Obuchi's march to the prime minister's spot
appeared to be the LDP's weak position in the upper house, where
the party lost seats in a humiliating defeat in July 12 elections.
	   The Yomiuri reported this week that the upper house, where
opposition parties hold more seats than the LDP, may vote to elect
popular opposition leader Naoto Kan as prime minister.
	   The move would be largely symbolic, however, since the
constitution gives the lower house the power to overrule the upper
house in the election.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The military government of Myanmar
has refused to allow U.S. and Japanese diplomats to see opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose health was reportedly deteriorating
as she spent a fifth day at a police roadblock Wednesday.
	   ``At this juncture the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Myanmar's foreign minister, Ohn Gyaw, told a news conference at the
end of a week of meetings with other Southeast Asian nations and
world powers.
	   Seven foreign ministers met with Ohn Gyaw on Tuesday to press
concerns about human rights and to ask that the Japanese ambassador
and the U.S. charges d'affaires in Myanmar be allowed to visit Suu
Kyi. She was stopped last Friday as she traveled by car to meet
with members of her party, the National League for Democracy.
	   ``Our proposal was quite a moderate one. This response is not
satisfactory, that is clear,'' the European Union representative,
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria, said after Ohn
Gyaw's remarks.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told reporters that
another attempt would be made Wednesday to get permission for
Western diplomats to see Suu Kyi, who he said was ill.
	   ``I'm not very hopeful that we will be able to meet with her,''
Downer said. ``Her doctor said her blood pressure is falling, and
she's not so well.''
	   Foreign ministers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan,
South Korea, the European Union, and the United States held a
special meeting with Ohn Gyaw on Tuesday, asking him to relay a
request to his government that the impasse be resolved and the
diplomats be allowed access to Suu Kyi on the highway outside the
capital.
	   ``We have our ways to deal with the impasse,'' Gyaw told the

as I know her health is in good condition. Also, we have arranged
for some food and facilities to be available.'' He said an
ambulance was also standing by, but Suu Kyi's supporters have said
she would not use it.
	   The government in Myanmar has accused Suu Kyi of staging a
publicity stunt to draw attention during the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations meetings in Manila. Ohn Gyaw told the news
conference that Suu Kyi had left the capital without saying where
she was going.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who left Manila
Wednesday morning after attending the meetings, said the United
States would hold the Myanmar military responsible for the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright said earlier.
	   Suu Kyi's party said in a statement Tuesday that her food is
running out and that she should be allowed to proceed before her
health fails.
	   ``The provisions in the car, water and edibles, are nearly
exhausted,'' the statement said.

Japanese vehicle exports fall 9.9 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's exports of buses, cars and trucks fell 9.9
percent in June compared to a year ago to 375,608 vehicles, the
second consecutive month of declines, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association said Wednesday.
	   Japanese vehicle exports to the United States _ a key component
of the country's trade surplus with the U.S. _ fell 13.4 percent to
103,894, the association said.
	   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, saw its overall
exports fall 10.2 percent to 125,834 vehicles, the automaker said.
Exports from second-ranked Nissan Motor Co. dipped 1.7 percent to
61,810, it said.
	   Honda Motor Co. exports declined 5.3 percent to 43,500 vehicles
and Mazda Motor Corp. exports shrank 31.2 percent to 35,671.
	   Total passenger car exports last month for all carmakers dropped
10.3 percent to 298,200, while truck exports fell 8.7 percent to
72,928, the association said. Bus exports sank 4.7 percent to
4,480, it said.
	   After rising each month over a two-year period, vehicle exports
slipped 3.9 percent in May.
	   For the first six months of this year, total vehicle exports
from Japan rose 3.9 percent to 2.3 million.

Doctors say Suu Kyi dehydrating as road standoff enters sixth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi's doctors said the
Nobel laureate was showing signs of dehydration as she entered a
sixth day Wednesday under siege on a rural highway, with Myanmar's
military refusing to let her travel outside Yangon.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians examined her on Tuesday in
her white Toyota Mark II sedan, 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of
the capital.
	   They requested the military allow them to monitor Suu Kyi's
condition twice a day and asked she be provided with facilities to
wash herself, according to a statement from Suu Kyi's political
party received in Bangkok on Wednesday.
	   Members of her party have said her food is running out and they
are concerned about her health.
	   Suu Kyi, a colleague and two drivers, were stopped outside
Yangon on Friday morning by government officials as they attempted
to travel to the city of Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west
of the capital to meet with members of her political party.
	   The government has said she is trying to foment unrest. On
Wednesday it refused a request by seven Western nations that U.S.
and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional bloc.
	   Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, has tried to travel
outside the capital three times this month and has been stopped
each time by the government.
	   The military has allowed her to make only one trip to the
provinces since her release from six years of house arrest in July
1995, visiting a Buddhist monk later that year in the city of
Pa-an, 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital.
	   Her party issued a statement on Saturday that said the military
had placed barbed-wire barricades, sand bags and a contingent of
soldiers around the car to prevent it from proceeding.
	   The government escorted local journalists to the scene on
Sunday. By then, Suu Kyi's car had been moved to a narrow wooden
bridge over a small stream in a marshy area off the highway.
	   The bridge appeared wide enough only for one vehicle, and about
a dozen plain clothes government security personnel were stationed
nearby along with a military ambulance.
	   No barricades, sand bags or uniformed soldiers were seen at that
time. Suu Kyi's party issued a statement saying she would not
accept medical treatment from the military or local authorities and
that she must be treated by her personal physicians.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week that the
U.S. will hold Myanmar's military government directly responsible
for Suu Kyi's health and welfare.
	   United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
issued a statement Tuesday saying there are legitimate concerns for
Suu Kyi's health and safety.
	   And at a meeting of Southeast Asia's regional bloc in Manila
this week, foreign ministers from Japan, South Korea, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the European Union pressured Myanmar to end
human rights abuses and let Suu Kyi proceed.

Japan's splintered opposition likely to be ruling party's trump

 &UR; With BC-Japan-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Humiliated by a stunning defeat in Parliamentary
elections and bleeding from an internal battle to find a new
leader, Japan's ruling party heads towards this week's vote for a
new premier looking hobbled and divided.
	   But if things are bad for the ruling Liberal Democrats, they
need only to look at the opposition camp for solace.
	   Although it is riding high on a wave of voter anger against the
ruling party's mismanagement of the sour economy, Japan's main
opposition Democratic Party has yet to shake off its image as a
ragtag bunch of legislators united only in their desire to oust the
LDP from power.
	   The Democratic Party's charismatic leader, Naoto Kan _ Japan's
most popular politician _ is trying to portray his group as broad
cathedral open to members with diverse views.
	   But many analysts see the party in a different light.
	   ``The Democratic Party is like an inn filled with little bosses
from a wide variety of groups,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, a professor
of politics at prestigious Tokyo University. ``They eat together
but don't really agree on anything.''
	   The Democrats only registered formally as a political party in
April, and they consist of splinter groups from defunct political
parties, whose members range from conservative hawks to
left-leaning liberals.
	   Many of them entertain closer ties to politicians outside of
their party than within it, Inoguchi says.
	   The Democratic Party's main hold on public hearts is their
leader Kan, who became a national hero as health minister in 1996
by taking on his own bureaucracy and exposing its role in allowing
the marketing of HIV-tainted blood products.
	   But the Democrats' inability to offer policies that distinguish
them from the LDP could truncate the political honeymoon they've
been enjoying in the wake of their major gains in elections for the
upper house of Parliament on July 12.
	   Parliament on Thursday convenes to vote for Japan's new prime
minister and the ruling party's choice of colorless Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi is almost certain to win because the party
controls the legislature's powerful lower house.
	   In spite of its record low-popularity, analysts say the LDP will
have little trouble forging an alliance with the opposition Komei
party, which will allow it to pass crucial economic recovery
legislation in Parliament's upper house, where it has a minority of
seats.
	   That means the Democrats will have to rely on more than just
voter dissatisfaction and the personal appeal of its leader to have
any hope of maintaining its current high approval ratings.
	   Much of the problem for the opposition is that there is only one
big issue obsessing the Japanese public _ the economy _ and almost
everyone seems to agree now on the what has to be done: Big tax
cuts and aggressive action to clean up the bad loan mess in the
banking system.
	   If the ruling party manages to keep its promises to fix the
economy, the public may be more inclined to forgive its past sins.
	   ``Everybody says Kan, Kan ... but I don't think it'll make any
difference who leads the country,'' said Katsuhiko Moriya, a
gas-station manager in Tokyo. ``If the LDP can turn the economy
around, I think it'll be possible to support them again.''
	   The dramatic gains made by the traditionally marginal Communist
Party in the upper house polls showed the extent to which the
election was a protest vote against LDP inertia rather than a show
of support for the opposition. The Communists almost doubled their
seats in the upper house and became Japan's second largest
opposition party.
	   And if the LDP can muster the unity to rally around
premier-in-waiting Keizo Obuchi after a raucous leadership
election, the opposition may have a long wait before being granted
a realistic chance of wresting power from the ruling party.
	   ``The Democrats will be able to keep up the pressure by
screaming a lot in Parliament,'' said Inoguchi. ``But if general
elections are called, it seems unlikely that the country will trust
them.''

Nine killed in South African attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ Gunmen burst into a home in a
rural area and fatally shot nine people, including five children,
police said Wednesday.
	   The killings took place Tuesday night as the victims slept in a
house outside this town 280 miles (450 kilometers) southeast of
Johannesburg. At least 30 people have been killed in and around
Richmond in the past month.
	   The motive for the latest attack was unknown.
	   What is behind the other killings also remains murky. Some
connect the violence to next year's elections, the second all-race
voting since the end of apartheid.
	   Richmond is in KwaZulu-Natal province, the scene of a decade of
political violence in the 1980s and 1990s between the African
National Congress and Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party that
killed 10,000 people.
	   The ANC condemned Tuesday night's attack.

Official: Singapore's economy grew 3.8 percent in first 6 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said the city-state's economy grew by ``a modest 3.8 percent'' in
the first half of 1998, The Straits Times reported Wednesday.
	   Lee's comment reinforced an estimate made in late June by
Finance Minister Richard Hu, who said the economy grew by 1.9
percent in the second quarter following a 5.9 percent expansion in
the first.
	   ``The economy is continuing to deteriorate,'' Lee told the
gathering Tuesday evening in Singapore.
	   The official government estimate calls for gross domestic
product to expand by 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent this year, but
analysts have projected the economy will contract this year.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong warned earlier that the
chances the nation will slide into recession next year are ``fairly
high.''

Vietnam tries 23 people for counterfeiting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Vietnamese court has sentenced one man
to death, another to life in prison and given 21 other members of
an ethnic Chinese gang 16-year jail terms for counterfeiting the
country's currency, a court official said Wednesday.
	   The two-day trial in southern Ho Chi Minh City ended Tuesday.
The court condemned Tran De to death and Lam Khanh Minh to life in
prison, said presiding judge Phan Tanh who presided over the court
proceedings.
	   Both convicts are ethnic Chinese. The judge said he spared Lam
Khanh Minh the death penalty because he turned himself in to
police.
	   Police are still searching for Guo Hanken, whom they say is the
ring leader.
	   The case was uncovered in January 1997 when some shop owners
told police they had received counterfeit money in 10,000 dong (75
cents) and 50,000 dong (dlrs 3.85) notes from some customers.
	   Tran De and Lam Khanh Minh confessed that in December 1996 they
had smuggled about 300 million counterfeit dong (dlrs 23,000) given
to them by Guo Hanken in Lang Son province, bordering China, to Ho
Chi Minh City.
	   Tanh said police seized more than 47 million fake dong (dlrs
3,615). The suspects burned as police raided them and some had been
spent to buy gold, home appliances and electronic goods.
	   Tanh said the convicts have 15 days to appeal.
	   Counterfeit money, mostly in 50,000-dong (dlrs 3.85) and
10,000-dong (75 cents) notes, is common in Vietnam where a number
of offenses _ including murder, drug trafficking and corruption _
are punishable by death.
	   Two weeks ago, a Chinese man was executed by firing squad in
northern Cao Bang province for trafficking in more than 100 million
fake dong (dlrs 7,700).

Chinese leader backs effort to close down army businesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's army risks becoming ``a hotbed of
corruption'' if it resists a presidential decree ordering an end to
its vast business activities, a top leader said in remarks reported
by state media Wednesday.
	   President Jiang Zemin has ordered military businesses closed as
part of a campaign to remake China's army, the world's largest,
into a modern, professional force.
	   The move was a bold stroke for Jiang because the army is
politically powerful, while he is militarily inexperienced. But
Jiang has won public declarations of support from senior generals
and government leaders.
	   Vice President Hu Jintao, considered a possible successor to
Jiang, told a conference on Tuesday that the president's order
marked ``a major step'' in reshaping the 2.9 million-member army
and battling official corruption. It also was important for
stability and China's moves toward a market economy, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   By engaging in business, ``the powerful army, armed police and
law-enforcement departments could become a hotbed of corruption,''
Hu warned. He said the military must ``put the nation's and the
people's interests above anything else'' by complying with Jiang's
order, Xinhua quoted Hu as saying.
	   So far, the government has not specified how it plans to go
about the daunting task of unravelling the extensive and entrenched
business interests of the People's Liberation Army, which range
from pharmaceutical and truck manufacturing to night clubs and
hotels.
	   At a PLA briefing in April, a senior Chinese colonel said the
military would get out of business ``to the extent that it's
practical,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   He said the military's withdrawal from business would depend on
government budget increases and on how badly military spouses are
affected by layoffs at state-run enterprises.
	   Seeking to preempt any evasion of Jiang's order, another senior
leader said the military and armed police were prohibited from
hiding, relocating, transferring or selling properties belonging to
enterprises they run, Xinhua said.
	   Wei Jianxing, who like Hu is a member of the ruling Communist
Party's elite Politburo Standing Committee, also said they must not
make false financial reports, nor rewrite, hide or destroy
financial documents belonging to these firms, Xinhua said.
	   Wei added that anyone suspected of being involved in criminal
cases would be stopped from going abroad, it said.
	   The order banning the military from commercial ventures was part
of a new government campaign to eradicate pervasive smuggling.
	   By playing up the army's role in smuggling, Chinese leaders may
be trying to shame military leaders into going along with Jiang's
order and overcome the kind of resistance that foiled attempts in
the early 1990s to get the military out of business.
	   Hu stated openly that army, armed police and law-enforcement
units have engaged in smuggling and the sale of smuggled goods, and
said their involvement in such illegal activities would sully their
image, Xinhua said.

Dollar slips, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Wednesday
amid growing speculation that a veteran politician known for his
financial expertise will become Japan's next finance minister.
Japanese stocks closed mixed.
	   The dollar bought 141.28 yen in mid-afternoon, down 0.66 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also slightly below its late New
York rate of 141.35 yen overnight.
	   The dollar moved lower against the yen after Japanese newspapers
said Wednesday that former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling
party elder and economic policy expert, was likely to be named
finance minister, traders said.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is expected to be voted in
Thursday as Japan's next prime minister, has been courting Miyazawa
to serve as finance minister in his Cabinet.
	   Obuchi has pledged to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister to accelerate efforts to stimulate the sluggish Japanese
economy and carry out needed economic reforms.
	   ``The Miyazawa news is largely factored in, so I don't think
we'll get much movement when an announcement is made,'' said Minoru
Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   In New York overnight, the dollar fell in part on concern about
a former White House intern's decision to testify about her
relationship with President Clinton, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started lower after an
overnight fall on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
avenge closed at 8,934.78 on Tuesday, down 93.46.
	   But buying from public pension fund reversed the course by
midmorning, and trading then turned mixed in the afternoon as
investors awaited the selection of Japan's new finance minister.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
43.55 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 16,158.09. On Tuesday, it
rose 170.18 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,240.70.
The TOPIX had risen 8.24 points, or 0.67 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.275 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.310 percent, driving its price up to 111.27 yen from 111.03 yen.

Non-binding auction called to sell bankrupt Korean steelmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks will begin screening
potential buyers of bankrupt Hanbo Steel Industry Co. in September,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Interested investors will be asked to submit non-binding bids on
Sept. 15 and those making the best offers will be invited to
participate in an auction in October.
	   Local media reported that potential investors include U.S. Steel
and several other companies in Taiwan, Brazil and the Netherlands.
	   Hanbo, the nation's second largest steel company with an annual
production capacity of 3 million tons, collapsed in January last
year under the weight of dlrs 6 billion in debt, most of it in
low-interest, government-controlled loans.
	   In mid-1997, South Korea's state-run Pohang Iron and Steel Corp.
offered dlrs 2.5 billion for key facilities of Hanbo, excluding its
debts. Creditor banks rejected the offer, saying the price was too
low.
	   Like many other big South Korean businesses, Hanbo had borrowed
heavily to finance its aggressive expansion programs. But sales
lagged in 1996 amid an overall economic slowdown, producing a cash
crunch.
	   A prosecution investigation into Hanbo's bankruptcy uncovered a
major bribes-for-loans scandal involving politicians, bankers and
government officials.
	   About a dozen people, including Hanbo's owner, Chung Tae-soo,
were convicted of giving or taking bribes in exchange for
low-interest bank loans.
	   Hanbo is the second major South Korean firm to be put up for
sale. Bids already are being sought for bankrupt Kia Motors Co.
which collapsed last year with dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.

Russia sees no political will in council for scaling back Iraq
</HEADLINE>
nuclear probe &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia, which had taken a leading role in
pushing to have nuclear inspections in Iraq scaled back, now
concedes there isn't the political will in the Security Council for
any formal reduction.
	   As a result, the 15-member council wasn't expected to take any
action after receiving the latest report from the International
Atomic Energy Agency and a briefing Wednesday by IAEA chief Garry
Dillon.
	   The next IAEA report is due in October, when U.N. sanctions are
to be reviewed. But council diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Baghdad would have to provide a good deal more
information between now and October if the council _ in particular
the United States _ would agree to scale back inspections.
	   Washington blocked an effort in May by Russia, France and China
to shift from intrusive inspections to passive monitoring and
verification visits, citing continued questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities. It could do the same in October unless IAEA
inspectors get tangible evidence that Iraq is cooperating and
coming forward with more information, the diplomats said Tuesday.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the IAEA's work in Iraq
had essentially already been reduced to long-term monitoring. But
in an interview Tuesday, he said ``I don't believe there is the
political will'' in the council now to formally codify such a
scaleback.
	   The IAEA report, obtained Monday, said U.N. inspectors had found
no evidence that Baghdad was trying to maintain its nuclear program
but said they also couldn't certify that no such evidence existed.
	   It noted that ``Iraq had made significant progress in
weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when the
inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf War.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It urged that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring system
continue to try to answer the remaining questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.
	   The Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington nonproliferation
advocacy group, warned against any scaleback in inspections, saying
questions remain about Iraq's nuclear ability, such as whether a
full-scale model of Iraq's bomb design exists.
	   ``The Security Council should not close the nuclear file or
weaken sanctions until these matters are fully resolved,'' said the
group's president, Paul Leventhal.

Driving rain drives Yeltsin back to Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Disappointed by 10 days of rainy weather in
northwestern Russia, President Boris Yeltsin is flying back to
Moscow on Wednesday to continue his vacation elsewhere.
	   Yeltsin has been vacationing since July 18 at the government
lakeside resort of Shuiskaya Chupa in the region of Karelia, near
the border with Finland. But he's been stuck indoors the entire
time as rains have lashed the region without interruption, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   The president will spend a day or two at his country residence
outside Moscow before continuing his vacation somewhere else, the
presidential press service said. Yeltsin has not yet made up his
mind about the new vacation spot.
	   The Kremlin has previously said that Yeltsin will not return to
work before the end of August. Early in the month he is expected to
travel to the to Severomorsk, a military port on the Barents Sea,
to inaugurate the recently built nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great.

Son of comprador and former Taiwan adviser dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Ho Sai-lai, the soldier-son of Hong Kong's
original comprador and a former adviser to Taiwan's government, has
died at age 92, local news reports said Wednesday.
	   Ho, also known as Robert or Robbie, was the third son of Sir
Robert Hotung.
	   Compradors were Chinese who worked for the large foreign trading
houses based in Hong Kong and southern China. They served as
middlemen between the traders and the Chinese bureaucracy, and
often became wealthy in their own right.
	   Hotung worked for Jardine's, one of the first and largest of the
trading houses.
	   Ho was born in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and
attended military academies in Britain and France, rising to the
rank of general in the Chinese army under Nationalist Chiang
Kai-shek, the South China Morning Post reported.
	   After the World War II, he represented the Nationalists in
delegations to Japan, the United States and United Nations, it
said.
	   Ho returned to Hong Kong in 1962 to run a newspaper, the Kung
Sheung Daily News, which closed in 1984 when Britain and China
struck their deal to return Hong Kong to China. The decision to
close the paper was seen as a vote of no confidence in the future
of Hong Kong by a pro-Taiwan newspaper.
	   Ho lived at the family home, Hotung Garden, on Hong Kong's
exclusive Peak. At the beginning of the century, the Hotungs were
the first Chinese to live there after being exempted from a law
which excluded non-Europeans.
	   Taiwanese reports said Ho's only son long ago moved the family
business abroad. The funeral was scheduled for Aug. 5.

Obuchi pieces together cabinet to tackle economic problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES missing `together' in lead &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Incoming premier Keizo Obuchi worked Wednesday to
piece together a Cabinet to attack Japan's economic woes, appealing
in person to a former prime minister to take the high-profile job
of finance minister.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally ask elder statesman Kiichi
Miyazawa, 78, later Wednesday to take the helm of the powerful
Finance Ministry and to call on a handful of other ruling party
veterans to fill out the Cabinet's top posts.
	   Obuchi, who last week was voted president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, is nearly certain to be elected prime minister
when Parliament convenes on Thursday since the LDP has a
comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house.
	   The incoming premier said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert
in finance and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled
financial sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left
over from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   ``He has a deep understanding of the problem and is trusted
internationally. I want to ask him from the bottom of my heart'' to
accept the post, Obuchi told reporters.
	   Miyazawa, a former Finance Ministry official, also speaks fluent
English and is well known internationally, traits that would help
him present Japan's policies abroad. The Tokyo stock market rallied
on Wednesday when it looked like he would take the job.
	   Three of Japan's leading newspapers reported Wednesday that
Miyazawa would accept the offer, citing sources close to Miyazawa.
But the veteran politician, who held the finance portfolio once
before, remained coy in public.
	   Miyazawa was quoted by national broadcaster NHK as saying he
would like to decline the offer, and that the position should go
instead to former LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato. Kato is seen
as a likely successor to Miyazawa as leader of an important faction
in the party.
	   But few believed Miyazawa would actually say no when Obuchi
formally offered him the post. Japanese politicians often turn down
a position several times publicly before accepting a formal offer
as a way of improving the terms of the offer or securing a better
post for a political ally.
	   Obuchi has pledged to put together an ``economic reform
Cabinet.'' He has said he would appoint a political heavyweight as
finance minister to lead Japan out of its worst recession since
World War II.
	   Other key posts in the new cabinet were also expected to go to
ruling party veterans.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
The post functions as chief of staff and chief spokesman for the
prime minister.
	   Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister, according to Kyodo news.
	   The only glitch in Obuchi's march to the prime minister's spot
appeared to be the LDP's weak position in the upper house, where
the party lost seats in a humiliating defeat in July 12 elections.
	   The Yomiuri reported this week that the upper house, where
opposition parties hold more seats than the LDP, may vote to elect
popular opposition leader Naoto Kan as prime minister.
	   The move would be largely symbolic, however, since the
constitution gives the lower house the power to overrule the upper
house in the election.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Despite confusion over who is running
the Philippines' premier freeport, investors there are not planning
to leave, a spokesman for the local business chamber said
Wednesday.
	   The month-old dispute over who should head the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority, which manages the Subic Bay Freeport, arose
after President Joseph Estrada fired its chairman, Richard Gordon,
and replaced him with a Gordon critic, Felicito Payumo.
	   Gordon, who claims he still has a six-year term, challenged his
dismissal and brought it to an appeal court, which has not yet
ruled on the legality of his ouster.
	   On Sunday, about 100 people were injured when his supporters
clashed with police and firemen sent to oust them from the
freeport's headquarters building, which they have occupied since
June 29.
	   Gordon and his group moved to a nearby building where they
continue to issue directives to investors and local residents.
	   Payumo, meanwhile, is trying to run the freeport from a
temporary office at the local airport.
	   ``Business seems to be rolling along,'' said Bob Couttie,
spokesman of the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce. ``The main
problem is the confusion because of the two chairmen.''
	   He said investors who need to renew their business permits do
not know where to pay the fees and whether documents they obtain
now from one camp will later be recognized as valid by the other
camp once the chairmanship dispute is settled by the courts.
	   Couttie said investors are relieved, however, that seaport and
airport operations, their business lifeline, have not been hampered
by the dispute.
	   ``What has been interesting is that most of them don't seem to
be moving out,'' he said. ``They are convinced of the long-term
prospects of the place. This is a local blip on the radar. This is
not the end of Subic Bay.''
	   He said at least two medium-size companies have expressed
interest in investing at Subic despite the dispute, but many others
are going to ``sit back and see what happens.''
	   ``The image (of Subic) has not been a good one'' because of the
dispute, he said.
	   Subic, a former U.S. naval base 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Manila, was converted into an industrial and tourism center after
the Americans left in 1992.
	   More than 200 companies now make a wide range of products such
as business suits, shoes, computer circuit boards, cranes, yachts
and armored personnel carriers.
	   Exports over the past four years have totaled almost dlrs 1.4
billion.
	   The industrial zone now employs close to 70,000 workers, more
than double the number during the time it was a U.S. base.

Former rebel leader finds it's harder to build than to destroy

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Nearly two years after signing a
peace pact with the government and being elected governor of an
autonomous region, former Muslim rebel leader Nur Misuari says it
is easier to destroy than to build.
	   Misuari, 57, led the Moro National Liberation Front which fought
some of the most brutal battles in recent Philippine history. By
the time he signed the peace accord on Sept. 2, 1996, the 25-year
struggle for Muslim self-rule had left more than 120,000 people
dead.
	   After exchanging his combat fatigues for business suits, the
soft-spoken former political science instructor also shifted from
guerrilla tactics to board room negotiations to win investments for
his impoverished region in the southern Philippines.
	   ``It is a lot easier to blow up, to destroy infrastructure than
to find the funds to build it,'' Misuari said in an interview this
week.
	   As governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,
Misuari's main concerns now are attracting businessmen to revive
the local economy, which was crippled by the rebellion.
	   ``There was a time when all we thought about was weapons and
tactics, how to make problems for the government and sabotage the
economy,'' he said. ``Now it's how to get water for the far-flung
areas, working with foreign investors, and seeking ways to
alleviate the effects of the currency crisis on all of our people
in Mindanao.''
	   After the peace agreement was signed, the government said it
will develop the main southern island of Mindanao as the gateway
for foreign investors to the southern Philippines and to a new East
Asian ``growth area'' comprising Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos, who pushed the talks with the
rebels, said the government hopes to bring the poverty level in the
region down from 47 percent to 15 percent by the year 2010.
	   Plans include a railway, new roads and airports, but Misuari has
complained that the government has been slow to release funds.
	   With a budget deficit expected to reach as high as 70 billion
pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) this year plus a 25 percent cut in
government spending, it is unlikely that the new government of
President Joseph Estrada will be able to shift more funds for
Mindanao.
	   Sporadic fighting has continued with two smaller, more militant
Muslim groups that rejected the peace settlement, continuing to
discourage more investment.
	   After receiving a degree in political science in 1962, Misuari
taught at the University of the Philippines until 1968.
	   In 1964, he helped found the left-wing Kabataang Makabayan, or
Patriotic Youth, a group that became a breeding ground for future
Communist leaders, including a fellow professor, Jose Maria Sison,
who founded the Maoist-oriented Communist Party of the Philippines.
	   Misuari said he conceived of the MNLF when he and about 300
fellow Muslims were protesting the March 1968 massacre of Muslim
recruits for a secret government plan to invade Sabah, the east
Malaysian state being claimed by Manila.
	   Misuari took a leave from teaching and joined his comrades in
the ``Group of 90'' that secretly trained for armed struggle in a
``nearby Asian country'' which the rebels do not want to identify
but which the military believes is Malaysia.
	   In 1970, after returning from his training, he taught political
science at the Philippine Muslim College in Jolo, Sulu.
	   He ran for a seat in the 1971 constitutional convention,
believing that Muslim hopes could be achieved through a new
national constitution.
	   But he lost, in part because of the corruption and power of
entrenched interests, and concluded that change through
parliamentary politics was impossible.
	   Armed hostilities between the government and the MNLF broke out
after the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law in
September 1972.

Policeman charged with corruption alleges torture by authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore policeman charged with corruption
said the authorities tortured him during interrogation, The Straits
Times reported Wednesday.
	   Traffic policeman Alan Wee Soon Heng, 25, said in court on
Tuesday that three officers from the Corrupt Practices
Investigation Bureau coerced him on September 24 last year into
signing a confession.
	   According to the newspaper, Wee alleged that the officers made
him strip to his underwear and stand in front of an air-conditioner
operating at full power. He added that his wrist was handcuffed to
his ankle, and that the men pushed him around.
	   Wee is charged with two counts of corruption. He is alleged to
have extorted and received money from a man whose traffic ticket he
destroyed, the report said.
	   But the policeman objected to the prosecution's attempt to
tender his statement to the authorities in court, arguing that it
was not voluntary.
	   Wee named three senior special investigators at the
anti-corruption watchdog as being responsible for the harassment.
	   Reports of police harassment during interrogations have surfaced
in Singapore before.
	   The authorities have been accused of employing various tactics
to coerce admissions of guilt, including sleep deprivation,
physical violence, and the cold treatment mentioned by Wee.
	   In their latest human rights report on Singapore, the United
States Department of State said there have been credible reports in
past years of police mistreatment of detainees.
	   ``Reliable reports indicate that police have sometimes employed
sleep deprivation or interrogation of detainees in very cold rooms
where the prisoners may be stripped of their clothes and doused
with water,'' stated the U.S. report, which was released on January
30.
	   It added that in 1993, the last year for which statistics were
available, 14 out of the 94 complaints of police abuse that were
investigated were substantiated.

Indian, Pakistani leaders meet as South Asian summit opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Talks between Vajpayee and Sharif are scheduled for 1100 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A regional summit that opened
Wednesday provided the leaders of India and Pakistan with the
opportunity to meet for the first time since the rival neighbors
conducted nuclear tests.
	   Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif
of Pakistan shook hands and sat next to each other Wednesday at the
opening of the seven-nation summit. Later in the day, they were
scheduled to hold private talks aimed at reducing tensions raised
by their underground nuclear tests.
	   The two leaders were meeting for the first time since ordering
underground nuclear tests last May and declaring their countries
nuclear weapon states.
	   India's five nuclear explosions in May were greeted with
national jubilation and pride, matched two weeks later in Pakistan
when Sharif brought Islamabad's nuclear program out of the closet.
Opinion polls showed the tests were hugely popular.
	   It also was their first meeting since Vajpayee's Hindu
nationalist government took office in March, pledging to step up
the fight against what India calls a Pakistan-backed insurgency by
Muslim separatists in the border region of Kashmir. Pakistan denies
active involvement but gives diplomatic and political support to
the militants.
	   ``I am optimistic,'' Vajpayee said on his arrival in Colombo.
``I am confident the dialogue with Pakistan will be continued
further.''
	   The planned talks overshadowed the broader summit topic of
economic cooperation in South Asia, a region that is home to
one-fifth of humanity and 40 percent of the world's poor.
	   Speaking at the inauguration of the 10th summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC, Sri Lanka's
President Chandrika Kumaratunga said regional cooperation and
economic progress depended on mutual confidence among the seven
member countries.
	   ``It cannot be denied that such an ambiance could be affected by
the recent developments in South Asia,'' she said referring to the
nuclear tests.
	   The SAARC groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and the Maldives.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif meeting was arranged for the first day of
the three-day summit to allow the two men time to meet again if
required.
	   The seaside capital of Sri Lanka also was partially shut down by
police on guard against any attack by Tamil separatists, who are
fighting a 15-year-old war for independence in the north of this
Indian Ocean island.
	   The issues at the India-Pakistan talks were expected to go
beyond nuclear issues and include Kashmir, the Himalayan territory
over which India and Pakistan has fought two wars since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Sharif said on his arrival Tuesday the Kashmir dispute was ``the
root cause of all the tension.'' Both leaders have, however,
expressed hope the talks will score progress.
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they were closely watching
the Colombo meeting. A high-level U.S. State Department delegation
came to the area last month to try to persuade India and Pakistan
to halt their nuclear programs and not to deploy nuclear weapons.
	   Since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited Pakistan in 1989, the
various leaders of the two countries have met only in third
countries, usually on the sidelines of international conferences.

Strongman threatens to stay in government, sideline opponents

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen raised the stakes
in Cambodia's post-election turmoil Wednesday, saying that if his
opponents refuse to work with him, the current government he
dominates will stay in power indefinitely.
	   Should his rivals carry out threats to boycott the National
Assembly, denying the two-thirds attendance needed to meet and
confirm a new government, Hun Sen said he will amend the
constitution to lower the minimum to 50 percent plus one, possibly
giving his party sole control.
	   Hun Sen, ending public silence since Sunday's vote, indicated in
an interview on Cambodian television that he wants to divide a
newly formed opposition alliance and suggested one leader, Sam
Rainsy, could join him in a coalition.
	   The threat amounts to brandishing a constitutional coup
following the bloody power grab Hun Sen staged last year, deposing
Prince Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in fighting that
devastated parts of the capital. The new disputes threaten to again
plunge Cambodia into crisis after 30 years of civil war and the
Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have complained of fraud in the
parliamentary elections and demand a recount and new voting in some
areas.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party claims a landslide victory,
but those claims are being undermined by independent counts.
	   ``I wish to call on all political parties to honor the
determination of our people,'' Hun Sen said. ``Winning or losing is
normal as far as democracy is concerned. No one wins all the
time.''
	   Hun Sen said he could keep co-premier Ung Huot, whom he picked
to replace Ranariddh after last year's coup. Ung Huot, a former
member of Ranariddh's party, failed to win a seat Sunday.
	   Hun Sen said he would not allow Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy to block
the National Assembly from meeting to confirm a new government.
	   ``The constitution may have to be amended to 50 percent plus one
to allow the new government to be formed,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen was to travel Wednesday to the northern town of Siem
Reap for talks with King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's father. The
king's acceptance of any power arrangement could be vital for Hun
Sen to win international legitimacy and aid.
	   Earlier, partial election results released by Cambodia's top
independent monitoring group confirmed that Hun Sen's party had a
lead over its rivals, but less than the boasted landslide.
	   The figures from the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia were carefully scrutinized to balance claims by the
Cambodian People's Party that it had won 67 of the 122 National
Assembly seats, compared to just 42 for FUNCINPEC and 13 for Sam
Rainsy.
	   COMFREL said its figures showed that with 56.3 percent of the
vote counted, 40.5 percent had gone for Hun Sen's party, 32.8
percent to the prince's FUNCINPEC and 14.2 percent to the Sam
Rainsy Party. Thirty-six other parties split the rest.
	   Under the complicated formula being used, it remained difficult
to determine how the vote would translate into dividing up seats.
	   But if the COMFREL figures are mirrored in the official count,
the final result could look more like 50-odd seats for the CPP,
rather than 67 the party is claiming _ figures many Cambodians
disbelieve.
	   The lower total could make it harder for Hun Sen to dictate the
shape of a new government, though he still has control of the power
that has always mattered here _ the army.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee, which issuing
official results, was still plagued by delays that spokesman
Samraing Kimsan blamed on communications problems. That could not
explain why 100 percent of the vote was still not counted in Phnom
Penh.
	   Final results could be expected by Sunday, the NEC said.
	   Despite widespread pre-election violence, international
observers have generally endorsed the process as free and fair
enough to reflect the will of the Cambodian people. The verdicts
were issued before the results were known.
	   The United Nations' human rights office released a report saying
it was investigating reports of an additional 12 killings in the
final week of the campaign.
	   Ranariddh's party won U.N.-organized elections backed by 20,000
peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under
the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the Khmer Rouge,
forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening civil war.

Report: Japanese man expelled from Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
said Wednesday that they have expelled a Japanese citizen who was
found taking photos of secret facilities, a news agency reported.
	   The Japanese man, whose name was given as Yoshikama Mumora, had
entered Chechnya without permission and was carrying dlrs 40,000 in
cash, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting security officials
in the southern region. He was evicted from Chechnya over the
weekend, they said.
	   In an appearance late Tuesday on Chechen television, Deputy
Security Minister Khizir Mezhidov accused unspecified ``secret
services'' of sending the Japanese to Chechnya to stage his
abduction, the agency said.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Embassy in Moscow were
checking the report, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Since the end of the 1994-96 war with Russia, Chechen officials
have been unable to contain a tide of crime in which dozens of
Russians and foreigners have been kidnapped by gangs seeking
ransom.
	   Tension has intensified in recent weeks, as Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov began a crackdown on the Wahhabis, the
fundamentalist Islamic sect blamed for many abductions and attacks.
	   Maskhadov on Tuesday lifted a state of emergency he imposed more
than a month ago to rein in Wahhabis and other militant groups. The
authorities also lifted a ban on Russian television broadcasts and
private Chechen channels.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian forces withdrew. But Moscow and the rest
of the world still consider the republic part of Russia.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A hand grenade went off
under a Sarajevo trolley-bus early Wednesday, shortly after another
explosion damaged a church in central Bosnia.
	   According to Sarajevo police spokesman Adnan Kosovac, an
unidentified person dropped hand granade under a trolley-bus full
of morning commuters in the center of the city. Nobody was injured
in the blast and the motive of the explosion wasn't immediately
known. An investigation is underway.
	   Another explosion in a predominantly Muslim town in central
Bosnia damaged local Catholic church, state-run radio reported
Wednesday.
	   The explosion in the church of ``St. Apostles Peter and Pavle,''
occurred around 1 a.m. Wednesday in the town of Kakanj, some 35
kilometers (21 miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
Nobody was injured and police are investigating.
	   There were no immediate indications linking the two incidents.

Floodwaters barrel down China's longest river
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YUEYANG, China (AP) _ A dangerous flood crest swept down China's
largest river Wednesday, passing through an industrial center and
threatening swamped provinces with further floods.
	   The flood crest, the second-largest on the Yangtze since
flooding in 1954 killed 30,000 people, passed safely through
central Wuhan city Wednesday morning, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   But downstream, Jiangxi province braced for further floods,
Xinhua said. The province declared a state of emergency earlier in
the week, along with Anhui and Jiangsu provinces farther down the
river, the world's third-longest.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell heavier and earlier than usual
have killed more than 1,145 people so far this year. The death toll
is expected to rise as reports from flood-hit areas continue to
reach Beijing. Almost a million people have been forced from their
homes in the three worst-hit provinces _ Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi.
	   In Jiujiang city in Jiangxi, about 1 million people and soldiers
were fighting to shore up dikes along the Yangtze, Xinhua said.
	   Upstream in Wuhan, a city of more than 7 million people, water
levels peaked at 28.96 meters (95 1/2 feet), just below the
29.73-meter (98.10-foot) high of 1954, before beginning to recede,
Xinhua said.
	   Further rains are expected in the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze and they could endanger levees that already have been
waterlogged for a month, the China Daily said.
	   Rains that precipitated the Yangtze flood crest, the river's
third this summer, resumed along the river's middle reaches
Tuesday, the newspaper said.
	   ``We must not relax our vigilance since even a small amount of
rain will further exacerbate the already serious flood situation,''
Tang Huifang, deputy director of the Central Meteorological
Station, was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
	   Among the areas hit by rain Wednesday was Yueyang, a city next
to the badly swollen Dongting Lake in Hunan province, which feeds
into the Yangtze's middle reaches.
	   A senior Chinese leader, Wen Jiabao, on Tuesday visited Anxiang,
a county in Hunan where tens of thousands of people were left
homeless when dikes along Dongting Lake collapsed, Xinhua said.
	   The China Daily disclosed that levees had also been breached in
at least three places in neighboring Hubei province as the Yangtze
flood peak passed by. The newspaper did not say whether the
breaches caused any casualties or damage but said they did take
some of the force out of the flood peak.
	   Hunan authorities had been considering blowing up levees around
Dongting Lake to ease pressure on weakened dikes along the Yangtze,
but now did not consider such a move necessary, the newspaper
added.

Indonesian businessman reports high sales of `anti-rape' corset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Following reports of widespread rape
during riots in May, ethnic Chinese women fearful of more violence
have been snapping up ``anti-rape'' corsets.
	   A businessman who makes the corsets said he has sold more than
500 since the deadly riots over price increases in Jakarta, in
which ethnic Chinese homes and shops were targeted.
	   Sales had previously been only a trickle.
	   Women's groups say gangs committed at least 168 rapes. Most of
the victims were members of the Chinese minority, which has been
made a scapegoat for soaring inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Simon Sanjaya, an ethnic Chinese businessman in the Java Island
city of Bandung, said he had failed to win many clients for his
anti-rape corset since he began marketing in 1996.
	   ``But in the aftermath of the May riots, with extensive reports
of rapes, many women, almost all Chinese, contacted my shop,''
Sanjaya said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
	   Advertised in a Jakarta newspaper, the corset is made of
imitation leather and stainless steel and features a numbered lock.
It is inspired by the Victorian chastity belt and costs 100,000
rupiahs (dlrs 7.50).
	   Chinese account for only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202
million people. However, they control much of the economy and are
resented by some indigenous Indonesians.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in the riots in Jakarta in May,
which contributed to the downfall of authoritarian President
Suharto after 32 years in power.

American women crush Chinese swimmers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes, more details; EDITS to
conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ For years, American women swimmers
believed they were getting robbed of gold medals in international
meets, including the Olympics, by Chinese swimmers taking drugs.
	   The veteran U.S. team members try to put the past behind them,
but they haven't forgotten.
	   ``What goes around, comes around, is what my sister taught me,''
said American Cristina Teuscher, one of the stars of the U.S. rout
of China in a dual meet at the Goodwill Games on Tuesday night.
``People get what they deserve. But I don't want to pick fights
with them. I just want to swim good times and help my teammates
swim good times.''
	   Jenny Thompson, also of the United States, and Teuscher each won
two individual events, set a games record and swam on a winning
relay as the United States beat China 88-34.
	   ``I guess they were on a down cycle,'' Thompson said
sarcastically of the Chinese team's checkered drug past.
	   China's swim team has been tainted by drug scandals almost from
the time its women started setting world records in 1994, and the
United States complained bitterly about performance enhancers from
the beginning. Even as recently as last week, four Chinese swimmers
were suspended for two years for testing positive.
	   ``It's hard to know what to expect from the Chinese,'' said
Thompson, a harsh critic of China's team in the past. ``They ebb
and flow from meet to meet.''
	   There was little indication the Chinese were enhancing their
performances Tuesday. In fact, they had other problems.
	   ``We lacked strength because we were not used to the food
here,'' Chinese team member Qian Yan said.
	   American team captain Lea Maurer, the 1998 world champion in the
100-meter backstroke, swam a strong opening leg in the first event,
the 400 medley relay, helping the U.S. team take a 7-0 lead.
	   The only real setback of the night for the American women came
in the 800 freestyle when China's Yan Li and Ping Luo finished
first and second respectively to pull into an 8-8 tie in the team
standings. First through third places are awarded 5, 3 and 1
points.
	   It didn't stay close long, however, as the United States reeled
off six consecutive 1-2 sweeps for a 62-17 lead.
	   Thompson won the 50 and 100 freestyles and was a member of the
winning 400 freestyle relay. Her 100 time of 55.56 seconds was a
games record.
	   Teuscher also won two individual events, the 400 freestyle and
the 200 in a games record, and swam third on the freestyle relay
that also set a games record.
	   Teuscher, also an Olympic gold medalist, was scratched from the
800 freestyle before her winning races in the 200, 400 and relay.
Swimmers are allowed only to appear in three races a night, and
Teuscher said she wasn't sure she could have swum in two other
events after the grueling 800.
	   Maurer won the 100 backstroke and finished second behind fellow
American Shelly Ripple in the 200.
	   In the opening women's dual meet, the World All-Stars defeated
Germany 64-58 as Inge DeBruijn of the Netherlands and Penny Heyns
of South Africa each set two Goodwill records.
	   The U.S. women meet the World team Thursday night in another
dual meet. The men swim Wednesday night, with the United States
facing Germany, and Russia taking on a World All-Star team.
	   Boxing was a U.S. showcase, with three quarterfinal victories
over fighters from Cuba _ including a world champion.
	   American Roberto Benitez, who is ranked No. 2 in the United
States, outpointed flyweight champ Manuel Mantilla of Cuba 12-8.
	   Another U.S. boxer, Teaunce Shepherd, beat Cuba's Rudinelson
Hardy 16-3 in the opening featherweight bout at the Theater at
Madison Square Garden, before American Ricardo Williams Jr. beat
Cuba's Damian Austin 6-2 at light welterweight.
	   ``At the beginning of the fight, I felt like I had to establish
my jab to get some respect from my opponent, and it worked,''
Shepherd said. ``There's an intimidation factor involved with Cuban
boxers, an aura, but I feel like it's coming to an end.''
	   Also posting victories were American flyweight John Medina, who
edged world championship bronze medalist Omar Varvaes of Argentina
9-8; and Jermain Taylor of the United States, who beat light
middleweight Nurzhin Smanov of Kazakstan by the same score.

Thai Cabinet approves bill to outlaw begging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Cabinet of Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai has approved in principle a bill that would ban
street begging, a press release from the government said Wednesday.
	   The bill will now be reviewed to make sure it doesn't violate
any provisions of the constitution.
	   Thai police said Wednesday they had arrested 40 Cambodian
beggars in a sweep of Bangkok neighborhoods Tuesday.
	   Beggars have always been a common sight in Bangkok, but the
practice is on the rise because of Thailand's economic crisis,
which began last July.
	   Some beggars are organized into gangs, with ring leaders
supplying children with puppies to try to garner more sympathy from
passers-by.

Henry off to coach Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Graham Henry was en route to
Britain on Wednesday to start a five-year contract as coach of
Wales after acquiring his release from the New Zealand Rugby
Football Union (NZRFU).
	   ``Thanks for coming, I really appreciate you being here . . .
I'm going to coach Wales, I'm leaving tonight,'' the Auckland Blues
coach said a press conference before flying to Britain.
	   ``It is a marvelous opportunity, I feel very privileged to be
asked do the job, it is a rugby nation that has a great tradition
in rugby.''
	   With four national titles as coach of the Blues and two Super 12
championships from three finals appearances behind him, Henry is
looking forward to taking on the challenge ahead.
	   Asked about his views while watching Wales crash 96-13 to South
Africa last month, he replied: ``I thought they needed a bit of
improvement.''
	   His wife, the Auckland provincial netball coach, will remain in
New Zealand until November, with speculation that she may end up
coaching the Welsh netball team.
	   Henry said he will return from Wales shortly for a proper
farewell with the Auckland team which he has coached from 1992 to
1997.
	   Auckland will announce its new coach on Thursday. (djp)

Heat wave in central Russia kills five
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A combination of hot weather and foul air has been
blamed for the deaths of five people in central Russia, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   Temperatures in Yekaterinburg, some 1,700 kilometers (1,000
miles) east of Moscow, have topped 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees
Fahrenheit), and are expected to remain high through the end of the
week, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The heat has generated a blanket of smog, which has hung over
Yekaterinburg for the last week. A city first aid station says it
is receiving 200 more calls per day than usual, mostly from
residents with cardiovascular problems.
	   City meteorologists said Yekaterinburg has never experienced
such a sustained period of hot, windless weather, ITAR-Tass
reported.

EU urges respect for results of Cambodia election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union on Wednesday urged
all political groups in Cambodia to respect the results of its
election, and said economic aid would resume when the political
situation returns to normal.
	   The EU was a main contributor to the cost of Sunday's election
and to the international group monitoring the polling.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen lost the U.N.-organized election in 1993
but muscled his way into dominance of the new government, sharing
power with the top vote-getter, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The EU and other countries suspended assistance to Cambodia
following Hun Sen's coup against Ranariddh in July 1997. Hun Sen's
party was blamed for violence and intimidation of opposition
supporters in the months before the poll.
	   ``The EU calls upon all political forces in Cambodia to respect
the election results and to seize this opportunity for national
reconciliation,'' said an EU statement issued at the end of annual
talks between Southeast Asian nations and world powers.
	   Hun Sen's coup caused the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
to delay Cambodia's entry into the nine-nation group. Outgoing
ASEAN chairman Domingo Siazon, the Philippine secretary of foreign
affairs, said Wednesday that the group would wait to make a new
decision after the results of the election become clear.

Indonesia says Portugal's reaction to East Timor proposal positive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo ASEAN106 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Portugal has reacted positively to
Indonesia's new proposal to grant limited autonomy to East Timor,
where rebels have been fighting for independence, Indonesia's
foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   An envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan relayed the
proposal to Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master, and then
visited Indonesia a few days ago, said minister Ali Alatas.
	   ``The first reaction was positive, but it did not go into
detail,'' Alatas told reporters.
	   Annan is organizing talks in New York Aug. 4-5 between Alatas
and Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama to begin negotiations on
the autonomy proposal.
	   Under the Indonesian plan, East Timor would be granted autonomy
except in foreign policy, external defense and certain monetary and
fiscal policies. Rebel leaders have demanded a referendum on full
autonomy, but Alatas said that is likely to lead to renewed civil
war.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in the midst of a civil war in 1975
and annexed it the following year. The United Nations regards
Portugal as the administering power of East Timor.
	   On Tuesday, in keeping with a pledge by new Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie, the Indonesian army began a gradual withdrawal of
troops from East Timor.

Mexican government urged to crack down on lawless police officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MO108 &QL; 
 &UR; By ISAAC A. LEVI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a capital where some of the most feared
criminals wear uniforms, an upsurge in rape, kidnapping and robbery
has business leaders calling for drastic measures to rein in
crooked cops.
	   Current and former police officers are accused of complicity
with drug runners and other criminal gangs and are blamed for much
of the city's lawlessness, which also includes a rise in auto theft
and frequent holdups of passenger buses on city streets and of
freight trucks on federal highways.
	   There is ``a growing and uncontrollable phenomenon of
insecurity'' throughout the nation, Jose Antonio Ortega, head of a
security studies commission at the powerful Mexican Employers'
Federation, warned this week.
	   Crooked cops seem to be the norm rather than the exception in
Mexico City, a metropolis of 8.5 million people. Even so, the
kidnappings and rapes of three teen-age girls by capital police
last week has horrified even the most jaded observers.
	   It was ``an indescribable act that harms the government and the
citizenry,'' Mexico City government delegate Graciela Rojas Cruz
told Police Chief Rodolfo Debernardi last week. ``These officers
should be made examples of.''
	   The girls _ ages 13, 15 and 18 _ approached four officers riding
in a patrol car on July 19 and asked for directions. The officers
offered them a lift, but took them to the police stables on the
city's east side.
	   There, they held the girls for four days, repeatedly raping two
of them.
	   The 18-year-old escaped by hiding in a horse stall; the younger
girls were found later, wandering half-naked on a street, almost
incoherent.
	   As of Tuesday, 16 officers had been arrested, and nine of them
were being held for trial. The mounted police detachment involved
was disbanded and the rest of the 80-man group placed under house
arrest pending further investigation.
	   Amid outcry over the crime, the employers federation asked
President Ernesto Zedillo late Monday to speed up implementation of
a national public security plan that has been discussed but never
put into practice.
	   In a statement published widely in newspapers Tuesday, the
federation blamed much of the problem on ``the penetration of
organized crime into public security institutions'' as well as a
lack of coordination among police agencies.
	   Authorities say an average of 700 crimes involving a weapon and
resulting in the deaths of at least six people, are committed every
day in Mexico City. The crimes range from muggings to bank
robberies and murder.
	   The federation underscored the need for local, state and federal
databases on current and former police officers _ something that
has never existed in Mexico.
	   The databases would help ensure that crooked cops who are fired
are not later re-hired by other police agencies, and it would help
track them for criminal activity after returning to civilian life.
	   The federation also called on the federal government to
establish an intelligence-gathering organization to probe
organized-crime rings.
	   In the wake of the kidnap-rapes, Chief Debernardi announced that
new candidates for the 28,000-member police force would undergo
aptitude, proficiency and drug tests, as well as psychological
evaluations.
	   About 70 officers are fired every month from the force after
testing positive for drugs, Debernardi said.
	   Even so, senior officers privately admit the problem is too
ingrained for quick solutions. Fired police officers often wind up
working for other law enforcement agencies or as full-time
criminals.
	   Several months ago, virtually all the top law enforcement
officials in neighboring Morelos state were arrested or
investigated for criminal activity, mostly kidnapping.
	   One kidnapping ring reportedly operating in Morelos under police
protection is known for cutting off a victim's ear to get quick
ransom payments.
	   Many senior federal law-enforcement officials also have been
accused of criminal acts.
	   Mexico's top anti-narcotics officer, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo, last year was arrested and sentenced to 32 years in prison
on drug and related charges after he was found to be in the pay of
the nation's top cocaine smuggler.
	   Law enforcement and human rights officials admit the problem is
exceedingly difficult.
	   Police have little education or training, and get paid very
little: in Mexico City, it is the equivalent of about dlrs 300 a
month.

Malaysian oil giant promises to buy up government bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's biggest oil and gas
company said Wednesday it would be willing to buy up to 20 billion
ringgit (dlrs 4.9 billion) worth of government bonds to aid the
country's struggling economy.
	   The proceeds from the bonds would be used to inject capital into
Malaysia's cash-strapped banks, said Azizan Zainual Abidin,
chairman of the government-controlled Petroliam Nasional Ltd., or
Petronas.
	   ``If the nation wants liquidity, we will assist in providing
liquidity,'' Azizan told reporters.
	   However, he stressed that Petronas would not be using its vast
reserves to bail out individuals.
	   ``Whatever we do, we should ensure that it won't undermine
confidence in this country,'' he said.
	   Petronas monopolizes the nation's oil industry. With about 30
billion ringgit (dlrs 7.3 billion) in reserves, it is considered a
major player in the government's bid to rejuvenate Malaysia's
stalled economy.
	   Independent market observers, such as Moody's Investors Service,
have forecast that the economy will contract as much as 5 percent
this year.
	   Due to falling global oil prices, Azizan added that Petronas
will keep oil production at current levels.
	   ``There have been suggestions that we should produce more,'' he
said, but added that if Petronas produces more petroleum at a time
when the market is weak, the company will get less income.

Thai university closes for 12 days after hazing protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai provincial university has been
closed for 12 days because of a raucous protest by upper classmen
after school officials banned their annual freshman hazing ritual,
local newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Deans at Maejo University in Chiang Mai, 580 kilometers (360
miles) north of Bangkok, prohibited the hazing ritual after some
freshen complained that upper classmen blindfolded them and beat
them, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The ban prompted more than 200 seniors and juniors to
demonstrate on campus. Many threatened local television reporters
when they ignored student demands to stop filming their
demonstration.
	   Police were called to the campus to contain the demonstrators.
	   The university rector negotiated with the upper classmen for
seven hours but, failing to reach an agreement, decided to close
the school, the Post said.
	   The rector said any upper classmen who were found to have beaten
freshmen would be expelled.

Crisis in nearby Kosovo strains deeply troubled Albania

	   TIRANA, Albania, (AP) _ For two hours each night, Albania's
government television brings the Kosovo conflict into Albanian
homes with graphic reports about the struggle between Kosovo
Albanian ``heroes'' and their Serb ``enemy.''
	   Officially, the government of Prime Minister Fatos Nano supports
peaceful dialogue to end the fighting between the Serb-led Yugoslav
government and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for the
Yugoslav province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the
population. The hardline KLA wing also seeks to unite
Albanian-speaking communities throughout the Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' which Yugoslavia and major powers oppose.
	   But the government in Tirana barely controls this impoverished,
factious country of four million people. KLA rebels move freely
from northern sanctuaries into Yugoslavia, carrying weapons and
ammunition to battle the Serbs.
	   Meanwhile, state television appeals for Albanians to ``give
their all for Kosovo's independence.'' On Monday, a televised
concert, ``Kosovo, The Cradle of Freedom,'' featured a performer
dressed in a KLA uniform, singing the ``KLA's anthem.''
	   The audience joined the other onstage performers chanting ``UCK,
UCK,'' the rebels' Albanian language initials.
	   ``There is a big difference between what the government declares
and what it really does,'' said Remzi Lani, an Albanian political
analyst. ``The world has closed one eye to what's happening in
Albania. Albania has closed both of them.''
	   Nano, whose shakey government desperately needs foreign
assistance to rebuild the economy, has tried to steer a course
between the Americans and Europeans _ who oppose Kosovo
independence and a ``Greater Albania'' _ and a vigorous opposition,
led by former President Sali Berisha.
	   But Nano cannot ignore a growing sense among Albanians that they
too have a stake in the battle being waged by their ethnic kinsmen
across the border in Kosovo.
	   Berisha, who was defeated by Nano in last year's elections,
openly supports the KLA, apparently gambling that nationalist
feelings among Albanians will propel him back to power.
	   Such feelings have been aroused by a special Kosovo department
of Albanian state television. Financed by Albanian communities
abroad and with links to a Kosovo government-in-exile, the
department's six-member staff here prepares a daily, two-hour
program about Kosovo.
	   The program includes a half-hour news summary, in which about 15
Kosovo Albanian correspondents provide satellite-telephone reports
of the fighting. KLA rebels are referred to as ``the heroes.''
Serbs are ``the enemy.''
	   KLA fighters, who move across the rugged mountain border between
Kosovo and Albania, ferry videotapes from the front.
	   The rest of the two-hour program is devoted to dramas,
documentaries and concerts promoting ``Albanianism.'' A recent
documentary _ ``An Unseparated People'' _ featured the Albanian
version of the centuries-long struggle between Albanians and Serbs
in the southern Balkans.
	   ``The Kosovo Liberation Army is a hope, a historic chance which
probably will never come again,'' the commentator said.
	   Bajram Asllani, chief of Albanian television's Kosovo
department, makes no secret of his views. ``This is a historic
chance for Albanians,'' Asllani said in an interview.
	   ``And if our leaders in Tirana and (Kosovo's capital) Pristina
fail to take it, shame on them for the rest of the history,'' he
added.
	   A senior adviser to the prime minister said the broadcasts do
not reflect official policy _ even though the station is
government-run. But the adviser, Vladimir Prela, said any attempt
to shut down the Kosovo department or tone down coverage would
backfire among the population.
	   Foreign Minister Paskal Milo admitted for the first time Monday
that the government ``has often been obliged to give explanations
to foreign governments and international organizations for certain
television reports.''
	   ``Only a few days ago, we had to answer for such irresponsible
reports,'' Milo said.
	   He was referring to a television report quoting a KLA statement
urging Kosovo Albanians to abandon pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova,
whom the Americans and Europeans are promoting to head an Albanian
delegation in future peace talks with the Yugoslavs.

Manning, Colts agree to contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANDERSON, Indiana (AP) _ Peyton Manning says his rookie-record
dlrs 48 million contract won't mean anything if he doesn't play
well.
	   ``People ask me what I plan to do with my money. I plan to earn
it,'' the Indianapolis Colts quarterback said Tuesday night after
agreeing to a six-year deal that includes an dlrs 11.6 million
signing bonus.
	   ``Whatever it is I sign for, it won't make any difference to me
unless I'm a productive quarterback in the NFL.''
	   Ken Kremer, an associate of Manning's agent, Tom Condon, at
International Management Group, provided the contract figures after
team spokesman Craig Kelley said no details were available on the
agreement reached between Condon and club president Bill Polian.
	   ``There is also an dlrs 8.4 signing bonus after three years
structured on incentives, which will easily be reached,'' Kremer
said.
	   Manning and his father, former National Football League
quarterback Archie Manning, arrived in Indianapolis late Tuesday
night from New Orleans. After signing the contract, the former
Tennessee star was to join the Colts Wednesday at Anderson
University.
	   The 6-foot-5 (1.96-meter), 230-pound (104-kilo) quarterback,
selected first overall in the April draft, was already designated
the starting quarterback for the regular-season opener against
Miami on Sept. 6.
	   The agreement came two days after quarterback Ryan Leaf, the
second overall pick, agreed to a five-year, dlrs 31.25 million deal
with San Diego that includes an dlrs 11.25 million signing bonus.
	   Manning joins a team with little experience at quarterback. The
other three quarterbacks in camp have have combined for two NFL
starts and played just 16 games. Kelly Holcomb, the team's No. 3
quarterback last season, was filling in as the starter in camp.
	   Coach Jim Mora plans to give Manning a heavy workload to prepare
him for what he'll be facing when the exhibition season begins Aug.
8 at Seattle. It was uncertain how much Manning would play when the
team scrimmages with the St. Louis Rams in Champaign, Illinois, on
Saturday. The Colts also will practice with the Rams in Champaign
on Thursday Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Mora said he spoke with linebacker Quentin Coryatt
for the first time since the player disappeared after practice
Sunday morning.
	   ``He went down to see one of our doctors and I have not heard
the results,'' said Mora, adding that Coryatt was complaining of an
injury to his left shoulder.
	   Still, Mora said the injury was no reason to leave camp and that
Coryatt was being fined for the time he missed.
	   ``I'm going to keep that between me and Quentin,'' Mora said
when asked if the injury was why he had disappeared. ``A lot of
people get hurt, and they don't leave camp.''

 &UR; Indians 4, Mariners 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Seattle, Manny Ramirez hit a three-run homer off Randy
Johnson in the sixth in what may have been the left-hander's final
start for Seattle as Cleveland won for the fifth time in six games
against the Mariners.
	   Johnson (9-10), rumored to be moved before Friday night's trade
deadline, pitched his sixth complete game of the season. He gave up
four runs and four hits, struck out 12 and matched a season-high
with six walks.
	   Johnson didn't give up a hit until Travis Fryman opened the
fifth with a double off the right-field wall.
	   Jay Buhner's two-run single in the seventh off Charles Nagy
(9-6) made it 3-2. Nagy went six-plus innings, giving up two runs
and six hits.
	   The Indians took a 4-2 lead in the eighth on David Bell's ninth
homer.
	   The Mariners closed to 4-3 on Edgar Martinez's RBI single in the
bottom of the inning, but Mike Jackson struck out the side in the
ninth for his 26th save.
 &UR; Yankees 9, Angels 3
	   In Anaheim, California, David Cone became the first 15-game
winner in the majors, and Derek Jeter, Darryl Strawberry and Bernie
Williams homered for New York.
	   Cone (15-3) won for the sixth time in seven starts. He allowed
three runs, one earned, and six hits in seven innings, struck out
six and walked two.
	   The victory improved the Yankees' major league-leading record to
74-26, one behind the start of the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates, who
began 75-25.
	   The Angels, who swept a season-opening two-game series from the
Yankees, still lead the AL West by a full game over Texas.
	   Tim Salmon hit his 17th homer for Anaheim.
	   Jason Dickson (9-8) was charged with eight runs, six earned, and
11 hits in 5 1-3 innings.
	   Garret Anderson extended his hitting streak to a major
league-best 25 games with a leadoff single to center in the ninth,
tying the Angels club record set by Rod Carew in 1982.
 &UR; Red Sox 8, Athletics 4
	   In Oakland, California, Darren Lewis hit a three-run
inside-the-park homer that was initially ruled a four-base error,
and Troy O'Leary added a two-run shot as Boston won its third
straight.
	   It was the second straight game the Red Sox had an
inside-the-park homer. Nomar Garciaparra had one Sunday against
Seattle, a three-run shot at Fenway Park.
	   Mo Vaughn, who said last weekend he expects to leave the Red Sox
as a free agent after this season, went 3-for-5 with a triple and
two singles while being booed by many fans.
	   The loss was the season-high eighth straight for Oakland, its
longest since dropping the final nine games of the 1995 season.
	   Tim Wakefield (12-5) allowed three runs on five hits in 5 2-3
innings, struck out eight and walked six.
	   Tom Gordon got the final three outs for his 29th save.
	   Jimmy Haynes (7-4) allowed six runs on nine hits in five innings
for Oakland.

Man found half-frozen in airliner landing gear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man half-frozen but alive was found Wednesday
clinging to the landing gear of a Northwest Airlines jumbo jet that
arrived in Tokyo from Shanghai.
	   The man, who was conscious but unable to move, described himself
as a 23-year-old Chinese citizen, said a police spokesman at the
New Tokyo International Airport. He was taken to a hospital in
critical condition.
	   Ground attendants found the man clinging to the left rear
landing gear after the Boeing 747 had pulled up to the terminal,
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The man had been frozen so severely during the three-hour flight
that police called to the scene had to pry him loose.
	   The spokesman expressed surprise that the man had survived the
flight in a non-pressurized part of the plane at altitudes of more
than 10,000 meters (33,000 feet).
	   Police still want to question the man, who faces deportation.
	   Japanese officials are battling an influx of illegal immigrants
from China sneaking into the country in search of work.

Albright urges Philippines to allow new joint military exercises
</HEADLINE>

Albright-Philippines. Albright remarks in Papua New Guinea expected
roughly 0815 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright urged a resumption of joint military exercises with the
Philippines Wednesday, five years after the United States was
forced to close its last base here. She said it would help ``keep
this region stable and at peace.''
	   Albright's remarks, to an American business group, came as she
wrapped up a three-day visit for an annual diplomatic conference
that focused on Asia's financial crisis.
	   Later Wednesday, she was traveling to Papua New Guinea for a
short visit, then to Australia and New Zealand for more talks.
	   In Port Moresby, she was expected to announce modest U.S.
assistance to help Papua New Guinea recover from devastation caused
earlier this month when three giant waves, caused by an earthquake
offshore, leveled villages and killed more than 2,000 people.
	   Speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in Manila, Albright
said she was hopeful the Philippine Senate would ratify an
agreement permitting U.S. military forces to return to the nation
on a limited basis, and to engage in joint military exercises.
	   The proposed visiting forces agreement has prompted
anti-American demonstrations for the duration of Albright's visit.
	   In 1992, the Philippine Senate rejected a renewal of the lease
on the last U.S. base, which was forced to close the following
year, ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in the
Philippines.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. and Philippine officials signed the
visiting forces agreement that would allow a resumption of joint
military exercises and provide certain legal protections to U.S.
soldiers while in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the agreement, which requires ratification by the
Philippine Senate, could shield American soldiers from prosecution
because of various loopholes.
	   ``Our visiting forces agreement establishes a basis for keeping
our alliance strong and for working together to keep this region
stable and at peace,'' Albright said Wednesday.
	   ``It must be ratified by the Philippine Senate, and I hope that
can happen soon.''
	   On Tuesday, Albright defended the agreement at a news
conference, saying, ``It is my understanding the government
supports this agreement and it is one that is viewed as mutually
beneficial to both countries.''
	   She said any concern about nuclear weapons was misplaced.
	   ``I think we have made statements all along that our surface
ships do not carry nuclear weapons,'' she said.
	   In her remarks to the Chamber of Commerce, Albright reiterated
her promise that the United States would help the region
financially to weather ``the worst days of the crisis.''
	   But, she added, ``We also have to recognize that this crisis is
not going to be resolved by aid alone.''

Islands hope to shift economy from fish exports to Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic &QL; 
 &UR; By TED BRIDIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Two tiny islands off the African coast are
hoping to boost their local economies, which rely mostly on the
export of frozen tuna, by selling one-of-a-kind Internet addresses.
	   Ascension Island and St. Helena, which together are just over
twice the size of the District of Columbia, are selling World Wide
Web addresses using the unique two-letter suffixes assigned to the
islands, ``ac'' and ``sh.''
	   Their offers mean a company that failed to seize popular generic
Web site names, such as ``diapers.com'' or ``computer.com,'' can
rush to buy ``diapers.ac'' or ``computer.sh.'' Each address costs
roughly dlrs 60 to dlrs 100.
	   These aren't high-tech outposts in the South Atlantic: Reference
books show their combined population is just over 7,000 people, and
there are no television sets, a single AM radio station on St.
Helena and only about 500 telephones. Chief exports include frozen
skipjack and tuna, along with handmade crafts.
	   ``They're selling their national asset and inviting any member
of the Internet community to register,'' said Paul Kane, the
general manager for the company that was hired by those governments
to sell the addresses.
	   St. Helena began selling addresses using its ``sh'' domain last
week, and nearby Ascension Island, also a British territory, will
begin offering its ``ac'' suffix on Monday.
	   Of more than 200 countries with unique Internet suffixes, most
reserve them for government agencies and institutions, such as
``us.'' Only a relative handful sell addresses to entrepreneurs:
The same company providing ``sh'' and ``ac'' also registers sites
for the British Indian Ocean Territory, whose suffix is ``io.''
	   Last summer, the island kingdom of Tonga in the South Pacific
began offering its ``to'' suffix. And until recently, the former
Soviet republic of Turkmenistan was selling ``tm'' addresses; a
note on its Web site now warns that business was suspended because
some addresses ``may be legally obscene in Turkmenistan.''
	   The fledgling industry is fueled by frustration. The popular
``com'' suffix, administered by Network Solutions Inc., a U.S.
government contractor located near Washington, is so popular that
hundreds of thousands of site names already are taken. As Tonga's
Web site explains: ``All the good (com) names are gone.''
	   The novelty may end after the U.S. government largely ends its
management of the Internet later this year, when new generic
suffixes _ such as ``info'' or ``shop'' _ are widely expected to be
added.
	   That new abundance of address combinations could reduce interest
in Web sites using off-the-wall country suffixes.
	   Meanwhile, the practice fuels the frustration of big-name
trademark holders, including some of America's biggest
corporations, which are worried that unscrupulous Internet users
might try to register ``nike.tm'' or ``mcdonalds.io.''
	   In many cases, companies slow to register their own trademarks
as Internet addresses have been forced to buy the site names from
people known as ``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates.''
	   Turkmenistan's ``tm'' suffix was particularly popular because it
suggested ``trademark.''
	   ``These are national domains, and in effect these countries can
say it's our national resource,'' said Mark Hellmann, a Chicago
trademark lawyer who specializes in the Internet. ``Can you enforce
(trademark claims) on their (computer) servers? Where is the
jurisdiction? Who has a right to impose their laws on this
particular country?''
	   Half a world away, on the island of St. Helena, the Web address
``ibm.sh'' was still available as of Tuesday _ as were ``nike.sh''
and ``mcdonalds.ac'' and countless others.

Thai steel industry has shut down half its operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's steel manufacturers have
shut down about half of their operations and laid off more than
5,000 workers because of a drastic drop in domestic demand,
industry sources said.
	   Domestic consumption has plunged by more than 50 percent because
of the collapsed property market and slumping building and
construction sectors, said Visuth Chirayudh of the Steel Industry
Club, quoted Wednesday in the newspaper The Nation.
	   Thailand's steel industry exports very few of its products, he
said, and with the price of steel falling on world markets, Thai
producers would not be able to compete.
	   He said several companies had shut down plants and the surviving
plants had cut output by about half.

Muslim rebels kill two hunters in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILIGAN, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim rebels have killed two men and
wounded four others who strayed into an insurgent-controlled area
while chasing wild game in the southern Philippines, a survivor
said Wednesday.
	   Arnel Libre, who suffered gunshot wounds in the arms and legs,
said Muslim rebels shot them while they were chasing a wounded wild
boar Tuesday in Maguing in Lanao del Sur province.
	   Libre said they were not armed with guns and could not have been
mistaken for soldiers. He said they used table tennis balls packed
with explosives to maim the animal.
	   ``We knew the area was a Muslim rebel stronghold but we were
about to catch a big wild boar we had wounded earlier and we were
not about to let it escape,'' Libre said.
	   He said the rebels fired at them when they caught the boar and
were preparing to bring it down the mountain.
	   Libre said his father and a neighbor died from wounds in the
head and body.
	   The others where wounded when they tried to carry away the two
dead men and the wild boar. Two of the wounded were in critical
condition.
	   Wild boar meat is a delicacy in the Philippines and is more than
double the price of pork or beef.

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Demonstrators picketed the U.S.
consulate in Russia's Far East on Wednesday to protest
Russian-American military exercises scheduled for next week.
	   Chanting ``Yankee Go Home'' and waving communist flags, over 50
protesters in the Pacific port city of Vladivostok complained that
the exercises simulate an invasion of Russia and demanded they be
canceled or moved elsewhere.
	   ``This is a targeted action to plan for landings in Russia and
the suppression of the people who will undoubtedly revolt,'' said
Reserve Captain Alexander Dudinsky of the Union of Soviet Officers.
``Expect an uprising this fall.''
	   The six days of naval maneuvers starting Aug. 4 will practice
sea rescues and civilian evacuation procedures, officials said.
Among other exercises, U.S. Marines will conduct mock landings on
the city's outskirts.
	   In a letter to the U.S. Consul General, representatives of
various nationalist and communist groups said U.S. forces would
gather classified information about Vladivostok's naval base. They
called the maneuvers an ``encroachment on the safety and
sovereignty of Russia.''
	   ``We perfectly understand what peacemaking is. It will be like
Iraq or Yugoslavia,'' said retired sailor Vasily Sovchenko.
	   A U.S. diplomat, Edward Booth, spoke with the protesters and
promised to consider their claims and provide an answer by Aug. 2.
	   A spokesman for the Russia's Pacific Fleet said fleet commanders
were aware of the protests, but had no plans to cancel the
exercises.
	   Joint exercises between Russia's Pacific Fleet and the U.S.
Seventh Fleet have taken place off Russian and American coasts
since 1994.
	   Meanwhile, Russia and Japan began their first joint naval
exercises Wednesday, conducting mock search and rescue operations
390 kilometers (240 miles) from Vladivostok in the Sea of Japan.

Serbs reportedly capture major rebel stronghold in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following Serb gains on the
battlefield, a delegation of European diplomats arrived in Kosovo
on Wednesday to meet ethnic Albanian leaders as part of the
international effort to end the fighting.
	   Diplomats from Austria, Britain and Germany -- representing the
European Union -- were to meet with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,
favored by the West to represent the Albanians in negotiations with
the Yugoslav government.
	   The move came as the United States said its effort to forge a
broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team to begin talks with
the Serb-led Yugoslav government was beginning to bear fruit.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo's dominant
Albanian population.
	   ``We hope we'll be able to put this together very soon,'' Rubin
said.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which grew dramatically after the
government launched a crackdown on Albanian militants in February,
has refused to accept Rugova as the leader of the Albanian
community because he rejects violence.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   But Serb gains on the battlefield during an offensive launched
Friday night may have changed the political dynamics. Police and
army troops have managed to regain control of key areas of the
province which had been under rebel control.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from is major central Kosovo
stronghold Malisevo. In southwestern Kosovo, troops have surrounded
another KLA bastion, Junik, trapping about 1,000 fighters,
according to the Serbs.
	   No reliable casualty figures are available.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the last ten days has increased
the total number of civilians to flee their homes, to at least
100,000 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Last week, the International Committee of the Red Cross said
that many of the 40,000 civilians who fled fighting in another
town, Orahovac, had taken shelter in Malisevo. The UNHCR estimated
that half of the Orahovac refugees had fled to Malisevo.

Swissair in talks with Qantas over partnership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair is negotiating a possible
link-up with Australian carrier Qantas, a spokesman for the Swiss
national airline said Wednesday.
	   However, the talks have been postponed for the time being
because the two firms are unable to agree on conditions for the
alliance, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review.
	   Swissair spokesman Mirjam van Zweden confirmed the negotiations
had begun but wouldn't give further details.
	   According to the newspaper report, the two airlines are
negotiating a code-sharing deal covering six weekly flights between
the two countries.
	   The talks represent the latest move by Swissair towards
developing a wide network of alliances with other airlines across
the globe. Earlier this month and in late June, the firm announced
partnerships with Japan Airlines and Hong Kong based carrier Cathay
Pacific.
	   It already has alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four South African men convicted
in the stoning and fatal stabbing of U.S. student Amy Biehl are
free, having won amnesties from the commission probing abuses
committed during the country's apartheid era.
	   South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared that
the crime was political and that the four men had told the full
truth _ the two criteria needed for amnesties.
	   The brutal killing of the 26-year-old student at the hands of a
mob five years ago drew international attention to South Africa's
racial violence.
	   Friends and relatives went to three separate prisons in the Cape
Town area to greet Vusumzi Ntamo, Ntobeko Peni, Mzikhona Nofemela
and Mongezi Manqina when they were freed Tuesday.
	   The four were 18 to 22 years old when they stoned and stabbed
Biehl, who was white, to death in the Guguletu black township
outside Cape Town. They were among a crowd of blacks who attacked
her car and then chased her down the street.
	   Walking out of Brandvlei prison, in Worcester, 135 kilometers
(85 miles) northeast of Cape Town, Manqina said he was happy to be
released. His mother and other relatives hugged and kissed him.
	   ``We can't believe that he is out,'' said his mother, Evelyn
Manqina. ``As a mother I am very happy, but on the other side I am
not happy. I feel the pain of Mrs. Biehl. I am not glad because of
what my child has done.''
	   Biehl, a Fulbright scholar, was in South Africa to help with
voter registration for the nation's first all-race election in 1994
that ended apartheid.
	   Her parents, Peter and Linda Biehl had attended the amnesty
hearing and publicly forgave their daughter's killers after they
apologized for the slaying.
	   In a statement from their home in La Quinta, California, the
Biehls said they supported the amnesty decision.
	   ``We've never been angry, we've never been that way or bitter,
just empty ... and certainly I felt empty, very empty again this
morning.'' Peter Biehl told Associated Press Television.
	   Linda Biehl also said she hoped those released had learned
something.
	   ``We hope that a bit of Amy's spirit and all of those that have
died in the struggle will be with them and that they live better
lives than they have in the past,'' she said in an interview with
APTV.
	   The four killers, convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison
for the murder, testified at their amnesty hearing that they
believed their political leaders wanted them to attack whites _
also called ``settlers'' by black militants _ to highlight the
grievances of blacks.
	   They cited the ``one settler, one bullet'' slogan of the Pan
Africanist Congress, a radical black group.

Mudslides kills four in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Landslides triggered by heavy rains
have killed four people in this former Soviet republic in Central
Asia, officials said Wednesday.
	   The downpour, which hit the northern Leninabad region a week
ago, caused mudslides that killed an 18-year-old woman, her 1-year
old baby and two other children in the village of Karamazor, said
Bakhram Mamadaliyev, a spokesman for the Tajik Emergencies
Ministry.
	   The landslide also washed away a local dam, swept over 20 houses
and destroyed five kilometers (three miles) of power lines, he
said.
	   Meanwhile, melting glaciers in the Pamir Mountains in eastern
Tajikistan swelled the River Vakhsh and other local rivers and
officials sent emergency workers to strengthen dams to prevent
possible floods.
	   Last April, landslides caused by torrential rains killed more
than 100 people in the impoverished nation, which is recovering
from a five-year civil war.

Myanmar rejects request for U.S., Japan diplomats to meet Suu Kyi

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The military government of Myanmar
has refused to allow U.S. and Japanese diplomats to see opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose health was reportedly deteriorating
as she spent a sixth day at a police roadblock Wednesday.
	   ``At this juncture the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Myanmar's foreign minister, Ohn Gyaw, told a news conference at the
end of a week of meetings with other Southeast Asian nations and
world powers.
	   In a highly unusual step, seven foreign ministers met with Ohn
Gyaw on Tuesday to press concerns about human rights and ask that
the Japanese ambassador and the U.S. charges d'affaires in Myanmar
be allowed to visit Suu Kyi. She was stopped last Friday as she
traveled by car to meet with members of her party, the National
League for Democracy.
	   ``Our proposal was quite a moderate one. This response is not
satisfactory, that is clear,'' the European Union representative,
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria, said after Ohn
Gyaw's remarks.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, sitting next to
Ohn Gyaw and looking at him as he spoke, said he was very
disappointed. He said another attempt would be made Wednesday to
get permission for Western diplomats to see Suu Kyi, who he said
was ill.
	   ``I'm not very hopeful that we will be able to meet with her,''
Downer said. ``Her doctor said her blood pressure is falling, and
she's not so well.''
	   Foreign ministers from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Japan,
South Korea, the European Union and the United States had asked Ohn
Gyaw on Tuesday to relay a request to his government that the
impasse be resolved and the diplomats be allowed access to Suu Kyi
on the highway outside the capital.
	   ``We have our ways to deal with the impasse,'' Ohn Gyaw told the
news conference, as the other ministers sat next to him. ``As far
as I know, her health is in good condition. Also, we have arranged
for some food and facilities to be available.'' He said an
ambulance was also standing by, but Suu Kyi's supporters have said
she would not use it.
	   The government in Myanmar has accused Suu Kyi of staging a
publicity stunt to draw attention during the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations meetings in Manila. Ohn Gyaw told the news
conference that Suu Kyi had left the capital without saying where
she was going.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who left Manila
Wednesday morning after attending the meetings, said the United
States would hold the Myanmar military responsible for the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright said earlier.
	   Schuessel said the pressure on Myanmar during Tuesday's meeting
and Wednesday's news conference was unprecedented.
	   ``I think they have never seen that before _ such strong
pressure from the world,'' he said. ``We're able and willing to do
our utmost to solve the crisis.''
	   Suu Kyi's party said two doctors examined her Tuesday and found
she was showing signs of dehydration.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Protesters urged the government
Wednesday to investigate officials accused of involvement in the
bloody takeover of a minority party headquarters two years ago.
	   About 100 supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri
rallied outside the Home Affairs Ministry, saying supporters of
former President Suharto involved in the takeover should be
punished.
	   Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid was the military chief of
staff for social and political affairs at the time of the 1996
clash at the Jakarta office of the Indonesian Democratic Party, or
PDI.
	   Prior to the confrontation, Megawati, the eldest daughter of
Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, had gained wide popularity
after criticizing the autocratic policies of Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, PDI rivals backed by security forces
staged a predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots in which at least five people
were killed and dozens were reported missing.
	   At the protest Wednesday, protesters chanted and waved banners,
including one that read: ``Suharto's men behind the riots.''
	   They urged the government of new President B.J. Habibie to
investigate Syarwan as well as his predecessor, Yogie Memed, and
former Armed Forces Commander Feisal Tanjung.
	   All three men have denied involvement in the takeover of the PDI
headquarters.
	   However, newspapers reported Wednesday that Soerjadi, a
pro-government rival who replaced Megawati as PDI head, admitted
that security forces were involved in the 1996 takeover of the
party headquarters.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto two months ago
after Indonesia was rocked by student protests and riots amid by
the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

United Nations, Taliban at stalemate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations and Afghanistan's
religious regime were at a stalemate Wednesday, with the Afghans
apparently unwilling to open negotiations for the return of scores
of aid workers expelled from their capital.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel said officials in Pakistan, where
aid to neighboring Afghanistan is coordinated, continued to await
an official response to a request for talks made two days ago. The
United Nations had hoped for an immediate answer.
	   ``The U.N. maintains simply lifesaving programs in Kabul for the
foreseeable future,'' she said.
	   Qazi Habibullah, a high-ranking diplomat at the Afghan embassy
in Pakistan, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his country
saw no reason to discuss the matter with the United Nations, as its
dispute was with independent aid agencies.
	   Some 200 aid workers for 38 agencies were thrown out of Kabul
after refusing to move from homes and offices scattered throughout
the Afghan capital to dilapidated dormitories on the campus of
Kabul Polytechnic, which was heavily damaged in the war.
	   Most of the expelled workers came to neighboring Pakistan.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban government insists that if the agencies
want to work in Kabul, they must obey the relocation order, saying
rent from the agencies will allow it to rebuild the campus. Aid
workers say the dormitories are unsafe and uninhabitable, and the
order to move may have been a pretext to get them out of Kabul
after months of tension.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes. International aid groups say
they are committed to providing education and other services to
all, while Taliban officials accuse the groups of flouting the
country's laws and traditions.
	   The expelled workers had carried out or supplemented U.N.
humanitarian programs in a city of 1.2 million decimated by years
of civil war. Without the help of Save the Children, Care, Doctors
Without Borders and other agencies, the United Nations has
suspended projects such as rebuilding schools and hospitals and
confined itself to providing food, health care and safe water.
	   The Red Cross, which like the United Nations was not affected by
the relocation order, also runs a feeding program in the Afghan
capital.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albright in Papua New Guinea, new throughout &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright conferred Wednesday with Papua New Guinea
officials on relief efforts in the aftermath of the giant waves
that obliterated villages and claimed more than 1,600 lives.
	   She announced dlrs 650,000 in new U.S. aid, bringing the total
to just over dlrs 1 million. That is enough to provide temporary
shelter and help relocate up to 3,000 people, she said.
	   Albright also got a bird's-eye glimpse of the 20-mile
(30-kilometer) stretch of coastline hit hardest by the July 17
tsunami. The beaches appeared empty on sunny afternoon sky. ``We
could only imagine the horror of what took place,'' Albright said.
	   She met with Bill Skate, the prime minister, in a two-hour
stopover at the airport here.
	   Asked by local reporters why she did not plan a more extensive
look at the affected area, Albright said: ``I wanted to make clear
my own personal concern for what has happened. But I did not want
to put any burden on the rescue effort. I didn't want to create
another tidal wave.''
	   The United States has already spent about dlrs 400,000 on
relief, including three planeloads of food, medicines, tents, and
other supplies, and a special disaster team that included dogs
capable of detecting bodies under water.
	   Albright said the additional aid includes technical assistance
to enhance the region's ability to track and predict
earthquake-generated waves like the ones that struck earlier this
month.
	   Skate welcomed her and said he hoped President Bill Clinton
would visit the island next year when he attends an Asian economic
summit in New Zealand.
	   Albright praised Skate for helping frame a compromise to help
bring peace to the island of Bougainville, where years of conflicts
with separatists have claimed thousands of lives. She pledged dlrs
450,000 in U.S. money to support United Nations peace efforts
there.
	   Skate said that the giant waves had claimed more than 1,600
lives. Officials have said the death toll could rise to as high as
3,000.
	   Albright's jet plane took a course that flew directly over the
damaged part of the coast in the northwest part of this nation,
which occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, the
second largest in the world.
	   Even though the plane flew right over Sissano Lagoon, where the
most deaths occurred, not much was visible from 25,000 feet (7,500
meters). Albright aides said the plane was asked not to fly lower
because it might interfere with airborne rescue operations still
under way.
	   She was greeted at the airport by dancers in native garb,
arriving here after three days in the Philippines for an Asian
regional diplomatic conference.
	   Albright was the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit this
nation since then-U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young in 1979, and the
first secretary of state ever to visit.
	   Cecila Sangul, a government disaster-relief official, told
reporters, ``We need the basics like cooking utensils, bedding,
medicine ... building supplies.''
	   Government officials said that many of the residents who fled to
higher land are reluctant to come back because they are fearful
another tidal wave will strike.
	   Earlier, Albright in a speech in Manila, voiced strong support
for a resumption of joint military exercises with the Philippines,
six years after the United States was forced to close its last base
here. She said it would help ``keep this region stable and at
peace.''
	   Speaking to the Manila's American Chamber of Commerce, Albright
said she was hopeful the Philippine Senate this fall would ratify
an agreement permitting U.S. military forces to return to the
nation on a limited basis, and to engage in joint military
exercises.
	   The proposed Visiting Forces Agreement has prompted
anti-American demonstrations for the duration of Albright's visit.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen was to visit the Philippines
next week in a further effort to drum up support for the agreement.
	   In 1992, the Philippine Senate rejected a renewal of the lease
on the last U.S. base, which was forced to close the following
year, ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in the
Philippines.
	   Earlier this year, U.S. and Philippine officials signed the
visiting forces agreement that would allow a resumption of joint
military exercises and provide certain legal protections to U.S.
soldiers while in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the agreement, which requires ratification by the
Philippine Senate, could shield American soldiers from prosecution
because of various loopholes.

Frustrated finalist for Berlin Holocaust Memorial withdraws entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ One of four finalists for Germany's
national Holocaust Memorial has withdrawn his entry, saying the
repeated delays and unending debate have made him doubt the project
will ever be built.
	   Germany's inaction shows ``a lack of will to tackle unpopular
problems that nevertheless must be solved,'' German artist Jochen
Gerz was quoted as saying Wednesday in Cologne Stadtanzeiger
newspaper.
	   After more than 10 years of debate, officials hope to begin
construction of the national memorial in the heart of Berlin next
year, with federal, city and private funds. But a design, which was
to be announced in March, has yet to be chosen.
	   The Berlin city council is to debate the matter Aug. 18.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised a decision before parliamentary
elections on Sept. 27.
	   The opposition Social Democrats have recently called the entire
project into question again. The man chosen to be the party's
culture czar if they unseat Kohl has said he would rather see a
documentation center about Nazi genocide or more money spent on
preserving former concentration camps.
	   In an interview from Canada, where the Paris-based artist has a
summer house, Gerz told the newspaper the new debate showed there
was no political will to actually build the memorial.
	   What's even more disturbing, he said, ``is that the big part of
the public stands behind that, silent as always, but still very
present.''
	   Gerz's design envisioned 39 poles on which the word ``why''
would be written in the languages of the Nazis' victims.
	   The favorite, though, is believed to be one by New York-based
architect Peter Eisenmann and American sculptor Richard Serra,
which proposed a labyrinthian field of 4,000 concrete pillars
resembling a cemetery.
	   Eisenmann scaled-down the model alone this summer at Kohl's
request. Serra withdrew from the project in June, citing personal
and professional reasons.

Tokyo stocks mixed, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices closed mixed in light trading
Wednesday on the eve of the selection of Japan's new prime
minister. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained
43.55 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 16,158.09. On Tuesday,
the average had climbed 170.18 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   Trading remained light, with an estimated 347 million shares
changing hands on the first section, compared with Tuesday's 345
million. Advances outnumbered declines 534 to 515, with 188 issues
unchanged.
	   But the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on
the first section was down 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, to
1,240.70. It had gained 8.24 points, or 0.67 percent, the previous
day.
	   Share prices opened slightly lower following an overnight
93.46-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average in New
York, but then gained in midmorning on buying by public pension
funds.
	   Price movements in the afternoon were mixed as many investors
awaited the election of Japan's new prime minister by Parliament on
Thursday, traders said.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is expected to win the prime
minister's post, has been courting former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to serve as finance minister in his Cabinet.
	   Japanese newspapers said Wednesday that Miyazawa, 78, a ruling
party elder and economic policy expert, was likely to accept.
	   Obuchi has pledged to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister to accelerate efforts to stimulate Japan's moribund
economy and implement economic reforms.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 141.09 yen, down 0.85 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also slightly below its late New
York rate of 141.35 yen overnight. It ranged between 140.75 yen and
141.50 yen in Wednesday's trading.
	   ``The Miyazawa news is largely factored in, so I don't think
we'll get much movement when an announcement is made,'' said Minoru
Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.275 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.310 percent, driving its price up to 111.27 yen from 111.03 yen.

Commission recommends April 18 for Turkish elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Parliament's justice commission on
Wednesday decided on April 18 as the date for general elections,
nearly a year ahead of schedule.
	   Deputies are scheduled to vote and approve the proposed date
Thursday.
	   The governing coalition leaders meeting last week had agreed on
April 25 for elections. But the commission deemed the date too
close to a public holiday, with voters likely to want to leave on
vacation that weekend.
	   General elections are ordinarily not due until 2000.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's exports of buses, cars and trucks in June
fell 9.9 percent from a year earlier to 375,608 vehicles, the
second consecutive month of decline, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association said Wednesday.
	   Japanese vehicle exports to the United States _ a key component
of the country's trade surplus with that nation _ fell 13.4 percent
to 103,894, the association said.
	   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, saw its overall
exports fall 10.2 percent to 125,834 vehicles. Exports from
second-ranked Nissan Motor Co. dipped 1.7 percent to 61,810.
	   Honda Motor Co. exports declined 5.3 percent to 43,500 vehicles
and Mazda Motor Corp. exports shrank 31.2 percent to 35,671.
	   Total passenger car exports last month for all car makers
dropped 10.3 percent to 298,200, while truck exports fell 8.7
percent to 72,928, the association said. Bus exports slipped 4.7
percent to 4,480, it said.
	   After rising each month over a two-year period, vehicle exports
slipped 3.9 percent in May.
	   For the first six months of this year, total vehicle exports
from Japan rose 3.9 percent to 2.3 million.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's biggest oil and gas
company said Wednesday it would be willing to buy up to 20 billion
ringgit (dlrs 4.9 billion) worth of government bonds to aid the
country's struggling economy.
	   The proceeds from the bonds would be used to inject capital into
Malaysia's cash-strapped banks, said Azizan Zainual Abidin,
chairman of the government-controlled Petroliam Nasional Ltd., or
Petronas.
	   ``If the nation wants liquidity, we will assist in providing
liquidity,'' Azizan told reporters.
	   However, he stressed that Petronas would not be using its vast
reserves to bail out individuals.
	   ``Whatever we do, we should ensure that it won't undermine
confidence in this country,'' he said.
	   Petronas monopolizes the nation's oil industry. With about 30
billion ringgit (dlrs 7.3 billion) in reserves, it is considered a
major player in the government's bid to rejuvenate Malaysia's
stalled economy.
	   Independent market observers, such as Moody's Investors Service,
have forecast that the economy will contract as much as 5 percent
this year.
	   Due to falling global oil prices, Azizan added that Petronas
will keep oil production at current levels.
	   ``There have been suggestions that we should produce more,'' he
said, but added that if Petronas produces more petroleum at a time
when the market is weak, the company will get less income.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The president of cash-strapped
Philippine Airlines has resigned in the middle of a labor dispute
that threatens to shut down the company, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Jose Antonio Garcia's resignation was accepted by the airline's
board of directors in a meeting Monday, said the senior airline
official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
	   He said there was no immediate need for the company to replace
Garcia since it will soon be placed under receivership.
	   Garcia will take a job with San Miguel Corp., the Philippines'
largest food and beverage conglomerate, the official said. He once
headed San Miguel's flagship beer division and was a member of its
board.
	   He will leave PAL at a time when the airline is embroiled in a
dispute with its three unions. Its pilots' union staged a crippling
22-day strike last month, and its ground crew union walked out last
week but returned to work Sunday after the company agreed to
suspend for one month the retrenchment of 1,800 of its members.
	   The flight attendants' union is also seeking the reinstatement
of about 1,400 of its members who were included among 5,000
employees laid off by the company in a drastic downsizing program.
	   The layoffs were part of a rehabilitation program by PAL, which
has warned it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion of
debt.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will begin receiving gas from
Myanmar Thursday as the Yadana pipeline project becomes
operational, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand said.
	   The dlrs 1.2 billion project, owned by Total of France, Unocal
of the United States, PTT and Myanmar's military government,
carries gas from the coastal waters of Myanmar to a power plant in
Ratchaburi, Thailand.
	   The project has been dogged by criticism and lawsuits by
democracy and environmental activists.
	   They charge that Myanmar's military regime has used forced labor
to build infrastructure necessary for the pipeline and that its
profits will shore up a government that is strapped for cash and
spends most of its budget on weapons to repress its own people.
	   The pipeline was attacked at least once by ethnic guerrillas
fighting Myanmar's military government.
	   Environmental activists contend that the project has destroyed
rain forests and the habitat of wild animals including elephants,
Thailand's national symbol.
	   The companies involved deny the charges.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's steel manufacturers have
shut down about half of their operations and laid off more than
5,000 workers because of a drastic drop in domestic demand,
industry sources said.
	   Domestic consumption has plunged by more than 50 percent because
of the collapsed property market and slumping building and
construction sectors, said Visuth Chirayudh of the Steel Industry
Club, quoted Wednesday in the newspaper The Nation.
	   Thailand's steel industry exports very few of its products, he
said, and with the price of steel falling on world markets, Thai
producers would not be able to compete.
	   He said several companies had shut down plants and the surviving
plants had cut output by about half.

Storage tank leaks ammonia in Dagestan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Over 70 kilograms (150 pounds) of ammonia leaked
into the atmosphere from a smokehouse on the Caspian Sea, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   The leak occurred in Makhachkala, the capital of Russia's
Dagestan region, 1,600 kilometers (990 miles) south of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Because winds were blowing away from the city at the time of the
leak, no one was harmed by the ammonia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The report did not specify how much damage the leak did to the
environment, including how much it polluted the Caspian.
	   By Wednesday morning emergency officials stopped the leak.
Investigators said no foul play was suspected.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Aung San Suu Kyi's doctors said the
Nobel laureate was showing signs of dehydration as she entered a
sixth day Wednesday under siege on a rural highway, with Myanmar's
military refusing to let her travel outside Yangon.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians examined her Tuesday in her
white sedan, 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital.
	   They asked the military to allow them to monitor Suu Kyi's
condition twice a day and that she be provided with facilities to
wash herself, said a statement from Suu Kyi's political party, the
National League for Democracy, received in Bangkok on Wednesday.
	   It was not known whether the military honored the request,
although it has provided her with drinking water. Members of her
party have said her food is running out and they are concerned
about her health.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, a colleague and two
drivers Friday morning as they drove to Bassein, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) west of the capital, to meet members of her political
party.
	   The government said she is trying to foment unrest.
	   ``It is the hope of the government that (Suu Kyi) will realize
the folly of her uncompromising and belligerent stand,'' a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``More importantly, foreign governments and news agencies should
also desist in fanning the fire by refraining from backing the NLD
up all the way and all the time and seeing things the NLD
leadership sees,'' it said.
	   On Wednesday, the government refused a request by seven Western
nations that U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to
see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional group.
	   Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, has tried to travel
outside the capital three times this month and has been stopped
each time.
	   The military has allowed her only one trip to the provinces
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the city of Pa-an, 160
kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and members of her party.
	   Democracy activists say military harassment of her followers has
been stepped up in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   Suu Kyi's party said Saturday that the military had placed
barbed-wire barricades, sand bags and soldiers around the car to
prevent it from proceeding.
	   The government escorted local journalists to the scene on
Sunday. By then, Suu Kyi's car had been moved to a narrow wooden
bridge over a small stream in a marshy area off the highway.
	   The bridge appeared wide enough only for one vehicle, and about
a dozen government security personnel stood nearby with a military
ambulance.
	   No barricades, sand bags or uniformed soldiers were seen at that
time. Suu Kyi's party said she would not accept medical treatment
from the military but only from her personal physicians.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week that the
United States will hold Myanmar's military government directly
responsible for Suu Kyi's health and welfare.
	   United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
issued a statement Tuesday saying there are legitimate concerns for
Suu Kyi's health and safety.
	   And at the Southeast Asian meeting in Manila this week, foreign
ministers from Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and the European Union pressured Myanmar to end human rights abuses
and let Suu Kyi proceed.

In gauge of Netanyahu backing, a symbolic parliamentary vote

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of growing disenchantment with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's parliament on Wednesday
prepared to vote on a largely symbolic measure to dissolve itself.
	   Final approval of such a measure would effectively topple the
government and force early elections. But the vote expected later
Wednesday was only a preliminary one.
	   Wednesday was the last working day before parliament's summer
recess, and the steps needed for full enactment _ committee
approval and three subsequent parliamentary votes _ were impossible
to complete in a single day.
	   Even so, the vote was seen as a bellwether of sentiment on
whether early elections should be held and on Netanyahu's handling
of negotiations with the Palestinians. The peace talks broke down
16 months ago and fitful efforts to revive them have so far not
succeeded.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from both inside and outside
Israel to accept an American-authored initiative calling for an
Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The prime minister's coalition partners all have different views
on the proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   For final approval of the dissolution measure, a majority of the
120-seat parliament would have to vote in favor of it. In
Wednesday's preliminary vote, only a majority of lawmakers present
needed to approve it for passage.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners were boycotting the vote. The
prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in parliament,
survived three opposition no-confidence motions on Monday.
	   On the eve of the vote, he expressed unconcern. Shai Bazak, the
prime minister's spokesman, told Army radio that Wednesday's vote
was ``not meaningful.''

Museveni names two to unspecified ministerial posts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni has named two
people, including his only brother, to unspecified cabinet-level
posts, Radio Uganda reported Wednesday.
	   Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, whose latest job had been described as
``overseer'' in the Defense Ministry, and Betty Okwir, a former
parliamentary speaker, were named ministers, the state radio said.
	   The appointments raise the number of cabinet members to 19.
	   In what appeared to be a minor shake-up, Amama Mbabazi, a former
minister of state for political affairs, was transferred to the
Ministry of Regional Cooperation. Ruhakana Rugunda, a junior
minister for regional cooperation, will take charge of political
affairs, the radio said.
	   Museveni also named 14 junior ministers, but their jobs were
also unspecified.
	   There are 43 junior ministerial posts, but some were vacant. The
new junior ministers are expected to fill the vacancies pending
parliamentary approval.
	   In Uganda, junior and state ministers also attend cabinet
meetings.

Strongman threatens to stay in government, sideline opponents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen raised the stakes
in Cambodia's post-election turmoil Wednesday, saying that if his
opponents refuse to work with him, the current government he
dominates will stay in power indefinitely.
	   Should his rivals carry out threats to boycott the National
Assembly, denying the two-thirds attendance needed to meet and
confirm a new government, Hun Sen said he will amend the
constitution to lower the minimum to 50 percent plus one, possibly
giving his party sole control.
	   Ending public silence since Sunday's vote, Hun Sen indicated in
an interview on Cambodian television that he wants to divide a
newly formed opposition alliance and suggested either leader, Sam
Rainsy or Prince Norodom Ranariddh, could join him in a coalition.
	   But the opposition showed no sign of backing down. Sam Rainsy
climbed a tree outside a hotel and spoke through a bullhorn to some
1,500 cheering supporters who had waited outside for the result of
a meeting by a dozen opposition parties charging electoral fraud.
	   ``Although we have diverging views among us, we have to struggle
together to get justice for Cambodia,'' Sam Rainsy cried.
	   The crowd, standing on cars and motorcycles to get a better
view, responded with shouts of ``Sam Rainsy! Sam Rainsy!'' and
``Chai-yo!'' or ``Bravo!'' Police watched from a distance.
	   Hun Sen's threat amounts to brandishing a constitutional coup
following his bloody power grab a year ago to depose Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in fighting that devastated parts of the capital.
	   The new disputes threaten to again plunge Cambodia into crisis
after 30 years of civil war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of the
1970s.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have complained of fraud in the
parliamentary elections and demand a recount and new voting in some
areas.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party claims a landslide victory,
but those claims are being undermined by independent counts.
	   ``I wish to call on all political parties to honor the
determination of our people,'' Hun Sen said. ``Winning or losing is
normal as far as democracy is concerned. No one wins all the
time.''
	   Hun Sen said he could keep co-premier Ung Huot, whom he picked
to replace Ranariddh after last year's coup, and simply stay at the
helm of the current government the election was supposed to
replace.
	   Hun Sen said that he would not allow the opposition to block the
National Assembly from meeting to confirm a new government.
	   ``The constitution may have to be amended to 50 percent plus one
to allow the new government to be formed,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen was to hold talks Wednesday with King Norodom Sihanouk,
the prince's father. The king's acceptance of any power arrangement
could be vital for Hun Sen to win international legitimacy and aid.
	   Sam Rainsy dismissed Hun Sen's threats: ``Hun Sen is not
consistent. To amend the constitution, he needs a two-thirds
majority. If he can do that, he does not need us.''
	   Earlier, partial election results released by Cambodia's top
independent monitoring group confirmed that Hun Sen's party had a
lead over its rivals, but less than the boasted landslide needed to
dictate the formation of a new government.
	   The figures from the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia indicate that the Cambodian People's Party could end up
with 50-odd seats, rather than the 67 it has claimed. The ruling
party says that FUNCINPEC won 42 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party
just 13.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee said final
results could be expected Sunday.
	   Despite widespread pre-election violence, international
observers have generally endorsed the election as free and fair
enough to reflect the will of the Cambodian people. The verdicts
were issued before the results were known.
	   The United Nations' human rights office released a report saying
it was investigating reports of an additional 12 killings in the
final week of campaigning.
	   Ranariddh's party won U.N.-organized elections backed by 20,000
peacekeepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under
the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the Khmer Rouge,
forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening civil war.

No official election results before Sunday, committee says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodians may have to wait until
Sunday for official results from their parliamentary elections, a
week after the vote was held, election officials said Wednesday.
	   The National Election Committee said that poor communications
and uneven training were delaying results from the provinces, but
that did not seem to explain why, three days after the vote, full
results were not yet available from Phnom Penh.
	   ``There is no secret,'' spokesman Samraing Kimsain told a news
conference. ``We had limited time to train our staff. Some could do
it in just one day, and some won't finish it in one week.''
	   Opposition leaders are demanding a recount and new voting in
some areas, claiming massive fraud by strongman Hun Sen, who has
packed the NEC and provincial election agencies with his
supporters.
	   Cambodians disbelieved figures advanced by the ruling Cambodian
People's Party that it had won in a landslide, taking 67 of the 122
seats in the National Assembly, ahead of 42 for Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and 13 for the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, the
nation's top independent monitoring group, issued its own partial
tallies based on communal election committee reports, the same
source used by the NEC.
	   COMFREL said its figures showed that with 56.3 percent of the
vote counted, 40.5 percent had gone for Hun Sen's party, 32.8
percent to the prince's FUNCINPEC and 14.2 percent to the Sam
Rainsy Party.
	   It was unclear how the popular vote would translate into
National Assembly seats, which are divided up under a complicated
formula.
	   But if the COMFREL figures are mirrored in the official count,
the final result could look more like 50-odd seats for the CPP, a
plurality rather than an outright majority enabling it to dictate
the shape of a new government.
	   The assembly does not convene until Sept. 24 and some kind of
accommodation is likely by then. The current unity between
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who dislike each other, may not last.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Kamov helicopter company unveiled a new
military transport helicopter Wednesday that has been under
development since the 1980s.
	   The Ka-60 is a twin-engined general purpose military transport
helicopter capable of carrying 14 troops and over 2 tons of cargo.
Its development has been stalled by the military's desperate cash
shortage.
	   Designers haven't set a date for the chopper's maiden flight,
but said it would happen soon.
	   The Kamov company also hopes to sell its Ka-50 Black Shark
helicopter gunships to Turkey, but faces competition from several
U.S. and European companies, Kamov's chief designer Sergei Mikheyev
said at a news conference, according to the Interfax news agency.

Victims of 1988 air show disaster at U.S. base seek compensation

<TEXT>
	   RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) _ Ten years after an air show disaster at
the Ramstein Air Base killed 70 people, survivors for the first
time are seeking to win compensation for their emotional suffering.
	   The accident occurred on Aug. 28, 1988, when three jets from an
Italian stunt-flying team collided over the base where the U.S. Air
Force European headquarters is located. One jet engulfed in flames
plowed into the crowd, killing 70 and injuring about 450 people.
	   A victims fund financed by Germany, Italy and the United States
has paid out about 32 million marks (about dlrs 18 million at
today's exchange rate) to more than 1,500 claimants.
	   But Elmar Giemulla, an air law expert in Berlin, said most of
that money has gone to pay medical costs.
	   ``In such a case the victim ends up with really nothing,'' said
Giemulla, who is representing 100 Ramstein victims.
	   In addition, people who lost loved ones, but were uninjured
themselves, end up with nothing, he said. Unlike U.S. law, German
law makes no provision for compensation for emotional suffering.
	   ``I believe that there should also be compensation for the
feelings that play out inside,'' Giemulla said.
	   Psychologist Sybille Jatzko, who have been counseling victims
since the accident, says her patient list has grown from 40 to
about 150.
	   While physical wounds have healed, many victims still have
psychological trauma and complain of feelings of fear, cold sweats
and insomnia, she said.
	   Giemulla asked the German Defense Ministry in June to appoint a
judge to rule on whether the accident occurred in the line of duty
_ as has been presumed _ or outside the military service.
	   If outside, the way could be cleared for victims to apply for
so-called ``ex gratia'' or ``as a favor'' compensation, which could
also include money for emotional suffering.
	   But Defense Ministry lawyers say even by ex-gratia compensation,
German law would still apply because the accident happened on
German soil.
	   The federal government now has to decide whether to appoint a
special judge.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Four South African men convicted
in the stoning and fatal stabbing of U.S. student Amy Biehl are
free, having won amnesties from the commission probing abuses
committed during the country's apartheid era.
	   South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared that
the crime was political and that the four men had told the full
truth _ the two criteria needed for amnesties.
	   The brutal killing of the 26-year-old student at the hands of a
mob five years ago drew international attention to South Africa's
racial violence.
	   Biehl's parents supported the decision, but the amnesty angered
one of her friends and a fellow activist.
	   ``Giving amnesty to an undisciplined and violent mob has serious
repercussions for the rule of law,'' Rhoda Kadalie told the
Business Day newspaper. She called the killing a ``barbaric,
racially motivated murder of the most primal sort.''

Hong Kong stocks fall for third day on problems in China and Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Stocks in Hong Kong fell for a third straight
day Wednesday because of new fears over China's economic growth and
old concerns about Japan's government.
	   Traders said they expected more losses in the near term.
	   The benchmark Hang Seng index fell 117.27 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 7,808.83. It had slipped 58.33 points Tuesday.
	   Turnover was 3.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 502 million),
down from Tuesday's 4.31 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 556
million).
	   China-related shares were among the hardest hit. Floods along
the Yangtze River have raised fears that China may not be able to
reach its growth targets for the year. The floods have killed at
least 1,145 people so far this year and forced almost a million
people from their homes.
	   Traders cited concerns that some Chinese infrastructure
companies may be short of cash, and that the cost of repairing
flood damage might slow growth, making it harder for China to meet
its goal of 8 percent.
	   Investors also remain worried about the ability of incoming
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to piece together a government
that will be able to tackle the woes of an economy that much of
Asia depends on for growth and investment.
	   Traders said they expected a volatile market Thursday because of
the expiration of July futures contracts.
	   Investors continued to sell before a string of earnings reports
coming in the next week, said Alvin Ow-Yang at OCBC Securities.
``People are still quite bearish'' and expect to see sharp
declines, he said.
	   Among the biggest blue-chip losers Wednesday was Cheung Kong
Infrastructures, which fell 6 percent to 12.10 Hong Kong dollars.
New World Infrastructures fell more than 16 percent to 6.45 Hong
Kong dollars.

Critics of Arab security pact fear it will target dissidents

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments have extradited dozens of
people under a new pan-Arab pact against terrorism, raising fears
that it is being used to target political dissidents, activists
said Wednesday.
	   At the end of a two-day meeting in Tunisia on Tuesday, security
officials from 22 Arab nations put their seal of approval on a
strategy to implement the pact which was signed in April.
	   The strategy includes efforts to chase extremists working
``under the pretext of slogans of human rights and democracy,''
Ahmed Al-Salem, the Saudi diplomat who chaired the meeting, said.
	   The pact requires Arab countries to deny support to groups that
launch attacks on other nations in the region and to exchange
information on terrorist groups.
	   It also obliges signatories to extradite Arab extremists based
in their territory.
	   But because the agreement leaves vague the definition of
extremists, critics say, a government could easily kick out
political refugees based in its territory to appease another
government.
	   The critics say the agreement provides no legal or judicial
guarantees that it will not be used against civilian opponents of
other governments.
	   Faiz Jibril, a Libyan opposition leader who has been living as a
political refugee in Egypt for years, noted that most Arab
governments have not signed international agreements guaranteeing
protection to dissidents like himself living under political asylum
in other countries.
	   ``The problem is that there are no deep rooted traditions in the
Arab world on how to deal with and respect the rights of asylum
seekers, and many believe that the new agreement may be at the
expense of opposition leaders,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   In the last three months, several host countries have extradited
foreign activists, acting on simple requests by their governments,
said Abdel Hussein Shaban, a human rights activist.
	   No public judicial procedures were followed in the process, he
said.
	   ``Every thing was done under a blanket of darkness and we are
not sure if they (those extradited) received due justice,'' Shaban,
head of the London-based Arab Human Rights Organization, said in a
telephone interview.
	   Among the first to act on the pact was Saudi Arabia, which
handed over dozens of Muslim fundamentalist activists to Egypt and
Libya.
	   Last month Syria extradited at least 16 Algerian Islamic
activists to Algeria some of whom had lived in Syria since 1992.
	   Jordan also is believed to have extradited some Egyptian Islamic
activists to Egypt who were accused of financing a six-year-old
violent campaign against the Egyptian government that has so far
claimed more than 1,100 lives.
	   Iraq is reported to be seeking more than 80 dissidents, some of
them former ambassadors who received political asylum in Saudi
Arabia.
	   But the pact has failed to work when faced with larger rivalries
between governments: Egypt has yet to act on a request by Sudan to
extradite leaders of Sudanese opposition groups in Cairo.
	   Egypt has had sour relations with Sudan since an assassination
attempt in 1995 on President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt blamed the
Sudanese government for the harboring the assailants said to be
members of the Egyptian radical groups.

Pakistan proposes resumption of talks with India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Pakistani offer to resume formal
talks, more quotes and background; EDITS to conform and tighten;
meeting between Sharif and Vajpayee scheduled for 1100 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister offered to
resume formal talks with India on Wednesday, the same day he was to
meet with his Indian counterpart for their first face-to-face talks
since they sparked fears of a regional arms race by ordering
nuclear tests.
	   ``The inescapable reality that confronts us today is that South
Asia is now nuclearized,'' Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said at the opening of a seven-nation regional summit. ``It is for
us to steer away from the gathering storm.''
	   Sharif's offer appeared to be a promising start for his much
anticipated private talks scheduled later Wednesday with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The session was intended to
ease the tensions raised when each country set off a series of
underground nuclear explosions in May.
	   It also was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office in March,
pledging to step up the fight against what India calls a
Pakistan-backed insurgency by Muslim separatists in the Himalayan
border region of Kashmir. Pakistan denies active involvement but
gives diplomatic and political support to the militants.
	   Sharif suggested Wednesday that top foreign ministry officials
resume discussions that broke down in June 1997 about Kashmir, over
which India and Pakistan have fought two wars since they gained
indpendence from Britain in 1947.
	   ``Pakistan is ready for the immediate resumption of bilateral
foreign secretary level talks with India,'' Sharif said.
	   India's response was not immediately known, but Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said he also favors a dialogue.
	   ``We should seek what unites us and not duel on our divisions,''
Vajpayee said, speaking before Sharif at the opening of the South
Asia Association for Regional Cooperation summit.
	   Although the nuclear issue was not on the summit agenda,
Vajpayee addressed it in his speech, reasserting India's commitment
to a nuclear free world. India has said it will not give up its own
right to develop nuclear weapons unless all other countries do.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif talks on the sidelines also overshadowed the
broader summit topic of economic cooperation in South Asia, a
region that is home to one-fifth of humanity and 40 percent of its
poorest people.
	   The seaside capital of Sri Lanka also was partially shut down by
the police on guard against any attack by Tamil separatists, who
are fighting a 15-year-old war for independence in the north of
this Indian Ocean island.
	   The SAARC groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and the Maldives.
	   Other leaders also voiced concern over the rising threat from
India and Pakistan.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests in our region is a development that,
we all wish, could have been avoided,'' Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina of Bangladesh said. Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala spoke of ``the fear of an arms race in the region.''
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they were closely watching
the Colombo meeting. A high-level State Department delegation came
to the area last month to try to persuade India and Pakistan to
halt their nuclear programs and not to deploy nuclear weapons.

European Union's Kinnock: Look at Cambodian poll in context
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The European Union's special envoy
monitoring Cambodia's parliamentary elections urged the
international community Wednesday to consider the country's need
for peace when evaluating the legitimacy of the polls.
	   ``As we deliberate on the election process, we should therefore
not lose sight of the clear imperatives the country now faces,''
said Glenys Kinnock, referring to ``grotesque statistics'' showing
Cambodia's social and health development.
	   While acknowledging that pre-election violence still needed
investigating, Kinnock said the dlrs 11.4 million assistance given
by the EU _ the largest foreign donor _ to stage the election was
``vindicated by the response.''
	   Some 90 percent of the 5.4 million registered voters are
estimated to have cast ballots Sunday.
	   The European Union provided a large number of the 678
international observers. Their role was considered essential by
opposition politicians, who feared strongman Hun Sen would try to
steal the election.
	   In the poll's aftermath, there has been a rough consensus among
the observer groups that the polling was fair enough to adequately
represent the views of the Cambodian people.
	   Though the final tally has not been announced, the opposition
parties have charged fraud and said they will not accept the
results. Because of slowness in releasing official tallies,
suspicion has focused on the counting process.
	   ``Anything that has the potential for creating political
instability is worrisome at this time,'' said Kinnock, urging an
investigation into irregularities and voicing confidence in the
National Election Committee to do it.
	   The opposition believes the committee does the bidding of
strongman Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party, since most of
its members were picked by his government. None of the opposition
complaints of violence or intimidation before the election was
investigated.

Croatia launches criminal investigation against Nada Sakic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The district court here has launched a
criminal investigation against Nada Sakic, the wife of the
commander of Croatia's most notorious World War II concentration
camp, state-run news agency HINA reported Wednesday.
	   The court suspects Mrs. Sakic, who was arrested last week in
Argentina, of war crimes against civilians, and the investigation
may led to an indictment and trial.
	   Mrs. Sakic, also known as Esperanza, is believed to have run a
womens' block at the Stara Gradiska camp, a part of the Jasenovac
concentration camp complex, when she was only 16. Her future
husband, Dinko Sakic, commanded the Jasenovac complex.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and insurgent Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   Mrs. Sakic, 76, was arrested last Friday in Argentina, where she
and her husband fled after the war. She was arrested at the request
of Yugoslav officials, who have charged her with genocide.
	   She is currently in Argentine custody.
	   Dinko Sakic was extradited from Argentina in June and is being
held in Zagreb prison pending completion of a pre-trial
investigation.
	   On Tuesday, Croatian Ministry of Justice asked Argentina to
extradite Mrs. Sakic too.
	   Croatia apparently moved to seek Mrs. Sakic's extradition to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The
majority of Jasenovac victims were Serbs.
	   In court papers, Croatian authorities said Mrs. Sakic was
suspected of ``violating the principles of international laws by
carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians''
between 1942 and 1945, HINA said.

Indonesia allows two foreign newspapers to publish locally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Herald Tribune and
The Asian Wall Street Journal will be allowed to publish in
Indonesia, the government said Wednesday.
	   The move is part of a relaxation of curbs on the press following
the resignation of former President Suharto in May after 32 years
of authoritarian rule.
	   Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said the two newspapers have
a circulation in Indonesia of about 3,000 copies each. Until now,
copies published in Singapore or Hong Kong have been flown to
Indonesia, he said.
	   By allowing publication in Indonesia, the government will
prevent long delays in distribution.
	   Under Suharto, the Indonesian government often clamped down on
the media. It banned local magazines and sometimes barred the
circulation of foreign publications with articles considered too
critical of Indonesian government policy.
	   New President B.J. Habibie is promoting democratic reforms,
including freedom of the press. However, some editors have
criticized his proposal that journalists be required to obtain
licenses to work.

India offers nuclear technology to Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ India, strongly criticized for its
recent nuclear weapons tests, has offered to provide the
Philippines with non-military nuclear technology, Philippine
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said Wednesday.
	   Siazon said he welcomed the offer made by Indian deputy planning
commission chief Jaswant Singh in a meeting Tuesday on the
sidelines of a security forum in Manila attended by the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and major Western and Asian powers.
	   But Philippine officials have to determine if there is a need
for such assistance, consisting of training programs and
technology, and how this would fit into ongoing bilateral programs,
Siazon said.
	   The Philippines and other members of ASEAN strongly deplored
nuclear tests staged by India in May, saying they heightened
tension in a region already beset by a financial crisis.
	   As for the seeming irony of India's offer, Siazon said, ``That's
OK, as long as it is for peaceful purposes.''
	   The Philippines has a very limited nuclear capability. A nuclear
power plant was constructed during the time of the late strongman
Ferdinand Marcos in Bataan province, west of Manila, but was
mothballed due to safety concerns and accusations that its foreign
builder bribed Marcos to win the contract.
	   The Philippines established diplomatic ties with India in 1952.
Two-way trade amounted to dlrs 262 million last year.

EU team expresses regret over escalating violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A three-member European Union team
met Wednesday with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and afterward
expressed regret over new fighting in Kosovo province.
	   Following the meeting, the Austrian representative on the team,
Albert Rochan, said the members had ``expressed our deep concern at
the escalation of violence, especially in the area of Malisevo and
Junik.''
	   Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army have suffered
losses in those two places over the last three dauys.
	   ``Our message is very clear, the violence has to stop,
immediately,'' Rochan said. ``We can not tolerate the increasing
amount of victims, the destruction, the refugee situation...''
	   ``Immediately, the dialogue must start on negotiating a solution
of this province and we've also expressed our views and it is very
important the whole strata of political leadership in Kosovo is
united under one platform,'' Rochan added.
	   The EU delegation was also to meet U.S. special envoy
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and later,
possibly Adem Demaci, an important Kosovo Albanian leader who
remains at odds with Rugova.

Capriati loses to Morariu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Despite hitting a bump in her
comeback trail, Jennifer Capriati is still looking forward to a
successful return.
	   Corina Morariu, who grew up watching Capriati when she was an
elite player, handed Capriati a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 loss Tuesday in the
first round of the Bank of the West women's tournament.
	   ``This could have been a good step forward if I pulled it out,''
Capriati said. ``It does show me I can still play.''
	   In another late match, Mary Joe Fernandez beat Chanda Rubin,
6-4, 6-4.
	   San Diego's Alexandra Stevenson upset the No. 8 seed Rita Grande
of Italy, 6-1, 7-5.
	   In other matches, Amy Frazier of the United States defeated
American Janet Lee 3-6, 6-2, 6-3; Kimberly Po of the United States
beat Australia's Nicole Pratt, 7-5, 6-0; Ukraine's Elena Tatarkova
topped America's Sandra Caci 7-6 (7-1), 2-6, 7-5 and France's
Anne-Gaelle Sidot defeated Japan's Miho Saeki, 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3.
	   Capriati was foiled by seven foot faults during her match, two
in the final game when Morariu broke her serve.
	   ``In practice, when people watch me, they say I do it,''
Capriati said of the foot faults. ``It's something I need to work
on, and be more conscious of it.''
	   The 20-year-old Morariu _ two years younger than Capriati _
thought the former gold medalist still had something left.
	   ``She cranked a few forehands,'' said Morariu, ranked No. 36 in
the world. ``She's not playing as well as she was, but she still
played good tennis.''
	   Capriati is ranked No. 117, and hopes she can continue
progressing.
	   ``I feel stronger, more confident,'' she said. ``I think I'm
pretty close. It will take more matches and me getting into better
shape.''
	   Fernandez won her first match of the year, and was playing in
her first tournament since April.
	   ``It feels great to be playing again,'' said Fernandez. ``It's
been a long year.''
	   Rubin saw some improvement in Fernandez's game.
	   ``She was hitting the ball pretty well,'' said Rubin. ``She was
a little slow from a lack of matches, but overall it was a good
match.''
	   Stevenson was offered, but turned down, a wild card spot in the
tournament. She will play either top seed Lindsay Davenport or Po
in the second round.
	   ``It was better at this point because I haven't played a lot of
matches,'' said Stevenson, who turns 18 in December. ``It was the
first time I qualified into a WTA event and it feels great.''
	   Stevenson opened up with a strong first set.
	   ``My plan was to come out hitting because I knew she got in
later than most of the girls,'' said Stevenson, a senior at La
Jolla Country Day School. ``I don't know if she's heard of me
before.''

Government clashes with legislators over political reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government and political parties are
heading for a showdown over whether to scrap two local councils in
a dispute that pits calls for democracy against demands for better
government.
	   Politicians are accusing the government of trying to curb
democracy by scrapping the two councils _ one for urban Hong Kong
and one for the rural New Territories _ that supervise food safety,
the environment, the arts and entertainment.
	   Hong Kong has been hit by a series of scares over the quality of
its food supply in the past year, including the so-called ``bird
flu,'' red tides that wiped out fish farms and other problems.
Pollution also is a growing concern.
	   The government says the councils' record has been poor, and
wants to set up a new department to handle food safety and the
environment.
	   A period of public consultation on the issue ended this week,
and a final government decision isn't expected until October.
However, government officials repeatedly have indicated they would
prefer to scrap the local councils altogether.
	   Michael Suen, the secretary for constitutional affairs, was to
make a preliminary report to the legislature Wednesday.
	   In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Suen said the
government was ``determined to take back powers over food safety
and environmental hygiene.''
	   ``We hold a strong view that the present structure is too
cumbersome. ... Hong Kong is such a small place. It's doubtful
whether we need a three-tier system,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The Post reported that the Democratic Party and Democratic
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong _ two of Hong Kong's
largest parties _ are opposed to scrapping the councils and prefer
merging them.
	   The two parties make up a third of the 60-member legislature,
but may be able to block the government's proposal with the support
of allies.
	   The two councils were the only policymaking bodies in Hong Kong
that were chosen by fully democratic means before the return to
Chinese rule last year. Beijing allowed all the counselors,
including critics, to stay after the handover, but added a group of
pro-Beijing counselors to ensure overall control.
	   Local councils are seen as a political training ground for
legislators, and several of them also are council members.
	   Voter turnouts ordinarily have been low for local council
elections.
	   A survey by Hong Kong University's Social Science Research
Center indicated that 45 percent of respondents supported setting
up a government department to oversee food safety, and 25 percent
were against it.
	   Sixty-one percent of respondents said they prefer merging the
two councils, compared with 16 percent against it.
	   The survey had a margin of error of 2 percent.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ France's Guillaume Raoux beat Wimbledon
finalist Goran Ivanisevic 6-4, 6-4 on Tuesday in the first round of
the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
	   Ivanisevic, playing in his first tournament since losing to Pete
Sampras in a grueling five-set final at Wimbledon, had 13 double
faults to go along with 13 aces. His biggest serve was clocked at
138 mph (222 kph).
	   ``Goran didn't play like he did at Wimbledon, for sure,'' Raoux
said. ``He missed a lot, he gave me a lot of points. He didn't play
like someone who practices very much. At the end, I was waiting a
little bit more for him to miss. After you break him, the toughest
part of the job is made.''
	   Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi, coming off a victory Sunday in the
Legg Mason Classic at Washington, beat Bob Bryan 6-4, 6-3 in a
night match.
	   ``It was a good experience,'' said Bryan, who turned pro two
months ago. ``He congratulated me after the match and he said that
I have a future.''
	   Top-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia defeated Ramon Delgado of
Paraguay 6-3, 6-2. Rafter had two match points and finally earned
the win on the second match point.
	   England's Tim Henman made a successful Los Angeles debut,
beating Grant Stafford of South Africa 6-3, 6-0. Henman, the second
seed, had 10 aces.
	   ``This is my first match of the summer on hard courts,'' said
Henman, No. 12 in the world. ``It's a good build up for the U.S.
Open. I knew this match wasn't going to be easy.''
	   Sixth-seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also was an upset
victim, falling 6-2, 6-1 to Armenia's Sargis Sargsian. Eighth-seed
Vince Spadea rallied to beat Marcos Ondruska of South Africa 2-6,
6-3, 6-3.
	   In other matches, America's Jeff Tarango beat Alejandro
Hernandez of Mexico 6-2, 6-2, and Michael Joyce of the United
States beat Michael Tebbutt of Australia 7-5, 2-6, 7-5.

After doping tests, TVM team to race in Tour de France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team will race in
Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour de France following medical
tests to determine whether the races took illegal drugs.
	   ``Despite fatigue, the racers will start,'' Guido Vancasten, one
of the officials of the TVM team.
	   The cyclists from TVM were tested Tuesday for illegal
substances, the same day French authorities placed two top team
officials under formal investigation for allegedly supplying racers
with EPO, a performance enhancing drug.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens, one of the TVM racers, said Wednesday all of
the team's cyclists had been told to report to French authorities
in Reims on Monday morning, the day after the tour ends.
	   French doctors administered blood, urine and capillary tests
Tuesday and the racers reach their hotel only about midnight.
	   Police also interrogated Henrik Redant, a TVM official, most of
the night before releasing him Wednesday morning. Ian Moors, in
whose suitcase drugs were found, remained in custody.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov,
who were put under investigation Tuesday, are likely to be formally
charged.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Police then found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and trash
can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Meanwhile, a third team has been caught up in the doping scandal
that has trailed the Tour de France.
	   French police on Tuesday seized suspect medication in a van
driven by officials of the Bigmat team in Chambery, on the
Franco-Swiss border near Albertville, where the cyclists arrived
after the 16th stage of the competition.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials,
police said.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   France Info radio, citing unidentified judicial sources,
reported that the medication was a banned substance. The radio also
said the Bigmat cyclists underwent testing Wednesday morning.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO.

Serbs reportedly capture major rebel stronghold in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with EU statement following meeting with
Rugova &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following Serb gains on the
battlefield, a three-member European Union delegation arrived
Wednesday in Kosovo to continue international efforts to halt the
escalating conflict in the Serb-ruled province.
	   ``Our message is very clear, the violence has to stop
immediately,'' the Austrian delegation leader, Albert Rochan, told
reporters after meeting with the chief Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Rochan added.
	   He said the EU believed it was essential that the factious
Albanian community rally ``under one platform'' to begin peace
talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo's dominant
Albanian population.
	   ``We hope we'll be able to put this together very soon,'' Rubin
said.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which grew dramatically after the
government launched a crackdown on Albanian militants in February,
has refused to accept Rugova as the leader of the Albanian
community because he rejects violence.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   But Serb gains on the battlefield during an offensive launched
Friday night may have changed the political dynamics. Police and
army troops have managed to regain control of key areas of the
province which had been under rebel control.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from is major central Kosovo
stronghold Malisevo. In southwestern Kosovo, troops have surrounded
another KLA bastion, Junik, trapping about 1,000 fighters,
according to the Serbs.
	   No reliable casualty figures are available.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the last ten days has increased
the total number of civilians to flee their homes, to at least
100,000 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Last week, the International Committee of the Red Cross said
that many of the 40,000 civilians who fled fighting in another
town, Orahovac, had taken shelter in Malisevo. The UNHCR estimated
that half of the Orahovac refugees had fled to Malisevo.

Syria to continue building up forces, says new army chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's new military chief says he will
continue to beef up the armed forces in order to defend the country
from Israel.
	   But Syria does not look for a military solution and will stick
to its strategy of seeking ``genuine, just and comprehensive
peace'' with the Jewish state, Gen. Ali Aslan, the chief of staff,
wrote in the government's Al-Baath daily Wednesday.
	   ``The Israeli leaders will be mistaken if they think that
resorting to force and aggression would ever achieve security and
peace to them,'' Aslan wrote.
	   Aslan, a close ally to Syrian President Hafez Assad, replaced
Gen. Hikmat Al-Shihabi in a major army reshuffle this month. His
remarks do not indicate any shift in Syria's position.
	   Aslan also urged Arab countries to forge a unified Arab stance
against what he called Israel's ``evasiveness and stubbornness'' in
the Middle East peace process.
	   His remarks in an article were published on the occasion of the
Army Day on Saturday.
	   The Syrian-Israeli peace talks which started in 1992 have
stalled over Israel refusal to withdraw from the strategic Golan
Heights which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A gasoline tanker overturned and caught fire,
killing four men in the vehicle, and the spilled fuel caused
explosions that injured two people, the Interior Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   The accident happened Tuesday when a tire on the right side of
the truck blew up while the driver was making a right turn, the
ministry's spokesman, Col. Bader Saleh, said.
	   He said the victims' bodies were burned beyond recognition.
	   The tanker's owners said the driver was an Indian.
	   Gasoline from the overturned truck seeped into the sewage system
in the area and caused small explosions that slightly injured two
passers by, Saleh said.
	   No other details were available.

 &UR; Report: Japanese man expelled from Chechnya &QL;

ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Officials in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya said Wednesday that they have expelled a Japanese citizen
who was found taking photos of secret facilities, a news agency
reported.
	   The Japanese man, whose name was given as Yoshikama Mumora, had
entered Chechnya without permission and was carrying dlrs 40,000 in
cash, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting security officials
in the southern region. He was evicted from Chechnya over the
weekend, they said.
	   In an appearance late Tuesday on Chechen television, Deputy
Security Minister Khizir Mezhidov accused unspecified ``secret
services'' of sending the Japanese to Chechnya to stage his
abduction, the agency said.
	   Other security ministry officials contacted by The Associated
Press have refused to confirm the detention of the Japanese
citizen.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Embassy in Moscow were
checking the report, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   It quoted Mairbek Vachagayev, a spokesman for Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov as saying the government didn't know anything about
the reported detention.
	   Since the end of the 1994-96 war with Russia, Chechen officials
have been unable to contain a tide of crime in which dozens of
Russians and foreigners have been kidnapped by gangs seeking
ransom.
	   Tension has intensified in recent weeks, as Maskhadov's
government began a crackdown on the Wahhabis, a fundamentalist
Islamic sect blamed for many abductions and attacks.
	   Maskhadov on Tuesday lifted a state of emergency he imposed more
than a month ago to rein in Wahhabis and other militant groups. The
authorities also lifted a ban on Russian television broadcasts and
private Chechen channels.
	   However, heavy street patrols continued to stop and inspect cars
in the capital of Grozny for documents and illegal weapons.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian forces withdrew. But Moscow and the rest
of the world still consider the republic part of Russia.

In gauge of Netanyahu backing, a symbolic parliamentary vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Timing of vote uncertain. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of growing disenchantment with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's parliament on Wednesday
prepared to vote on a largely symbolic measure to dissolve itself.
	   Final approval of such a measure would effectively topple the
government and force early elections. But the vote expected later
Wednesday was only a preliminary one.
	   Wednesday was the last working day before parliament's summer
recess and the steps needed for full enactment _ committee approval
and three subsequent parliamentary votes _ were impossible to
complete in a single day.
	   Even so, the vote was seen as a bellwether of sentiment on
whether early elections should be held and on Netanyahu's handling
of negotiations with the Palestinians. The peace talks broke down
16 months ago and fitful efforts to revive them so far have not
succeeded.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from both inside and outside
Israel to accept an American-authored initiative calling for an
Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The prime minister's coalition partners all have different views
on the proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   For final approval of the dissolution measure, a majority of the
120-seat parliament would have to vote in favor of it. In
Wednesday's preliminary vote, only a majority of lawmakers present
needed to approve it for passage.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners were boycotting the vote. The
prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in parliament,
survived three opposition no-confidence motions on Monday.
	   On the eve of the vote, he did not seem concerned. Shai Bazak,
the prime minister's spokesman, told Army radio that Wednesday's
vote was ``not meaningful.''

Nine killed in South African attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details on victims, attack,
investigation; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ Gunmen burst into a home in a
rural area and fatally shot nine people, including five children,
police said Wednesday.
	   The killings took place Tuesday night as the victims slept in a
house outside this town 280 miles (450 kilometers) southeast of
Johannesburg. At least 30 people have been killed in and around
Richmond in the past month.
	   The victims were members of an extended family, police said. Two
of them were 2 years old and a third 3. All nine had been shot in
the head, said police Capt. Joshua Gwala.
	   The motive for the latest attack was unknown. Police were
investigating allegations by neighbors that the killers spoke
English or Afrikaans, Gwala said, an indication that they were
white.
	   He said the attack appeared related to the other killings over
the past month, which are unexplained. Some connect the violence to
next year's elections, the second all-race voting since the end of
apartheid.
	   Richmond is in KwaZulu-Natal province, the scene of a decade of
political violence in the 1980s and 1990s between the African
National Congress and Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party that
killed 10,000 people.
	   The ANC condemned Tuesday night's attack.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II called Wednesday for
prayers for victims of violence in the world, in particular five
Roman Catholic missionaries killed in recent days.
	   Speaking at his general audience, the pope mentioned three nuns
shot to death in Yemen, a nun kidnapped and slain in South Africa
and a Jesuit missionary killed in Republic of Congo.
	   John Paul urged prayers for ``these generous witnesses of the
Gospel and for all the victims of violence that, unfortunately,
continues to bloody various regions of the world.''

Obuchi pieces together Cabinet to tackle economic problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other tentative Cabinet appointments in grafs
20-21 &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Incoming premier Keizo Obuchi worked Wednesday to
piece together a Cabinet to attack Japan's economic woes, appealing
to a former prime minister to take the high-profile job of finance
minister.
	   Obuchi ``unofficially appointed'' elder statesman Kiichi
Miyazawa, 78, to the helm of the powerful Finance Ministry,
Japanese media reported.
	   Obuchi tapped a handful of other ruling party veterans to fill
out top posts of the Cabinet he is expected to formally announce
Thursday.
	   The 61-year-old Obuchi, who last week was voted president of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is nearly certain to be elected
prime minister when Parliament convenes Thursday since the LDP has
a comfortable majority in the more powerful lower house.
	   The incoming premier said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert
in finance and economics, to lead a clean-up of Japan's troubled
financial sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left
over from the collapse of the real estate market in the early
1990s.
	   ``He has a deep understanding of the problem and is trusted
internationally,'' Obuchi told reporters before meeting Miyazawa.
	   Miyazawa, who has held the key portfolio once before, speaks
fluent English and is well known internationally, which could help
him present Japan's policies abroad. The yen rose against the U.S.
dollar Wednesday when it looked like he would take the job.
	   Miyazawa would be the first to take the finance post after
serving as prime minister since Korekiyo Takahashi in 1927.
	   Takahashi is credited with saving Japan from a financial crisis
after rumors about the health of banks triggered a run on deposits
that year.
	   Obuchi has pledged to put together an ``economic reform
Cabinet'' and to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister to lead Japan out of its worst recession since World War
II.
	   Miyazawa served as finance minister during the ``bubble
economy'' of runaway stock and real estate prices before resigning
in 1988 amid accusations he accepted shares from Recruit Co. in
exchange for political favors. He was never found guilty of any
wrongdoing.
	   He became prime minister in 1991 but resigned when the LDP was
defeated in lower house elections in 1993, losing its grip on power
for the first time in 38 years.
	   Since then, he has quietly exercised power in the ruling party
as head of the LDP's third largest intra-party group.
	   Miyazawa was one of the architects of the plan drafted under
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to fix the banking
system.
	   Analysts doubted whether a man who had helped draft the current
measures would push for the bolder steps they say are needed to get
Japan's economy back on track.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is going to clean up, or radically
change the system. He is the ultimate insider,'' he said.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief Cabinet secretary, newspapers said
early Wednesday. The secretary functions as chief of staff and
spokesman for the prime minister.
	   Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, was chosen as
minister of international trade and industry while State Foreign
Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, was asked to replace Obuchi as
foreign minister.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, a writer, was chosen as director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency. Sakaiya, also a former trade ministry
official, has written that despite their material riches, many
Japanese are dissatisfied with their work and with society.
	   Formal appointments are expected to be made Thursday.
	   The only glitch in Obuchi's march to the prime minister's spot
appeared to be the LDP's weakness in the upper house, where the
party suffered a humiliating setback in July 12 elections.
	   The Yomiuri reported Wednesday that the upper house, where the
LDP does not have a majority, may vote to elect popular opposition
leader Naoto Kan as prime minister.
	   The move would be largely symbolic, however, since the
constitution gives the lower house the power to overrule the upper
house in the election.

Iraq holds Kuwait responsible for 1,000 missing Iraqis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq holds Kuwaiti authorities responsible
for the fate of 1,037 Iraqis missing from the 1991 Gulf War, the
ruling party newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Al-Thawra daily said Iraq has given the International Committee
of the Red Cross files on the Iraqis who went missing in Kuwait
during the war.
	   But Kuwait has only provided information on three files and has
neglected the rest on the grounds that it has no more information
to give, al-Thawra said, describing it as a ``mean stand.''
	   ``The way Kuwaiti authorities are dealing with this problem
holds them fully and legally accountable to declare what happened
to them,'' al-Thawra said.
	   Kuwait denies Iraqi allegations and accuses Baghdad of trying to
overshadow the issue of missing Kuwaitis.
	   Kuwait repeatedly has said that 600 people _ including more than
500 Kuwaitis, more than a dozen Saudis and other foreign nationals
_ are still unaccounted for since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which set off the Gulf War.
	   Iraq has repeatedly denied that it is holding any Kuwaitis in
its jails.

Iranians, Russians deny weapons links that brought U.S. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran's ambassador to Moscow denied Wednesday any
knowledge of the seven Russian companies that the United States
alleges have sold sensitive weapons technology.
	   President Clinton banned U.S. aid on Tuesday to the Russian
research and manufacturing enterprises found to have sold sensitive
weapons technology to such countries as Iran, Libya or North Korea.
The enterprises will also be barred from exporting goods to the
United States.
	   ``The companies and organizations figuring in Clinton's
directive, with the exception of the research institutes, are not
even known in Iran,'' Iranian Ambassador Mehdi Safari said in an
interview with the Interfax news agency.
	   Safari said Clinton's actions were based on rumors.
	   The sanctioned enterprises are the INOR scientific center, the
Grafit and Polyus research institutes, the Glavkosmos organization,
the MOSO company, the Baltic State Technical University and
Europalace 2000.
	   Baltic State University in St. Petersburg denied on Tuesday that
it had helped Iran acquire nuclear weapons technology by training
Iranian students.
	   ``Not one Iranian student or trainee ever studied in this
area,'' said university rector Yuri Savelyev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Savelyev said an agreement to train 25 Iranian scientists ended
two years ago, and all they were taught was Russian language,
physics, math, physical sciences and general engineering.
	   Russia has been accused by the United States and Israel in
particular of helping Iran develop its nuclear weapons program, by
training students, building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran
and providing missile technology.
	   Russia denies the missile allegations and says the nuclear plant
is for purely civilian uses. Regardless, the government has moved
recently to tighten control over the export of weapons and weapons
technology.
	   On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said it would coordinate its
efforts with regional law enforcement agencies and the Federal
Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, to halt illegal
exports.
	   Still, the ministry reiterated that it would continue selling
sanctioned technology abroad, particularly conventional arms, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Defense Ministry's announcement followed a decree signed by
President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday that tightened government
control over weapons exports by specifying which Russian weapons
can be sold to what countries.

Pakistan awaits IMF team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ If it's very careful, Pakistan can
make its meager foreign exchange reserves last until international
lenders release money denied under anti-nuclear sanctions, a
government adviser said Wednesday.
	   Aleem Mahmud, special adviser to Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz,
said he expected the International Monetary Fund to approve loans
within a month now that the United States has dropped its
objections. An IMF team will arrive in the next 10 days for
preparatory work, he said, adding the World Bank also was likely to
release funds based on the IMF team's assessment.
	   In the meantime, ``we're exercising all possible measures to
control the outflow of foreign exchange,'' Mahmud said. He said he
did not believe Pakistan's economy would collapse.
	   The IMF had a three-year, dlrs 1.6 billion loan program with
Pakistan that now must be renegotiated.
	   Pakistan's already weak economy was brought to the brink of
collapse by sanctions imposed on both Pakistan and India after the
two rival neighbors conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May.
Food and fuel prices shot up in Pakistan, and shopkeepers have
protested the government's attempts to raise funds with new taxes.
	   Central bank director Mohammad Yaqub said that as of last
Friday, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves stood at dlrs 531
million, down from dlrs 1.2 billion before Pakistan conducted
nuclear tests in May. At that rate, in less than two months
Pakistan could run out of money to pay for imports or service
debts. Pakistan, a country of 140 million people, has a foreign
debt of dlrs 30 million on which it makes annual payments of dlrs 3
billion.
	   The United States cut off its own aid and loans and blocked
international loans in response to the tests, which it said could
lead to nuclear war in South Asia. But Washington has had to review
its sanctions strategy.
	   The punishments were backfiring, leaving buyers in Pakistan and
India without funds to buy, for example, wheat from U.S. farmers.
U.S. President Bill Clinton also said he had never intended to hurt
ordinary people.
	   Last week, the United States cleared the way for the IMF to
resume negotiations with Pakistan, though U.S. law still requires
Washington to abstain or vote no on loan proposals. Senior state
department and treasury officials said they believed new loans
would be approved by other industrialized democracies on the IMF
board, provided Pakistan agreed to substantial economic reforms.
	   Mahmud said Pakistan was ``not in a rush'' for lenders to act.
	   To preserve foreign exchange reserves, Pakistan has restricted
the rate at which foreign currency can be purchased, frozen special
foreign currency accounts held by about 600,000 Pakistanis and
stopped imports of all but cooking oil, wheat, medicines and other
commodities deemed essential commodities.

ASEAN determined not to let haze cover Commonwealth Games

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Determined not to let dark haze
cover the upcoming Commonwealth Games, Southeast Asian nations
announced plans Wednesday to fight and prevent regional wildfires.
	   Senior environment officials from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations met to prepare for the group's fifth
ministerial-level meeting on the haze Thursday.
	   ``The main thing we are all thinking about is the Commonwealth
Games,'' Cheah Kong Wai, secretary-general for Malaysia's
Environment Ministry, told reporters. ``It is very important for us
to ensure that the haze is not only prevented but controlled.''
	   Malaysia's preparations for the games, which begin in six weeks,
have included multibillion-dollar investments in sports arenas,
hotels and a still-unfinished light-rail train system. The event is
expected to boost tourism and draw more than 4,000 athletes from 68
countries.
	   ``Every ASEAN country member believes this is a matter of
working together,'' said Effendy A. Sumardja, Indonesia's assistant
minister for environment coordination. ``We are trying to solve the
problem of forest fires happening.''
	   On Monday, Indonesia launched its first surveillance flight to
detect hot spots in Riau province on Sumatra Island, Sumardja said.
He added that 16 more flights were planned in the area,
concentrating on hot spots and plantations.
	   Funding for the plan came from the United Nations Environment
Program, which recently released a dlrs 30,000 disbursement of a
dlrs 750,000 fire fighting aid package.
	   Indonesia's government hopes to draw more financial support from
international donors, Sumardja said.
	   Ministers are expected to review progress reports Thursday on a
regional haze action plan, divided among the countries hardest hit
by last year's haze. Under the plan, Indonesia is responsible for
firefighting, Singapore for monitoring the fires and Malaysia for
preventing new blazes.
	   Uncontrollable wildfires in Indonesia last year wiped out more
than 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest and sent
choking smoke over neighboring countries from Singapore to Malaysia
and the Philippines.
	   Fires were exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which
halted regional rains and led to the worst drought in half a
century in parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei earlier this
year.
	   Recently, rains have returned to the region and doused the
majority of hot spots, Cheah said.
	   ``This will help us to put out the fires,'' said Cheah. ``We're
doing our best to make sure that the fires don't reappear.''

Norway planning bridge based on 496-year-old Leonardo da Vinci

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian highway department has found a
bridge designer with unbeatably impressive credentials: Leonardo da
Vinci, the original Renaissance Man.
	   The department aims to build a bridge that da Vinci designed
nearly five centuries ago for a Turkish sultan, who rejected the
plan in the belief that it wouldn't work.
	   ``This is the opposite of our usual projects,'' said Haakon
Haaversen, of the Norwegian Highway Department's Akershus County
office. ``Usually we have a place that needs a bridge, and we
design one to fit it. But now we have a bridge design and had to
search for a place that suits it.''
	   Leonardo designed the bridge in 1502 to cross the Golden Horn
inlet in Istanbul. With a length of 1,155 feet (346 meters), it
would have been the world's longest bridge, and Sultan Bajazet II
didn't believe it could be completed.
	   The highway department is planning a modest 190-foot (57-meter)
version of the bridge in Aas Township, about 1,500 miles (2,400
kilometers) north of the location Leonardo had in mind. The
department wants to replace an ugly pedestrian bridge across a main
highway.
	   The current structure, basically a slab on stilts, ``is a pretty
good example of how not to design a bridge,'' said Knut Gloersen,
head of highway planning for Akershus County.
	   Leonardo's design, on the other hand, pleases esthetes as much
as engineers. The sketches show a graceful elliptical arch
supporting a roadway that curves like an archer's bow.
	   Vebjoern Sand, a Norwegian artist, saw a model of the bridge at
an exhibition in Stockholm, Sweden, and decided it had to be built.
In 1995, he contacted Norwegian highway authorities and political
leaders, and gained broad support.
	   ``The first time I saw the model it really excited me. It was so
beautiful,'' Sand said. He described it as ``the primordial bridge,
the perfect blend of art and function.''
	   ``This is a bridge that has never been built but has been an
inspiration to modern bridge designers,'' he said. ``It is the Mona
Lisa, the queen of bridges. To build Leonardo's bridge is to
realize both history and art.''
	   The highway department is studying two proposals for the bridge
_ a wooden version, costing about 3.5 million kroner (dlrs
466,000), and one of stone, costing nearly three times as much.
	   ``The wooden bridge would be a design inspired by da Vinci,
while the stone one would be more of a monument,'' Gloersen said.
The highway department, at best, can fund a wooden bridge, but Sand
said he was sure of raising the additional money for a stone bridge
from other sources.
	   A final decision is due in November.
	   In a letter discovered in 1952, Leonardo offered to lead
construction of the original bridge for the sultan, since no one
else could be found. That led researchers to ask whether the
sultan's refusal had spared Leonardo a humiliating failure, or if
he could have succeeded.
	   ```While he had to rely on intuition for his designs, we used
modern techniques and computers to test the design,'' Gloersen
said. ``We can confirm that (Leonardo) was right. At least for the
scale we're working on.''

Cargo handler says recovery program ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with official saying small-medium
businesses to be most affected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The main cargo handler at Hong Kong's troubled
airport increased shipments Wednesday, and said it was slightly
ahead of its schedule for returning to normal operations.
	   While airport officials managed to iron out most problems at the
passenger terminal shortly after the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok
airport opened July 6, cargo-handling has been a much tougher
problem.
	   A series of problems at its new terminal forced the main cargo
handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to limit imports and
exports, and to reopen some facilities at the old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   The government's secretary for economic services, Stephen Ip,
told legislators that small- and medium-size businesses will suffer
about 60 percent of the losses due to the cargo problems.
	   Some of them may face cash-flow problems, weakened bargaining
power or reduced competitiveness, he said.
	   Both the government and the cargo handler have come in for
scathing criticism from legislators and businessmen who fear the
problems will further hurt Hong Kong's economy. Air cargo is an
important industry, and Hong Kong already is suffering from
recession and unemployment that has risen to a 15-year high of 4.5
percent.
	   Over the weekend, the cargo handler began accepting one pallet
of general cargo per passenger plane arriving at Chek Lap Kok. On
Wednesday, it began permitting two pallets.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of the cargo handler, said in
a statement that prior to the increase, it had averaged more than
2,700 tons of cargo a day for the previous seven days.
	   He said the company was making steady progress, and was slightly
ahead of schedule for a four-phase plan it announced earlier this
month.
	   The plan called for cargo handling to be at 75 percent of the
normal capacity of 4,000 tons a day by the end of July, using
facilities at both the old and new airports; full capacity using
both airports by mid-August; and 100 percent capacity using only
the new airport by the end of August.

East and west Germans disagree about causes for economic woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Germans from east and west tend to blame
each other when asked who's to blame for the country's high
unemployment and other economic problems, a survey released
Wednesday found.
	   The Polis poll of 6,000 Germans found 78 percent of west Germans
point to the high cost of building up the former communist east as
the main cause for Germany's economic troubles today.
	   East Germans, on the other hand, blame the expensive government
(89 percent) and the power of the banks and big capital (79
percent) _ institutions based in the western half.
	   But there's one point where both sides agree: the solution does
not lie in cutting wages or benefits. The most popular suggested
remedies were more flexible working times (westerners 49 percent,
easterners 56 percent) and limits on immigration (westerners 48
percent, easterners 54 percent).
	   The survey was conducted over 18 months for the Friedrich-Ebert
foundation, which is close to the Social Democratic party. No
margin of error was given.
	   Excerpts were to appear Thursday in Die Zeit weekly newspaper,
and the complete survey will be published in book form in August by
the Dietz Verlag publishing company.

Dispute between Ajax and De Boer twins continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The predicament for twin soccer
stars Frank and Ronald de Boer seems simple: they want to leave
Ajax Amsterdam, but the club won't let them.
	   The protracted contract squabble was dragged before an
independent soccer arbitration commission this week, and an
agreement was still not in sight on Wednesday.
	   ``They are good players and Ajax want to keep them,'' said
Ajax's Christa Overtoom.
	   ``They've made it clear, they definitely won't come back for
Ajax,'' said Rob de Leede, spokesman for the Royal Netherlands
Soccer Association.
	   After negotiations failed, the twins took their case to the
arbitration commission of the soccer association.
	   Both sides presented their arguments before the three-member
panel Tuesday. A decision was expected later this week.
	   The commission's decision will be legally binding, De Leede
said.
	   The twins have requested to be released from their contracts
with Ajax, which are valid until 2004.
	   ``Ajax was a great book, but we've read it,'' Ronald was quoted
as saying by the national daily De Volkskrant in its Wednesday
editions.
	   Their lawyer Harro Knijff said the twins weren't exactly proud
of being in a legal dispute with the club they've been with for 14
years.
	   ``They consider this as a black day in their carrier,'' Knijff
told De Volkskrant.
	   The contracts, signed in March 1997, also contain a clause
stipulating that the twins cannot seek a transfer before 2001.
	   But several top European club are eying the twins.
	   A delegation from FC Barcelona attended Tuesday's hearing,
reported De Volkskrant, adding the Spanish powerhouse is willing to
pay dlrs 22 million for both De Boers.

Serbs reportedly capture major rebel stronghold in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with EU commission arriving in Pristina,
trims. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A delegation of European diplomats
arrived in Kosovo Wednesday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders
rattled by recent Serb battlefield gains, announcing ``the violence
has to stop immediately.''
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rochan, the Austrian
delegation leader, said after meeting with the chief Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The meetings come on the heels of several Serb victories during
an offensive launched Friday night. Police and army troops have
managed to regain control of key areas of the province that had
been under rebel control, a development that may lead the rebels to
be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with
Rugova and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party
executive'' to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for
Kosovo's dominant Albanian population.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which grew dramatically after the
government launched a crackdown on Albanian militants in February,
has refused to accept Rugova as the leader of the Albanian
community because he rejects violence.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has offered to restore the
autonomy he took away from Kosovo in 1989 but refuses to consider
independence. The United States and the European Union also oppose
independence.
	   ``Our message is very clear,'' delegation leader Rochan said
Wednesday. ``The violence has to stop immediately.''
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from its major central Kosovo
stronghold, Malisevo. In southwestern Kosovo, troops have
surrounded another KLA bastion, Junik, trapping about 1,000
fighters, according to the Serbs.
	   No reliable casualty figures are available from the fighting.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the last ten days has increased
to at least 100,000 the number of civilians forced to flee their
homes, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
	   Last week, the International Committee of the Red Cross said
that many of the 40,000 civilians who fled fighting in another
town, Orahovac, had taken shelter in Malisevo.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, located in
southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics that make up the
remainder of Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of
the province's 2 million people.

EU Warns Italy On Golden Share Privatization Provision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Wednesday gave
the Italian governemnt two months to alter privatization laws that
grant the state powers over share purchases and corporate
decision-making.
	   The special powers effectively grant the government a golden
share in privatized defense and public services companies in
transport, telecommunications, energy, and utilities. The EU
Commission threatened to take Italy to the European Court of
Justice if the law isn't changed.
	   The golden share provision has been used in the privatization
programs of ENI Spa, Telecom Italia Spa, and STET Spa, according to
the Commission.
	   Investors must receive Italian Treasury Ministry authorization
to acquire more than 5 percent of voting rights in one of these
companies, or to form a shareholder pact that would collectively
surpass that limit.
	   The government also can veto decisions that would lead to the
dissolution, transfer, or merger of the company, or a change in the
company statutes, if such a move ``implies the suppression or
modification of these special powers.''
	   Finally, the government has the right to appoint one or several
members of the company directorate, as well as one auditor.
	   In a statement, the Commission said these provisions violate EU
laws on free movement of capital It said a response to EU concerns
from Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi received failed to
address the problems.

After doping tests, TVM team to race in Tour de France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes from Blijlevens, CORRECTS spelling of
Guido van Calster &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBERTVILLE, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team will race in
Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour de France following medical
tests to determine whether the races took illegal drugs.
	   ``Despite fatigue, the racers will start,'' Guido van Calster,
one of the officials of the TVM team. ``We're keeping our moral up.
I am very proud of my racers.''
	   The cyclists from TVM were tested Tuesday for illegal
substances, the same day French authorities placed two top team
officials under formal investigation for allegedly supplying racers
with EPO, a performance enhancing drug.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens, one of the TVM racers, said Wednesday all of
the team's cyclists had been told to report to French authorities
in Reims on Monday morning, the day after the tour ends.
	   Blijlevens railed against French authorities, saying they were
conducting a ``witch-hunt'' against the racers. ``French justice
can do whatever it wants. The racers have no rights.''
	   French doctors administered blood, urine and capillary tests
Tuesday and the racers reach their hotel only about midnight.
	   ``The hospital was very amateurish. They can do whatever they
want with our blood,'' he said.
	   Blijlevens said the TVM racers were very tired emotionally.
``For myself, I am exhausted.''
	   Police also interrogated Henrik Redant, a TVM official, most of
the night before releasing him Wednesday morning. Ian Moors, in
whose suitcase drugs were found, remained in custody.
	   Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov,
who were put under investigation Tuesday, are likely to be formally
charged.
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Police then found evidence of used drugs in a suitcase and trash
can during a search of the team's hotel in Toulouse and Metz,
though the nature of the drugs is still not known.
	   Meanwhile, a third team has been caught up in the doping scandal
that has trailed the Tour de France.
	   French police on Tuesday seized suspect medication in a van
driven by officials of the Bigmat team in Chambery, on the
Franco-Swiss border near Albertville, where the cyclists arrived
after the 16th stage of the competition.
	   Around 100 doses of medication were found in briefcases among
the team's bags during a routine inspection by customs officials,
police said.
	   The drugs were sent to a police laboratory in the city of Lyon
for analysis, police said.
	   France Info radio, citing unidentified judicial sources,
reported that the medication was a banned substance. The radio also
said the Bigmat cyclists underwent testing Wednesday morning.
	   Festina has been thrown out of the race for the use of EPO.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky is
prepared to testify that she and President Bill Clinton discussed
ways of concealing an alleged sexual relationship, legal sources
say. Ms. Lewinsky's account to Independent Counsel Ken Starr's
prosecutors is that ``she and the president were talking about
cover stories for their relationship, as two people in such
situations frequently do; how to keep it secret,'' one source said
Tuesday night. For example, said the sources, Ms. Lewinsky, 25,
says she and the president agreed that one way to explain her
frequent visits to the White House Oval Office would be to say she
was going to see the president's secretary. Starr won Ms.
Lewinsky's cooperation while trying to enforce a subpoena _ or
negotiate an arrangement _ for Clinton's testimony in his
investigation of a presidential affair and coverup. (US-CLINTON

military to let them monitor Suu Kyi's condition twice a day and
that she be provided with facilities to wash herself, said a
statement from Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, received in Bangkok on Wednesday. It was not known
whether the military honored the request, although it has provided
her with drinking water. Members of her party have said her food is
running out and they are concerned about her health.(MYANMAR-SUU

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen raised the stakes
in Cambodia's post-election turmoil Wednesday, saying that if his
opponents refuse to work with him, the current government he
dominates will stay in power indefinitely without them.Should they
boycott the National Assembly as threatened to prevent the
two-thirds attendance needed to confirm a new government, Hun Sen
said he will amend the constitution to lower the minimum to 50
percent plus one, possibly giving his party sole control. The
opposition showed no sign of backing down. Leader Sam Rainsy
climbed a tree and spoke through a bullhorn to 1,500 cheering
supporters who had waited outside a hotel for the result of a
meeting by a dozen parties alleging fraud in Sunday's parliamentary
elections.(CAMBODIA-ELECTIONS)
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister offered to
resume formal talks with India on Wednesday, the same day he was to
meet with his Indian counterpart for their first face-to-face talks
since they sparked fears of a regional arms race by ordering
nuclear tests. Sharif's offer was a promising start for his
anticipated talks later Wednesday with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee on easing tensions since each country set off
nuclear tests in May. It also was the first meeting between the two
leaders since Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office
in March, pledging to step up the fight against what India calls a
Pakistan-backed insurgency by Muslim separatists in the Himalayan
border region of Kashmir.(INDIA-PAKISTAN-NUCLEAR)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A delegation of European diplomats
arrived in Kosovo Wednesday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders
rattled by recent Serb battlefield gains, announcing ``the violence
has to stop immediately.'' The meetings come on the heels of
several Serb victories during an offensive launched Friday night.
Police and army troops have managed to regain control of key areas
of the province that had been under rebel control, a development
that may lead the rebels to be more amenable to talks with the
Serbs. The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from
Germany and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American
effort to forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was
beginning to bear fruit. In Washington, the U.S. State Department
said that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova and
other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive'' to
negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo's dominant
Albanian population. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Yeltsin cuts short rained-out vacation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin saying he's returning to Moscow to deal
with urgent business. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his rained-out
vacation Tuesday to return to Moscow, saying he had urgent business
related to the ``complicated political and economic situation in
the country.''
	   Yeltsin has been vacationing since July 18 at the government
lakeside resort of Shuiskaya Chupa in the Karelia region near the
border with Finland.
	   But he's been stuck indoors the entire time while rains lashed
the region, unable to go fishing or gather mushrooms, Russian news
agencies reported. Aides said he worked on government papers
instead.
	   Yeltsin flew back to Moscow and headed for his country residence
outside the city.
	   Before leaving Karelia, Yeltsin told reporters he had ``urgent
business'' to attend to in Moscow.
	   ``The transition from the summer political period to the autumn
one is now under way,'' Yeltsin said. ``We should carry out this
transition in a confident, resolute way, without stepping back.''
	   While he was on vacation, Yeltsin fired the head of the Russian
security service and hinted at more high-level government firings.
He also faces simmering unrest in the Caucasus regions of southern
Russia and continued economic problems, despite a dlrs 22 billion
international bailout.
	   The vice-chairman of the Communist Party said Wednesday he
expected the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to hold an
emergency session at the end of August when an austerity program
demanded by the International Monetary Fund begins to take effect.
	   ``The first signs of discontent with the so-called stabilization
measures will make themselves felt at the beginning of August, so
we shall have serious reasons to hold an extraordinary session,''
said Valentin Kuptsov, who is also deputy Communist leader in the
Duma.
	   Yeltsin's press service said he planned to resume in his
vacation somewhere else in a couple of days. Yeltsin has not yet
made up his mind about the new vacation spot.
	   The Kremlin said previously that Yeltsin will not return to work
before the end of August. Early in the month he is expected to
travel to the to Severomorsk, a military port on the Barents Sea,
to inaugurate the recently built nuclear-powered missile cruiser
Peter the Great.

Asian markets mostly lower on continued uncertainty over Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets ended mostly lower Wednesday as
investors remained nervous over political uncertainty in Japan and
a 1 percent drop on Wall Street overnight.
	   Tokyo stocks closed mixed as most investors stayed out of the
market on the eve of the selection of Japan's new finance minister.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues gained 43.55 points,
or 0.27 percent, closing at 16,158.09, after a 170.18-point rise
Tuesday.
	   Investors remained worried about the ability of incoming
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to piece together a government
that will be able to tackle the woes of an economy that much of
Asia depends on for growth and investment.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed higher following an agreement
between the government and the International Monetary Fund to keep
interest rates down. The two indicated that a flexible monetary
policy would be maintained. The benchmark KOSPI index was up 9.08
points, or 2.7 percent, ending at 344.41.
	   In Hong Kong, stocks fell for a third straight day on new fears
over China's economic growth and concerns about Japan's government.
Traders said they expected more losses in the near term.
	   The benchmark Hang Seng index fell 117.27 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 7,808.83. It had slipped 58.33 points Tuesday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished lower, reflecting
falls on overseas markets. The NZSE-40 was down 9.02 points, or
0.43 percent, closing at 2,093.04.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower because of
nervousness over Asian markets and Wall Street's overnight drop.
The All Ordinaries fell 33 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,693.2.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian stocks ended higher on heavy buying in
cigarette shares, despite caution over an international lenders'
meeting in Paris. The JSX Composite Index inched up 1.565 points,
or 0.3 percent, closing at 483.531.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower on persistent
selling, with the key index at a nine-year low. The benchmark
Composite Index fell 18.01 points, or 4.6 percent, ending at
385.97.
	   SINGAPORE: Singapore shares closed lower on nervousness over
neighboring Malaysia's economy and possible disappointment when
local companies announce their earnings in the coming weeks. The
Straits Times Industrials Index lost 6.16 points, or 0.58 percent,
closing at 1,053.98.
	   BANGKOK: Share prices closed lower after an announcement by
Moody's Investors Service of a possible downgrade of long-term debt
ratings of six Thai banks and financial institutions prompted a
sale of banking shares. The SET index fell 3.23 points, or 1.2
percent, closing at 263.49.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended lower as investors took to the
sidelines after Wall Street's overnight plunge. The Weighted Price
Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 54.81 points, or
0.70 percent, at 7,775.33.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares finished lower as a lack of good news
pushed many investors to the sidelines. The PSE index fell 23.06
points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,605.27.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets ended mostly lower Wednesday as
investors remained on nervous over political uncertainty in Japan
and a 1 percent drop on Wall Street overnight. Although Tokyo
stocks closed marginally higher, most investors stayed out of the
market before the selection of Japan's new finance minister. The
Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was up 43.55 points, or 0.27
percent, ending at 16,158.09 after a 170.18-point rise on Tuesday.
In Seoul, share prices closed higher after the government and the
IMF agreed to keep interest rates down and monetary policy
flexible. In Hong Kong, stocks fell for a third straight day on new
fears over China's economic growth and concerns about Japan's
government. Traders said they expected more losses in the near
term. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Responding to calls by strapped Asian
countries for more assistance, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Wednesday cautioned that aid alone would not resolve
the crisis. Asian countries appealed for aid during a wide-ranging
diplomatic conference that ended Tuesday. The United States, Japan
and other countries announced no new aid packages and said that
while they will continue to help, Southeast Asian countries
themselves must persevere with painful political and economic
reforms if they are to recover. China's Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan told the concluding session of the ASEAN conference that
Asia's recovery must come from within for it to be lasting. He
reiterated a Chinese pledge not to devalue its currency. (ASEAN)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ Workers at General Motors Corp. vote
Wednesday on ratifying a deal to end their 8-week strike at two
parts plants that have cost the world's largest automaker more than
dlrs 2.2 billion. United Auto Workers officials predicted the deals
would be approved overwhelmingly, and that some of the 200,000
idled employees could return to work by Wednesday night. GM said it
will take at least two days for the first idled assembly plants to
resume operation and all plants won't be operational until next
week. But perhaps the most significant result of the deal is a
commitment by GM and the UAW to try and resolve disputes through
frequent talks among top officials. (GM STRIKES)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Incoming premier Keizo Obuchi worked Wednesday to
piece together a Cabinet to attack Japan's economic woes, appealing
to a former prime minister to take the high-profile job of finance
minister. Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, ``unofficially agreed'' to take the
helm of the powerful Finance Ministry, national broadcaster NHK
reported. The incoming premier said he is depending on Miyazawa, an
expert in finance and economics, to lead a clean-up of Japan's
troubled financial sector, which is weighed down by bad debt from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s. Miyazawa
speaks fluent English and is well known internationally, which
could help him present Japan's policies abroad. The yen rose
against the U.S. dollar Wednesday when it looked like he would take
the job.(JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Microsoft answered accusations by the Justice
Department and a group of states over its landmark antitrust case,
and countersued the 20 state attorneys general to pay its own
lawyers' fees. The influential software company filed its own
lawsuit Tuesday against the states that joined the Justice
Department in the federal antitrust case filed May 18. The company
said that under copyright law, it is entitled to sell unaltered
versions of its Windows 95 and Windows 98 software. As part of its
claim, the government contends that Microsoft should be forced to
change the way its Internet browser works within Windows and
computer makers should be allowed to make additional changes to
Windows. A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general said
Microsoft's lawsuit was an intimidation attempt. (US-MICROSOFT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A female employee has sued United Airlines Inc.'s
Japan branch over alleged discrimination in the payment of special
allowances to married workers, a court official said Wednesday. The
52-year-old employee, whose name was not disclosed, says she has
siffered pay discrimination for 28 years and is seeking 16 million
yen (dlrs 114,000). She claims that the company's work regulations,
which provide a monthly family allowance totaling 16,500 yen (dlrs
118) to married workers, discriminates against single employees,
the Asahi newspaper reported. In Japan, the payment of a family
allowance is a common practice at most companies. A spokesman for
United's Japan subsidiary declined to comment. (JAPAN-UNITED
LAWSUIT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Two tiny islands off the African coast are
hoping to boost their local economies, which rely mostly on the
export of frozen tuna, by selling one-of-a-kind Internet addresses.
Ascension Island and St. Helena, which together are just over twice
the size of the District of Columbia, are selling World Wide Web
addresses using the unique two-letter suffixes assigned to the
islands, ``ac'' and ``sh.'' Their offers mean a company that failed
to seize popular generic Web site names, such as ``diapers.com'' or
``computer.com,'' can rush to buy ``diapers.ac'' or
``computer.sh.'' Each address costs roughly dlrs 60 to dlrs 100.
St. Helena began selling addresses using its ``sh'' domain last
week, and nearby Ascension Island, also a British territory, will
begin offering its ``ac'' suffix on Monday. (ISLANDS-INTERNET

Nasrallah reelects Hezbollah chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of the militant pro-Iranian
Hezbollah group has been reelected as the party's secretary-general
for a third consecutive term, local newspapers said Wednesday.
	   As-Safir newspaper said the party's congress, which had been
convening for a month in a secret location in Beirut's southern
suburbs, held its final session Tuesday, extending Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah's term for another three years.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah's press office.
	   The party's charter, which limits the tenure of a
secretary-general to a maximum of two consecutive, three-year
terms, was amended to allow for Nasrallah's reelection, As-Safir
said in its front-page report.
	   Nasrallah's deputy, Sheikh Naim Kassem, party politburo chief
Mohammed Raad and key members of the party's seven-men Shura
Council, the ruling body, also retained their posts, As-Safir and
other newspapers said.
	   Nasrallah, 44, was elected Hezbollah's secretary-general for the
first time in February 1992, two days after his predecessor, Sheik
Abbas Musawi, was killed in an helicopter gunship ambush in South
Lebanon.
	   He is the party's third secretary-general since it was founded
in 1982.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the main guerrilla group fighting
to oust Israeli troops occupying parts of southern Lebanon.
	   The party under Nasrallah's leadership has also made significant
strides on the political front, with seven representatives in
Lebanon's 128-seat legislature. Hezbollah scored major gains in
municipal elections held recently across the country.

Nigeria: West African force may intervene in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The Nigerian-led West African military
force that has intervened in conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia
may now intervene in the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria's
military leader has said.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar said that following a request for
intervention from the government of Guinea-Bissau he asked military
chiefs involved in the West African military force known as ECOMOG
to draw up contingency plans in case of intervention.
	   Fighting began in Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt
in the capital, Bissau, by ousted former army chief of staff Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who accuses President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption and says he should resign. The fighting spread later to
the interior of the former Portuguese colony.
	   On Tuesday, news reports said Mane's forces had accused
government forces of violating a cease-fire agreement signed last
weekend.
	   The government and the breakaway military faction agreed to a
cease-fire ahead of further talks to end the conflict, which has
displaced some 200,000 people _ about one-fifth of the population.
	   In Abuja, Abubakar told reporters Tuesday that he would soon
``be able to tell you exactly the number of countries that have
pledged to contribute troops'' to an intervention force for
Guinea-Bissau.
	   He made the statement after meeting with Blaise Campaore, the
visiting president of the Burkina Faso and the current chairman of
the Organization of African Unity. Compaore endorsed the idea of
intervention, Abubakar said.
	   ECOMOG forces have intervened to stop fighting in recent years
in Liberia and has also sent troops to Sierra Leone, where they
returned that country's president, who had been ousted in a coup,
to power.

China punishes 37 corrupt judicial officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has punished 37 court officials for
bribe-taking and other malfeasance in an accelerating crackdown on
graft in the judiciary, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Wednesday.
	   One official is being prosecuted for corruption, and two others
are under investigation for related crimes, Xinhua said, without
identifying the officials or their alleged wrongdoings.
	   Additional punishments included demotion, dismissal and
expulsion from the Communist Party, it said.
	   The agency said several of the officials, who range from clerks
and bailiffs to senior judges, had accepted bribes, presumably from
plaintiffs in exchange for favorable verdicts. Corruption,
embezzlement of public funds and contempt for the law were also
listed among charges against the officials, Xinhua said.
	   Another 58 judicial officials have been punished for mishandling
cases, it said.
	   Amid vague calls for an independent judiciary, China has sought
to weed out the most corrupt in a judiciary that has traditionally
acted with impunity.
	   Earlier this month, a senior judge was sentenced to 15 years in
prison for accepting 250,000 yuan (dlrs 30,000) in bribes.

Prosecutors not yet involved in Boris Becker tax case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German prosecutors have no immediate
plans to open a tax evasion investigation against tennis star Boris
Becker, the chief Munich prosecutor said Wednesday.
	   Peter Schlicht said city tax officials were handling an inquiry
into Becker's taxes, and that prosecutors would get involved only
after the tax officials present their report.
	   Tax agents this week raided about 30 locations linked to Becker
on suspicion that he evaded taxes on millions of dollars in
earnings.
	   Munich tax agency sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the raids, first reported by the Munich newspaper
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   The agents searched offices and apartments of Becker's friends
and sponsors on Monday, the newspaper said.
	   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, the former No. 1 in the
world and the country's Davis Cup captain, remains one of Germany's
most popular personalities. He is in semi-retirement on the tennis
circuit, playing only selected tournaments.
	   Becker and his former manager Ion Tiriac are suspected of
evading taxes on millions of dollars of Becker's earnings from 1990
to 1993.
	   Becker and Tiriac have denied the accusations since they first
surfaced in February last year. Prosecutors never charged the two
men, indicating they did not believe they had a strong case.
	   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said offices of the German Tennis
Federation also were searched. Federation officials declined to
comment.
	   Tax authorities want to find out how much time Becker spent in
Monte Carlo, the tax haven where he officially resided between 1990
and 1993. Under German law, Becker would have had to spend at least
185 days per year in Monte Carlo to avoid paying German taxes. The
investigators believe he spent most of the time in Germany, the
newspaper reported.
	   German tennis star Steffi Graf also has been linked to tax
evasion. Her father, Peter Graf, was sentenced in January 1997 to
three years, nine months for evading taxes on dlrs 6.55 million of
his daughter's tennis earnings.
	   The elder Graf, 59, was released from prison April 29 after
serving more than half of the sentence, including time served when
he was in investigative custody.

Rugova says compromise formula for ethnic Albanian government
</HEADLINE>
reached &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian
politician announced Wednesday that he had reached a compromise
with other Albanian leaders about formation of a coalition
government _ a major step toward peace talks with the Yugoslav
leadership.
	   Following a meeting with a European Union delegation, Ibrahim
Rugova said that a ``step forward has been accomplished and a
compromise'' within the all-Albanian leadership community, torn by
rifts on policies over negotiating with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We have achieved a compromise about the coalition
government,'' Rugoav said. He did not elaborate about what the
copromise entailed.
	   ``We plan to include all political forces in the coalition
government and will thus create pre-conditions for a dialogue in
this extremely difficult situation,'' he said. ``There is no other
way out of this situation except through dialogue,'' he added.
	   Rugova said the meeting with the European Union delegation was
of special significance in the moment when Kosovo is under a new
Serb offensive and when Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds are
under attacked.
	   ``We demand preventive measures from the EU, the U.S. and the
international community with the aim to stop the ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo, the refugee exodus and massacre of civilians,'' he said.

Thai finance minister agrees with Moody's review of Thai banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's finance minister said
Wednesday that U.S.-based Moody's Investor Services was correct in
reviewing whether the credit ratings of Thailand's top banks are
too high.
	   A Moody's statement earlier Wednesday, which said the long-term
credit ratings faced a possible downgrade, reflected a ``true
picture of the banking system,'' Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said.
	   Thailand's banking system is plagued by its own foreign currency
obligations and unrecoverable debt owed by failed real estate and
other companies.
	   The problems intensified when Thailand floated its currency, the
baht, last July and it began losing value. The country has been
mired in an economic crisis ever since.
	   The crisis helped topple the government of former Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh last November. When Moody's downgraded Thai
bank ratings last year, one of Chavalit's ministers, Samak
Sundaravej, threatened to send gangsters to visit Moody's auditors.
	   By contrast, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his financial
team, led by Tarrin, have pushed to reform the banking system and
cooperated with international financial agencies.
	   Markets were unmoved by Moody's statement early Wednesday, as
Thai financial institutions' problems have long been apparent.
	   Tarrin said the Moody's announcement should motivate Thailand to
speed up work on improving its banking sector.
	   He said the Finance Ministry is studying a project involving a
merger of weak financial institutions or their assets.
	   Thailand's central bank has taken over four commercial banks and
seven finance companies since the beginning of the year.
	   A final decision on re-privatizing the institutions has been put
off pending discussions with an International Monetary Fund team
due Aug. 3 for a quarterly review of a dlrs 17.2 billion economic
rescue program.
	   Tarrin said the merger project under consideration should lead
to increased confidence among foreign investors.
	   Analysts said that if weak institutions are joined in the strict
sense of the term ``merger,'' the result would be a larger weak
institution. But the government is also considering means of
relieving banks of their non-performing loans. Bad debt is expected
to peak at around 40 percent of total loans.

Symbolic vote goes lopsidedly against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with approval of preliminary measure, adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp slap at Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel's parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly gave
preliminary approval to a measure meant to help pave the way for
early elections.
	   By a lopsided vote of 60-6, lawmakers took the first step toward
approving a bill to dissolve the parliament _ a move that would be
tantamount to toppling the government.
	   But final passage of the measure was impossible on Wednesday,
the last working day before lawmakers' summer recess. To be
enacted, the measure would need committee approval and three more
parliamentary votes, procedures that would take weeks or months.
	   Even though it carried little actual legal weight, the vote was
viewed as a bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of
negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago and
fitful efforts to revive them have so far not succeeded.
	   In a raucous debate before the vote, Netanyahu denounced the
opposition party as elitist and the vote as an ``empty exercise.''
	   Leaders of Netanyahu's coalition had beforehand urged a boycott
of the vote, but some participated anyway.
	   The prime minister, who was jeered and heckled by lawmakers when
he began speaking, intoned a Hebrew prayer at one point, replete
with dramatic pauses.
	   He scolded members of the opposition Labor Party, telling them:
``You are so distant and so elitist.'' And he derided their chances
of passing the dissolution measure later. Final approval would
require 61 votes, a majority of the 120-seat parliament.
	   ``You are scared to go to elections, because you know full what
will hapen,'' Netanyahu said, addressing his opponents. ``The
people of this country prefer a government...that is really
fighting to bring peace and security to the people.''
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept an American-authored initiative calling
for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners all have different views on the
proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   The prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in
parliament, survived three opposition no-confidence motions on
Monday. On the eve of Wednesday's vote, he expressed unconcern.
	   Shai Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, told Army radio
beforehand that the vote was ``not meaningful.''

Baritone Matteo Manuguerra dies at age 73
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Matteo Manuguerra, a French baritone who flourished
in roles in the great French and Italian operas and was known for
his rich voice, has died of a heart attack. He was 73.
	   Manuguerra had been staying in the southern French city of
Montpellier when he died Thursday, the Le Monde newspaper reported
in its Tuesday edition.
	   Manuguerra crisscrossed the world in his long career, finally
settling with the Metropolitan Opera in 1971.
	   Born in Tunis in 1924, Manuguerra began his career in Buenos
Aires where he studied tenor with Umberto Landi.
	   In the 1960s, he sang with the Lyon Opera and later with the
Paris Opera, excelling in roles in Faust, Carmen, and La Traviata
among others before joining the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
	   Manuguerra participated in several recordings. His last was made
in 1997 when he sang the role of Iago in Othello.
	   No information was immediately available on survivors or funeral
plans.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen raised the stakes
in Cambodia's post-election turmoil Wednesday, saying that if his
opponents refuse to work with him, the current government he
dominates will stay in power indefinitely without them.
	   Hun Sen also said in an interview on Cambodian television he
would prefer a coalition with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom he
deposed as co-premier in a bloody coup last July, over the other
opposition chief, Sam Rainsy.
	   Should they boycott the National Assembly as threatened to
protest alleged electoral fraud giving Hun Sen's party victory in
Sunday's vote, Hun Sen said he would lower the constitutional
minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a government from
two-thirds to 50 percent plus one.
	   The opposition showed no sign of backing down. Leader Sam Rainsy
climbed a tree and spoke through a bullhorn to 1,500 cheering
supporters who had waited outside a hotel as he met representatives
of a dozen parties complaining of election irregularities.
	   ``Although we have diverging views among us, we have to struggle
together to get justice for Cambodia,'' Sam Rainsy cried.
	   The crowd, standing on cars and motorcycles to get a better
view, responded with shouts of ``Sam Rainsy!'' and ``Chai-yo!'' or
``Bravo!'' Police watched from a distance.
	   The crowd broke up without making a rumored march on the
headquarters of the National Election Committee, which is compiling
voting results. The slow release of results by the Hun Sen-packed
panel has raised fears of vote tampering.
	   Hun Sen's threats amount to brandishing a constitutional coup
following his bloody power grab last year to oust Ranariddh in
fighting that devastated parts of the capital.
	   The new disputes threaten to again plunge Cambodia into crisis
after 30 years of civil war and the Khmer Rouge genocide of the
1970s.
	   ``Anything that has the potential for creating political
instability is worrisome at this time,'' said Glenys Kinnock,
special representative for the European Union, the leading foreign
contributor to election expenses.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have complained of ballot tampering,
voter intimidation, missing ballots and other irregularities in the
elections and demand a recount and new voting in some areas.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party claims a landslide victory,
but those claims are being undermined by independent counts.
	   Hun Sen urged parties to honor the results: ``Winning or losing
is normal as far as democracy is concerned. No one wins all the
time.''
	   Ranariddh's party won U.N.-organized elections backed by 20,000
peacekepers in 1993. But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under
the Vietnamese military occupation that succeeded the Khmer Rouge,
forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening civil war.
	   The tense arrangement ended last year when Hun Sen called out
the army to depose the prince.
	   Hun Sen was to hold talks Wednesday with King Norodom Sihanouk,
the prince's father. The king's acceptance of any power arrangement
could be vital for Hun Sen to win international legitimacy and aid.
	   Asked if he thought the meeting was intended to pressure the
75-year-old monarch, Sam Rainsy said: ``Hun Sen threatens
everybody, not only the opposition. He threatens even the king to
impose his will.''
	   Partial election results released by Cambodia's top independent
monitoring group confirmed that Hun Sen's party had a lead over its
rivals, but less than the boasted landslide needed to dictate the
formation of a new government. Final results are expected Sunday.
	   Despite widespread pre-election violence, international
observers have generally endorsed the election as free and fair
enough to reflect the will of the Cambodian people. The verdicts
were issued before the results were known.

Symbolic vote goes lopsidedly against Netanyahu

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on breakdown of vote &QL;

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp slap at Prime Minister Benjamin

Austrian math and science teachers to spend year in New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QC; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Eckhard Savinc knows America only through
pictures and hasn't spoken English in nearly nine years. But the
young Austrian can teach math and physics. That won him a job
Wednesday in New York City.
	   Savinc, a 27-year-old native of Voelkermarkt in Austria's
southern Carinthia province, is among up to 30 Austrian teachers
hired this week to teach math, biology, chemistry and physics in
the New York City public school system.
	   ``We just cannot find teachers in math and science,'' said Caryl
Cohen, who recruits teachers for the system. Although the city
hired 8,000 new teachers last year, relatively few could teach math
and science.
	   The idea of recruiting teachers in Austria was the brainchild of
Alfred Posamentier, a math education professor from the City
University of New York who spent a year as a visiting professor at
Vienna University in 1990.
	   ``I kept hearing that `we (Austria) have out of work teachers,'
particularly in math and science,'' Posamentier said in an
interview.
	   Posamentier, whose Austrian Jewish grandparents died in the
Holocaust, organized the Austrian-American Educational Cooperation
Association and set up a series exchanges for teachers and school
board members between Vienna and New York.
	   When he heard that the New York school district needed math and
science teachers for the 1998-99 school year, he remembered the
Austrians.
	   On June 28, his association distributed brightly colored,
English language fliers in universities throughout Austria: ``If
you can read this, have we got a deal for you.''
	   Within two days, 300 people had called to inquire. Sixty of them
finally applied.
	   From this group, about half were selected through a series of
interviews, including a transatlantic video conference with school
board members in New York, who made the final selections.
	   The Austrians, hired on a one-year contract subject to renewal
to two years, will be placed in 30 different high schools across
New York's five boroughs, where they will teach a full six hours of
classes each day.
	   They will earn at least dlrs 30,000 a year _ more than they
could get in Austria outside of high-priced Vienna. Those with
advanced degrees will be paid slightly more.
	   To avoid immigration problems, the Austrians were officially
hired as ``researchers,'' meaning they do not have to get permanent
U.S. residence.
	   In addition to teaching, they must take two university courses _
one on American culture, life in the city and ``speaking New
York.'' and the other on American teaching methods.
	   ``You will learn quickly you don't have to stay in front of the
room the whole time,'' Posamentier told a group of applicants. This
is different from Austrian classrooms, where teachers traditionally
spend their time behind a desk at the front of the class.
	   The Austrian government's education ministry, which has endorsed
the recruiting program, hopes the teachers will return from New
York with new skills and teaching methods which might be useful in
Austrian high schools.
	   ``We are concentrating on teaching team work, communication and
presentation skills in the classroom,'' said Heidemarie Gluek,
spokeswoman for the ministry.
	   ``Also, there is a move towards bilingual education
(English-German) and to have math and science teachers who can
instruct these classes in English will be a huge asset,'' she
added.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of the militant pro-Iranian
Hezbollah group has been reelected as the party's secretary-general
for a third consecutive term, local newspapers said Wednesday.
	   As-Safir newspaper said the party's congress, which had been
convening for a month in a secret location in Beirut's southern
suburbs, held its final session Tuesday, extending Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah's term for another three years.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah's press office.
	   The party's charter, which limits the tenure of a
secretary-general to a maximum of two consecutive, three-year
terms, was amended to allow for Nasrallah's reelection, As-Safir
said in its front-page report.
	   Nasrallah's deputy, Sheikh Naim Kassem, party politburo chief
Mohammed Raad and key members of the party's seven-men Shura
Council, the ruling body, also retained their posts, As-Safir and
other newspapers said.
	   Nasrallah, 44, was elected Hezbollah's secretary-general for the
first time in February 1992, two days after his predecessor, Sheik
Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship ambush in
South Lebanon.
	   He is the party's third secretary-general since it was founded
in 1982.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the main guerrilla group fighting
to oust Israeli troops occupying parts of southern Lebanon.
	   The party under Nasrallah's leadership has also made significant
strides on the political front, with seven representatives in
Lebanon's 128-seat legislature. Hezbollah scored major gains in
municipal elections held recently across the country.

South Korea fines big businesses for illegal trade practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a move to force giant conglomerates
to clean up their financial books, a government watchdog slapped
five big businesses with dlrs 58 million in fines Wednesday for
illegally subsidizing weak subsidiaries.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has been urging the nation's chaebol, or
family-controlled conglomerates, to make their finances transparent
to build confidence in the Korean economy and woo back foreign
investors.
	   The conglomerates have been accused of paying little attention.
	   ``The penalties are a signal from the government that chaebol
should stop their abnormal internal dealings,'' said Chun
Yoon-chul, head of the Fair Trade Commission.
	   Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK conglomerates were accused
of funneling a total of dlrs 3.2 billion into 35 of their shaky
subsidiaries in the past year. Many of the subsidies were provided
illegally, Chun said.
	   The conglomerates did not immediately comment on the huge
penalties. By law, they can appeal the decision and if their appeal
is rejected they can take the commission to court.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's No. 1 conglomerate, was slapped with the
biggest penalty, dlrs 18 million. Hyundai Motor Co. bought bonds
issued by near bankrupt aluminum and furniture subsidiaries owned
by Hyundai, paying prices higher than market levels, Chun said.
	   SK was fined dlrs 15 million, Samsung dlrs 9 million, LG dlrs 8
million, and Daewoo dlrs 7 million.
	   Samsung, the No. 2 conglomerate, was accused of using its life
insurance company to deposit money in a local bank, which under a
secret deal bought bonds issued by financially weak Samsung
subsidiaries, paying more than market prices.
	   The trade commission said it was expanding its investigation to
other conglomerates.
	   Although long illegal, the practice of cross-funding
subsidiaries by conglomerates was condoned by the country's former
military rulers. The conglomerates used cross-funding and
cross-loan payment guarantees to fuel their rapid expansion.
	   It was difficult, if not impossible, to assess conglomerates'
financial status because they were not required to provide annual
consolidated financial statements audited by outside companies.
	   A typical chaebol is controlled by a single family and has 40 to
50 subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips to cars and
ships. As a group, the top 50 or so conglomerates have become so
powerful they have defied the efforts of past governments to break
them up.

Swedish Motors says dispute with Chrysler led to Thai lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The majority shareholder in the Thai
affiliate of U.S. automaker Chrysler Corp. said Wednesday a dispute
over an asset purchase agreement led to the breakdown of the joint
venture, which is being sued by 10 banks for unpaid loans.
	   A source at Swedish Motors Corp., which owns 70 percent of Thai
Chrysler Automotive Ltd., said it had been unable to accept the
terms of a proposal last March under which the U.S. car maker would
have assumed some of the debt of its insolvent affiliate.
	   The source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said
Chrysler had proposed to buy assets and assume a dlrs 40 million
loan on which its affiliate had defaulted. In return, Swedish Motor
would be required to take on all future liabilities.
	   ``Swedish Motor as a limited liability company had no legal
responsibility to assume any debts of Thai Chrysler,'' the source
said.
	   Bankers to Thai Chrysler have filed a lawsuit in Thailand
against the joint venture, demanding repayment of their share of
the dlrs 40 million loan on which the company defaulted following
the floating of Thailand's currency, the baht, last July. That
devaluation sparked the region's economic and financial crisis.
	   The source said that before the crisis, Chrysler had wanted to
buy a 100 percent stake in its Thai affiliate from Swedish Motors.
	   ``But as selected liabilities (including the dlrs 40 million
loan) grew in Thai baht terms, they found this undesirable,'' the
source said.

Symbolic vote goes lopsidedly against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with approval of preliminary measure, details on
breakdown of vote. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp slap at Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel's parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly gave
preliminary approval to a measure to help pave the way for early
elections.
	   By a lopsided vote of 60-6, lawmakers took the first step toward
dissolving the parliament _ a move that would be tantamount to
toppling the government.
	   But final passage of the measure was impossible on Wednesday,
the last working day before lawmakers' summer recess. To be
enacted, the measure would need committee approval and three more
parliamentary votes, procedures that would take weeks or months.
	   Even though it carried little actual legal weight, the vote was
a bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of negotiations
with the Palestinians. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down
16 months ago and fitful efforts to revive them have so far not
succeeded.
	   In brief but raucous debate before the vote, the prime minister
denounced the opposition party as elitist and the vote as an
``empty exercise.''
	   Leaders of Netanyahu's coalition had urged a boycott of the
vote, but some took part anyway _ and seven of them supported the
measure.
	   Those voting in favor included Dan Meridor, who quit as as
Netanyahu's finance minister last year and is widely viewed as a
potential challenger to lead Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   The prime minister, who was jeered and heckled by lawmakers when
he began speaking, intoned a Hebrew prayer at one point, replete
with dramatic pauses.
	   He scolded members of the opposition Labor Party, telling them:
``You are so distant and so elitist.'' And he derided their chances
of passing the dissolution measure later.
	   Final approval would require 61 votes, a majority of the
120-seat parliament _ only one more vote than Netanyahu's opponents
garnered on Wednesday.
	   ``You are scared to go to elections, because you know full what
will happen,'' Netanyahu said, addressing his opponents. ``The
people of this country prefer a government...that is really
fighting to bring peace and security to the people.''
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept an American-authored initiative calling
for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners all have different views on the
proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   The prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in
parliament, survived three opposition no-confidence motions on
Monday. On the eve of Wednesday's vote, he expressed unconcern.
	   Shai Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, told Army radio
beforehand that the vote was ``not meaningful.''

Vaccination campaign against hepatitis launched in flood areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ School children in areas hit by
floods last week will receive mandatory vaccinations against
hepatitis, CTK news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Kids between 3 and 15 years of age will be vaccinated in
selected villages by local doctors within two weeks starting
Monday.
	   The vaccination program is mandatory and the children's health
will be monitored for another month after the campaign ends, CTK
said.
	   Flash floods in the northeast of the Czech Republic came after
heavy rains swamped an area of about 100 square kilometers (40
square miles) Thursday, killing seven people.
	   In neighboring Slovakia, 36 people have been killed and up to 50
are missing following a sudden downpour last Monday that flooded
the Sabinov district in the eastern portion of the country.

European diplomats arrive in Kosovo after Serb battlefield gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Rugova saying he's reached
compromise on ethnic Albanian government, major step toward peace
talks; EDITS to conform. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's leading Albanian politician
said Wednesday he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, which would be a major step
toward peace talks on the future of the rebellious province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova gave no details of the compromise plan except to
say it would include ``all political forces'' and ``create
pre-conditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav
government.
	   He did not specify whether the coalition would include the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence and
which has rejected Rugova's leadership.
	   His announcement came on the heels of several Serb victories in
an offensive launched Friday night. Police and army troops have
managed to regain control of key areas of the province that had
been under rebel control, a development that may lead the rebels to
be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA posts of defense and interior _ meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Although Yugoslavia would likely not recognize Rugova's
``government,'' it could form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team
to negotiate the status of the province with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of American and European
diplomacy since Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown on Albanian
militants in February. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which
together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million-strong
population.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation, which arrived here in the
latest international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rochan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   ``Our message is very clear,'' delegation leader Rochan said
Wednesday. ``The violence has to stop immediately.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from its major central Kosovo
stronghold, Malisevo. In southwestern Kosovo, troops have
surrounded another KLA bastion, Junik, trapping about 1,000
fighters, according to the Serbs.
	   No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the past 10 days has increased to
at least 100,000 the number of civilians forced to flee their
homes, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.

Cargo handler says recovery program ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 6 with legislators approving own investigative
committee &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The main cargo handler at Hong Kong's troubled
airport increased shipments Wednesday, and said it was slightly
ahead of its schedule for returning to normal operations.
	   While airport officials managed to iron out most problems at the
passenger terminal shortly after the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok
airport opened July 6, cargo-handling has been a much tougher
problem.
	   A series of problems at its new terminal forced the main cargo
handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to limit imports and
exports, and to reopen some facilities at the old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   The government's secretary for economic services, Stephen Ip,
told legislators that small- and medium-size businesses will suffer
about 60 percent of the losses due to the cargo problems.
	   Some of them may face cash-flow problems, weakened bargaining
power or reduced competitiveness, he said.
	   Late Wednesday, legislators formally approved an independent
committee including prominent government critics to determine who
was responsible for problems at Chek Lap Kok. The 13-member
committee will work independently of the commission appointed by
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Both the government and the cargo handler have come in for
scathing criticism from legislators and businessmen who fear the
problems will further hurt Hong Kong's economy. Air cargo is an
important industry, and Hong Kong already is suffering from
recession and unemployment that has risen to a 15-year high of 4.5
percent.
	   Over the weekend, the cargo handler began accepting one pallet
of general cargo per passenger plane arriving at Chek Lap Kok. On
Wednesday, it began permitting two pallets.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of the cargo handler, said in
a statement that prior to the increase, it had averaged more than
2,700 tons of cargo a day for the previous seven days.
	   He said the company was making steady progress, and was slightly
ahead of schedule for a four-phase plan it announced earlier this
month.
	   The plan called for cargo handling to be at 75 percent of the
normal capacity of 4,000 tons a day by the end of July, using
facilities at both the old and new airports; full capacity using
both airports by mid-August; and 100 percent capacity using only
the new airport by the end of August.

ASEAN determined not to let haze cover Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Indonesian official criticizing U.N., U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Determined not to let dark haze
cover the upcoming Commonwealth Games, Southeast Asian nations
announced plans Wednesday to fight and prevent regional wildfires.
	   Meanwhile, a senior Indonesian official complained that the
United Nations Environmental Program and the United States still
had not delivered on promises to contribute a total of dlrs 16
million to fight fires in the region.
	   ``We're tired of empty promises,'' Effendy A. Sumardja,
Indonesia's assistant minister of environment, told the national
news agency Bernama. He said the U.N. agency had promised dlrs 10
million of the total.
	   He was among senior environment officials from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations meeting to prepare for the group's fifth
ministerial-level meeting on the haze Thursday.
	   ``The main thing we are all thinking about is the Commonwealth
Games,'' Cheah Kong Wai, secretary-general for Malaysia's
Environment Ministry, told reporters. ``It is very important for us
to ensure that the haze is not only prevented but controlled.''
	   Malaysia's preparations for the games, which begin in six weeks,
have included multibillion-dollar investments in sports arenas,
hotels and a still-unfinished light-rail train system. The event is
expected to boost tourism and draw more than 4,000 athletes from 68
countries.
	   ``Every ASEAN country member believes this is a matter of
working together,'' said Sumardja. ``We are trying to solve the
problem of forest fires happening.''
	   On Monday, Indonesia launched its first surveillance flight to
detect hot spots in Riau province on Sumatra Island, Sumardja said.
He added that 16 more flights were planned in the area,
concentrating on hot spots and plantations.
	   Funding for the plan came from the United Nations Environment
Program, which recently released a dlrs 30,000 disbursement of a
dlrs 750,000 fire fighting aid package.
	   Indonesia's government hopes to draw more financial support from
international donors, Sumardja said.
	   But in criticizing the U.N. agency and the United States, he
said, ``We cannot be overly dependent on foreign contributions.
This time we have to find our own resources.''
	   Ministers are expected to review progress reports Thursday on a
regional haze action plan, divided among the countries hardest hit
by last year's haze. Under the plan, Indonesia is responsible for
firefighting, Singapore for monitoring the fires and Malaysia for
preventing new blazes.
	   Uncontrollable wildfires in Indonesia last year wiped out more
than 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest and sent
choking smoke over neighboring countries from Singapore to Malaysia
and the Philippines.
	   Fires were exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which
halted regional rains and led to the worst drought in half a
century in parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei earlier this
year.
	   Recently, rains have returned to the region and doused the
majority of hot spots, Cheah said.
	   ``This will help us to put out the fires,'' said Cheah. ``We're
doing our best to make sure that the fires don't reappear.''

Reports: 15 killed in new Algeria violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ An armed group attacked an isolated
house full of civilians and then struck a military outpost, killing
at least 13 people, Algerian newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   In a separate incident, two members of an Islamic group were
killed Tuesday by Algerian security forces in a suburb of the
capital, Algeria media said.
	   The violence came as a U.N. delegation on a fact-finding mission
began the second week of its inquiry into the Islamic insurgency
that has left some 75,000 people dead in the last six years.
	   According to the Le Matin newspaper, six civilians were killed
early Tuesday when a group attacked an isolated house near El
Affroun-Mouzaia, a town about 30 kilometers southwest of Algiers.
	   Six people in the house were killed, the newspaper said. The
assailants then attacked a military post, killing three soldiers
and four volunteer defenders who had been armed by the government.
	   In a separate clash, two members of an Islamic group were killed
Tuesday by Algerian security forces in the Baraki neighborhood in
western Algiers.
	   Local hospitals confirmed the newspaper accounts.
	   The attacks occurred in an area where the Armed Islamic Group,
which opposes the current government, is known to be active.
	   It was attacks such as these that prompted the visit by a
six-member U.N. panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario
Soares.
	   The mission arrived a week ago for a visit expected to last
about two weeks.
	   The mission is looking into an Islamic insurgency that was
sparked in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary
elections an Islamic party was set to win.

First major business-labor accord on 35-hour work week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A business-labor accord to comply with a new
35-hour work week law drew protest from some unions Wednesday but
backing from conservatives for boosting overtime and allowing
flexible scheduling.
	   The agreement between the Union of Metallurgy and Mining
Industries and two labor unions Tuesday allows for a 35-hour work
week, but it permits weekly schedules of up to 48 hours to meet
demand.
	   As a result, the work week will remain at about 39 hours on
average. Annual overtime nearly doubles to 180 hours, up from the
existing 94, under terms of the agreement.
	   The accord leaves open the question of salaries, which must be
negotiated by company, management said.
	   The conservative daily Le Figaro called the agreement
management's ``first victory against the 35 hours'' and said it
increased flexibility in the workplace.
	   Among the unions that refused to sign, Robert Bonnand,
secretary-general of the metallurgy federation of the French Labor
Confederation (CFDT), called it ``a black Tuesday for cutting the
work week.''
	   The Communist-led General Labor Confederation (CFT) also refused
to sign. But the other leading union, Workers Force (FO), along
with the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) did.
	   Workers Force leader Marc Blondel stood by the accord, saying
that as part of the deal, management agreed to grant retirement
incentives to longtime employees and replace them with younger
hires.
	   If approved by the government, the accord would affect nearly 2
million workers, or about one French employee in 10, in the auto
industry, shipbuilding, aerospace, mining and steel.
	   The 35-hour work week, aimed at spreading jobs around to fight
double-digit unemployment, was a campaign plank for Socialist-led
government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin that came to power a
year ago. Workers are supposed to receive the same pay for fewer
hours.
	   The law was widely criticized by business, but Jospin has taken
a more pragmatic approach, saying it was a way to negotiate more
flexibility in rigid work laws.

Serb police storm hard-line radio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Serb police
stormed a local radio Wednesday, following the station's two-day
strike in protest against a government decision to sack hard-line
editors.
	   Police forces took over Radio Serb Sarajevo in the Bosnian Serb
stronghold of Pale, just east of Bosnia's capital Sarajevo, the
independent Belgrade-based Beta news agency reported.
	   In protest, the station employees switched off their
transmitters. Radio Serb Sarajevo is the main station controlled by
Bosnian Serb hard-liners, led by indicted war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic.
	   On Sunday, the pro-Western Bosnian Serb government demoted 16
chief editors of local radio and television stations, mostly in
hard-liners' strongholds in the Bosnian Serb half of the country.
	   The sacked editorial staff was replaced by government
confidants, a move which the government said was intended to
prevent the hard-liners from voicing their ``biased and incorrect
reporting'' ahead of Bosnia's September general elections.
	   Radio Serb Sarajevo employees banned the government's new
appointee from entering the premises Monday while police forces
prohibited the sacked editor from returning into the building.
	   The government's decision to dismiss 16 chief editors, 11 from
radio and five from local television stations, drew sharp criticism
from hard-liners. Several radio stations went off the air in
protest while others continued to operate under their previous
editorial staff.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin also made a
reference Tuesday to the dismissals.
	   ``It remains our view that the media throughout
Bosnia-Herzegovina, including in the Republika Srpska must be
pluralistic and adhere to democratic standards,'' Rubin said,
referring to the Bosnian Serb part of the country.
	   Top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Wesetendorp is due
to meet Thursday with Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic to
discuss the controversial decision.
	   Momcilo Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb member in the country's
tripartite presidency and a Plavsic opponent, called the move
``illegal, unconstitutional and undemocratic.''
	   He said the Plavsic government was ``stifling basic freedom of
the press.''
	   His hard-line supporters threatened to boycott Bosnia's
elections scheduled in mid-September if the government did not
suspend the demotions.
	   A deputy from Plavsic's party, the Serbian National Alliance,
defended the move and told The Associated Press on Wednesday that
the government wants to ``bring law and order into the media
domain.''
	   ``This is not about narrow-minded political interests, about
members of one party displacing members of another for political
gain,'' said Svetozar Mihajlovic.
	   The Bosnian Serb reformist government was elected last January,
replacing Karadzic loyalists.
	   Plavsic enjoys Western support and badly needed reconstruction
aid denied her hard-line predecessor, but on the local level, the
Bosnian Serb media have remained plagued by rifts between those
supporting her and those loyal to the hard-liners.

Gas blast in Moscow's apartment building kills at least two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least two people died and two others were
injured on Wednesday in the collapse of an apartment building
apparently caused by a gas blast, officials said.
	   The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) on
Sherbakovskaya Street in eastern Moscow, said Viktor Beltsov, a
spokesman for the Ministry for Emergency Situations.
	   Two entrances to the 10-story brick building were demolished
from top to bottom, and ruined apartments gaped wide open. Rescue
workers accompanied by sniffer dogs were clearing the debris
looking for more victims.
	   Thick police cordons surrounded the area and several ambulance
crews were waiting on the ground.

Report: Entrepreneur faces trial in China for e-mail accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in China have arrested a young
computer engineer for providing 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to
a U.S.-based Internet democracy magazine, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   Lin Hai, the 30-year-old founder and manager of a computer
software company in Shanghai, was arrested on charges of ``inciting
the overthrow of state power'' and will soon be tried, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Conviction generally carries a penalty of up to five years
imprisonment.
	   Lin's reported arrest highlights the government's determination
to prevent use of the Internet as a tool to challenge Communist
Party authority and to maintain strict control over information.
China now has more than 1 million Internet subscribers.
	   Spokesmen for the Shanghai court, the Shanghai procurators'
office and the Shanghai police said they did not know about the
case.
	   Police took Lin, a computer graduate from an aeronautics
technology university in Beijing, from his home on March 25 for
providing the addresses of 30,000 e-mail accounts in China to the
U.S-based electronic pro-democracy magazine ``Big Reference,'' the
Information Center said.
	   Lin was formally arrested April 30, the Hong Kong-based group
said. Prosecutors in Shanghai have completed the indictment against
him and plan to hand the case over shortly to the Shanghai
Intermediate People's Court for trial, the group said.
	   According to his wife, Xu Hong, Lin is being held in a Shanghai
police detention center and has already hired a lawyer for his
defense, the group said.

Pakistan proposes resumption of talks with India

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister offered
Wednesday to open formal talks to resolve differences with India,
just before meeting his Indian counterpart face-to-face for the
first time since each set off nuclear tests and stepped up a
regional arms race.
	   ``The inescapable reality that confronts us today is that South
Asia is now nuclearized,'' Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said at the opening of a seven-nation regional summit. ``It is for
us to steer away from the gathering storm.''
	   Sharif's offer appeared to be a promising start for his much
anticipated private talks, which began later Wednesday at a
seafront hotel with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The
session was intended to ease the tensions raised when each country
set off a series of underground nuclear explosions in May.
	   It also was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office in March,
pledging to step up the fight against what India calls a
Pakistan-backed insurgency by Muslim separatists in the Himalayan
border region of Kashmir. Pakistan denies active involvement but
gives diplomatic and political support to the militants.
	   Sharif suggested Wednesday that top foreign ministry officials
resume discussions that broke down in June 1997 about Kashmir, over
which India and Pakistan have fought two wars since they gained
indpendence from Britain in 1947.
	   ``Pakistan is ready for the immediate resumption of bilateral
foreign secretary level talks with India,'' Sharif said.
	   India's response was not immediately known, but Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee has said he also favors a dialogue.
	   ``We should seek what unites us and not duel on our divisions,''
Vajpayee said, speaking before Sharif at the opening of the South
Asia Association for Regional Cooperation summit.
	   Although the nuclear issue was not on the summit agenda,
Vajpayee addressed it in his speech, reasserting India's commitment
to a nuclear free world. India has said it will not give up its own
right to develop nuclear weapons unless all other countries do.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif talks on the sidelines also overshadowed the
broader summit topic of economic cooperation in South Asia, a
region that is home to one-fifth of humanity and 40 percent of its
poorest people.
	   The seaside capital of Sri Lanka also was partially shut down by
the police on guard against any attack by Tamil separatists, who
are fighting a 15-year-old war for independence in the north of
this Indian Ocean island.
	   The SAARC groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and the Maldives.
	   Other leaders also voiced concern over the rising threat from
India and Pakistan.
	   ``The recent nuclear tests in our region is a development that,
we all wish, could have been avoided,'' Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina of Bangladesh said. Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala spoke of ``the fear of an arms race in the region.''
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they were closely watching
the Colombo meeting. A high-level State Department delegation came
to the area last month to try to persuade India and Pakistan to
halt their nuclear programs and not to deploy nuclear weapons.

British cyclist pulled out of Tour de France due to drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British cyclist Graeme Obree, the former one-hour
world record-holder, says the sport is infested by drugs and a
``culture of the needle.''
	   In an interview in the Daily Express on Wednesday, Obree said he
withdrew from the 1995 Tour de France after another rider tried to
persuade him to use performance enhancing drugs.
	   He admitted the offer was tempting for a new professional but he
``stuck to my guns'' and later withdrew because he didn't have a
chance against the drug-users.
	   Obree's comments came as drug scandals continued to mar this
year's Tour de France, with leading teams, doctors and cyclists
either banned or under suspicion for doping.
	   Obree said, citing first-hand experience, that the use of
performance enhancing drugs in cycling was rife.
	   The 32-year-old Scottish rider was quoted as saying his career
was great until a rider ``came up to me to explain the facts of
life on the professional tour'' while he was in France.
	   He said the cyclist, who spoke good English, confirmed all the
rumors he had heard about ``the culture of the needle.''
	   ``I was to donate 2,000 pounds (dlrs 3,288) into a fund for
medical back-up as it was called,'' Obree said in the article.
	   ``That, I was told, was a bargain as the system was to have the
team pay another 6,000 pounds (dlrs 9,864) for each of the 17
riders on the payroll who chose to take up the scheme.
	   ``There was no question at all of what medical back-up was for.
We were soon discussing the drugs required and the main one was
EPO, Erythropoietin _ a type of growth hormone which stimulates the
production of red blood cells.''
	   ``The rider explained it was no big deal. It was the
professional way and when I explained I was worried about deaths
because of the way EPO thickens the blood, he said there were no
problems'' he added.
	   Obree said the cyclist explained that the doctors ``looked after
everything.''
	   ``(the doctors) supervised the whole process and that was why
the team owner needed to be paying for medical back-up, a real
euphemism,'' he said.
	   ``A drug that was undetectable, used extensively by some of
professionals and administered by proper doctors. If you didn't
have it, you would be going backwards.''
	   Obree, who estimates his decision not to ride the Tour de France
cost him about 90,000 pounds (dlrs 147,960) a year, said the sport
must be cleaned up.
	   ``I would have loved to have ridden in the Tour but I have no
regrets. I am sad for the riders, they are victims of their
psychological dependence on drugs.''
	   Obree set the one-hour record in 1993 with a distance of 51.596
kilometers, and again in 1994 with 52.713 kms.

Antic rejects Yugoslav coaching job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Former Atletico Madrid coach Radomir
Antic on Wednesday rejected an offer to become Yugoslavia's
national soccer team manager.
	   Antic, who was sacked by the Spanish first division team at the
end of this season, was offered the Yugoslav job to replace
Slobodan Santrac, who resigned following Yugoslavia's early exit
from the World Cup.
	   Yugoslavia lost 2-1 to the Netherlands in the round of 16
best-of-16 rounds and Santrac was bitterly criticized for his
defensive tactics.
	   After meeting Yugoslav soccer officials Wednesday, Antic said he
rejected the offer because he wants to return to Spain and search
for a new club.

Jordanians welcome King Hussein's assurances on cancer treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanians welcomed Wednesday King
Hussein's assurances that he will recover from lymphatic cancer.
	   ``Thank Almighty God that he looks fine,'' said Hassan Nasr
Yousef, a 28-year-old businessman. ``I understood that his
diagnosis is curable. I pray that God bring him back home safe and
fine.''
	   Hussein, 62, has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota since July 14. In an interview Tuesday with
Jordanian television, he said he has begun receiving chemotherapy
and expected to ``fully overcome this problem.''
	   ``My general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my
morale is high,'' he said in a strong voice.
	   A statement by Hussein's physicians Tuesday said they had
concluded that he was suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and ``this condition is highly
treatable with chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days over four to five
months.
	   The statement, released at the Mayo Clinic, said results of the
first cycle of chemotherapy ``are very encouraging.''
	   Hussein's physicians said he has B-cell lymphoma. A Mayo Clinic
spokeswoman declined to comment on what that means for Hussein's
prospects for treatment.
	   Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very
responsive to treatment and the 5-year survival rate is about 75
percent.
	   High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than 1 1/2 years if there
is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty to 80 percent of
sufferers enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.
	   Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne on Aug. 11, and about 90
percent of Jordan's 4 million people have known no other ruler.
	   ``I pray to God to guard his steps and return him home safe so
that the country continues to be safe and stable,'' said Wafa
Fraih, a 35-year-old nurse in Amman.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

European diplomats arrive in Kosovo after Serb battlefield gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Rugova saying he's reached
compromise on ethnic Albanian government, major step toward peace
talks; EDITS to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's leading Albanian politician
said Wednesday he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, which would be a major step
toward peace talks on the future of the rebellious province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova gave no details of the compromise plan except to
say it would include ``all political forces'' and ``create
preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav
government.
	   He did not specify whether the coalition would include the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence and
which has rejected Rugova's leadership.
	   His announcement followed several Serb victories in an offensive
launched Friday night. Police and army troops have managed to
regain control of key areas of the province that had been under
rebel control, a development that may lead the rebels to be more
amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA posts of defense and interior _ meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Although Yugoslavia would likely not recognize Rugova's
``government,'' it could form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team
to negotiate the status of the province with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of American and European
diplomacy since Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown on Albanian
militants in February. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which
together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million residents.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation, which arrived here in the
latest international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rochan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   ``Our message is very clear,'' delegation leader Rochan said
Wednesday. ``The violence has to stop immediately.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from its major central Kosovo
stronghold, Malisevo. In southwestern Kosovo, troops have
surrounded another KLA bastion, Junik, trapping about 1,000
fighters, according to the Serbs.
	   No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the past 10 days has increased to
at least 100,000 the number of civilians forced to flee their
homes, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.

German man convicted of rape, incest given five year term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FULDA, Germany (AP) _ A state court on Wednesday convicted a
66-year-old German man of raping his daughter and of incest over an
11-year period and sentenced him to five years in prison.
	   The court said the man was guilty of raping his then 17-year-old
daughter starting in 1984 and impregnating her six times through
1995.
	   According to the court, one baby was aborted, two were given up
for adoption, and three continued to live with the daughter who was
virtually held captive at home by her father.
	   In 1996, at age 29, the daughter managed to flee her father and
eventually reported her situation to a social worker, who alerted
prosecutors.
	   To register the children over the years, the daughter had
claimed they resulted from short-term affairs with different men,
the court said.

Report: Premier League issues ultimatum to Man U, Arsenal,
</HEADLINE>
Liverpool

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Premier League has reportedly given
Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool a deadline to confirm in
writing that they are not interested in joining a European Super
League. Otherwise, they could face legal action.
	   The move comes amid speculation in Germany, Italy and England
that Europe's top clubs, targeted by major marketing companies,
have met privately to discuss forming a league in the year 2000 and
breaking away from UEFA's Champions Cup competition.
	   The tabloid Sun reported that the Premier League has requested
all three clubs, who have previously denied any involvement in any
potential breakaway, to make their intentions clear in writing by 5
p.m. Wednesday (1600 GMT). A court injunction could follow if they
refuse to agree.
	   According to reports, if any English club joined a Super League,
they would be breaking the rules of the domestic soccer
association. The rules prohibit clubs from playing in any
professional competitions not recognized by their domestic League
and Football Association.
	   A Premier League spokesman declined to say whether it had issued
the ultimatum but admitted it wanted the clubs to say No to the
concept of a Super League.
	   ``Our clubs have read a lot about a Super League, much of which
is speculation,'' said the spokesman, who declined to be
identified.
	   ``While we believe that the present structure is working well,
it is only sensible that we, as other leagues and UEFA are doing,
clarify what _ if any _ proposals exist concerning a Super
League.''
	   UEFA, soccer's governing body in Europe, has asked member
associations to contact its leading clubs to find out if a rival
Super League is being proposed.
	   Speculation has been around for more than a decade that the top
teams would get together in their own league and UEFA has taken
steps to strengthen its own competitions to keep them more
attractive to the big clubs.
	   It created a league system within the champions Cup so that the
leading eight clubs go automatically into the last 24 and play in
groups before reverting to the knockout formula from the
quarterfinal onwards.
	   It has even changed the group format from six groups of four to
four groups of six next season so that the clubs will gain higher
revenue from more games.

Jane's: Myanmar operating signals intelligence stations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar is operating a major signals intelligence
station at its embassy in Bangkok and has similar capabilities in
Bangladesh and at least one other overseas diplomatic mission,
Jane's Defense Weekly reported Wednesday.
	   The station's main targets include international telephone
conversations, facsimile traffic, satellite-telephone
transmissions, E-mail messages on the Internet and radio
broadcasts, the respected military magazine said.
	   The Bangkok station, controlled by the Directorate of Defense
Services Intelligence, is located in a compound housing the office
of Myanmar's military, naval and air attaches in the diplomatic
district, Jane's said.
	   There are at least nine antennas on the roof of a five-storey
apartment-style building in the compound, most of them probably
ordinary TV antennas, a high-frequency system and two satellite
communications dishes, the magazine said. It published photographs
of two satellite dishes and an aerial which it said appears to be a
high-frequence mast.
	   The high-frequency antenna allows the Bangkok station to monitor
short-wave or high-frequency radio broadcasts and the satellite
dishes are used to monitor international telecommunications in
Bangkok and the surrounding area, Jane's said.
	   The magazine quoted sources familiar with the intelligence
directorate's operations as saying Myanmar installed a similar
system in neighboring Bangladesh. The location of a third signals
intelligence station isn't known with certainty but some sources
suspect it may be in Vientiane, Laos, Jane's said.
	   Myanmar's current military regime came to power in 1988 after
violently crushing a nationwide democracy uprising. It ignored the
results of a 1990 landslide election victory by the National League
for Democracy, the political party headed by Nobel Peace Prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

Angolan gov't reports more rebel attacks; rebels say peace close to
</HEADLINE>
collapse &QL; 
 &UR; CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government Wednesday reported new
attacks on outlying towns by the former rebel movement UNITA while
the guerrillas warned that the country's four-year-old peace
process was on the verge of collapse.
	   ``The peace in Angola is hanging by a thread,'' UNITA official
Rui Oliveira said, referring to the deepening tension between the
former foes which threatens to undermine their 1994 peace deal.
	   The government claims UNITA has killed hundreds of civilians and
police in attacks in recent months, including the massacre of some
200 people last week, while the rebels allege that police have
tortured and murdered their supporters.
	   There was no independent verification of the charges which have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA forces occupied two villages in Cuanza Sul province, 250
kilometers (155 miles) south of Luanda over the past 48 hours,
state radio RNA reported, citing unidentified government sources.
	   UNITA had last year handed back control of the towns to the
government as part of the United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
	   Jonas Savimbi's rebels, regarded as one of Africa's strongest
guerrilla forces, seized more than half of the country during the
war.
	   Stated radio said the rebels were gathering for an attack on the
nearby strategic town of Mussende which lies on a main road leading
to Luanda from the south.
	   Meanwhile Oliveira, a UNITA official resident in Lisbon, said
the group's supporters had reported a massive government troop
build-up in Huambo province, 560 kilometers (350 miles) south of
the capital, within striking distance of UNITA's remaining central
highland strongholds where its leadership is based.
	   He denied the government reports of UNITA attacks.
	   Oliveira complained that the European Union sanctions against
his movement, announced Tuesday, were ``unfair'' and further
undermined the peace process.
	   ``The international community is biased against UNITA and is in
fact giving the government a carte blanche to launch an attack
against us,'' Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   The EU sanctions included restrictions on UNITA's diamond sales,
which nets the movement hundreds of millions of dollars annually,
and a freeze of its bank accounts.
	   The U.N. passed similar sanctions earlier this year.
	   Oliveira alleged the army and police had committed human rights
abuse in areas returned to government control but had gone
unpunished.

Jordanians welcome King Hussein's assurances on cancer treatment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanians welcomed Wednesday King
Hussein's assurances that he will recover from lymphatic cancer.
	   ``Thank Almighty God that he looks fine,'' said Hassan Nasr
Yousef, a 28-year-old businessman. ``I understood that his
diagnosis is curable. I pray that God bring him back home safe and
fine.''
	   Hussein, 62, has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota since July 14. In an interview Tuesday with
Jordanian television, he said he has begun receiving chemotherapy
and expected to ``fully overcome this problem.''
	   ``My general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my
morale is high,'' he said in a strong voice.
	   Hussein's physicians said Tuesday that they had concluded that
he was suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or cancer of the
lymphatic tissue, and ``this condition is highly treatable with
chemotherapy.''
	   It said Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days over four to five
months.
	   The statement, released at the Mayo Clinic, said results of the
first cycle of chemotherapy ``are very encouraging.''
	   Hussein's physicians said he has B-cell lymphoma. A Mayo Clinic
spokeswoman declined to comment on what that means for Hussein's
prospects for treatment.
	   Low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very
responsive to treatment and the 5-year survival rate is about 75
percent.
	   High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than 1 1/2 years if there
is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty to 80 percent of
patients enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.
	   Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne on Aug. 11, and about 90
percent of Jordan's 4 million people have known no other ruler.
	   ``I pray to God to guard his steps and return him home safe so
that the country continues to be safe and stable,'' said Wafa
Fraih, a 35-year-old nurse in Amman.
	   Hussein underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular medical
checkups at the clinic since.
	   He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph
gland that was found to be benign. In April 1997, he had surgery
for an enlarged prostate that also was benign.

Sudan to try el-Mahdi on charges of anti-government activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A military tribunal will try in absentia
Sudan's most prominent pro-democracy advocate on charges of
conspiring to topple the government, local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   The tribunal sent summonses to former Prime Minister Sadiq
el-Mahdi, who lives in exile in Eritrea, his son and 14 other
opposition members ordering them to appear in court on Saturday,
the Akhbar al-Saa and other newspapers said.
	   They are charged with conspiring and attempting to wage war
against the state, possession of weapons and undermining public
order and security. It was not clear what punishments these charges
attract.
	   An aide to el-Mahdi in Cairo rejected the charges and said he
has no intention of handing himself over to the court.
	   El-Mahdi was the elected prime minister of Sudan when the army
supported by an Islamic party toppled his government in 1989 and
replaced it with an Islamic oriented regime headed by President
Omar el-Bashir.
	   El-Mahdi fled Sudan in December 1996 to Eritrea by donning
horse-riding gear and tricking security men into thinking he was
going out for a ride.
	   The summonses, signed by the head of the court, Brig. Osman
Khalifa Mohammed, said that el-Mahdi and the others will be tried
in absentia if they do not appear before the court.
	   The newspapers did not say how or where the summonses were
served.
	   In June, the government accused opposition leaders abroad of
planting bombs at several sites in Khartoum, set to explode during
the celebrations for the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military
coup.
	   Some twenty people were arrested and accused of participating in
placing the bombs, which did not explode.
	   In another development, the government accused neighboring
Eritrea of launching an attack against its forces on the borders.
	   A military statement Wednesday said the Eritreans attacked the
Sudanese forces with heavy artillery and rockets. There were no
reports of casualties on both sides.
	   El-Mahdi's Umma Party has joined hands with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, in a larger opposition
alliance-in-exile against el-Bashir's government.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the southern districts, which are predominantly Christian and
animist, and resent the authority of the Islamist north.

EU Commission calls for duties on cotton imports from five
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission proposed
Wednesday to slap five-year anti-dumping duties on imports of
unbleached cotton fabrics from China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and
Pakistan.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive arm, called for a five-year
extension of duties imposed in April on these countries for a
six-month period.
	   The proposal must be approved by EU ministers by October 9,
Commission spokesman Nigel Gardner said. Once approved, it would go
into effect immediately.
	   The Commission proposed at the same time to end anti-dumping
duties imposed in April on imports of unbleached cotton fabrics
from Turkey.
	   ``There is no evidence of injury from Turkish exports of
unbleached cotton fabrics into the EU,'' said Gardner. He said
Turkey represents only 2.3 percent of imports of raw cotton into
the 15-nation bloc.
	   The Commission said it will urge unbleached cotton fabric
producers in China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Pakistan to respect
minimum EU prices in return for exemptions from the planned
five-year duties.
	   In addition, it proposed that five-year duties on products not
covered by any minimum price commitments be lower than those
imposed in April.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A prominent Romanian journalist, who
was arrested in 1989 revolution has died, officials said Wednesday.
He was 60 years old.
	   Anton Uncu, died in hospital Tuesday of cerebral congestion,
press officials said Wednesday.
	   Uncu worked for various Romanian newspapers, including Libera,
Magazin, Momentul and Informatia Bucurestiului and Curentul, where
he was editor-in-chief.
	   In January 1989, Uncu was one of four journalists arrested in by
the former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's secret police for
publishing an anti-Communist manifesto. He remained in prison until
Ceausescu was killed the revolt the following December.
	   ``His work of three decades made him one of the most appreciated
Romanian journalists after the World War II,'' Gabriel Hizo, a
colleague at Curentul daily said.
	   Uncu is to be buried Thursday, no further funeral arrangements
were announced.
	   He is survived by his wife and a son.

Chechen officials detain Japanese man, keep him in custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with officials confirming Japanese man's
arrest, saying he's still in custody, details, CORRECTS spelling of
minister's name. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police have arrested and jailed a
Japanese man for nearly two weeks on charges of illegally entering
the separatist republic, an official said Wednesday.
	   Chechnya's deputy security minister Khizir Mezhiyev said the
Japanese national, whom he refused to identify, was detained by
police near the Chechen town of Gudermes on July 16.
	   During a search, police found him carrying a large amount of
currency from 12 different countries, including U.S. dlrs 40,000 in
cash.
	   The man was moved to the Chechen capital, Grozny, and put in
jail pending the results of the investigation, Mezhiyev told The
Associated Press. He's accused of illegally crossing into Chechnya
and contacting local mobsters.
	   Investigators believe that the Japanese man traveled to Chechnya
in order to stage his own kidnapping and keep part of the expected
ransom, Mezhiyev said. He refused to identify the man's suspected
accomplices.
	   Mezhiyev said the man drove over 11,000 kilometers (nearly 7,000
miles) westward from Asia all across Russia to reach Chechnya.
	   Mezhiyev's was one of several versions of the incident.
	   The Interfax news agency said he was expelled from Chechnya in
recent days for taking pictures of ``secret facilities.'' Interfax
identified him as Yoshikama Mumora.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency gave a similar account, but gave his
name as Mumoto Ishikama and said he had dlrs 50,000 in cash.
	   Both agencies quoted unidentified Chechen government officials.
	   Mairbek Vachagayev, a spokesman for Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov, said he was unaware of any Japanese man detained in the
republic, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Embassy in Moscow were
checking the report, it said.
	   Since the end of the 1994-96 war with Russia, Chechen officials
have been unable to contain a tide of crime in which dozens of
Russians and foreigners have been kidnapped by gangs seeking
ransom.
	   Chechnya has become increasingly tense in recent weeks, as
Maskhadov's government began a crackdown on the Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect blamed for many abductions and attacks.
	   However, Maskhadov has lifted a state of emergency he imposed
more than a month ago to rein in Wahhabis and other militant
groups.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian forces withdrew. But Moscow and the rest
of the world still consider the republic part of Russia.

Japan's Miyazawa accepts offer to serve as finance chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Miyazawa saying he will accept finance
minister's job &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former prime minister known as an economics
expert agreed Wednesday to serve as Japan's finance chief, boosting
incoming premier Keizo Obuchi's efforts to put together a Cabinet
that can pull the country out of recession.
	   Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, leader of one of the largest factions in
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, met with Obuchi Wednesday
afternoon and told reporters later he would take the job, despite
worries about his age.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi said.
	   The 61-year-old Obuchi, who last week was voted LDP president,
is nearly certain to be elected prime minister when Parliament
convenes Thursday since the party has a comfortable majority in the
more powerful lower house.
	   The incoming premier said he is depending on Miyazawa to lead a
clean-up of Japan's troubled financial sector, which is weighed
down by loads of bad debt left over from the collapse of the real
estate market in the early 1990s.
	   ``He has a deep understanding of the problem and is trusted
internationally,'' Obuchi said.
	   Miyazawa, who has held the key portfolio once before, speaks
fluent English and is well known internationally, which could help
him present Japan's policies abroad. The yen rose against the U.S.
dollar Wednesday when it looked like he would take the job.
	   Obuchi has pledged to put together an ``economic reform
Cabinet'' and to appoint a political heavyweight as finance
minister to lead Japan out of its worst recession since World War
II.
	   Miyazawa served as finance minister during the ``bubble
economy'' of runaway stock and real estate prices before resigning
in 1988 amid accusations he accepted shares from Recruit Co. in
exchange for political favors. He was never found guilty of any
wrongdoing.
	   He became prime minister in 1991 but resigned when the LDP was
defeated in lower house elections in 1993, losing its grip on power
for the first time in 38 years.
	   Since then, he has quietly exercised power in the ruling party
as head of the LDP's third largest intra-party group.
	   Miyazawa was one of the architects of the plan drafted under
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to fix the banking
system.
	   Analysts doubted whether a man who had helped draft the current
measures would push for the bolder steps they say are needed to get
Japan's economy back on track.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is going to clean up, or radically
change the system. He is the ultimate insider,'' he said.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief Cabinet secretary, newspapers said
Wednesday. The secretary functions as chief of staff and spokesman
for the prime minister.
	   Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, was chosen as
minister of international trade and industry while State Foreign
Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, was asked to replace Obuchi as
foreign minister.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, a writer, was chosen as director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency. Sakaiya, also a former trade ministry
official, has written that despite their material riches, many
Japanese are dissatisfied with their work and with society.
	   Formal appointments are expected to be made Thursday.
	   The only glitch in Obuchi's march to the prime minister's spot
appeared to be the LDP's weakness in the upper house, where the
party suffered a humiliating setback in July 12 elections.
	   The Yomiuri reported Wednesday that the upper house, where the
LDP does not have a majority, may vote to elect popular opposition
leader Naoto Kan as prime minister.
	   The move would be largely symbolic, however, since the
constitution gives the lower house the power to overrule the upper
house in the election.

	   DORTMUND, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund, a former Champions
Cup winner and one of the leading German clubs, on Wednesday signed
Brazilian midfielder Dede from Atletico Mineiro.

Rwanda disputes Conglese claim on troop expulsion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda is pulling its troops out of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and not the other way around, a
military spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said a statement on Congolese television
Monday that Kinshasa had ordered all Rwandan troops out of the
central African nation had surprised him.
	   He said it was Rwanda who had made the irreversible decision to
recall more than 100 officers and troops, including Col. James
Kabari, a Rwandan who had served as interim Congolese chief of
staff.
	   ``The Congolese leaders wanted us to stay,'' Ndahiro said. ``We
wanted to leave it to the Congo to sort out their own problems.''
	   The Rwandan Patriotic Army played a decisive role in the
eight-month rebellion in the former Zaire that ousted longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 and brought Congolese Laurent
Kabila to power.
	   Several months after the fact, Rwandan Defense Minister Maj.
Gen. Paul Kagame acknowledged the role of the RPA in the rebellion
and said some officers and troops would remain in Congo to help the
new army get on its feet.
	   ``One year was enough to give them internal capacity to deal
with training and discipline,'' Ndahiro said. ``Our job was done.''
	   Kabila's ties with Rwanda and Uganda, which had also helped his
rebel alliance, have been gradually deteriorating. Disputes have
flared over the way Kabila manages the vast country he re-named
Congo, and Hutu rebels continue to use bases in eastern Congo to
launch attacks inside Rwanda.
	   Tensions have also escalated between Tutsi officers from Rwanda
and eastern Congo Rwanda and members of the new Congolese army from
other tribes.
	   Ndahiro said the Congolese particularly objected to the
departure of Kabari, who until last month served as interim
Congolese army chief of staff. He was replaced by Celestin Kifwa, a
Luba like Kabila from southeastern Katanga province, and named an
advisor to the president.
	   Ndahiro said Kabari will soon be returning to Rwanda.
	   ``They wanted to make us scapegoats because they didn't like our
decision to leave,'' he said. ``They are playing their own game,
and we will not be dragged into internal affairs of Congo.''
	   Ndahiro said despite the disagreements, he hoped the Congolese
and Rwandan armies would continue to cooperate in maintaining and
upgrading security along their long and volatile common border.
	   The eastern Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu are
bases for several rebel groups fighting the governments of Rwanda,
Uganda and Burundi.
	   ``It is in our interest, and it is in their interest,'' Ndahiro
said. ``We shall have to persuade them to cooperate.''
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels have been operating in the region in an
attempt to destabilize northwestern Rwanda since Tutsi-led rebels
ousted a Hutu government in July 1994, ending the slaughter of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The rebels are mostly former government soldiers and militiamen
who participated in the 1994 genocide.

Myanmar rejects request for U.S., Japan diplomats to meet Suu Kyi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new details throughout &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In an unusual public scolding,
Western officials expressed deep displeasure to Myanmar's foreign
minister Wednesday over his country's refusal to let diplomats
visit opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent a sixth day in
her car at a police roadblock.
	   ``It's unbearable and regrettable,'' Wolfgang Schuessel,
president of the EU Council, told a news conference as Myanmar
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw listened several seats away. ``This
response is not satisfactory.''
	   Ohn Gyaw had told the news conference that his country's
military government would not allow the diplomats to visit Suu Kyi
at the roadblock on a highway outside the capital.
	   ``At this juncture the meeting is not urgently needed,'' Ohn
Gyaw said. ``We have our ways to deal with the impasse.''
	   The news conference came at the end of several days of meetings
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other Asian
and Western countries on security and other issues.
	   During a break in the sessions Tuesday, seven foreign ministers
met with Ohn Gyaw to press concerns about human rights and ask that
the Japanese ambassador and the U.S. charges d'affaires in Myanmar
be allowed to visit Suu Kyi.
	   The opposition leader was stopped by police last Friday as she
traveled by car to meet with members of her party, the National
League for Democracy. The party said her car was blocked by barbed
wire, sandbags and soldiers.
	   Two doctors who examined her Tuesday in her car found she was
showing signs of dehydration, the party said.
	   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer, sitting next to Ohn Gyaw at the news conference
and looking at him as he spoke. He said another attempt would be
made Wednesday to get permission for Western diplomats to see Suu
Kyi.
	   ``I'm not very hopeful that we will be able to meet with her,''
Downer said. ``Her doctor said her blood pressure is falling, and
she's not so well.''
	   Ohn Gyaw said the government had arranged for food to be taken
to Suu Kyi and that an ambulance was standing by. Party members,
however, said she would not use it.
	   Schuessel said the pressure placed on Myanmar during Tuesday's
meeting _ which included ministers from New Zealand, Australia,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the United
States _ and in Wednesday's news conference was unprecedented.
	   ``I think they have never seen that before _ such strong
pressure from the world,'' he said. ``We're able and willing to do
our utmost to solve the crisis.''
	   The government in Myanmar has accused Suu Kyi of staging a
publicity stunt to draw attention during the ASEAN meetings in
Manila. Ohn Gyaw told the news conference that Suu Kyi had left the
capital without saying where she was going.
	   Myanmar was accepted as a member by ASEAN last year despite
opposition from Western nations and from Suu Kyi, who said the
military government should be pressured, not embraced.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who left Manila
Wednesday morning after attending the meetings, said the United
States would hold the Myanmar military responsible for the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright said.

Pro-democracy student leader says he was beaten, detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A student leader said Wednesday he was
beaten and detained by security men to prevent him from speaking at
a pro-democracy rally at Tehran University.
	   Manouchehr Mohammadi said he was kicked and punched by five
intelligence agents and university guards Tuesday, and then hauled
away to the police station where he was held for five hours.
	   ``They let me go ... and then warned me not to tell anyone about
it,'' said Mohammadi who had cuts and bruises on his neck, but was
otherwise all right.
	   Police prevented students who are seeking democratic reforms in
Iran from staging a rally on Tuesday, the latest incident in a
deepening power struggle between moderates and hard-liners in the
country.
	   A half-dozen students _ apparently an advance team _ stood
outside the Tehran University gate for an hour before they were
ordered away by police.
	   Mohammadi said he had gone to the university several hours
before the planned rally and had tried to sneak in. He was to be
the main speaker.
	   ``I couldn't get in, because they stopped me at the gate, then
called some people who started to beat me. They said they would
never let me speak because all I wanted to do was deceive other
students,'' Mohammadi told The Associated Press.
	   Tensions have been high in Iran amid a growing confrontation
between reformist President Mohammad Khatami and religious
hard-liners determined to keep their grip on power.
	   Khatami has promised to protect free speech and individual
rights, but pro-democracy rallies in recent months have been
violently disrupted by Islamic militants allied with the
hard-liners.
	   ``This time, instead of unleashing the militants, they (the
hard-liners) stopped us through the university authorities and
police,'' said Mohammadi.
	   He was also beaten by Islamic militants during another rally in
May.

Indonesian rights group urges military to clear up missing
</HEADLINE>
activists case &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group urged the
military Wednesday to speed up an investigation into the
whereabouts of 14 political activists believed kidnapped by elite
troops.
	   The pro-democracy activists were abducted while authoritarian
President Suharto, who quit in May following riots and student
protests, was still in power. Suharto often treated his opponents
harshly, jailing and muzzling many.
	   Under his reform-minded successor, B.J. Habibie, the military
has acknowledged that officers of Indonesia's special forces, known
as Kopassus, were involved in kidnappings. Eleven soldiers have
been arrested and face trial in a military court.
	   But Munir, a lawyer of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, said
14 of at least 23 activists kidnapped since last year have yet to
appear. The families of the missing visit him daily to seek
information, he said.
	   Military police have said they believed the missing activists
were being held by Kopassus troops in a military complex on the
outskirts of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. But when
investigators arrived at the complex, the activists were no longer
there.
	   Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, was chief of
Kopassus when the abductions occurred and has said he is ready to
take responsibility if it is proved the unit was involved.
	   Human rights activists say the military should investigate
whether Prabowo and other high-ranking officers ordered the
kidnappings.
	   Some activists who were released have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Andi Arief, an activist who was kidnapped and released this
month, said he believes the missing opponents of the government
were tortured and may have died in captivity.

Lightning kills farmer, injures his wife and daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A sudden lightening storm killed a man
and injured his wife and daughter, when a bolt struck them as the
worked in their potato field, a police official said Wednesday.
	   Ferenc Dobo, 74, died almost instantly when lightening struck
the family's vegetable plot outside the village of Morahalom late
Tuesday, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Budapest, said
Ibolya Szeged, a spokesman for the Csongrad County police.
	   Szegedi said Dobo was holding a metal rake, which may have
attracted the lightning.
	   ``They were picking potatoes when the storm caught them by
surprise. They were thrown up into the air by the explosive force
of the lightning and landed two meters (yards) away,'' Szegedi
said. Szegedi said that Dobo had held a metal rake, which may have
attracted the lightning.
	   Dobo's wife and daughter were treated for burns in the local
hospital, then released.

Profits slip as BAT Industries pays tobacco settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Style on Brown and Williamson, 4th graf, uses ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Quarterly profits at BAT Industries PLC fell 25
percent to 490 million pounds (dlrs 803 million) as the cigarette
and insurance group paid out millions to settle tobacco litigation
in Minnesota, the company said Wednesday.
	   The pre-tax earnings for the three months ending June 30
compared with profits of 656 million pounds in the same period a
year earlier.
	   Quarterly revenues came to 6.35 billion pounds (dlrs 10.41
billion) at BAT, which soon will separate into two companies, one
handling the tobacco and the other handling financial services
including insurance. Revenues were 5.81 billion pounds in the same
period a year earlier.
	   BAT's results were hurt by 152 million pounds (dlrs 249 million)
that its subsidiary Brown and Williamson had to pay in a Minnesota
tobacco case. But the company received a one-time gain of 78
million pounds (dlrs 128 million) as it was able to recover sales
taxes that were at issue in a Brazilian case.
	   For the first six months of its fiscal year, BAT reported
pre-tax profits of 1.06 billion pounds (dlrs 1.74 billion),
compared with earnings of 1.24 billion pounds in the same period of
1997.
	   Half-year revenues came to 12.63 billion pounds (dlrs 20.69
billion), compared with 11.48 billion pounds a year earlier.
	   BAT has announced plans to spin off its financial services
businesses and merge them with Switzerland's Zurich Group, creating
a new company called Zurich Financial Services.
	   The deal, expected to be completed in about two months, will
give BAT shareholders stakes in two companies: British American
Tobacco, with the tobacco interests; and Allied Zurich, which will
hold 43 percent of Zurich Financial Services.

Stewards at center of controversial British GP resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The three stewards who officiated the recent
British Grand Prix quit international auto racing Wednesday as the
governing body FIA introduced new rules designed to prevent a
repeat of the controversial race.
	   At an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council,
FIA's policy-making arm, in Paris, stewards Nazir Hoosein of India,
Roger Peart of Canada and Howard Lapsley of Great Britain
voluntarily returned their FIA licenses, meaning that they are no
longer entitled to officiate FIA events.
	   They will be able to reapply for the licenses in future, FIA
officials said.
	   The Paris meeting was held in the aftermath of the bizarre
ending to the July 12 British Grand Prix, held at Silverstone.
	   At the race, Michael Schumacher's Ferrari, leading by more than
20 seconds, crossed the finish line first driving down the pit lane
rather than on the track, to take a 10-second penalty incurred
earlier in the race.
	   McLaren, for whom Finland's Mika Hakkinen came in second,
protested but lost. On Tuesday, the International Court of Appeal
upheld the original decision of the stewards.
	   Though the stewards recognized that they had made errors, FIA
president Max Mosley, speaking at a news conference, was quick to
defend them.
	   ``At the meeting we realized that the procedures at Silverstone
were wrong, not the people,'' he said.
	   ``The stewards each had 30 years of experience at different
levels of the sport,'' he said. ``They were under enormous
pressure. The weather was very bad and dangerous. They had to make
a lot of difficult decisions that were a matter of life and
death.''
	   Still, FIA said that the race officials made three key errors:
incorrectly treating information from the race director as though
it was a formal request; not taking account of the time of the
incident; and not communicating their decision, once it was made,
to the race director on time.
	   Having re-examined the race, the stewards also agreed that they
were, in any case, wrong to have imposed the penalty on Ferrari.
	   FIA announced procedural changes designed to reduce the
administrative workload of stewards at future Grand Prix races:
contacts between the race director and stewards must be made
directly to the chief steward; stewards can only impose a penalty
after a written request from the race director that includes the
time and nature of an incident and the lap; the race director must
suggest a penalty after incidents; and, once a decision is made,
the race director must ensure that it appears on TV monitors as
soon as possible.

Note from dead wife frees husband imprisoned for her murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police, prosecutors and a jury didn't believe Ryan
James when he claimed that his wife killed herself and made it look
like murder.
	   But the Court of Appeal believed her own words, left in a brief,
cryptic note to her husband, and freed him from prison by quashing
his conviction Tuesday.
	   The note, found in an old magazine, said: ``Ryan. I leave you
absolutely nothing but this note -- if you find it in time. Sam.''
	   Sam was the pet name of Sandra James, who died in January 1994.
	   Prosecutors alleged that James, a veterinarian, killed his
39-year-old wife with a drug used to anesthetize horses. Their
theory was that he wanted to collect her life insurance to start a
new life with his mistress, Catherine Crooks, now his wife.
	   The new Mrs. James found the note in an old copy of ``Veterinary
Record'' in 1996. Based on the note, the Criminal Cases Review
Commission referred the case for appeal.
	   James' attorney, Colman Treacy, told the appeals court that the
note was written by Mrs. James a few days before her death.
	   ``Its contents, we say, show suicidal intent,'' Treacy said.
	   The words _ ``I leave absolutely nothing'' _ echoed a will
Sandra James made four months before her death. It said: ``To my
husband I leave absolutely nothing. I loved you and lost you. I
will never forget.''
	   Prosecutor Peter Joyce did not oppose the appeal, and said the
whole of the case against James had been reconsidered in the light
of the new developments.
	   He said the government ``cannot seek this conviction to stand
now that that note exists.''

Thai minister plays down fears over foreign ownership of oil firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's deputy prime minister said
Wednesday that the fears of a state-owned oil company's president
about the effects of allowing foreign ownership of the company were
unfounded.
	   Sophon Suphapong, president of Bangchak Petroleum, has been
waging a campaign against such a sale, saying Thailand's important
utilities should remain in the hands of Thais.
	   The Thai government is committed to privatizing most of its
utility companies by the end of 1999, in line with requirements
attached to a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout program led by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Sophon also has expressed fears that selling the company to
foreigners would end a program he began that has allowed community
ownership of gas stations. Sophon recently won the Magsaysay Award,
the Asian version of the Nobel Prize, for the program, which has
helped raise the standard of living of rural people.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi told a news
conference after meeting with London-based privatization experts
that Sophon's claims that foreign ownership would bring an end to
the cooperatives were mistaken.
	   ``That kind of positive culture should be preserved,'' Supachai
said, referring to Bangchak's encouragement of rural cooperatives
to operate filling stations and use the premises to sell locally
grown crops and other goods.
	   ``In any (privatization) sales contract we would mention that,''
he added.
	   Supachai said Wednesday the government had made progress in its
negotiations with Sophon and underlined its commitment to getting
foreign capital to invest in the privatization of cash-strapped
Thai industries.
	   ``Recently we have narrowed the gap of understanding (with
Sophon),'' Supachai said without elaborating.
	   ``If foreign ownership could be brought in right at the
beginning (of the privatization process), it could help improve
share prices even,'' he added.

UNITA says Angola peace close to collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's former UNITA rebels warned
Wednesday that the U.N.-brokered peace accord was on the verge of
collapse, and the government reported new UNITA attacks outlying
towns.
	   ``The peace in Angola is hanging by a thread,'' UNITA official
Rui Oliveira said, referring to the deepening tension between the
former foes which threatens to undermine their 1994 peace deal.
	   The government claims UNITA has killed hundreds of civilians and
police in attacks in recent months, including the massacre of some
200 people last week, while the rebels allege that police have
tortured and murdered their supporters.
	   There was no independent verification of the charges which have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA forces occupied two villages in Cuanza Sul province, 250
kilometers (155 miles) south of Luanda over the past two days,
state radio RNA reported, citing unidentified government sources.
	   UNITA had last year handed back control of the towns to the
government as part of the United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
	   Jonas Savimbi's rebels, regarded as one of Africa's strongest
guerrilla forces, seized more than half of the country during the
war.
	   Stated radio said the rebels were gathering for an attack on the
nearby strategic town of Mussende which lies on a main road leading
to Luanda from the south.
	   Meanwhile Oliveira, a UNITA official who lives in Lisbon, said
the group's supporters had reported a massive government troop
buildup in Huambo province, 560 kilometers (350 miles) south of the
capital, within striking distance of UNITA's remaining central
highland strongholds where its leadership is based.
	   He denied the government reports of UNITA attacks.
	   Oliveira complained that the European Union sanctions against
his movement, announced Tuesday, were ``unfair'' and further
undermined the peace process.
	   ``The international community is biased against UNITA and is in
fact giving the government a carte blanche to launch an attack
against us,'' Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   The EU sanctions included restrictions on UNITA's diamond sales,
which nets the movement hundreds of millions of dollars annually,
and a freeze of its bank accounts.
	   The U.N. passed similar sanctions earlier this year.
	   Oliveira said the army and police were not punished for alleged
human rights abuses in areas returned to government control.

Iranians, Russians deny weapons links that brought U.S. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian-Iranian customs agreement, TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran's ambassador to Moscow denied Wednesday any
knowledge of the Russian companies alleged by the United States to
have sold sensitive weapons technology to foreign countries.
	   President Clinton banned U.S. aid on Tuesday to seven Russian
research and manufacturing enterprises found to have sold sensitive
weapons technology to such countries as Iran, Libya or North Korea.
	   The enterprises, first identified by a Russian government
commission, will also be barred from exporting goods to the United
States.
	   ``The companies and organizations figuring in Clinton's
directive, with the exception of the research institutes, are not
even known in Iran,'' Iranian Ambassador Mehdi Safari said in an
interview with the Interfax news agency.
	   The sanctioned enterprises are the INOR scientific center, the
Grafit and Polyus research institutes, the Glavkosmos organization,
the MOSO company, the Baltic State Technical University and
Europalace 2000.
	   Baltic State, in St. Petersburg, denied on Tuesday that it had
helped Iran acquire nuclear weapons technology by training Iranian
students.
	   ``Not one Iranian student or trainee ever studied in this
area,'' said university rector Yuri Savelyev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Savelyev said an agreement to train 25 Iranian scientists ended
two years ago, and all they were taught was Russian language,
physics, math, physical sciences and general engineering.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service acknowledged last year that
Iranian students were studying missile engineering in Russian
colleges, including the Bauman National Technical University in
Moscow and the Baltic State University. But it said their studies
did not go beyond ``generally available'' knowledge.
	   Russia has been accused by the United States and Israel in
particular of helping Iran develop its nuclear weapons program by
training students, building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran
and providing missile technology.
	   Russia denies the missile allegations and says the nuclear plant
is for purely civilian uses.
	   Regardless, the government has moved recently to tighten control
over the export of weapons and weapons technology.
	   The Russian and Iranian customs services signed an agreement
Wednesday to improve controls over the export of technology,
especially dual-use technology that can be used for both civilian
and military purposes.
	   State Customs Committee chairman Valery Valery Draganov said
Russia had investigated a few cases of alleged illegal export of
dual-use technology, but found ``all of the said items were of an
exclusively peaceful nature,'' Interfax reported.

Two soldiers killed in explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ An explosion ripped apart an army supply
truck Wednesday, killing two soldiers and wounding five others in
the northern state of Kashmir.
	   Police were unable to immediately establish if the cause was a
land mine or a bomb planted inside the truck. Further details were
not available.
	   The explosion was in the district of Poonch 240 kilometers (150
miles) northwest of Jammu, Kashmir's summer capital. Indian
security forces had stepped up operations in the district, which
borders Pakistan. Police said more than 20 separatist militants had
been killed in the last three days.
	   Rebels in Kashmir are fighting to separate the largely Muslim
state from Hindu-dominated India and merge it with Pakistan or
become independent. More than 15,000 people have been killed in
nine years of fighting.

Pro-democracy student leader says he was beaten, detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A student leader said Wednesday he was
beaten and detained by security men to prevent him from speaking at
a pro-democracy rally at Tehran University.
	   Manouchehr Mohammadi said he was kicked and punched by five
intelligence agents and university guards Tuesday, and then hauled
away to the police station where he was held for five hours.
	   ``They let me go ... and then warned me not to tell anyone about
it,'' said Mohammadi who had cuts and bruises on his neck, but was
otherwise all right.
	   Police prevented students who are seeking democratic reforms in
Iran from staging a rally on Tuesday, the latest incident in a
deepening power struggle between moderates and hard-liners in the
country.
	   A half-dozen students _ apparently an advance team _ stood
outside the Tehran University gate for an hour before they were
ordered away by police.
	   Mohammadi said he had gone to the university several hours
before the planned rally and had tried to sneak in. He was to be
the main speaker.
	   ``I couldn't get in, because they stopped me at the gate, then
called some people who started to beat me. They said they would
never let me speak because all I wanted to do was deceive other
students,'' Mohammadi told The Associated Press.
	   Tensions have been high in Iran amid a growing confrontation
between reformist President Mohammad Khatami and religious
hard-liners determined to keep their grip on power.
	   Khatami has promised to protect free speech and individual
rights, but pro-democracy rallies in recent months have been
violently disrupted by Islamic militants.

Populist legislator Hanson costing Australia investment, jobs:
</HEADLINE>
Fischer &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The success of right-wing populist
lawmaker Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is costing Australia
investment and jobs, Trade and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer
said Wednesday.
	   Fischer told reporters that a recent foreign investment mission
had been canceled as a direct result of the June 13 Queensland
state elections, in which One Nation attracted 23.5 percent of the
vote and won 11 seats in the state's parliament.
	   The result was not enough to give One Nation power in a
coalition government in the state, but sent shockwaves through
Australian politics nationally because it signified a huge swing to
the right. One Nation has scored in double figures in recent
national opinion polls.
	   Fischer said the investment mission would have come from Asia
and would have had substantial financial capability. He refused to
give any further details.
	   Fischer gave the warning at a news conference on new government
trade figures that show Australia's exports set a new high in the
12 months to the end of June, despite the Asian economic crisis.
	   Australia's exports were worth U.S. dlrs 70 billion (114 billion
Australian dollars) in the 12 months.
	   But imports ran even higher at U.S. dlrs 72.5 billion (118.4
billion Australian dollars), and the country ended the year with
red ink in its trade books.
	   Fischer said Australia's exporters had turned in ``gold medal''
performances by diversifying into other markets when the Asian
economic crisis hit.
	   Hanson, a member of the federal parliament, has been criticized
widely as a racist. She has warned that Australia is becoming
``Asianized,'' opposes specific welfare benefits for Aborigines and
advocates economic protectionism.
	   One Nation's performance in the Queensland state election made
headlines around the world and was widely reported in Asia.
	   In June, a Taiwanese business leader warned that Taiwanese
companies were reassessing their attitude to investment in
Australia in view of the election result.
	   Taiwan-Australia Business Association spokesman Jim Sheu said
Taiwanese investors feared anti-Asian sentiment in Australia.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah
said Wednesday the world's oil producers will have to reduce their
output further if the price of Brent blend crude futures remains
below dlrs $17 a barrel in November.
	   On Wednesday, it was trading at about dlrs 13 a barrel.
	   Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC
producers have already pledged more than 3.1 million barrels a day
in cumulative cuts through the first half of 1999.
	   ``My policy is very clear, and it is in the direction of
reducing output,'' the Kuwaiti minister said in comments carried by
the Kuwaiti News Agency.
	   ``We are watching the market, and if prices do not improve, we
will reconsider the production quotas that were agreed upon
lately,'' he said.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has agreed to take part in four
international trade fairs over the next three months.
	   Jordan will participate in fairs in Kenya, Germany, Bosnia and
Lebanon to promote the sale of Jordanian products abroad and to
help Jordanian exporters learn about the needs of foreign markets,
said Bashar Khasawneh, an official with the Jordan Export
Development and Commercial Centres Corporation.
	   The fairs will take place from August to October.
	   ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government has slashed tariffs on a
range of goods and raw materials to stimulate the country's
industry, a Baghdad magazine reported.
	   The weekly al-Musawir said the Cabinet, which is chaired by
President Saddam Hussein, has reduced customs on 72 imported
commodities from 5 percent to 1 percent.
	   The step is part of several measures the government has taken
recently to ease trade with the outside world, even though U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 bar nearly
all trade expect for food, medicine and some humanitarian goods.
	   It was not clear what impact, if any, the cuts would have.
	   ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will build two cement factories in
Syria to help offset Syria's shortage, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Wednesday.
	   Syria needs 4 million tons of cement annually, but can only
produce 3 million tons. The two factories will produce 500,000 tons
each, the agency said.
	   Egyptian experts will travel to Syria soon to work out the
details for building the factories. They will also set a plan for
upgrading existing cement factories.
	   The agency did not say how much these factories would cost.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East announced
Wednesday that its net profits were 6.02 million dinars (dlrs 19.67
million) in the first half of the year, up 54 percent from the same
period in 1997.
	   An advertisement in Al-Qabas daily said owners' equity also rose
33 percent, reaching 124.02 million dinars (dlrs 405.29 million) on
June 30.
	   The bank is one of Kuwait's smaller commercial banks. It is
listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange with a paid-up capital of 57.51
million dinars (dlrs 187.94 million).

Philippine Airlines president resigns in midst of labor dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The president of cash-strapped
Philippine Airlines has resigned in the middle of a labor dispute
that threatens to shut down the company, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Jose Antonio Garcia's resignation was accepted by the airline's
board of directors in a meeting Monday, said the senior airline
official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
	   He said there was no immediate need for the company to replace
Garcia since it will soon be placed under receivership.
	   Garcia will take a job with San Miguel Corp., the Philippines'
largest food and beverage conglomerate, the official said. He once
headed San Miguel's flagship beer division and was a member of its
board.
	   Garcia is known to be close to business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco
Jr., who was recently re-elected San Miguel's chairman and chief
executive officer.
	   He will leave PAL at a time when the airline is embroiled in a
dispute with its three unions. Its pilots' union staged a crippling
22-day strike last month, and its ground crew union walked out last
week but returned to work Sunday after the company agreed to
suspend for one month the retrenchment of 1,800 of its members.
	   The flight attendants' union is also seeking the reinstatement
of about 1,400 of its members who were included among 5,000
employees laid off by the company in a drastic downsizing program.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is preparing a rehabilitation program to be submitted
to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   It was unclear what position Garcia will take in San Miguel,
although there was speculation that he may replace San Miguel
president Francisco Eizmendi.
	   Eizmendi and other senior San Miguel executives recently offered
courtesy resignations to give Cojuangco a free hand in choosing his
management team.
	   San Miguel's board is to meet Thursday.
	   Garcia did not return calls to his office. He was a member of
San Miguel's board when Cojuangco was chairman starting in 1984.
Cojuangco was ousted from San Miguel in 1986, when his shares were
seized by government on the charge they were illegally acquired.
	   Cojuangco contributed to President Joseph Estrada's campaign for
the May 11 election and is chairman of Estrada's Struggle of the
Filipino Masses party.

 &UR; Taliban minister says he's ready for talks on aid workers &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment from minister in Kabul,
CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's religious regime said
Wednesday it was ready to talk with the United Nations about the
return of scores of aid workers expelled from its capital last
week.
	   Afghan planning minister Khalid Din Mohammed made no mention of
his earlier insistence that the aid workers move from homes and
offices scattered throughout the Afghan capital to dilapidated
dormitories on the campus of Kabul Polytechnic.
	   Taliban officials ``are ready to negotiate with the United
Nations delegation in Kabul,'' Mohammed told The Associated Press.
``We have no preconditions.''
	   It was not clear whether international pressure, concern about
the plight of the poor in Kabul or both prompted Mohammed to agree
to talks a day after his envoy in neighboring Pakistan said the
Taliban saw no reason to discuss the matter with the United
Nations, as its dispute was with independent aid agencies.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel said officials in Pakistan, where
aid to neighboring Afghanistan is coordinated, would have no
comment until they had received an official response to a request
for talks made two days ago.
	   Some 200 aid workers for 38 agencies were expelled from Kabul
last Monday after refusing to move from homes and offices scattered
throughout the Afghan capital to Kabul Polytechnic, which was
heavily damaged in Afghanistan's civil war.
	   Aid workers say the dormitories are unsafe and uninhabitable,
and the order to move may have been a pretext to get them out of
Kabul.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes.
	   International aid groups say they are committed to providing
education and other services to all.
	   The expelled workers had carried out or supplemented U.N.
humanitarian programs in a city of 1.2 million decimated by years
of civil war.
	   Without the help of Save the Children, Care, Doctors Without
Borders and other agencies, the United Nations has suspended
projects such as rebuilding schools and hospitals and confined
itself to providing food, health care and safe water.
	   The Red Cross, which like the United Nations was not affected by
the relocation order, also runs a feeding program in the Afghan
capital.
	   Mohammed, the Taliban planning minister, said Wednesday that the
impact of the aid workers' departure had so far been ``minor.''

said, adding that Chinese trawlers intruding in Vietnamese waters
was common.
	   Vietnamese authorities have seized 13 Chinese fishing trawlers

BT earnings slip on higher interest costs, startup losses

 &UR; EDs: Style on AT and T, 2nd graf uses ampersand with no spaces &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Telecommunications PLC said Wednesday its
quarterly profits fell 17.9 percent to 723 million pounds (dlrs
1.19 billion) as it paid higher interest costs and lost money
starting several new ventures.
	   The pre-tax earnings for the three months ending June 30
compared with profits of 881 million pounds in the same period a
year earlier, said BT, which just this week announced a broad
global alliance with American telephone giant AT and T.
	   BT's revenues came to 4.24 billion pounds (dlrs 6.95 billion) in
the first quarter of the company's fiscal year, a jump of 10.3
percent from revenues of 3.84 billion pounds in the same period
last year.
	   BT lost 78 million pounds (dlrs 128 million) from two ventures,
a cellular phone deal in France and the pending launch of a
combined fixed and mobile phone service in Germany.
	   Nonetheless, said BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance, ``growth in our
new services and the European ventures in the quarter has been
impressive.''
	   BT said demand for its telephone services remains strong, even
though price cuts worth 120 million pounds (dlrs 197 million) have

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A sudden lightning storm killed a man
and injured his wife and daughter, when a bolt struck them as the
worked in their potato field, a police official said Wednesday.
	   Ferenc Dobo, 74, died almost instantly when lightning struck the
family's vegetable plot outside the village of Morahalom late
Tuesday, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Budapest, said
Ibolya Szeged, a spokesman for the Csongrad County police.
	   Szegedi said Dobo was holding a metal rake, which may have
attracted the lightning.
	   ``They were picking potatoes when the storm caught them by
surprise. They were thrown up into the air by the explosive force
of the lightning and landed two meters (yards) away,'' Szegedi
said.
	   Dobo's wife and daughter were treated for burns in the local
hospital, then released.

India announces investment liberalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - India announced steps Wednesday to
liberalize trade with six of its neighbors, saying the move will
increase their access to the vast Indian market.
	   Looking forward to regional integration on a European style,
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said India will lift
restrictions on more than 2,000 products that nearby countries want
to export. The measure, which Vajpayee called ``a special
gesture,'' is effective Aug. 1.
	   He also relaxed rules for Indians to invest in other member
countries of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation,
or SAARC, allowing investments of up to dlrs 15 million to be
cleared quickly on a special basis.
	   Vajpayee urged a quick conclusion to trade negotiations begun
last July to achieve the goal of a free trade zone by 2001. In
meetings preparing the summit, experts said they believed the
target date may have to be set back by up to five years.
	   The SAARC groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and the Maldives.

German court: employee must use friendly address with colleagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMM, German (AP) _ A court may not be able to order someone to
be pals with his co-workers, but in Germany it can at least tell
him to sound friendly.
	   A state court in North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday said a
45-year-old department head at a clothing store had to follow his
company's policy and use the relaxed form of address at work.
	   The German language has formal and informal forms of the pronoun
``you,'' with the polite form, ``Sie,'' generally used for
managerial and older co-workers as a sign of respect.
	   Some companies, especially foreign ones, have instituted
policies requiring workers to use the more familiar form, ``du,''
to promote a more collegial environment.
	   Reinhard Weniger, who works for the Swedish H-and-M company,
complained that using ``du'' among colleagues was a fashion of the
younger generation, and that it made him uncomfortable and affected
his work.
	   He went to court seeking an exemption, but lost. The court said
German employees, including Weniger, had approved the H-and-M
policy when their company, Dyckhoff, was taken over by the Swedes.

Miner tells his tale after nine days in the dark.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Miner Georg Hainzl realized something was
wrong when water gushed into the underground shaft where he was
working. That began a nine-day ordeal spent in total darkness _
without food, water or contact with the outside world.
	   The ordeal ended Sunday night when rescuers hauled the
24-year-old miner from the talc mine in the village of Lassing,
where he was buried July 17 in a massive landslide, triggered by
heavy rains.
	   Ten others _ nine miners and a geologist _ remain missing. They
were sent to rescue Hainzl but were themselves buried in a second,
larger landslide a short time later.
	   Hainzl told his story for the first time Wednesday from his
hospital bed in Graz, where doctors said he was in relatively good
condition. He taped answers to questions submitted by reporters,
who were given copies of the tape by hospital authorities.
	   Hainzl said he was working about 60 meters (200 feet) below the
surface when water from the landslide came rushing into the shaft
at the mine, about 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   ``The water came in, it was two, three meters (yards) high,'' he
said. ``It nearly knocked me over.''
	   Hainzl rushed to an underground chamber where miners normally
ate their meals because he knew the chamber had a heavy wooden
table and emergency oxygen tanks. The room was also lit and
included a telephone.
	   ``I called my father and my brothers,'' Hainzl said . ``They
gave me courage and told me to 'Hang on.''' But the electricity and
telephone cables snapped _ leaving him alone and in the dark.
	   Hainzl counted the first hour as it passed, smoked his last
cigarette, then slipped into a ``sort of trance'' and lost track of
time. His mind began to play tricks on him.
	   ``I `saw' my friends bringing me something to drink,'' he said.
``I was already fantasizing.''
	   Although the room was full of muddy water, he dared not drink,
fearing it would make him sick. He thought of his family and
friends _ including his girlfriend, who is three months' pregnant.
	   He told himself ``I have to get through this. There's no other
way.''
	   Throughout the ordeal, he could hear noises from rescue teams
digging through the debris. Little did he know that rescuers had
given up hope of finding anyone alive.
	   Mine officials had in fact ordered 11 coffins, but the town
mayor canceled the request.
	   Finally, he heard a noise, which he thought was water washing
away some of the debris. In fact, it was the sound of a probe which
rescuers were forcing down through a temporary shaft.
	   When he noticed a bit of light appearing through the shaft, he
crawled to a microphone which had been sent down by rescuers.
``It's Georg,'' he said. ``I'm alive!''
	   A few hours later, Hainzl was hauled to the surface. After a
cursory examination, he was taken to hospital in Graz, where he is
being treated for shock and dehydration.
	   ``I feel totally, very good,'' he said.

Nasrallah reelected Hezbollah chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of Lebanon's militant
pro-Iranian Hezbollah group has been reelected as the party's
secretary-general for a third consecutive term, local newspapers
said Wednesday.
	   As-Safir newspaper said the party's congress, which had been
convening for a month in a secret location in Beirut's southern
suburbs, held its final session Tuesday, extending Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah's term for another three years.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah's press office.
	   The party's charter, which limits the tenure of a
secretary-general to a maximum of two consecutive, three-year
terms, was amended to allow for Nasrallah's reelection, As-Safir
said in its front-page report.
	   Nasrallah, 44, was elected Hezbollah's secretary-general for the
first time in February 1992, two days after his predecessor, Sheik
Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship ambush in
South Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the main guerrilla group fighting
to oust Israeli troops occupying parts of southern Lebanon.
	   The party under Nasrallah's leadership has made significant
strides on the political front, with seven representatives in
Lebanon's 128-seat legislature. Hezbollah scored major gains in
municipal elections held recently across the country.

First luxury Maybach limousines to be ready for delivery in 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ A day after announcing it was going
ahead with plans to build ultra-luxury Maybach limousines,
Daimler-Benz said Wednesday the hand-crafted cars would be ready
for delivery to customers in 2002.
	   Enrico Mueller, a Daimler-Benz spokesman, said the Maybach
models would cost between 300,000 to 500,000 marks (dlrs 170,000 to
282,500) _ roughly the same as a basic Rolls-Royce.
	   The 5.7-meter-long (19-feet-long) Maybachs are to travel at top
speeds of 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph), have three telephones
each and cater to a ``small, exclusive group of clients,'' the
company said Tuesday in announcing it plans.
	   Mueller said that ``several hundred,'' jobs would be involved in
producing the Maybachs at a plant in the southern town of
Sindelfingen.
	   Introduction of the Maybach comes at a time of brisk expansion
and diversification for Daimler and other German automakers.
	   Daimler-Benz announced a merger with the United States' No. 3
automaker, Chrysler, earlier this year, and introduced its first
sub-compact late last year.
	   Volkswagen also expanded into the high-luxury end of the market
with its purchase this year of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd.

Chinese opposition party founder reported detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police on Wednesday detained a democracy
campaigner who sought the release of a pair of colleagues seized in
a police crackdown earlier this month, a human rights activist
said.
	   It was the second detention this month for Wang Peijian, who was
held briefly in a roundup of democracy activists who organized an
opposition party to challenge the Communist Party's monopoly on
political power.
	   Wang, a graduate of the prestigious Beijing University law
school, was detained Wednesday after he tried to make photo copies
at a printing shop in coastal Hangzhou city, said Xu Wenli, a
Beijing-based compiler of information about the democracy movement.
	   After being released from his earlier detention, Wang joined a
legal team seeking the release of China Democracy Party founders
Wang Youcai and Lin Hui, who remain in detention, Xu said. The
documents Wang was trying to copy were believed to have been
related to the two men's case, Xu said.
	   The crackdown, in which 12 people associated with the party were
detained along with nine unrelated activists, was one of the most
concerted actions by police against dissidents in recent years.
	   It followed U.S. President Bill Clinton's breakthrough visit to
China, during which he urged China to allow its people greater
political freedoms.
	   Wang Youcai and other activists announced the party's formation
on the eve of Clinton's visit in a bid for publicity that appears
to have backfired badly. The government has refused to allow the
party to register, despite a law guaranteeing the right to organize
opposition parties.

Anti-corruption boss suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi Wednesday
suspended his anti-corruption boss after he attempted to pursue
senior treasury and tax department officials for alleged
corruption.
	   A statement from Moi's office said he had set up a tribunal to
look into ``the proper performance'' of the office of the director
of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority and suspended director John
Harun Mwau pending the outcome of the investigation.
	   On Mwau's request, a magistrate issued arrest warrants July 16
for the head of the Kenya Revenue Authority, the head of the
Customs and Excise service and several other officials.
	   The following day, the Attorney General's office dropped the
charges.
	   Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae claimed Monday that Mwau's move
was an attempt to intimidate senior treasury officials who were
only carrying out his instructions to reduce the duty on imported
wheat and waive penalities connected with the failure to follow
proper procedures for importing sugar.
	   Both Nyachae and Mwau claimed they had acted properly.
	   The anti-corruption unit was set up under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund which last August suspended a dlrs 220
million loan to Kenya because of the government's failure to stem
corruption.

Dutch chemicals giant posts 5 percent profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Boosted by strong pharmaceutical
activities, Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV said Wednesday its
net profit in the second quarter rose 5 percent to 483 million
guilders (dlrs 242 million).
	   Operating income rose in all divisions in the quarter, but
especially the pharmaceuticals division, which posted an increase
of 11 percent to 258 million guilders (dlrs 129 million). Akzo said
the Organon unit was the main contributor.
	   For the remainder of the year, Akzo said it expects growth to
continue, although the increase in earnings of ongoing operations
in the second half will slow compared with the first half of this
year.
	   Akzo's Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Friedrich
Frohlich said he expected a strong performance for the second half
of 1998 as well.
	   The financial crisis in Asia had a ``slight negative'' impact on
earnings, the Dutch company said. Frohlich said the impact of the
Asian crisis had hurt net income by 1 percent to 3 percent in the
second quarter.

Riders stop Tour de France again in protest over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JOURIOZ, France (AP) - Angry cyclists stopped racing on
the Tour de France on Wednesday in their second protest over a
doping scandal that has plagued the competition.
	   The riders stopped cycling just after starting the 17th stage
Wednesday at the 32-kilometer (20th mile) of the leg from
Albertville to Aix-les-Bains.
	   After starting very slowly, the 33 riders began taking off their
race numbers to protest against the drug investigations on the tour
that have demoralized the riders.
	   Members of the TVM team were taken away by police Tuesday for
testing that lasted until almost midnight (2200 GMT).
	   It was the second time in the race that the riders have
protested. Last Friday the riders stopped the race at the start of
the the 12th stage in Tarascon-sur-Ariege. The riders delayed the
start of the race two hours.

Riders stop Tour de France again in protest over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JOURIOZ, France (AP) - Angry cyclists stopped racing on
the Tour de France on Wednesday in their second protest over a
doping scandal that has plagued the competition.
	   The riders stopped cycling just after starting the 17th stage
Wednesday at the 32-kilometer (20th mile) of the leg from
Albertville to Aix-les-Bains.
	   After starting very slowly, the 33 riders began taking off their
race numbers to protest against the drug investigations on the tour
that have demoralized the riders.
	   Members of the TVM team were taken away by police Tuesday for
testing that lasted until almost midnight (2200 GMT).
	   It was the second time in the race that the riders have
protested. Last Friday the riders stopped the race at the start of
the the 12th stage in Tarascon-sur-Ariege. The riders delayed the
start of the race two hours.

Magistrate rules disputed confession admissible evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) - A magistrate ruled Wednesday a signed
confession of one of two defendants charged with killing a British
tourist was admissable as evidence.
	   Peter Hiuhu Gachau, who is standing trial for the Feb. 5 killing
of Roy Chivers, told the court he never recorded or signed the
confession and said he never met the police inspector who earlier
testified to have taken the confession from him.
	   ``The signature is not mine, and the day the police officer
claims to have recorded a statement from me at Mweiga (police
station), I was in Mukurweini police station,'' Gachau said.
	   In earlier testimony, Gachau testified police beat him to
extract the confession.
	   Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu are charged with the stabbing
death of Chivers on the grounds of Aberdare Country Club, 130
kilometers (80 miles) north of Nairobi.
	   Last week Police Inspector David Kibe testifed for the
prosecution he had recorded Gachau's confession on March 3.
	   ``I have examined the circumstances under which the confession
was made, and I rule that it is admitted as evidence in this
trial,'' Magistrate Julius S. Mushelle told the court following
Gachau's testimony Wednesday.
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest while
strolling on the grounds of the resort with his wife Sandra
Christine. He died while being flown to a Nairobi hospital.
	   The defendants are also charged with robbing the Chivers of two
cameras and a pair of binoculars.
	   Kibe said in his testimony last week that both suspects had
signed confessions that had been translated into English from the
Kikuyu language in which they gave them.
	   Mushelle on Wednesday called on the defendants, who are
representing themselves, to begin presenting their case when the
trial resumes August 6.
	   Since the trial began May 7, contradictions have arisen between
testimonies by prosecution witnesses and the defendants.
	   Last week, police testified that blood samples taken from the
clothing of one of the suspects did not match the victim's blood
type.
	   Mrs. Chivers was unable to identify the accused in a police
lineup on May 6, saying the incident had happened quickly and she
had been in a state of shock.
	   If found guilty, the defendants face mandatory death sentences.
	   Earlier this month, the two defendants were convicted and
sentenced to death in a separate trial in the same court for the
robbery and murder of a Kenyan farmer.

Prosecutors not yet involved in Boris Becker tax case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tax officers also asking Greenpeace if it has any
documents on tax-free contributions from Becker.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German prosecutors have no immediate
plans to open a tax evasion investigation against tennis star Boris
Becker, the chief Munich prosecutor said Wednesday.
	   Peter Schlicht said city tax officials were handling an inquiry
into Becker's taxes, and that prosecutors would get involved only
after the tax officials present their report.
	   Tax agents this week raided about 30 locations linked to Becker
on suspicion that he evaded taxes on millions of dollars in
earnings.
	   Munich tax agency sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the raids, first reported by the Munich newspaper
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   The agents searched offices and apartments of Becker's friends
and sponsors on Monday, the newspaper said.
	   Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, the former No. 1 in the
world and the country's Davis Cup captain, remains one of Germany's
most popular personalities. He is in semi-retirement on the tennis
circuit, playing only selected tournaments.
	   Becker and his former manager Ion Tiriac are suspected of
evading taxes on millions of dollars of Becker's earnings from 1990
to 1993.
	   Becker and Tiriac have denied the accusations since they first
surfaced in February last year. Prosecutors never charged the two
men, indicating they did not believe they had a strong case.
	   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said offices of the German Tennis
Federation also were searched. Federation officials declined to
comment.
	   A spokesman for Greenpeace said tax agents also visited the
Hamburg offices of the environmental organization to ask for any
documents on possible tax-free contributions from Becker.
	   Spokesman Norbert Schnorbach said the agents did not search the
offices and left after being told that Greenpeace had no such
documents.
	   Tax authorities want to find out how much time Becker spent in
Monte Carlo, the tax haven where he officially resided between 1990
and 1993. Under German law, Becker would have had to spend at least
185 days per year in Monte Carlo to avoid paying German taxes. The
investigators believe he spent most of the time in Germany, the
newspaper reported.
	   German tennis star Steffi Graf also has been linked to tax
evasion. Her father, Peter Graf, was sentenced in January 1997 to
three years, nine months for evading taxes on dlrs 6.55 million of
his daughter's tennis earnings.
	   The elder Graf, 59, was released from prison April 29 after
serving more than half of the sentence, including time served when
he was in investigative custody.

Monaco star joins Everton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Scottish World Cup midfielder John
Collins transfered from Monaco to Everton Wednesday for 2.5 million
pounds (dlrs 4.1 million).
	   The 30-year-old player, who helped Monaco win a French league
title and reach the semifinal of the Champions Cup, was hired by
new Everton manager Walter Smith, who moved to the Merseyside club
after a successful 10-year spell with Glasgow Rangers.
	   ``I talked to several clubs and thought long and hard about
things, but Walter being at Everton now was a big pull,'' Collins
said during a news conference at Everton's Goodison Park.
	   ``I have known him since I was 12 when he coached me one night a
week at Dundee United. We go back a long way.
	   ``I have always been impressed by him,'' Collins said. ``He was
manager at Rangers while I was at Celtic and I believe he can turn
things round at Everton.
	   ``I have missed the passion of British football and the crowds
and that was also one of the reasons I have returned from France.''
	   Everton, a powerhouse team in the 1980s, is currently going
through a slump and last season went close to relegation from the
Premier League.
	   On Monday Smith hired French midfielder Olivier Dacourt from
Strasbourg and has also signed Italian defender Marco Materazzi
from Perugia.

Volleyball chief slams Nebiolo over drug issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ In an extraordinary public war of
words between two international sports leaders, the head of the
international volleyball federation has blasted IAAF chief Primo
Nebiolo for his comments on doping.
	   Ruben Acosta, the Mexican president of the FIVB, accused
Nebiolo, Italian leader of track and field's world governing body,
of making ``totally false'' allegations and acting ``in bad
faith.''
	   Acosta and Nebiolo have been political rivals for years within
the Olympic movement, but this week's developments brought the
emnity into the public domain for the first time.
	   In a press release Monday, Nebiolo condemned volleyball, cycling
and tennis for allegedly refusing to sign an agreement on doping
rules and sanctions drawn up five years ago by the International
Olympic Committee.
	   Acosta fired back at Nebiolo in own press release Wednesday.
	   ``Primo Nebiolo should spend his time wiping out the systematic
doping in track and field instead of inventing lies on other
sports,'' Acosta said in a statement released by FIVB headquarters
in Lausanne.
	   ``He is in bad faith when he declares that volleyball, together
with other sports, refused to sign the convention agreed by the IOC
and the other international federations.
	   ``Although doping is almost non-existent in volleyball .... FIVB
was the first international federation to join the convention with
the IOC, even accepting the international court of arbitration for
sport, exclusively concerning appeals on doping control
decisions.''
	   Acosta also attacked Nebiolo's proposal to hold a worldwide
conference on doping, saying Nebiolo would try to use the meeting
for his own ends.
	   ``The world meeting called by Nebiolo would lead to an impasse
specially if he intends to manipulate it to his advantage as he has
on other occasions, rejecting reasonable opinions from other
international federations,'' Acosta said.
	   ``As president of ASOIF (Association of Summer Olympic
International Federations), Nebiolo should follow certain ethical
rules and be more prudent when mentioning other international
federations than his own. He should also stop taking powers that he
was not accorded at any official federation meeting.''
	   IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said there was no immediate
comment from Nebiolo.

Symbolic vote goes lopsidedly against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition reaction, next meeting of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators on Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sharp slap at Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel's parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly gave
preliminary approval to a measure meant to help pave the way for
early elections.
	   By a lopsided vote of 60-6, lawmakers took a symbolic first step
toward approving a bill to dissolve the parliament _ a move that
would be tantamount to toppling the government.
	   But final passage of the measure was impossible on Wednesday,
the last working day before lawmakers' summer recess. To be
enacted, the measure would need committee approval and three more
parliamentary votes, procedures that would take weeks or months.
	   Even though it carried no actual legal weight, Wednesday's vote
was a bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of
negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``It is a huge scandal for Netanyahu,'' said Abdel Wahab
Darawshe, head of Arab Democratic Party, which has four
parliamentary seats. ``Sixty Knesset members gave him what amounts
to a no-confidence vote.''
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago.
Negotiators from both sides have been trying over the past 10 days
to get the talks going again, but no breakthrough has been
achieved. They were to meet again Thursday.
	   Leaders of Netanyahu's coalition had urged a boycott of the
parliamentary vote, but some took part anyway _ and seven of them
supported the measure.
	   Those voting in favor included Dan Meridor, who quit as
Netanyahu's finance minister last year and is widely viewed as a
potential challenger for the leadership of Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   In brief but raucous debate before the parliamentary vote, the
prime minister denounced the vote as an ``empty exercise.''
	   Netanyahu, who was jeered and heckled by lawmakers when he began
speaking, intoned a Hebrew prayer at one point, replete with
dramatic pauses.
	   He scolded members of the opposition Labor Party, telling them:
``You are so distant and so elitist.'' And he derided their chances
of passing the dissolution measure later.
	   Final approval would require 61 votes, a majority of the
120-seat parliament _ only one more vote than Netanyahu's opponents
garnered on Wednesday.
	   ``You are scared to go to elections, because you know full what
will happen,'' Netanyahu told the opposition. ``The people of this
country prefer a government...that is really fighting to bring
peace and security to the people.''
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept an American-authored initiative calling
for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners all have different views on the
proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   The prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in
parliament, survived three opposition no-confidence motions on
Monday. On the eve of Wednesday's vote, he expressed unconcern.
	   Shai Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, told Army radio
beforehand that the vote was ``not meaningful.''

Brunei's sultan sacks younger brother from high government job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ The sultan of Brunei removed
his younger brother Wednesday as head of the powerful Brunei
Investment Agency, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
	   Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who is also the country's finance
minister, dismissed Prince Jefri Bolkiah as chairman of the agency,
which puts the sultanate's oil riches into hotels, banks,
businesses and U.S. Treasury bonds. The amount of those riches has
been estimated at up to dlrs 60 billion.
	   The sultan named Education Minister Haji Awang Abdul Aziz as the
new chairman of BIA, and also replaced the agency's managing
director and other key officials.
	   Prince Jefri formerly headed Amedeo Development Corp., the
government's flagship investment company, whose recent collapse has
cast a pall over the nation's economy and the financial soundness
of the BIA.
	   The sultan has hired independent auditors to examine the books
of Amedeo, whose losses were estimated at dlrs 16 billion. The
company's managers were being sought for questioning.
	   Other companies controlled by Prince Jefri have also come under
close scrutiny.
	   The Brunei ruler announced the ``restructuring'' of Datastream
Technology Ltd., a huge telecommunications company owned by his
brother, the statement said.
	   Seven other telecommunication companies controlled by Prince
Jefri would also be overhauled for the sake of ``public interest,''
it said.
	   Brunei, a tiny sultanate on the northern coast of Borneo, has
one of the world's highest annual per-capita incomes, dlrs 15,800.
Analysts have said that Amedeo's troubles were unlikely to affect
oil companies in the nation.

American bomb found near nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bomb experts on Wednesday defused an American bomb
from World War II that was found a few meters (yards) outside the
Chinon nuclear power plant southwest of Paris.
	   Groundskeepers found the bomb Tuesday, buried near a flowerbed
in a garden area outside the plant, a company spokesperson said.
	   A team of experts identified and safely defused the 200-kilo
(440-pound) bomb Wednesday morning and were planning on removing it
Wednesday night, the spokesperson said on customary anonymity.
	   The bomb must have washed up into the garden long ago by the
nearby Loire river because Chinon, about 360 kilometers (200 miles)
southwest of Paris, was not subjected to Allied bombardment, the
spokesperson said.
	   Last December, authorities evacuated more than 8,700 residents
of a Paris suburb to dismantle a 500-kilo (1,100-pound) bomb
dropped by the British during World War II.
	   French authorities continue to discover tons of unexploded
ordinance every year from both World War I and II.

Honda in negotiations to settle U.S. class action suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co. said Wednesday it is negotiating to
settle a class action lawsuit that claims the car maker conspired
to send cars to U.S. dealers who paid bribes.
	   While a company spokesman wouldn't say how much a settlement
could cost Japan's No. 3 automaker, news reports said Honda could
pay 44.5 billion yen (dlrs 316 million).
	   A settlement could be reached within the next few weeks, the
spokesman said.
	   The dealers who filed the suit allege that the cars they needed
to stay competitive were diverted to dealers willing to offer
bribes of cash, jewelry and vacation trips for Honda executives and
sales managers.
	   The lawsuit alleges that Honda executives at the highest levels,
including those in Japan, looked the other way while their
employees took the bribes between 1975 and 1992.
	   Honda has denied that its top executives knew about the schemes.
	   The first suit was filed in 1994. Three years later, a federal
judge in Baltimore allowed dealers to form a class action suit.

compensation awarded; EDITS to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court found a former minister
and 11 others guilty of kidnapping a French businessman, concluding
a trial Wednesday that exposed the former Socialist government's
role in a dirty war against Basque separatists.
	   Judge Joaquin Delgado said Jose Luis Barrionuevo, the minister
in charge of internal security between 1982-88, was guilty of
kidnapping Segundo Marey in 1983. Barrionuevo, currently a
parliamentary deputy, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and
banned from public office for 12 years.
	   Marey's abduction was the first action attributed to the
so-called GAL death squad. GAL killed 27 people in a campaign
against sympathizers and members of the armed Basque separatist
group ETA between 1983-87.
	   Many of the victims had no connection with ETA.
	   Marey himself was released after 10 days when his kidnappers
realized he was not the ETA hitman they were hunting. Awarded
compensation of 30 million pesetas (about dlrs 200,000) by the
court, the businessman said he was ``satisfied'' with the result of
the trial.
	   Rafael Vera, ex-secretary of state for security, and a former
Basque security chief Julian Sancristobal were sentenced to 10
years. Nine other former police and ministry officials were given
lesser terms.
	   The verdict, leaked by several newspapers last week, damages
former premier Felipe Gonzalez. He countered the leak by claiming
the trial was a plot to discredit him and his Socialist Party.
	   The GAL scandal directly contributed to the electoral defeat of
the Socialists two years ago after nearly 14 years in office.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were the only defendants to plead innocence
during the Marey trial that finished July 14. They have said they
would appeal a guilty verdict.
	   None of the 12 were at the court when the verdict was read.
Outside, a lone man protested that case ever went to trial.
	   Socialist spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters that
the party executive would meet Thursday, stressing that four of the
judges on the 11-member panel had voted against the guilty verdict.
	   A lawyer representing one of the convicted dozen, Manuel
Murillo, said he would solicit clarification of the sentence. This
would keep all 12 out of prison for at least another month.
	   Several foreign mercenaries contracted to carry out the killings
by GAL, which stands in Spanish for Anti-terrorist Liberation
Groups, were jailed in the late 1980s.
	   The Marey trial was the first to directly involve members of the
former government. Barrionuevo and Vera were indicted after two
police officers already sentenced for GAL murders, fingered their
former employers. There are another 12 GAL-linked cases currently
in the courts.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence. It was particularly active during the GAL years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ French police Wednesday began examining
drugs seized from the Chinese junior athletics team, said athletics
governing body IAAF.
	   ``Police have found products which are now under analysis. In
all probability they are harmless medicines, but we will take
action if necessary,'' said IAAF spokesman Sean Wallace-Jones.
	   The Chinese team is in Annecy to compete in the World Junior
Championships, which stated Tuesday and finish August 2.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least three people, including a child, died and
another person was seriously injured on Wednesday in the collapse
of a Moscow apartment building apparently caused by a gas blast,
officials said.
	   The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) on
Sherbakovskaya Street in eastern Moscow, said Viktor Beltsov, a
spokesman for the Ministry for Emergency Situations.
	   Three people were killed and one was seriously injured, said
ministry spokeswoman Marina Ryklina. District mayor Boris Ulyanov
said that a child was among the dead, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Two entrances to the 10-story brick building were demolished
from top to bottom, and ruined apartments gaped wide open. Rescue
workers accompanied by sniffer dogs were clearing the debris,
looking for more victims.
	   A fire erupted shortly after the explosion, the ministry said.
	   Thick police cordons surrounded the area and several ambulance
crews were waiting on the ground. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov went to
the site to personally direct the rescue efforts, Interfax said.

Critics of Arab security pact fear it will target dissidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments plan to consolidate a new
pan-Arab pact against terrorism that has already been used for
dozens of extraditions, raising fears among activists that it will
target political dissidents.
	   Security officials from 22 Arab nations approved a strategy that
includes efforts to pursue extremists working ``under the pretext
of slogans of human rights and democracy,'' Ahmed Al-Salem, the
Saudi diplomat who chaired the meeting, said Tuesday.
	   The two-day meeting had been called to discuss implementing a
pact, signed in April, that requires Arab countries to deny support
to groups that launch attacks on other nations in the region, to
exchange information on terrorist groups, and to extradite
``extremists.''
	   Critics charge that the the definition of extremists is vague,
and allows the expulsion of political refugees to appease an ally.
The pact also lacks legal guarantees that it will not be used
against civilian opponents of other governments, the critics say.
	   Faiz Jibril, a Libyan opposition leader based in Egypt, noted
that most Arab governments have not signed international agreements
guaranteeing protection to dissidents like himself living under
political asylum in other countries.
	   ``The problem is that there are no deep rooted traditions in the
Arab world on how to deal with and respect the rights of asylum
seekers, and many believe that the new agreement may be at the
expense of opposition leaders,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Since the pact was signed, several host countries have
extradited foreign activists, bypassing public judicial procedures,
said a human rights activist.
	   ``Every thing was done under a blanket of darkness and we are
not sure if they (those extradited) received due justice,'' Abdel
Hussein Shaban, head of the London-based Arab Human Rights
Organization, said in a telephone interview.
	   Saudi Arabia has handed over dozens of Muslim fundamentalist
activists to Egypt and Libya, and Syria has extradited at least 16
Algerian Islamic.
	   Jordan also is believed to have extradited some Egyptian Islamic
activists accused of financing a six-year-old violent campaign
against the Egyptian government that has so far claimed more than
1,100 lives.
	   Iraq is reported to be seeking more than 80 dissidents, some of
them former ambassadors who received political asylum in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Egypt has yet to act on a request by Sudan to extradite leaders
of Sudanese opposition groups in Cairo.
	   Egypt has had sour relations with Sudan since an assassination
attempt in Ethiopia in 1995 on President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt
blamed the Sudanese government for the harboring the assailants.

Radio: 21 killed in fighting between Burundi army and rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least 21 people were killed in fighting
between the Tutsi-led Burundi army and Hutu rebels, Radio Burundi
said Wednesday.
	   The government radio, monitored in the Kenyan capital, said the
skirmish occurred near Kibira National Park north of the capital,
Bujumbura, and 10 of those killed were rebels.
	   The radio said two government soldiers were wounded, but it did
not say whether any had been killed or when the fighting occurred.
	   The reported fighting occurred as all-party talks to end the
conflict in Burundi entered their second week in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   All parties to the talks were supposed to observe a cease-fire
during the talks, but the Burundi army said the rule was not
applicable when it was defending the nation's citizens.
	   Since October 1993, at least 200,000 people have been killed in
politically movited ethnic conflict in Burundi. Most of the victims
have been civilians.

Obuchi persuades economic expert to accept finance minister post
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS thruout; vote in Parliament expected 0400 GMT;
lower house results possible by 0500 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A day before his expected confirmation as Japan's
next prime minister, Keizo Obuchi bolstered his chances of tackling
Japan's recession when he won the agreement Wednesday of a ruling
party economics expert to serve as finance chief.
	   Parliament was scheduled to convene Thursday to vote for a
successor to resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Obuchi,
chosen last week as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, was nearly certain to win.
	   The LDP holds a comfortable majority in the 500-seat lower
house, which can overrule the 252-member upper house in a vote for
premier. The upper house is dominated by opposition parties, and
could pick another candidate, possibly popular Democratic Party
leader Naoto Kan.
	   Obuchi, criticized as a colorless leader unlikely to act
decisively to fix Japan's economy, boosted his standing with the
markets this week by zeroing in on former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa as his pick to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   The two met privately late Wednesday. Afterward, both said that
the 78-year-old party elder would accept the job.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after the meeting with Miyazawa.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister in 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan
to bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week and helped strengthen the yen against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of its deepest recession since the end of World War II. With
unemployment and bankruptcies at record highs, Obuchi is under
intense pressure _ at home and abroad _ to move quickly to turn the
economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kick start economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters.
Hashimoto was forced to resign after the LDP was routed in July 12
elections for the upper house, and the party's approval ratings are
at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean-up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
the brokerage Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the
guy who is going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is
the ultimate insider.''
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief Cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
The secretary functions as chief of staff and chief spokesman for
the prime minister.
	   Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister, according to Kyodo News.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, a writer, was chosen as director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency. Sakaiya, also a former trade ministry
official, has written that despite their material riches, many
Japanese are dissatisfied with their work and with society.

Iraq holds Kuwait responsible for 1,000 missing Iraqis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq holds Kuwaiti authorities responsible
for the fate of 1,037 Iraqis missing from the 1991 Gulf War, the
ruling party newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Kuwait denies the Iraqi allegations and accuses Baghdad of
trying to overshadow the issue of missing Kuwaitis.
	   The Al-Thawra daily said Iraq has given the International
Committee of the Red Cross files on the Iraqis who went missing in
Kuwait during the war, but Kuwait has only provided information on
three files and has said it no information on the others.
	   ``The way Kuwaiti authorities are dealing with this problem
holds them fully and legally accountable to declare what happened''
to the missing Iraqis, al-Thawra said.
	   Kuwait repeatedly has said that 600 people _ including more than
500 Kuwaitis, more than a dozen Saudis and other foreign nationals
_ are still unaccounted for since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which set off the Gulf War.
	   Iraq has denied that it is holding any Kuwaitis in its jails.

Paris Saint-Germain to sign Nigerian Okocha
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris Saint-Germain, re-building in a bid to
recapture the French league title, is set to sign Nigerian
midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha, club officials said Wednesday.
	   The playmaker, who starred for Nigeria in the World Cup and
currently plays for Turkish club Fenerbahce, will be presented
officially by the club before a friendly match Thursday night
against current champion, Lens.
	   However, club officials said Okocha still had to sign a
contract, and gave no further details.
	   The French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday reported that PSG
would pay a French transfer record of 95 million francs (dlrs 15.8
million) for the Nigerian.
	   FIFA selected Okocha as a reserve for its 22-man ceremonial
World Cup all-star squad for France 98.
	   Marseille has on its current roster the two most expensive
transfers French soccer history, having paid 75 million francs
(dlrs 12.6 million) each for Italian international Fabrizio
Ravenelli and former Metz star Robert Pires.
	   PSG, the country's richest and best-supported club, came a
disappointing seventh in the French standings last season.
	   Since then, it has signed German international defender
Christian Worns, Brazilian forward Adailton and French
international goalkeeper Bernard Lama in its bid to recapture the
title.

 &UR; Riders stop Tour de France again
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with quotes, background, color &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; By Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JOURIOZ, France (AP) - The Tour de France was stopped
again when the riders staged another protest just after starting
the 17th stage Wednesday.
	   The 133 riders left in the competition halted the race at the 32
kilometer (20th mile) of the leg from Albertville to Aix-les-Bains.
	   After starting very slowly, many of 133 riders stripped off
their race numbers to protest against the way French officials are
carrying out an investigation into the use of drugs on the tour.
	   The racers were angry that members of the Dutch TVM team had
been taken away by police to be tested Tuesday night and apparently
fear further police searches.
	   It was the second time in the race that the riders have
protested. Last Friday the riders stopped the race at the start of
the the 12th stage in Tarascon-sur-Ariege. The riders delayed the
start of the race two hours.
	   Wednesday, they stopped about 15 minutes but were without the
team of ONCE, which Laurent Jalabert is the leader.
	   Jalabert was the leader of the protest and delivered a statement
to Tour radio at the time. France 2 television reported that
Jalabert and his team had definitely quit the race.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc made a statement over Radio Tour, the radio
station for the followers of the race, asking the riders to restart
the race.
	   He promised the riders that he would have ``assurances
concerning the conditions to hear them this evening. ''
	   There has been speculation on further police action against the
riders.
	   Marco Pantani, the leader of this year's race, said. ``the pack
stopped because they are continuing to persecute the riders.''
	   ``We will restart when we have some guarantees from the police
that we would be treated well. We want to be treated like athletes
and not as delinquents. We are tired of being treated that way.''
	   The race had been plagued by the drug scandal since before the
beginning of the Tour and the way certain riders were treated.
	   The Dutch TVM team started the Tour following medical tests to
determine whether the races took illegal drugs that lasted until
midnight the night before.
	   The cyclists from TVM were tested Tuesday for illegal
substances, the same day French authorities placed two top team
officials under formal investigation for allegedly supplying racers
with EPO, a performance enhancing drug.
	   French doctors administered blood, urine and capillary tests
Tuesday and the racers reach their hotel only about midnight.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens, who took the fourth stage of the Tour two
weeks ago, said the TVM racers were very tired emotionally. ``For
myself, I am exhausted.''
	   TVM came under the spotlight when it emerged that EPO had been
found in the car of one of its officials in March.
	   Another team came under suspicion Tuesday when Fructs in the seizure later.
	   Earlier in the Tour the Festina team was thrown out of the Tour
after its director admitted a concerted effort to administer banned
substances of illegal drugs to the riders to improve performances.
	   Since then a number of the Festina team riders admitted to using
EPO and other products although the Festina star, Richard Virenque,
has denied using the drugs.
	   After the race restarted Wednesday, Bjarne Riis, the 1996
champion, seemed to be acting as a spokemen for the riders on the
route. He slowed to talk with Leblanc while riding.
	   After the protest last Friday following the rest day, things
appeared to calm down for a few days.
	   There were two stages in the Alps where Pantani took over the
lead from last year's champion Jan Ullrich.
	   But tension mounted Tuesday with the search of the Bigmat car
and the rooms of the TVM riders.
	   The riders became concerned over the report of a police
operation schedule to happen Wednesday night in Aix-Les-Bains
following the completion of the stage.

Ex-interior minister, 11 others convicted of ordering Basque
</HEADLINE>
kidnaping &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Supreme Court convicted a former
interior minister and 11 others Wednesday in the kidnapping of a
businessman, ending a trial that exposed the former Socialist
government's role in a dirty war against Basque separatists.
	   Jose Luis Barrionuevo, who directed internal security from 1982
to 1988, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for ordering the 1983
kidnapping of Segundo Marey.
	   Rafael Vera, ex-secretary of state for security, and a former
Basque security chief Julian Sancristobal were sentenced to 10
years. Nine other former police and ministry officials were given
lesser terms.
	   The verdict is a major embarrassment for Felipe Gonzalez,
Spain's highly popular former prime minister. He denied his
Socialist government had anything to do with the GAL death squad,
which killed 27 people in a campaign against ETA militants and
sympathizers from 1983 to 1987.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence.
	   Gonzalez and his party lost general elections two years ago, in
part due to allegations that his government was behind GAL, a
Spanish acronym for Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups.
	   Many of its targets, like Marey, had no connection with ETA.
	   The French businessman, who is of Basque origin, was mistaken
for a hitman of the militant Basque separatist group ETA. He was
held for 10 days in a mountain shack in northern Spain and then
released.
	   Awarded compensation of 30 million pesetas (about dlrs 200,000)
by the court, Marey said he was ``satisfied'' with the result of
the trial.
	   The Marey trial was the first to directly involve members of the
former government. Barrionuevo and Vera were indicted after two
police officers already sentenced for GAL murders, fingered their
former employers. There are another 12 GAL-linked cases currently
in the courts.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera pleaded innocent during the trial while the
other 10 admitted guilt. The two men have said that they would
appeal if found guilty.
	   Socialist spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters that
the party executive would meet Thursday, stressing that four of the
judges on the 11-member panel had voted against the guilty verdict.
	   A lawyer representing one of the convicted dozen, Manuel
Murillo, said he would solicit clarification of the sentence. This
would keep all 12 out of prison for at least another month.
	   None of the 12 were at the court when the verdict was read.
Outside, a lone man protested that case ever went to trial.

Miner tells his tale after nine days in the dark.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Miner Georg Hainzl realized something was
wrong when water gushed into the underground shaft where he was
working.
	   That began a nine-day ordeal spent in total darkness _ without
food, water or contact with the outside world.
	   The ordeal ended Sunday night when rescuers hauled the
24-year-old miner from the talc mine in the village of Lassing,
where he was buried July 17 in a massive landslide, triggered by
heavy rains.
	   Ten others _ nine miners and a geologist _ remain missing. They
were sent to rescue Hainzl but were themselves buried in a second,
larger landslide a short time later.
	   Hainzl told his story for the first time Wednesday from his
hospital bed in Graz, where doctors said he was in relatively good
condition. He taped answers to questions submitted by reporters,
who were given copies of the tape by hospital authorities.
	   Hainzl said he was working about 60 meters (200 feet) below the
surface when water from the landslide came rushing into the shaft
at the mine, about 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   ``The water came in, it was two, three meters (yards) high,'' he
said. ``It nearly knocked me over.''
	   Hainzl rushed to an underground chamber where miners normally
ate their meals because he knew the chamber had a heavy wooden
table and emergency oxygen tanks. The room was also lit and
included a telephone.
	   ``I called my father and my brothers,'' Hainzl said . ``They
gave me courage and told me to 'Hang on.''' But the electricity and
telephone cables snapped _ leaving him alone and in the dark.
	   Hainzl counted the first hour as it passed, smoked his last
cigarette, then slipped into a ``sort of trance'' and lost track of
time. His mind began to play tricks on him.
	   ``I `saw' my friends bringing me something to drink,'' he said.
``I was already fantasizing.''
	   Although the room was full of muddy water, he dared not drink,
fearing it would make him sick. He thought of his family and
friends _ including his girlfriend, who is three months' pregnant.
	   He told himself ``I have to get through this. There's no other
way.''
	   Throughout the ordeal, he could hear noises from rescue teams
digging through the debris. Little did he know that rescuers had
given up hope of finding anyone alive.
	   Mine officials had in fact ordered 11 coffins, but the town
mayor canceled the request.
	   Finally, he heard a noise, which he thought was water washing
away some of the debris. In fact, it was the sound of a probe which
rescuers were forcing down through a temporary shaft.
	   When he noticed a bit of light appearing through the shaft, he

``It's Georg,'' he said. ``I'm alive!''
	   A few hours later, Hainzl was hauled to the surface. After a
cursory examination, he was taken to hospital in Graz, where he is
being treated for shock and dehydration.
	   ``I feel totally, very good,'' he said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ England World Cup defender Sol Campbell flew to
Milan Wednesday and his startled reaction when spotted by the media
at Heathrow airport prompted speculation that he was due to
transfer to a big Italian club.
	   ``Go away, just go away,'' the tall Tottenham central defender
said when approached by reporters.
	   ``I'm not doing anything so just go. I want you to leave me
alone and just go away. Now.''
	   After collecting his ticket for the flight to Milan, Campbell
asked a member of British Airways staff to help him get onto the
plane quickly ahead of the other passengers and she opened a
security door leading to the aircraft jetty.
	   Holding a suit carrier up to hide his face, Campbell then
hurried through to the plane.
	   Last season Tottenham, which changed managers from Gerry Francis
to Swiss coach Christian Gross, went close to relegation from the
Premier League.
	   Campbell was one of the stars of England's World Cup
performance. He thought he had headed a winner against Argentina in
the second round but it was disallowed for a foul by team-mate Alan
Shearer and England eventually lost in a penalty shootout after a
2-2 tie.

Ukrainian government allocates funds to help Crimean Tatars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government has allocated 1
million hryvna (dlrs 500,000) to help resettle Crimean Tatars who
were expelled from their homeland by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin,
a top Crimean official said Wednesday.
	   The funds would be used to improve gas and water supplies to
Tatar settlements near the Crimean capital of Simferopol and the
town of Yevpatoria, said the prime minister of the Crimean regional
government, Serhiy Kunitsyn.
	   An additional 7 million hryvna (dlrs 3.5 million) would be
provided in the form of construction and other materials and
equipment, he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   A U.N.-sponsored conference of 26 donor countries in Kiev last
month pledged about dlrs 5 million to build infrastructure, create
new jobs and provide for cultural needs of the returning Tatars.
	   Stalin sent Crimean Tatars to Central Asia in 1944 for allegedly
helping the Nazis in the war against the Soviet Union.
	   Some 260,000 members of the Muslim group have returned in the
past decade but many still don't have Ukrainian citizenship. This
has added to ethnic tensions on the Crimea, which is populated
mostly by ethnic Russians.

Basson says apartheid chemical warfare program did `good work'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The mastermind behind a secret
chemical and biological warfare program told a panel investigating
apartheid-era abuse Wednesday that his scientists had done ``good
work.''
	   Dr. Wouter Basson, who was head of a government-sponsored poison
factory that churned out food and drinks laced with deadly
chemicals, spoke Wednesday for the first time before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
	   ``This was an extensive project and very good work was done in
this project,'' Basson told the commission.
	   The poison was intended for government attacks on anti-apartheid
activists including Nelson Mandela, the South African president who
was a political prisoner for 27 years under apartheid.
	   Most of the rest of Basson's three hours before the commission
was spent in legal wrangling over whether he was obligated to
testify.
	   He has objected to giving testimony, saying it could prejudice
his defense in an upcoming trial on charges ranging from drug
possession to conspiracy to murder.
	   A judge on Monday ruled Basson had to testify because evidence
given at commission hearings cannot be used in criminal trials.
	   Basson appeared Wednesday without his usual legal representation
and argued that the hearings could not proceed without his lawyers.
	   The panel's work ends on Friday when its mandate expires, adding
pressure to the schedule for Basson.
	   Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of the commission's investigative unit,
accused Basson of willfully delaying the hearing and warned him it
would continue on Thursday with or without his lawyers.
	   ``Dr. Basson takes a very cavalier approach to these
proceedings,'' he said.
	   The commission was set up in 1995, a year after all-race
elections ended apartheid, and is charged with uncovering the truth
about abuses by all sides in the fight against white rule.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A head-on collision between a passenger
bus and a loaded truck on a busy Bangladesh highway killed at least
12 people and injured 30 others, officials said Wednesday.
	   A district official at Comilla, 88 kilometers (55 miles)
southeast of the capital Dhaka, said a speeding passenger bus from
the southeastern Chittagong city rammed into the truck Tuesday on
the road leading to Dhaka.
	   An eyewitness said nine bus passengers were killed on the spot
while three others died on the way to the hospital.
	   The driver of the bus is believed to have died in the accident.

EU proposes duty on imports of U.S. corn gluten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union moved Wednesday to
impose a duty on imports of U.S. corn gluten into the 15-nation
bloc in retaliation for a U.S. quota on imports of EU wheat gluten.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive branch, wants to impose a
duty of 5 European currency units (dlrs 5.5) per metric ton on the
annual import of 2.73 million tons of U.S. corn gluten.
	   ``The measure won't enter into force for three years, under
World Trade Organization rules,'' said EU agriculture spokesman
Gerard Kiely. The Commission proposal must be approved by EU
agriculture ministers.
	   Each year, the EU imports about 5 million tons of U.S. corn
gluten, which is used in animal feed. These imports are currently
duty free.
	   The U.S. quota on wheat gluten imports from the EU was
introduced June 1. It will cost the EU industry at least 13.65
million ecu (dlrs 15 million) a year, the Commission said.
	   The proposed EU duty on U.S. corn gluten imports would have the
same financial impact on the U.S. corn gluten industry, the
Commission noted.
	   The EU and the United States often bicker over trade issues and
regularly accuse each other of protectionism.

Paris Saint-Germain to sign Nigerian Okocha
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris Saint-Germain, rebuilding in a bid to
recapture the French league title, is set to sign Nigerian
midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha, club officials said Wednesday.
	   The playmaker, who starred for Nigeria in the World Cup and
currently plays for Turkish club Fenerbahce, will be presented
officially by the club before a friendly match Thursday night
against current champion, Lens.
	   However, club officials said Okocha still had to sign a
contract, and gave no further details.
	   The French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday reported that PSG
would pay a French transfer record of 95 million francs (dlrs 15.8
million) for the Nigerian.
	   FIFA selected Okocha as a reserve for its 22-man ceremonial
World Cup all-star squad for France 98.
	   Marseille has on its current roster the two most expensive
transfers French soccer history, having paid 75 million francs
(dlrs 12.6 million) each for Italian international Fabrizio
Ravenelli and former Metz star Robert Pires.
	   PSG, the country's richest and best-supported club, came a
disappointing seventh in the French standings last season.
	   Since then, it has signed German international defender
Christian Worns, Brazilian forward Adailton and French
international goalkeeper Bernard Lama in its bid to recapture the
title.

Pakistan proposes resumption of talks with India

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The prime ministers of India and
Pakistan agreed Wednesday to resume formal talks on their
territorial and other disputes, ending a yearlong stalemate at
their first face-to-face talks since they stepped up the regional
arms race by ordering nuclear tests.
	   ``Nawaz Sharif and I have agreed that the dialogue process
should be resumed,'' said Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India after
meeting his Pakistani counterpart. ``We have directed our foreign
secretaries to meet today and tomorrow'' to work out how to
proceed.
	   The agreement to resume talks between the senior foreign
ministry bureaucrats was intended to go some way toward easing
tensions raised when India and Pakistan each set off a series of
underground nuclear explosions in May.
	   The 75-minute meeting at a seafront hotel in Sri Lanka's capital
city was held during a break in a seven-nation regional summit.
	   ``I had a very good meeting,'' Sharif said, speaking to
reporters after Vajpayee left. But he said India needed to show
more flexibility on the question of Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan
territory over which the two countries have fought two of their
three wars.
	   ``Kashmir is the core issue. The sooner it is resolved, it is
better for the two countries,'' he said, repeating his call for
third-party mediation.
	   It also was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office in March,
pledging to step up the fight against what India calls a
Pakistan-backed insurgency by Muslim separatists in Kashmir.
Pakistan denies active involvement but gives diplomatic and
political support to the militants.
	   Earlier, Sharif and Vajpayee sounded conciliatory as they spoke
at the summit inauguration of the South Asia Association for
Regional Cooperation.
	   ``The inescapable reality that confronts us today is that South
Asia is now nuclearized,'' said Sharif. ``It is for us to steer
away from the gathering storm.''
	   Sharif suggested a resumption of the talks in his speech, and
the agreement was tied up during the private talks.
	   The Kashmir issue broke down talks between foreign ministry
officials last September.
	   The Indian leader said his talks with Sharif Wednesday were
``wide ranging and covered many issues, including Kashmir and
terrorism.''
	   Asked if there was any discussion future testing, Vajpayee said,
``Both India and Pakistan have already declared a moratorium on
conducting further nuclear tests.''
	   In his speech earlier, Vajpayee discussed the nuclear question,
even though it was not on the summit agenda. He reasserted India's
commitment to a nuclear free world. India has said it will not give
up its own right to develop nuclear weapons unless all other
countries do.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif talks overshadowed the broader summit topic
of economic cooperation in South Asia, a region that is home to
one-fifth of humanity and 40 percent of its poorest people.
	   The seaside capital of Sri Lanka was partially shut down by
police on guard against any attack by Tamil separatists, who are
fighting a 15-year-old war for independence in the north of this
Indian Ocean island.
	   The SAARC groups India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and the Maldives.

Yemeni government approves capital punishment law for kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's government approved a draft law
Wednesday imposing the death penalty for kidnapping, the latest
attempt to curb abductions of foreigners.
	   Since 1991, tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners to
pressure the government to provide better services and money. So
far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including sending
armed security guards with tourists, have proved futile.
	   The draft law will go to parliament for ratification during the
first week of August, San`a radio reported. Executions in Yemen are
usually carried out by firing squad.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. But the hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
emerge from the ordeal inconvenienced but unhurt.
	   The last kidnapping occurred July 22 when tribesmen abducted two
Belgian tourists. They were released the next day.

Kohl accuses opponents of stealing his ideas in German election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HBG101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETER-ORDING, Germany (AP) _ Still trailing in the polls two
months ahead of national elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to
belittle the opposition Wednesday by saying they had co-opted his
party's tough law-and-order stance.
	   The main opposition Social Democrats unveiled a platform this
week that calls for deporting foreigners convicted of crimes in
Germany and for locking delinquent youth up in homes to keep them
out of trouble.
	   During a campaign swing to the northern coastal resort of St.
Peter-Ording, Kohl claimed the Social Democrats got those ideas
from his Christian Democratic Union.
	   ``I've never experienced such a characterless campaign from''
the Social Democrats as this year's, Kohl told a crowd of a few
thousand residents and tourists. ``We don't mind when they copy, as
long as they acknowledge the source of the ideas,'' he said.
	   The Social Democrats also drew criticism from their potential
coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens party, which said
the Social Democrats are giving voters the false impression that
crime can be fought through tougher punishment.
	   The Social Democrats and Kohl's party have ``begun a competition
for the biggest sheriff's star,'' Greens spokeswoman Kerstin
Mueller said in Bonn.
	   Mueller said strict punishment for minors should be reserved
only for extreme cases. Better integration of foreigners must take
priority over deporting those who commit crimes, she said.
	   The focus on law and order in this year's election campaign is
seen as a response to the growing appeal of far-right parties,
especially in economically depressed eastern Germany, where
unemployment hovers around 20 percent.
	   The anti-foreigner German People's Union won about 13 percent of
the vote in a state election in April with slogans such as ``German
jobs for Germans'' and ``Out with foreign bandits.''

Dutch chemicals giant posts 5 percent profit jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Boosted by strong pharmaceutical
activities, Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV said Wednesday its
net profit in the second quarter rose 5 percent to 483 million
guilders (dlrs 242 million).
	   Operating income rose in all divisions in the quarter, but
especially the pharmaceuticals division, which posted an increase
of 11 percent to 258 million guilders (dlrs 129 million). Akzo said
the Organon unit was the main contributor.
	   For the remainder of the year, Akzo said it expects growth to
continue, although the increase in earnings of ongoing operations
in the second half will slow compared with the first half of this
year.
	   Akzo's Deputy Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Friedrich
Frohlich said he expected a strong performance for the second half
of 1998 as well.
	   The financial crisis in Asia had a ``slight negative'' impact on
earnings, the Dutch company said. Frohlich said the impact of the
Asian crisis had hurt net income by 1 percent to 3 percent in the
second quarter.

Nuclear waste plant short of coal because of miners' blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A blockade of the Trans-Siberian Railway by unpaid
miners has stopped coal supplies to a nuclear waste processing
plant and could endanger the delivery of spent reactors, news
agencies reported Wednesday.
	   The huge Mayak plant in the Ural Mountains is fueled by coal,
but supplies cannot get past the blockade, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said. Hot water supplies have been cut to homes in the city
of Chelyabinsk to maintain power to the plant.
	   Any sudden cut in energy to the plant could cause a nuclear
accident, said Mayak's acting director, Alexander Suslov, according
to ITAR-Tass.
	   Mayak, also known as Chelyabinsk-65, was created in the late
1940s to make plutonium for the first Soviet bombs. It stopped
producing plutonium in 1992, but continues to produce isotopes and
reprocess spent nuclear fuel and is engaged in dismantling nuclear
weapons and storing fission material.
	   Suslov said the miners' blockade could also interfere with the
delivery of spent nuclear reactors removed from submarines in the
Far East.
	   ``Reactors removed from nuclear submarines have been loaded in
recent days on a special train in the Far East to be carried to the
Mayak station,'' Suslov said.
	   While the reactors have been packed safely for transport, their
containers were not designed to withstand the frequent stops and
starts trains are experiencing on the Trans-Siberian, he said.
	   Passenger trains on the Trans-Siberian will also be re-routed
after miners broke a promise to stop only freight trains, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Striking miners halted a passenger train Tuesday night that was
taking children to southern Russia for medical treatment, ITAR-Tass
said. The train was allowed through after lengthy negotiations, it
said.
	   Meanwhile, disgruntled coal miners in the Russian Far East held
the director of their mine hostage for a second day Wednesday,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Workers at the Nagornaya mine in the town of Partizansk have not
been paid for nine months. Eighteen miners there are also staging a
hunger strike.
	   Coal miners have staged periodic strikes since May to demand
their overdue wages. However, the protests have been largely
uncoordinated and have not inflicted significant damage on the
economy.

Land mine kills nine in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ A powerful explosion rocked a village
market in a restive area of eastern India on Wednesday, killing
nine people and injured 19 others.
	   Police said the explosion in the street market at Dhamdhama, a
village 90 kilometers (55 miles) west of Gauhati, the state capital
of Assam, was triggered by outlawed militants from the Bodo tribe.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility.
	   Bodo rebels have been fighting since 1986 to carve out an
autonomous homeland from Assam, which would give tribal authorities
more control over their lands. More than 1,000 people have been
killed in the insurgency.
	   Wounded shoppers were hospitalized and the military rushed
reinforcements to the region, a stronghold of two Bodo militant
groups, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and the Bodo
Liberation Tiger group, officials said.
	   The Bodos carry out frequent attacks on the Indian army and the
minority Santhal tribe in Assam. Last month rebels bombed a vital
railroad track and two bridges in narrow strip of land that
connects India's northeastern states with the rest of the country.

Doctors say Suu Kyi dehydrating as standoff enters sixth night
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with regime saying no health problem with Suu
Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Described by colleagues as ill and
running low on food, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi faced a sixth
night of cramped, uneasy sleep in her car Wednesday while Myanmar's
military maintained its roadblock.
	   In a briefing for diplomats in Yangon, the military regime said
she had no health problems, and that the democracy leader's trip
outside the Myanmar capital had been stopped to avert possible
disturbances, diplomatic sources said.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two
drivers Friday morning as the group headed toward Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) west of the capital, to meet members of her
party, the National League for Democracy.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has refused to return to
Yangon, and the military won't let her proceed. This is her third
attempt this month to travel to the provinces.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday
in her car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, said she is showing signs of dehydration.
	   A press release Wednesday from her political party said her
health was ``failing.''
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, says
she is trying to foment unrest.
	   After the briefing in Yangon, one diplomat quoted senior
military officer Lt. Col. Hla Min as saying: ``There is no health
problem with Aung San Suu Kyi. Necessary measures are being taken
in cooperation with the NLD leaders in Yangon to look after her
health.''
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hla Min
did not respond to questions by some ambassadors on whether they
would be allowed to visit her.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors asked that they be allowed to monitor her
condition twice a day and that she be provided with facilities to
wash, the NLD statement said.
	   The military said the doctors could visit Wednesday, and it has
provided her with drinking water.
	   ``It is the hope of the government that (Suu Kyi) will realize
the folly of her uncompromising and belligerent stand,'' a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``More importantly, foreign governments and news agencies should
also desist in fanning the fire by refraining from backing the NLD
up all the way and all the time and seeing things the NLD
leadership sees,'' he said.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week the United
States will hold Myanmar's military directly responsible for Suu
Kyi's health and welfare.
	   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Foley, in Sydney,
Australia, with Albright, said, ``We understand there may be a
question about the deterioration of her health. ... It's time to
find a way out of this situation.''
	   United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
said Tuesday there are legitimate concerns for Suu Kyi's health and
safety.
	   And at the Manila meeting this week, foreign ministers from
Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Union pressured Myanmar to end human rights abuses and let Suu Kyi
proceed.

Suspended shot putter says he didn't know substance was banned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM VERTUNO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) _ Suspended shot putter Randy
Barnes is pleading lack of knowledge in his positive doping test,
saying he did not know a nutritional supplement was banned under
IAAF rules.
	   ``I would never knowingly take a prohibited substance,'' Barnes
said Tuesday in a prepared statement.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Monday that
Barnes, who won the gold medal in the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta and
holds the world indoor and outdoor records, had tested positive for
androstenedione.
	   Barnes was given an out-of-competition doping test in Charleston
April 1.
	   ``I did not receive notice from USATF (U.S.A. Track and Field)
or the IAAF that this supplement was prohibited until after the
drug test,'' Barnes said.
	   Androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement, increases the
body's ability to produce its own testosterone naturally.
	   ``I would never knowingly take a prohibited substance, not even
a legal over-the-counter nutritional supplement like
androstenedione, if I knew it was prohibited by the federations. I
have done nothing morally, ethically, or legally wrong by using
this product.''
	   Barnes' statement did not say how much of the substance he may
have taken in the days leading up to the test.
	   Craig Masback, executive director of USATF, criticized the IAAF
over the suspension of Barnes and sprinter Dennis Mitchell, who the
IAAF said tested positive for testosterone.
	   Masback said USATF will not enforce the IAAF suspension and that
Barnes and Mitchell would ``receive the full support of USATF until
such time as it is determined that they have committed a doping
offense.''
	   Barnes, who previously served a two-year suspension starting in
1991 for the steroid methyltestosterone at a meet the previous year
in Malmo, Sweden, said he does not believe USATF will help him in
this situation. He faces a possible lifetime ban for a second drug
offense.
	   ``I am confident ... the USATF will do nothing to remedy the
wrong done to me here today even though the IAAF has completely
disregarded USATF rules and United States federal law,'' Barnes
said.
	   To evaluate an athlete's drug test, the IAAF divides a urine
sample into two parts. If the first sample tests positive, the
second is used to confirm the original finding.
	   IAAF officials said that only the first sample from Barnes and
Mitchell had been tested. However, that is sufficient to levy a
suspension.
	   If the second samples are positive, the IAAF then rules on the
severity of the punishment pending a hearing by USATF. If the B
sample is negative, the athletes are cleared.
	   Barnes' lawyer, Greg Duplantis, said Barnes was never told by
the IAAF that the substance was prohibited and still has not been
notified by the IAAF of his suspension.
	   ``(The) IAAF knows I'm his attorney and have sent me nothing,''
Duplantis said Tuesday evening. ``We've received nothing of an
official nature that he's suspended.''
	   Duplantis said the drug was not on the 1997 list of prohibited
substances and that he did not receive an updated list for 1998
until a few days ago.
	   ``I'd really like the IAAF to show some evidence they made some
attempt to tell Mr. Barnes that this was a prohibited substance, or
anybody else for that matter,'' Duplantis said.

Police believe killer might be chemical expert: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The killer who poisoned a pot of curry at a local
festival in western Japan with cyanide and killed four people might
have been an expert on the deadly chemical, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The economic newspaper Nihon Keizai quoted investigators that
they suspected a chemical expert because no other food or drinks
served at the gathering Saturday in Wakayama, a small coastal city
453 kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The killer deliberately chose a pot of curry so that its strong
flavor would make the chemical unnoticeable, the report said. When
solid, cyanide smells like almond, but gives strong stinking smell
once dissolved in liquid.
	   Police would not confirm the report.
	   Two leaders of the residents' association, aged 65 and 53 died.
The poisoning also killed a 10-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
	   As of Wednesday afternoon, 37 of the 63 sickened residents were
still hospitalized, including three in intensive care units,
according to an East Wakayama Police Department spokesman who
identified himself only by his family name, Koyama.
	   In a separate report, national newspaper Yomiuri quoted chemical
experts as saying that only a spoonful, or an estimated 5 grams _
enough to kill 25 people _ of powdered cyanide was sprinkled in the
curry.
	   The killings Saturday were big news in Japan, and the fear that
the killer aimed to murder as many as possible has prompted
comparisons to the1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway that
killed 12 people.

Imprisoned mayor approved as candidate for new vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The disqualified mayor of Nizhny Novgorod, who is
serving a six-year prison sentence for embezzlement, was registered
Wednesday as a candidate in new elections.
	   Andrei Klimentyev was elected mayor of Russia's third-largest
city in March. Election officials invalidated his victory after
President Boris Yeltsin expressed concern about the balloting
results.
	   Klimentyev was convicted in May on charges of document forgery,
embezzling part of a government loan to a local shipbuilding plant,
and appropriating a large share of the plant's stock.
	   New mayoral elections have been called for Sept. 17. The city
election commission approved Klimentyev's candidacy on Wednesday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Supporters have collected twice as many signatures as necessary
to register a candidate, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Klimentyev appealed his conviction to the Russian Supreme Court,
which is to hold a hearing on Thursday.
	   Klimentyev was convicted last year of embezzling dlrs 2.5
million and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was freed because
of time served in pre-trial detention.
	   He has also been involved in a dispute with Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov, whom he accused of taking dlrs 818,200 in
bribes while serving as Nizhny Novgorod governor. Nemtsov sued
Klimentyev for libel.

Radio Free Europe/Liberty to broadcast into Iran and Iraq out of
</HEADLINE>
secret location

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Radio Free Europe/Liberty will
start broadcasting into Iran and Iraq this fall out of a secret
location in the Czech Republic, station officials said Wednesday.
	   The American-sponsored radio station began transmitting from
Munich, Germany in 1951, spreading uncensored news to
Soviet-controlled countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold
War between the Americans and the Soviets.
	   In May of this year, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's
intention to create new services that will be beamed into Iran and
Iraq.
	   Because both American and Czech officials are concerned the
radio's new service could become the target of terrorist attacks,
the new departments will be housed in a separate building that is
easier to protect, said RFE/L spokeswoman Alena Fendrychova. She
declined to provide further details for security reasons.
	   RFE/L moved to its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following the
collapse of communism six years earlier, and began broadcasting out
of a prominent downtown building that once served as Parliament of
federal Czechoslovakia.

EU approves British aid for production of Jaguar car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday approved 43 million pounds (dlrs 47
million) in British regional aid for Jaguar Cars Ltd.
	   The funds will help finance the entry into production of the
Jaguar X-400 model at the Ford Halewood plant in Merseyside, a
region in northwest Britain, beginning 2001, the Commission said in
a statement.
	   The EU executive arm found that the aid was justified since the
project will help safeguard some 2,400 jobs and could lead to the
creation of 1,000 new jobs.
	   Furthermore, ``the handicaps of investing at Halewood, in
comparison to alternative locations, outweighed the aid amount.''
	   The Jaguar X-400 will compete with the BMW-3 series and the Audi
A4. The car will be produced only at Ford Halewood, where output of
the Ford Escort will cease in 2000, the statement said.
	   The EU Commission can veto state and regional aid plans it
judges violate fair competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.
	   Merseyside is a region that suffers from a skills deficiency and
has a higher than average unemployment rate, according to the
Commission.

Bangladesh flood begins to swallow Dhaka shantytowns
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ The raging flood that had submerged
huge parts of Bangladesh was knocking on Shahnoor Bano's door. Then
she had no door.
	   Bano escaped her house as it sank under the floodwaters in a
shantytown with her husband and three children. They took shelter
in a relief camp when the Buriganga River swallowed up the homes of
thousands of other slum dwellings on the fringes of the Bangladesh
capital, Dhaka.
	   At least 29 new deaths were reported Wednesday from flood-hit
areas across the country, raising the death toll in three weeks to
242. It was the worst flooding in 10 years in Bangladesh, a delta
nation that often is swamped during the annual monsoon season.
	   As the flooding threatened to submerge more areas of Dhaka,
nearly 10,000 victims were relocated to several camps in this city
of nine million people, officials said.
	   Some 3,000 are at the makeshift camp with Bano in a closed
tannery complex three miles (five kilometers) from the city center.
Bano, 30, is now desperate for food, drinking water and medicines,
in a daily struggle against heavy odds. Bano's husband _ the
family's lone breadwinner _ is sick and cannot work.
	   Bano said food and medicine at the camp were in short supply,
and people were increasingly falling ill with diarrhea and fever.
``Not much relief has come from the government,'' said volunteer
Toufique Unnesa, sitting by Bano's side.
	   The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC)
said the flooding in Dhaka had worsened as water cascaded from the
Himalayas down three rivers flowing through the city _ the
Buriganga, Turag and Sitalakhaya.
	   The floods spread in 19 districts, but the water level was
receding in 12 other districts, the government's monitoring center
said.
	   An official at the Disaster Relief Ministry said over 81,600
flood victims had been housed in 226 temporary shelters and camps
across the country by Tuesday. More than 18,000 doctors, paramedics
and health workers were scouring flood-hit areas to check possible
outbreaks of diarrhea, dysentery and fever, he said.

Riders stop Tour de France again in protest over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JOURIOZ, France (AP) - Angry cyclists stopped racing on
the Tour de France on Wednesday in their second protest over a
doping scandal that has plagued the competition.
	   The riders stopped cycling just after starting the 17th stage
Wednesday at the 32-kilometer (20th mile) of the leg from
Albertville to Aix-les-Bains.
	   After starting very slowly, the 33 riders began taking off their
race numbers to protest against the drug investigations on the tour
that have demoralized the riders.
	   Members of the TVM team were taken away by police Tuesday for
testing that lasted until almost midnight (2200 GMT).
	   It was the second time in the race that the riders have
protested. Last Friday the riders stopped the race at the start of
the the 12th stage in Tarascon-sur-Ariege. The riders delayed the
start of the race two hours.

Hong Kong bankruptcies up 14.9 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Bankruptcies in Hong Kong in this year's first
six months increased 14.9 percent from January-June last year, the
government said Wednesday.
	   In a report on liquidations ordered by the courts in
January-June, Robin Hearder said the regional economic crisis
played a part in the increase, but courts also have given more time
to hearing bankruptcy cases, effectively increasing the turnover.
	   Hearder, the official in charge of overseeing company
liquidations, said the 691 bankruptcies handled by the courts in
this year's first half included 326 compulsory company liquidations
and 365 personal bankruptcies, compared to 280 compulsory
liquidations and 321 personal bankruptcies a year earlier.
	   The liquidated companies were mainly in garments, construction,
trade, and transportation.
	   ``The number of winding-up and bankruptcy orders made by the
court in June alone was 161, as compared to the average monthly
figure of 106 for January to May,'' Hearder said.
	   In the first half, he said, 36.7 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 4.7 million) were paid to shareholders of 129 companies
declared insolvent, down from 79.1 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 10.1 million) in 113 insolvencies last year.
	   Under Hong Kong law, companies declared bankrupt must pay off
shareholders with a certain percentage of what is left after the
court's insolvency judgment.
	   Eight arrest warrants were issued in the first half of this year
against uncooperative individuals forced into liquidation, lifting
the total number of arrest warrants outstanding to 38, Hearder
said.

West Indian under fire from own fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Warwickshire cricket fans booed and
jeered team captain Brian Lara off the field after another batting
failure. Yet team officials are confident that the West Indian star
will bounce back.
	   Lara suffered the indignity of being blamed by his own fans for
his team's exit from the NatWest Trophy one-day competition
Tuesday. Several Warwickshire supporters at Leicestershire's Grace
Road shouted abuse at the cricket superstar.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman when he signed as
Warwickshire captain for the season, has an average of only 22 and
has twice been fined for arriving late for matches.
	   The West Indies captain was a hero when he played for
Warwickshire in 1994 and scored a world record 501 in a county
championship game against Durham.
	   But he was a villain Tuesday when he was out for 14 and his team
crumbled to be all out for 98 to present Leicestershire with an
easy victory in the NatWest Trophy quarterfinal.
	   ``I seem to be one of the most hated people here. I've failed
Warwickshire this year,'' Lara said after the quarterfinal.
	   But he said he was not going to relinquish the Warwickshire
captaincy despite his poor form.
	   ``I'm not going to chuck it in _ why should I?'' he said. ``I'm
the leader, the one who expects to take the brunt of the
responsibility. I'm prepared to take that.
	   ``I've got broad shoulders and I've been through many adverse
situations before.''
	   Warwickshire chief executive Dennis Amiss said he wanted Lara to
retain the captaincy for the rest of the season. A former standout
England batsman, Amiss said Lara's position was not under threat.
	   ``When you appoint a player such as Brian Lara, with his
reputation and record, you don't expect him to go through a season
having the bad run he has had,'' Amiss said Wednesday.
	   ``He needs to score runs, he is under tremendous pressure. When
you lose everyone criticises the captain and when you win everyone
says what a great skipper you are.
	   ``What has happened this season is hurting him as much as it is
hurting us. We will try to get it right but he is captain of the
club and we want him to continue.''

European diplomats arrive in Kosovo after Serb battlefield gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs trying to take Junik, new clashes in
Djakovica area, Serbs reported thwarting KLA attempt to block key
highway. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's leading Albanian politician
said Wednesday he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, which would be a major step
toward peace talks on the future of the rebellious province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova gave no details of the compromise plan except to
say it would include ``all political forces'' and ``create
pre-conditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav
government.
	   Meanwhile new clashes were reported in the border region of
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina, and the
situation around Malisevo, a rebel stronghold captured by Serb
forces Tuesday, was described as dramatic after tens of thousands
fled.
	   Rugova did not specify whether the envisaged coalition would
include the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence and which has rejected Rugova's leadership.
	   His announcement came on the heels of several Serb victories in
an offensive launched Friday night. Police and army troops have
managed to regain control of key areas of the province that had
been under rebel control, a development that may lead the rebels to
be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA posts of defense and interior _ meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Although Yugoslavia would likely not recognize Rugova's
``government,'' it could form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team
to negotiate the status of the province with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of American and European
diplomacy since Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown on Albanian
militants in February. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which
together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million-strong
population.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation, which arrived here in the
latest international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rohan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   ``Our message is very clear,'' delegation leader Rohan said
Wednesday. ``The violence has to stop immediately.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, heavily armed Serb forces, backed by
helicopters, were trying to capture another KLA bastion, Junik,
where about 1,000 fighters are trapped, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   In the Djakovica area near the border, Serb forces were shelling
from afar villages believed to be KLA strongholds. No reliable
casualty figures were available.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from Malisevo, a central
rebel stronghold. Tens of thousands who fled into nearby hills and
forests were forced to spend the second night in the open.
	   Four KLA members were killed and seven captured in overnight
clashes with Serb police near a village just north of Malisevo as
they were trying to block the Kijevo-Malisevo highway, Serbian
media reported.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the past 10 days has increased to
at least 100,000 the number of civilians forced to flee their
homes, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.

Bond rating agency Moody's plans to lower Ukraine's credit rating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The U.S. bond rating agency Moody's will
consider lowering its credit rating for Ukraine.
	   Moody's Investors Service said Ukraine's B2 country rating for
foreign currency debt and B3 rating for foreign currency bank
deposits have been placed ``on review for possible downgrade.''
	   The statement, issued Tuesday, followed the agency's recent
warning that its outlook for credit ratings assigned for Ukraine
had shifted from ``stable'' to ``negative.''
	   Moody's cited depletion of Ukraine's hard currency reserves as a
primary cause for lowering the rating, which ``implies an increase
in the risk of default on its foreign debt obligations.''
	   The agency expressed fear that Ukraine's reserves could run out
before the end of September if no foreign aid were received.
	   The reserves of Ukraine's central bank shrank by some 15 percent
to about dlrs 1.75 billion in recent months due to efforts to
support the national currency. The hryvna has been under pressure
from foreign investors withdrawing their money from the country.
	   The government is currently negotiating a dlrs 2.5 billion loan
with the International Monetary Fund, and hopes to borrow abroad in
August to cover its mounting debt obligations: repaying a dlrs 450
million foreign bond and redeeming more than dlrs 500 million in
government bonds. Some experts have speculated that the country may
fail to repay such a high debt.
	   Ukraine's current B2 bond rating, which the country shares with
several former Soviet bloc nations, is the worst among European
countries and former Soviet republics that Moody's has graded to
date.
	   Japan Rating and Investment Information rating agency recently
lowered its credit rating for Ukraine from BB+ to BB-.
	   Ratings assigned by international bond rating agencies
characterize a country's financial credibility and largely
determine the interest rate at which it can borrow from foreign
lenders.
	   The low ratings forced Ukraine earlier this year to borrow more
than dlrs 1 billion in foreign loans at annual interest rates of up
to 17 percent.

Report: Congo's president urges calm after Rwandan departure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila warned his army
to remain orderly following the pullout of Rwandan soldiers who
helped topple the country's former dictator last year,
state-controlled radio reported Wednesday.
	   ``The departure of the Rwandan military technicians must not
lead anybody to make the mistake that the time has come to create
chaos,'' Kabila said in a Tuesday address to military officers,
Voice of the People radio said.
	   Rwandan soldiers began flying out of Congo's capital on July 22,
several days before the Congolese government publicly announced it
had ordered the Rwandans out of the country.
	   A Rwandan military spokesman however said his country was
pulling its troops out of Congo, and had not been ordered out.
	   ``The Congolese leaders wanted us to stay,'' military spokesman
Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro said in Rwanda's capital of Kigali. ``We
wanted to leave it to the Congo to sort out their own problems.''
	   Kabila, however, said the soldiers had been told to leave in
order to ``create orderly relations'' between the two countries,
which he said retained a useful alliance, the radio reported.
	   ``From now on, we have to establish new forms of military
cooperation that are legally and constitutionally approved by the
parliament of each country,'' Kabila said.
	   Rwandan troops were an important part of Kabila's rebel
movement, which eventually drove longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko into exile in May 1997 following an eight-month
rebellion. Mobutu later died and Kabila renamed the country Congo.
	   Ties between Rwanda and Congo have soured since then amid
disputes over Kabila's administration and over security problems in
eastern Congo, where ethnic Hutu rebels have launched attacks on
the Rwandan government.
	   Some Rwandan soldiers remained in Congo after Kabila took over
the country, though it was not immediately clear how many were
still in the country when the order was given.
	   Kabila said 3,500 Rwandan soldiers were alongside 57,500
Congolese rebels when they captured the capital. The Congolese
president now boasts a military with 140,000 soldiers, although
these figures have not been independently confirmed.

West Indian under fire from own fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Warwickshire cricket fans booed and
jeered team captain Brian Lara off the field after another batting
failure. Yet team officials are confident that the West Indian star
will bounce back.
	   Lara suffered the indignity of being blamed by his own fans for
his team's exit from the NatWest Trophy one-day competition
Tuesday. Several Warwickshire supporters at Leicestershire's Grace
Road shouted abuse at the cricket superstar.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman when he signed as
Warwickshire captain for the season, has an average of only 22 and
has twice been fined for arriving late for matches.
	   The West Indies captain was a hero when he played for
Warwickshire in 1994 and scored a world record 501 in a county
championship game against Durham.
	   But he was a villain Tuesday when he was out for 14 and his team
crumbled to be all out for 98 to present Leicestershire with an
easy victory in the NatWest Trophy quarterfinal.
	   ``I seem to be one of the most hated people here. I've failed
Warwickshire this year,'' Lara said after the quarterfinal.
	   But he said he was not going to relinquish the Warwickshire
captaincy despite his poor form.
	   ``I'm not going to chuck it in _ why should I?'' he said. ``I'm
the leader, the one who expects to take the brunt of the
responsibility. I'm prepared to take that.
	   ``I've got broad shoulders and I've been through many adverse
situations before.''
	   Warwickshire chief executive Dennis Amiss said he wanted Lara to
retain the captaincy for the rest of the season. A former standout
England batsman, Amiss said Lara's position was not under threat.
	   ``When you appoint a player such as Brian Lara, with his
reputation and record, you don't expect him to go through a season
having the bad run he has had,'' Amiss said Wednesday.
	   ``He needs to score runs, he is under tremendous pressure. When
you lose everyone criticises the captain and when you win everyone
says what a great skipper you are.
	   ``What has happened this season is hurting him as much as it is
hurting us. We will try to get it right but he is captain of the
club and we want him to continue.''

Dispute between Ajax, De Boer twins continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The predicament for twins Frank
and Ronald de Boer seems simple: they want to leave Ajax Amsterdam,
but the club won't let them.
	   The protracted contract squabble was dragged before an
independent arbitration commission this week, and an agreement was
still not in sight on Wednesday.
	   ``They are good players and Ajax wants to keep them,'' Ajax's
Christa Overtoom said.
	   ``They've made it clear, they definitely won't come back for
Ajax,'' said Rob de Leede, spokesman for the Royal Netherlands
Soccer Association (KNVB).
	   After negotiations with the club failed, the twins took their
case to the KNVB arbitration commission.
	   Both sides presented their arguments before the three-member
panel Tuesday. A decision was expected later this week.
	   The commission's decision will be legally binding, De Leede
said.
	   The twins have requested to be released from their contracts
with Ajax, which run through the 2003-2004 season.
	   ``Ajax was a great book, but we've read it,'' Ronald de Boer was
quoted as saying by the national daily De Volkskrant in its
Wednesday editions.
	   Their lawyer Harro Knijff said the twins weren't exactly proud
of being in a legal dispute with the club they've been with for 14
years.
	   ``They consider this as a black day in their carrier,'' Knijff
told De Volkskrant.
	   The contracts, signed in March 1997, also contain a clause
stipulating that the twins cannot seek a transfer before 2001.
	   But several top European club are seeking the twins.
	   A delegation from FC Barcelona attended Tuesday's hearing,
reported De Volkskrant, adding the Spanish powerhouse is willing to
pay a dlrs 22 million transfer fee for both De Boers.

Yemeni government approves capital punishment law for kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's government approved a draft law
Wednesday imposing the death penalty for kidnapping, the latest
attempt to curb abductions of foreigners.
	   Since 1991, tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners to
pressure the government to provide better services and money. So
far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including sending
armed security guards with tourists, have proved futile.
	   The draft law will go to parliament for ratification during the
first week of August, San`a radio reported. Executions in Yemen are
usually carried out by firing squad.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. But the hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
emerge from the ordeal inconvenienced but unhurt.
	   The last kidnapping occurred July 22 when tribesmen abducted two
Belgian tourists. They were released the next day.

Cargo handler lifts embargo on all imports on passenger flights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with lifting of embargo on all imports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The main cargo handler at Hong Kong's troubled
airport said Wednesday that its efforts to resume normal service
were progressing well, enabling it to lift all limits on imports
brought in by passenger flights.
	   While airport officials managed to iron out most problems at the
passenger terminal shortly after the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok
airport opened July 6, cargo-handling has been a much tougher
problem.
	   A series of troubles at its new terminal forced the main cargo
handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, to limit imports and
exports, and to reopen some facilities at the old, downtown Kai Tak
airport.
	   Anthony Charter, the cargo handler's managing director, said in
a statement that the company's operations were ``progressing
well,'' and it expected to be back at full speed by the end of
August.
	   ``We are entering into phase two of our recovery plan. ... We
will now reach the target of processing up to 75 percent of our
customers' projected demand,'' Charter said.
	   The company had imposed an embargo shortly after the airport
opening on all air cargo except perishable goods and lifesaving
material.
	   Beginning Wednesday, it announced that two pallets of general
cargo would be allowed on each passenger plane. Later in the day,
it said all import limitations were being removed.
	   Both the government and the cargo handler have come in for
scathing criticism from legislators and businessmen who fear the
problems will further hurt Hong Kong's economy. Air cargo is an
important industry, and Hong Kong already is suffering from
recession and unemployment that has risen to a 15-year high of 4.5
percent.
	   Late Wednesday, legislators formally approved an independent
committee including prominent government critics to determine who
was responsible for problems at Chek Lap Kok. The 13-member
committee will work independently of the commission appointed by
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   During an inspection tour of the new airport Wednesday morning,
Tung Chee-hwa said the airport was now handling ``about 80
percent'' of the normal daily average of air cargo.
	   ``The government will continue to offer necessary assistance to
the (air cargo) industry to facilitate a smooth recovery,'' Tung
said in a statement after the tour.
	   The government's secretary for economic services, Stephen Ip,
told legislators that small- and medium-size businesses will suffer
about 60 percent of the losses due to the cargo problems.
	   Some of them may face cash-flow problems, weakened bargaining
power or reduced competitiveness, he said.
	   The cargo company's plans called for it to be at 75 percent of
the normal capacity of about 4,000 tons a day by the end of July,
using facilities at both the old and new airports; full capacity
using both airports by mid-August; and 100 percent capacity using
only the new airport by the end of August.

Report: Entrepreneur faces trial in China for e-mail accounts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with additional arrests reported,
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in China have arrested a young
computer engineer for providing 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to
a U.S.-based Internet democracy magazine, a human rights group said
Wednesday.
	   Lin Hai, the 30-year-old founder and manager of a computer
software company in Shanghai, was arrested on charges of ``inciting
the overthrow of state power'' and will soon be tried, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Conviction generally carries a penalty of up to five years
imprisonment.
	   Lin's reported arrest highlights the government's determination
to prevent use of the Internet as a tool to challenge Communist
Party authority and to maintain strict control over information.
China now has more than 1 million Internet subscribers _ mostly
drawn from the educated elite _ and the number of new users is
growing rapidly.
	   The publishers of ``Tunnel,'' a weekly on-line magazine
featuring dissident writings, were arrested by police in central
Jiangxi province Monday, according to the U.S.-based Chinese
Democratic Party. The party's web site and other pro-democracy
on-line publications have recently been wiped out by destructive
computer programs engineered by China's police, the party said.
	   Shanghai's Internet police division has recently been reinforced
with 150 additional computer experts, the Hong Kong-based center
said. Some Chinese Internet users have found their web access
blocked or even had their computers confiscated by police, the
center said.
	   The Telecommunications Ministry, which operates the servers that
permit access to the Internet, seeks to exert the same heavy-handed
control in cyberspace that it enforces over all print media, radio
and television in China.
	   That includes blocking access to sites posted overseas that are
considered subversive by the government. But Internet users have
found ways to bypass the controls by using foreign accounts or
proxy servers at universities, for example.
	   Pro-democracy Internet magazines that would almost certainly be
shut down by the government reach viewers by first being sent
overseas, then redistributed in China via e-mail.
	   Chinese authorities have moved decisively to close such
loopholes since U.S. President Bill Clinton finished his visit to
China earlier this month, the Information Center said.
	   Shanghai police took Lin, a computer graduate from an
aeronautics technology university in Beijing, from his home on
March 25 for providing the addresses of 30,000 e-mail accounts in
China to the U.S-based electronic pro-democracy magazine ``Big
Reference,'' the center said.
	   The magazine has been placed under electronic siege by Chinese
government-directed electronic interference, the Democratic Justice
Party said.
	   Lin was formally arrested on April 30, the Hong Kong-based group
said. Prosecutors in Shanghai have completed the indictment against
him and plan to hand the case over shortly to the Shanghai
Intermediate People's Court for trial, the group said.
	   Spokesmen for the Shanghai court, the Shanghai procurators'
office and the Shanghai police said they did not know about the
case.
	   According to his wife, Xu Hong, Lin is being held in a Shanghai
police detention center and has already hired a lawyer for his
defense, the group said.

Chinese quake destroys houses, causes light injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An earthquake has destroyed 19 homes and injured
several people in China's far western Xinjiang region, a government
seismologist said Wednesday.
	   Nine large cracks were opened up in the earth by the magnitude
5.5 earthquake, which hit Baicheng County just after noon (0400
GMT) Tuesday, said Xu Senzhou of the county seismology bureau.
	   Rescue teams from the county government were surveying damage
and distributing emergency supplies in the lightly populated
farming area, Xu said. More than 100 aftershocks have been
registered since the quake, one of them with a magnitude of 3.9.
	   Baicheng lies on the edge of the snowcapped Tian Mountains near
where they slope toward the Tarim Basin, a France-size swath of
desert and wasteland 2,900 kilometers (1,700 miles) west of
Beijing.

European diplomats arrive in Kosovo after Serb battlefield gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Serbs trying to take Junik, new
clashes in Djakovica area, Serbs reported thwarting KLA attempt to
block key highway. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's leading Albanian politician
said Wednesday he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, which would be a major step
toward peace talks on the future of the rebellious province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova gave no details of the compromise plan except to
say it would include ``all political forces'' and ``create
preconditions for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav
government. He did not say whether such a coalition would include
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence and
which has rejected Rugova's leadership.
	   Meanwhile, new clashes were reported in the border region of
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Rugova's announcement came on the heels of several Serb
victories in an offensive launched Friday night. Police and army
troops have managed to regain control of key areas of the province
that had been under rebel control, a development that may lead the
rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA posts of defense and interior _ meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Although Yugoslavia would likely not recognize Rugova's
``government,'' it could form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team
to negotiate the status of the province with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of U.S. and European
diplomacy since Milosevic launched a bloody crackdown on Albanian
militants in February. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which
together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's 2 million
residents.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation, which arrived here in the
latest international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rohan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The EU delegation, which also includes diplomats from Germany
and Britain, arrived as U.S. officials said an American effort to
forge a broad-based Kosovo Albanian negotiating team was beginning
to bear fruit.
	   ``Our message is very clear,'' delegation leader Rohan said
Wednesday. ``The violence has to stop immediately.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Tuesday that U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was working with Rugova
and other Albanian politicians to form an ``all-party executive''
to negotiate a cease-fire and self-government for Kosovo.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, heavily armed Serb forces, backed by
helicopters, were trying to capture another KLA bastion, Junik,
where about 1,000 fighters are trapped, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   In the Djakovica area, Serb forces were shelling from afar
villages believed to be KLA strongholds. No reliable casualty
figures were available.
	   Late Tuesday, police drove the KLA from Malisevo, a central
rebel stronghold. Tens of thousands who fled into nearby hills and
forests were forced to spend the second night in the open.
	   Four KLA members were killed and seven captured in overnight
clashes with Serb police near a village just north of Malisevo as
they were trying to block the Kijevo-Malisevo highway, Serbian
media reported.
	   The upsurge in fighting during the past 10 days has increased to
at least 100,000 the number of civilians forced to flee their
homes, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.

Greece approves national transition plan to euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Greek government approved Wednesday a
national transition plan to the European Union's single currency,
the euro, for its planned participation by 2001.
	   It calls for steps to improve the efficiency and quality of
services provided by Greek banks and adjustment needs in the
central bank's payment system, capital markets and computer
systems.
	   ``The country's entry to the euro zone in 2001 is a national
choice,'' said National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou, who chaired the committee which gave the go-ahead to
the plan.
	   Under the plan, gross domestic product growth has been forecast
at 3.5 percent in 1998 and 3.7 percent in 1999.
	   Greece was the only member of the 15-nation bloc that wanted to
participate in the first wave of nations planning for the single
currency but was unable to meet the criteria.

Top Tamil leader returns from Singapore after medical care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Blinded in one eye, a popular Tamil
politician and former rebel has returned to Sri Lankan from
Singapore where he was treated for injuries from a beating by rival
Tamils, his associate said Wednesday.
	   Douglas Devananda, head of the Eelam People's Democratic Party,
lost sight in his right eye but suffered no brain damage, said
Sangarapillai Sivathasan, a lawmaker from his party.
	   ``He can remember everything and except for no sight on his
right eye he is doing fine,'' Sivathasan said.
	   Devananda, 40, was attacked by Tamil jail inmates belonging to
the main Tamil rebel group, The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
on June 30 while he was visiting their cells to inquire into their
welfare. He was in a coma for several days.
	   The prison at Kalutara, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of
Colombo, houses Tamil rebels or suspects. The militants are
fighting for a separate homeland for the Tamil minority in the
north and east.
	   Devananda formed the EPDP after breaking from another rebel
group in 1985. He later gave up violence and joined mainstream
politics. His party took part in the 1994 federal elections,
winning nine seats in the 225-member house.
	   In January, the party won 10 of 17 council seats in local
government elections in the northern Jaffna peninsula, the Tamil
heartland.

Brewing industry becomes a motor of transition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A growing number of thirsty beer fans and
brave foreign investors have turned Bulgaria's beer-brewing
industry into the motor of the country's slow transition to a
market economy.
	   Brewing is the only industry in this post-communist country that
has been almost fully privatized, attracting foreign investments
worth more than dlrs 30 million.
	   Bulgarian breweries are expected to produce 4 million
hectoliters of beer this year, up 30 percent from last year's 3
million hectoliters, Peter Paunkov, chairman of the Union of
Brewers, told BTA news agency Wednesday.
	   Already in the first half of 1998, some 1.73 million hectoliters
were sold, a 30 per cent increase from the same period of last
year.
	   While Bulgaria is better known for its wines, the Balkan nation
has a 100-year-old brewing industry that produces 50 brands of
beer. The 1997 per capita beer consumption was 50 liters.
	   Of the country's 13 breweries, all except Shumensko Pivo in the
northeastern town of Shumen have passed into private hands _ many
of them foreign. Half of these businesses were sold for cash, 35
percent were privatized through vouchers and 15 percent were sold a
shares to the breweries' management and the employees.
	   Dutch beer giant Heineken holds a majority interest in
Bulgaria's largest brewery, Zagorka, based in Stara Zagora, 250
kilometers (160 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   Belgian Interbrew holds a controlling interest in three
Bulgarian beer-makers: Burgasko Pivo in the Black Sea town of
Burgas, Kamenitsa, in Bulgaria's second major city Plovdiv, and
Astika in Haskovo.
	   Astika, Zagorka and Kamenitsa are all operating at full
capacity, Plevensko Pivo of Pleven (North Central Bulgaria) at 90
percent capacity, and the rest at 75 to 90 percent, according to
Paunkov.
	   Almost all of the beer brewed in the country is absorbed by the
domestic market, with exports accounting for only 2 percent. Astika
sells the most abroad _ up to 15 percent of its output _ while
Zagorka exports 5 percent.
	   The principal overseas markets are the former Soviet Union,
Romania and Macedonia.
	   Zagorka sells small amounts in the United States, and Astika in
Great Britain.

London celebrates 50 years since Olympics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fifty years after the opening ceremony of the 1948
Olympics, Britain commemorated the games Wednesday as heralding
``the start of a new era in world history.''
	   The London Games, held in the aftermath of World War II, were
the first Olympics since Nazi Germany hosted the games in Berlin in
1936.
	   The London Olympics, dubbed the ``Austerity Games'' and opened
by King George VI, helped reunite athletes who may have been bitter
enemies just years before.
	   Among the 4,099 competitors representing 59 countries at the
games, there were many heroes _ most notably Czech middle-distance
runner Emil Zatopek and Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen.
	   On Wednesday, Blankers-Koen joined members of the 1948 British
team in a commemorative ceremony.
	   London was asked to host the Olympics after a postal ballot by
the International Olympic Committee in 1946
	   The city had stepped into the breach once before, in 1908 when
original host city Rome fell into financial turmoil and had to give
up the Olympics.
	   Four decades later, London received help from many nations to
help make the games a success. Simple things like the provision of
150,000 eggs and thousands of liters of mineral water from Europe
helped the event run smoothly and without going into the red.
	   ``These Games were seen by many as the start of a new era in
world history following years of war,'' the British Olympic
Association said. ``Athletes from around the globe came to a war
ravaged London to take part in a sporting event that will go down
in history for many as the start of the healing process after World
War II.
	   ``At a time when rationing was still in place and the city was
being repaired following the heavy bombing it received, London
managed to stage the games against odds that many bid cities today
would be unable to overcome.''
	   While London basked in sentimental reflection on Wednesday, BOA
chairman Craig Reedie was busy reminding the world that London
remained a viable venue for the Olympics.
	   Reedie, whose organization is working on preliminary planning
for the 2012 Games, said there were a number of people in the IOC
who remembered the contribution Britain had made but that would
count for little in the awarding of future Olympics.
	   ``The reality is that while Britain gave organized sport to the
world... other countries have taken that gift, polished it and put
extra luster on it,'' Reedie told the Evening Standard newspaper.
	   ``We took the games in 1948 because nobody else was prepared to
do it _ the competition is much keener now than it was 50 years
ago.''
	   Blankers-Koen, ``The Flying Dutchwoman,'' was a 30-year-old
mother-of-two who won four gold medals _ in the 100 meters, 200
meters, 80-meter hurdles, and 4-by-100-meter relay.
	   She was quoted in the Evening Standard on Wednesday saying that
every athlete was enriched by an experience that all the wealth of
the world could not buy.
	   ``It was so soon after the war but England organized an Olympics
for us and it made us all so happy,'' she said.
	   ``These days there are so many young boys and young girls who
are so good. They have nice tracks to run on, and they have nice
shoes to wear. Everything is so nice for them. But do you know
what? We had more fun.''
	   Zatopek broke coaches orders to attend the opening ceremony on
July 29 and returned to Wembley stadium the next day to win the
10,000-meter gold.
	   His grace and style launched him as one of the greatest
middle-distance runners of his era.
	   Zatopek, who won three gold medals at Helsinki in 1952, said
years ago that it was a ``liberation of spirit'' to race in London.
	   ``After all the dark days of the war, the bombing, the killing
and the starvation, the revival of the Olympics was as if the sun
had come out,'' he said.

Henry elects to coach Wales at risk of never coaching All Blacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Henry reaction to NZRFU ban, WRU quotes

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Graham Henry was en route to
Britain on Wednesday to start a five-year contract as coach of
Wales, knowing the New Zealand Rugby Football Union will never
allow him to coach the All Blacks.
	   The Auckland Blues coach, who had been tipped to take over from
current All Blacks coach John Hart after next year's World Cup, was
released by the NZRFU after three months of legal wrangling.
	   Henry was head-hunted by Welsh rugby union officials who made
him an offer he could not refuse.
	   ``I feel very privileged to be asked do the job, it is a rugby
nation that has a great tradition in rugby,'' he said Wednesday
before heading for Wales.
	   With four national titles as coach of the Blues and two Super 12
championships from three finals appearances behind him, Henry is
looking forward to taking on the challenge ahead.
	   Asked about his views while watching Wales crash 96-13 to South
Africa last month, he replied: ``I thought they needed a bit of
improvement.''
	   The 52-year-old takes over as full-time coach, filling a void
left by Kevin Bowring.
	   NZRFU chief executive David Moffett said Henry's decision means
he will forego any opportunity to coach the All Blacks and, on that
basis, he was released from his contract.
	   Henry said the NZRFU's ruling was a knee-jerk reaction to his
departure and it lacked maturity.
	   ``I think it is a one-off case because rugby players can play
for different nations as long as they have a stand-down period, yet
rugby coaches in New Zealand who coach another national side get
banned for life,'' he said.
	   ``That to me lacks logic, lacks thought, lacks sensitivity,
lacks maturity, and I'm sure they will change that when they have
got some time to consider it.''
	   Henry said Wales offered him the opportunity to coach the game
at the hightest level, including World Cup campaigns in 1999 and
2003 _ an opportunity he said he did not have in New Zealand.
	   ``It may have occurred, but it was a dream which meant a lot to
my life and when you have to make a decision between reality versus
a dream, it is a non-decision,'' he said.
	   ``It is a huge challenge, and that is what makes it so exciting
and demanding. I guess that is why you do these things and I'm
looking forward to it.''
	   In Cardiff, WRU chairman Glanmor Griffiths predicted that
Henry's appointment signalled a new era for Welsh rugby.
	   ``This is a tremendous coup for Welsh rugby and it shows we are
determined to make Wales a major force in the world game once
again,'' he said.
	   ``We said we wanted to find the best available coach in the
world, and that is exactly what we've done.''
	   Henry's wife, Raewyn, the Auckland provincial netball coach,
will remain in New Zealand until November but there is speculation
that she may end up coaching the Welsh netball team.
	   Henry said he will return from Wales for a proper farewell with
the Auckland team which he has coached since 1992.
	   Auckland will announce its new coach on Thursday.

Ousted curio sellers clash with Muslim youths over disputed land

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least 10 people were injured and scores
arrested Wednesday when Muslim youths clashed with curio sellers
who were evicted from a plot of land a downtown mosque claims it
has purchased to make a parking lot.
	   ``In the morning we went to court. We were allowed to continue
to rebuild our stalls, then the Muslims came this afternoon and
started destroying and burning our property,'' said vendor Juda
Makii.
	   About 50 riot police wielding clubs and guns shot tear gas
canisters into the melee to separate the two groups engaged in a
battle with rocks and pieces of timber.
	   ``I am ready to die for the mosque,'' sobbed a Muslim youth as
he was dragged away by police.
	   Police later took several of the injured to hospital. One person
was said to have died, but it was not immediately possible to
confirm this.
	   On Sunday evening, police sealed off a city block in downtown
Nairobi, smashing the scores of wooden stalls in the warren-like
Blue Market despite a court order restraining the city council from
evicting the curio vendors until their case had been heard next
month.
	   The vendors estimated property losses at millions of shillings
(hundreds of thousands of dollars).
	   The market, characterized by blue wooden outer walls, sold
beads, jewelry, soapstone, wood carvings, masks and baskets from
east and central Africa to tourists, who fear to venture elsewhere
in the city because of robbery and armed attacks.
	   The market was set up in 1980 on City Council land. A year ago,
the council said it had sold the land to the Jamia mosque for a
parking lot and proposed moving the market to an area outside the
central business district, where few tourists dare to go.
	   The ownership and transfer of land in Nairobi and other parts of
Kenya has become a major problem as corrupt officials obtain title
to public land and then sell it for a profit.

Holocaust survivors, others claim millions for seized assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign nationals and Holocaust survivors whose
British assets were seized during World War II have filed claims
for repayment totaling 6 million pounds (dlrs 10 million), the
government said Wednesday.
	   As the situation deteriorated elsewhere in Europe, many
Holocaust victims deposited their assets in Britain for safekeeping
_ only to have them seized under the 1939 Trading with the Enemy
Act.
	   Hoping to correct this injustice, the government invited claims
in April.
	   Since then, it has received 130 claims for funds and property
totaling 300,000 pounds at wartime prices _ the equivalent of 6
million pounds (dlrs 10 million) today _ according to Lord Archer
of Sandwell, a lawyer appointed by the government to set up a
system to evaluate and settle claims.
	   The figure far outstrips the 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.3 million)
that the government has set aside for repayments, but it has
promised more funds if needed.
	   ``No one can put a price on the suffering the victims of Nazi
persecution endured, nor the subsequent injustice in their
treatment after the war,'' Archer said.
	   ``However, I believe that it is possible to put in place a
workable and equitable scheme which might provide some relief, even
after all this time.''
	   Archer has asked groups like the Holocaust Educational Trust and
the Association of Former Political Prisoners of German
Concentration Camps to submit suggestions on the repayment scheme
by Sept. 11.
	   Lord Janner, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust,
welcomed Archer's suggestions and said he was confident ``that as
much justice as possible will be done in the minimum possible
time.''
	   But the Trust said Archer's proposals only deal with victims
from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
	   ``It does not explain how victims in Nazi occupied countries of
Eastern Europe _ Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Baltic states _
will get their money back. It also leaves out victims in former
East Germany,'' the Trust said.
	   Archer said he hopes the system will be operational by November,
under the control of the Department of Trade and Industry. ``A lot
of these people have waited for an outcome to their claims for a
very long period,'' Archer said.
	   The 1939 act allowed Britain to seize assets of citizens of
countries defined as ``belligerent enemy states.''
	   Despite a series of international treaties, after the war many
people did not receive repayment.
	   The Department of Trade and Industry has placed on the Internet
the names of 30,000 potential claimants from Germany, the former
Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria
and Romania.
	   Archer, a former lawmaker and chairman of Amnesty International,
proposes that the restitution scheme should run for a fixed period,
although he hopes extensive publicity will ensure all claimants
come forward in time.
	   He also recommended that a panel consisting of a legal expert, a
financial expert and ``someone with an understanding of belonging
to a minority group'' should assess claims.

Australia advances to world women's softball final

	   FUJINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Australia advanced to the final by
beating the United States 2-1 on a 12th-inning error Wednesday,
handing the Americans their first defeat in 43 games at women's
world softball world championships.
	   But the U.S. team, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, still has a
chance for its fourth straight world championship, and sixth
overall.
	   It now faces host Japan on Thursday. The winner of that game
takes on Australia for the championship later in the day, while the
losing team wins the bronze medal.
	   Australia gained its place in the championship match with a
perfect 2-0 record in the eight-nation final round. It had edged
Canada 1-0 on Tuesday.
	   Australia won the first world championship, and now is seeking
its second world title.
	   Japan, a 1-0 loser to the Americans Tuesday, advanced to the
medal round by beating Italy 2-0 and then China 3-0 Wednesday.
	   Under the world championship rule, China placed fourth with a
2-1 final-round record.
	   For Australia, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist, Simmone Marrow
scored the winning run in the bottom of the 12th when American
pitcher Lisa Fernandez threw wild to third base on a ball hit by
Peta Edebone with no one out.
	   Morrow had opened the 12th on second base under a softball
tie-break rule applied after seven regulation and two extra
innings, allowing the team at bat to place a runner on second.
	   Australian pitcher Kelly Hardie went the distance, allowing six
hits and striking out seven against the Americans, who had won nine
consecutive games here before Wednesday's loss.
	   On Thursday, Italy and Canada meet for fifth place and a ticket
to the Sydney Olympics.
	   The top four teams, excluding Olympic host Australia, qualify
for the 2002 games.

OSCE says Inter-Ethnic Radio at critical juncture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Donor countries were urged Wednesday to
consider ways to keep an inter-ethnic radio station in
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the air after current funding runs out after
the September elections.
	   The appeal was made during a meeting here of donor countries and
the Bosnia mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe to discuss the future of Free Inter-Ethnic Radio Network,
or FERN.
	   FERN went on the air July 15, 1996 as the only radio network not
influenced by one of Bosnia's three ethnic groups -- Muslims, Serbs
and Croats.
	   It was financed by the Swiss government and the OSCE to provide
accurate and unbiased reports from both the Serb-run part of Bosnia
and the territory controlled by the Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   But Swiss and OSCE funding will end after the September
elections. The OSCE mission told the donor representatives that the
network must rely on commercial investments, partnerships with
other media organizations or voluntary contributions.
	   No final decisions were taken at the Vienna meeting. OSCE hopes
the station will become more self-sufficient next year through
corporate sponsorship and commercial advertising.
	   The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, supplementing its own
material with rebroadcasts from Radio Free Europe and Deutsche
Welle.

Sony sees falling profits as competition erodes margins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sony Corp. said Wednesday it expects profits to
fall this year, hurt by stiff competition in its bread-and-butter
consumer electronics businesses and a worldwide slump in computer
chip prices.
	   The Tokyo-based electronics giant said it expects group
operating income to drop 10 percent in the year ending March 1999
to 470 billion yen (dlrs 3.4 billion).
	   That comes despite a projected 5 percent increase in sales to
7.1 trillion yen (dlrs 51 billion) because of a weakening yen.
	   In the most recent quarter, which ended June 30, operating
profit fell 4.9 percent from a year earlier to 92.5 billion yen
(dlrs 660 million), even as sales increased 13 percent to 1.6
trillion (dlrs 11.4 billion).
	   Consolidated net profit rose 17.6 percent to 40.95 billion yen
(dlrs 292.5 million), mostly due to an income tax cut in Japan and
improved earnings at certain loss-making subsidiaries in the United
States, it said.
	   For the lower operating profit, the company blamed increasing
competition, which has forced it to cut prices on key products such
as broadcast equipment, computer displays and cellular phones.
	   It also said the long downturn in world chip prices continued to
squeeze profit margins.
	   That helped drive down operating income in Sony's electronics
division by 22 percent to 57 billion yen (dlrs 407 million) in the
latest quarter.
	   Sony's movie business also turned in a poor showing, with
operating income dropping almost 9 percent to 5.4 billion yen (dlrs
39 million). The company said the worse-than-expected revenues from
the monster film ``Godzilla'' had only a limited effect on the
bottom line.
	   One bright spot was sales of its popular PlayStation television
games, which jumped 75 percent to 24.4 billion yen (dlrs 174
million).
	   Income from Sony's music business was also robust, doubling to
8.4 billion yen (dlrs 60 million).
	   Analysts expressed concern about Sony's inability to increase
profits despite the weaker yen, which traded around 141.5 yen to
the dollar Wednesday, compared with about 125 yen at the start of
the year.
	   A weaker yen usually benefits Japanese exporters by allowing
them to obtain more yen for dollars earned abroad.

Iranians, Russians deny weapons links that brought U.S. sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Russian Security Council
saying sanctions had been expected. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran's ambassador to Moscow denied Wednesday any
knowledge of the Russian companies alleged by the United States to
have sold sensitive weapons technology to foreign countries.
	   President Clinton banned U.S. aid on Tuesday to seven Russian
research and manufacturing enterprises found to have sold sensitive
weapons technology to such countries as Iran, Libya or North Korea.
	   ``The companies and organizations figuring in Clinton's
directive, with the exception of the research institutes, are not
even known in Iran,'' Iranian Ambassador Mehdi Safari said in an
interview with the Interfax news agency.
	   However, Russia's Security Council said the sanctions, which
also include a ban on exporting goods to the United States, were
not a surprise. The enterprises were first identified by a Russian
government commission.
	   The sanctioned enterprises are the INOR scientific center, the
Grafit and Polyus research institutes, the Glavkosmos organization,
the MOSO company, the Baltic State Technical University and
Europalace 2000.
	   Baltic State, in St. Petersburg, denied on Tuesday that it had
helped Iran acquire nuclear weapons technology by training Iranian
students.
	   ``Not one Iranian student or trainee ever studied in this
area,'' said university rector Yuri Savelyev, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Savelyev said an agreement to train 25 Iranian scientists ended
two years ago, and all they were taught was Russian language,
physics, math, physical sciences and general engineering.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service acknowledged last year that
Iranian students were studying missile engineering in Russian
colleges, including the Bauman National Technical University in
Moscow and the Baltic State University. But it said their studies
did not go beyond ``generally available'' knowledge.
	   Russia has been accused by the United States and Israel in
particular of helping Iran develop its nuclear weapons program by
training students, building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran
and providing missile technology.
	   Russia denies the missile allegations and says the nuclear plant
is for purely civilian uses.
	   Regardless, the government has moved recently to tighten control
over the export of weapons and weapons technology.
	   The Russian and Iranian customs services signed an agreement
Wednesday to improve controls over the export of technology,
especially dual-use technology that can be used for both civilian
and military purposes.
	   State Customs Committee chairman Valery Valery Draganov said
Russia had investigated a few cases of alleged illegal export of
dual-use technology, but found ``all of the said items were of an
exclusively peaceful nature,'' Interfax reported.

Riders stop Tour de France again ... and again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES tour director saying tour will go ahead, police
questioning will be in hotels in 11th-12th grafs
 &UR; By JEAN-LUC COURTHIAL &QC; 
 &UR; By Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JORIOZ, France (AP) - The Tour de France was stopped again
when the riders staged another protest just after starting the 17th
stage Wednesday.
	   The riders halted the race at the 32 kilometer (20th mile) of
the leg from Albertville to Aix-les-Bains. Some began to race
again, only before stopping and then starting again.
	   After starting very slowly, many of 133 riders stripped off
their race numbers to protest against the way French officials are
carrying out an investigation into the use of drugs on the tour.
	   The racers were angry that members of the Dutch TVM team had
been taken away by police to be tested Tuesday night and apparently
feared further police searches.
	   It was the second time in the race that the riders have
protested. Last Friday the riders stopped the race at the start of
the the 12th stage in Tarascon-sur-Ariege. The riders delayed the
start of the race two hours.
	   Wednesday, they stopped about 15 minutes but were without the
team of ONCE led by French star Laurent Jalabert.
	   Jalabert was the leader of the protest and delivered a statement
to Tour radio at the time. France 2 television reported that
Jalabert and his team had definitely quit the race.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Jalabert is ranked the No. 1 cyclist in the world by the
International Cycling Union based on results over the year.
Jalabert was the world champion in the time trial last year and has
been France's top hope in cycling since Richard Virenque was kicked
out of the Tour with his Festina team.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, Tour director, made a statement over Radio
Tour, the radio station for the followers of the race, asking the
riders to restart the race.
	   There has been speculation on further police action against the
riders. Leblanc said on Franc 2 radio that any police questioning
would take place in the riders' hotels.
	   Leblanc said the tour would continue Thursday despite the
protest.

BlueWave edge Fighters 5-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chris Donnels ignited a two-run ninth inning with
an infield hit and the Orix BlueWave edged the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 5-4 at Kobe Wednesday.
	   In the bottom of the ninth, the BlueWave filled the bases with
an error and a walk after former Boston Red Sox player Donnels'
hit. Then Koichi Oshima drew a walk and Ichiro Suzuki singled home
the winning run.
	   Third reliever Edwin Hurtado, formerly with Seattle Mariners,
held the Fighters hitless in the last inning for his eighth victory
against three defeats.
	   The Fighters are 7 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, who extended their winning streak to five with a 3-1
victory over the Seibu Lions at Seibu Stadium.
	   Rob Mattson, formerly with a Mexican League team, limited the
Lions to four hits over 7 2/3 innings for his third victory against
two defeats.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Iwao Oomura drove in three runs with a home run
and a single as the Chiba Lotte Marines beat the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks 8-3 and extended their winning streak to four.
	   In the Central League, Teruyoshi Kuji tripled home two runs in
the four-run fifth inning as the Chunichi Dragons edged the
front-running Yokohama BayStars 4-3 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The victory narrowed the BayStars' lead over the second-place
Dragons to three games.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, pinch hitter Hiroo Ishii smashed a
grand slam home run in the top of the 10th inning, giving the
Yomiuri Giants a 4-0 victory over the Yakult Swallows. Ishii has
four homers.
	   The Giants ended their losing streak at three and the Swallows
ended their winning streak at five.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Dave Hansen hit the winning home run in the
bottom of the 10th inning as the Hanshin Tigers edged the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp 3-2.
	   Hansen, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has six homers.

Radio Free Europe/Liberty to broadcast into Iran and Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Radio Free Europe/Liberty will
start broadcasting into Iran and Iraq this fall out of a secret
location in the Czech Republic, station officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.S.-sponsored radio station began transmitting from Munich,
Germany in 1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved a plan to create new services to
be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   The radio moved to its headquarters to Prague in 1995, after the
collapse of communism, and began broadcasting out of a prominent
downtown building that once served as Parliament of federal
Czechoslovakia.
	   Because American and Czech officials fear terrorist attacks
against the new service, the new departments will be housed in a
separate building that is easier to protect, said spokeswoman Alena
Fendrychova.

Four people killed and over 60 injured in heavy storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A heavy storm that hit central and
western Romania, killed four people and injured more than 60
others, the Central Floods Commission said Wednesday.
	   The storms, which blew in late Tuesday, following a long spell
of scorching weather, left tens of thousands of people without
power or telephone services.
	   A man and his wife in Lunca de Jos, were swept away by flood
waters while traveling in a horse-drawn cart. In Timisoara two
other men were killed, one who was struck by lightning and another
who fell to his death, Medaifax news agency reported.
	   No other details on causalities were immediately available.
	   Weather officials told Mediafax the damage ran to billions of
lei (hundreds of thousands of dollars).

Treason suspects released in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Authorities in Sierra Leone have
released from detention 19 people accused of collaborating with the
country's erstwhile military junta, government-controlled radio
reported Wednesday.
	   The group, including several civil servants, are among more than
50 people rounded up and charged with treason and other crimes
linked to the country's former military government. More than 200
other people are still under investigation.
	   Treason in Sierra Leone is punishable by death.
	   The 19 suspects were released due to insufficient evidence, the
government's broadcasting authority reported.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has led an inquisition-like probe
into the causes and supporters of the military coup last year that
toppled his presidency and launched Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma to
power.
	   Koroma was subsequently driven from the capital by a West
African intervention force which paved the way for Kabbah's return
to power in March.
	   Kabbah's probe has implicated senior military officers,
prominent civilians, journalists and civil servants and government
ministry functionaries.
	   Within days of returning to power, Kabbah invoked a presidential
decree that suspended most civil liberties and gave him sweeping
powers to detain people.
	   Kabbah became Sierra Leone's first elected president in 1996
after successive years of civil war and military coups.
	   Forces loyal to the former military junta are still wreaking
havoc in the countryside near Sierra Leone's border with Liberia.
	   Junta gunmen and their rebel allies have been accused of
committing horrific atrocities, including mass murder, torture and
rape, Human Rights Watch said in a report released this week.

First major business-labor accord on 35-hour work week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS management comment, three unions signing; background

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A business-labor accord to comply with a new
35-hour work week law drew protest from some unions Wednesday but
backing from conservatives for boosting overtime and allowing
flexible scheduling.
	   The agreement between the Union of Metallurgy and Mining
Industries (UIMM) and three labor unions Tuesday allows for a
35-hour work week, but it permits weekly schedules of up to 48
hours to meet demand.
	   As a result, the work week will remain at about 39 hours on
average, French media reported. The accord makes no commitment to
create new jobs, as the law was designed to do, and it leaves
companies to negotiate salaries.
	   The agreement, however, preserves ``competitiveness by
introducing flexibility but also respecting people,'' the
management said in a statement.
	   The conservative daily Le Figaro called the agreement
management's ``first victory against the 35 hours.''
	   Among the unions that refused to sign, Robert Bonnand,
secretary-general of the metallurgy federation of the French Labor
Confederation (CFDT), called it ``a black Tuesday for cutting the
work week.''
	   The Communist-led General Labor Confederation (CFT) also refused
to sign. But the other leading union, Workers Force (FO), signed
along with the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) and
a smaller union, the CFE-CGC.
	   Workers Force leader Marc Blondel said as part of the deal,
management agreed to grant retirement incentives to longtime
employees and replace them with younger hires.
	   If approved by the government, the accord would affect nearly 2
million workers, or about one French employee in 10, in the auto
industry, shipbuilding, aerospace, mining and steel.
	   The 35-hour work week, aimed at spreading jobs around to fight
double-digit unemployment, was a campaign plank for Socialist-led
government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin that came to power a
year ago.
	   The 35-hour law, subject to parliamentary review next year,
requires businesses with more than 20 employees to comply by 2000
and for all to conform by 2002.
	   The law was widely criticized by business, but Jospin has taken
a more pragmatic approach, saying it was a way to negotiate more
flexibility in rigid work laws.
	   Workers were supposed to receive the same pay for fewer hours,
but Jospin later said that would be ``anti-economical.''

B'nai B'rith hopes justice will be done in the Sakic case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The prominent Jewish group B'nai B'rith
said Wednesday it hopes that ``justice will be done'' in the case
of Dinko Sakic, the commander of Croatia's worst World War II
concentration camp.
	   ``We do not intend to in any way prejudge the outcome of the
Sakic trial,'' Tommy Baer, the group's international director, told
reporters. ``But it is our hope that the process reflects the
highest standards, of both justice and of the Croatian people, and
that justice will be done.''
	   The delegation from B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League, whose
years-long efforts led to the arrest of Sakic, arrived this week to
observe the government's handling of the case.
	   Sakic, 76, was extradited to Croatia in June from Argentina and
is in a Zagreb prison while prosecutors prepare a case against him
for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Sakic is accused of running the notorious Jasenovac
concentration camp in World War II, when Croatia was a Nazi puppet
state.
	   Tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and anti-Nazi Croats
died at Jasenovac. About 30,000 Jews, the majority of its pre-World
War II population, were killed by the then Ustasha regime.
	   The group is ``satisfied'' that the legal process against Sakic
has been led ``in a manner that would be accepted and respected by
... the United States and other western democracies,'' Baer said.
	   Noting that Sakic's fate will have to be determined by Croatian
authorities, Baer emphasized that ``credibility and integrity of
Croatia's system of justice is now under scrutiny and the world
indeed will be watching.''
	   B'nai B'rith was invited by President Franjo Tudjman to attend
the trial against Sakic, Baer said. He was flirting in the past
with the kind of nationalism reminiscent of the Ustasha regime but
has increasingly tried to improve his image in the West.
	   ``At stake is a larger issue than Dinko Sakic, and that is the
necessity for the people of Croatia to look honestly at the part of
their past,'' Baer said, adding that the Sakic case is a chance for
Croatia ``to show the world, the West ... (that) it has no affinity
and no bonds'' to World War II Croatia.

Air France scraps Cape Town flights due to lack of profitability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France said Wednesday it would suspend its
flights from Paris to Cape Town, South Africa, due to a lack of
profitability and the need to sustain new growth levels.
	   The suspension of the flights, via Johannesburg, will come into
force as of April, 1999.
	   ``The suspension of Cape Town flights via Johannesburg in April
1999 is only due to insufficient route profitability,'' Air France
said in a statement.
	   The company said it planned to resume flights along the route
once it can introduce non-stop flights to Cape Town.
	   Air France, which earlier this year suffered a crippling strike
by pilots, said it posted a profit for the year 1997-1998 of 1.87
billion francs (dlrs 311.7 million) _ compared to a loss of 268
million francs (dlrs 44.7 million) a year earlier.
	   ``In order to continue and increase this growth, Air France
decided to discontinue unprofitable services and eliminate
multi-segment flights,'' the statement said.
	   The company did not say whether it had decided to withdraw other
flight routes.

Cold winds lash Australia's southeast, killing two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Cold weather and gale-force winds
lashed Australia's southeast Wednesday, claiming two lives and
causing extensive property damage, authorities said.
	   A deep low pressure system east of Tasmania state was blamed for
the cold snap in the central southeastern highlands and gale force
winds in coastal areas.
	   At Nowra, south of Sydney, a man died when a tree crashed into
his house as he slept, police said.
	   At Bathurst, in New South Wales state's central west, a
50-year-old man died and a 55-year-old woman was critically injured
when a shopfront collapsed on them.
	   In the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, black ice forced the
closing of the main western road out of the city after a spate of
car smashes.
	   Thousands of homes in Sydney and other regions suffered power
cuts Wednesday evening and the State Emergency Service reported
hundreds of calls for help.
	   Most callers reported high winds had brought down power lines
and trees, causing damage to roofs, said a service spokeswoman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, floodwaters in the north of New South Wales reached a
peak, with water lapping at the tops of levee banks surrounding the
towns of Moree, Coonamble and Pilliga. All three were effectively
cut off, although essential supplies were getting through, the
spokeswoman said.
	   And wild seas complicated the rescue of six men from the
stricken fishing boat Monray Frontier, which sent a distress call
early Tuesday after becoming grounded on Middleton Reef, north of
Lord Howe Island.
	   The fishermen were rescued early Wednesday by a helicopter from
the Australian navy's HMAS Newcastle, Australian Maritime Safety
Authority spokesman David Gray said.
	   In northwest Tasmania, sightseer Grant Mooy, 20, survived
several hours at sea after being washed into Bass Strait by a wave.
	   He managed to clamber ashore over rocks and climb an almost
sheer 180-meter (yard) cliff to reach the safety of a farmhouse.

	   Sokol Nano, the 20-year-old son of Prime Minister Fatos Nano,
was arrested Friday holding four grams (0.14 ounces) of hashish,
said police on Siros, an Aegean island about 100 kilometers (60
miles) southeast of Athens.
	   The younger Nano, a student at the University of Salonica in
northern Greece, tried unsuccessfully to use his diplomatic
passport to avoid prosecution.
	   No trial date was immediately set. If convicted, he could face
up to six months in jail. But it's unlikely he would face the
harshest punishment.
	   ``I must say that this is not an important issue. It involves a
small quantity ... The issue will be dealt with by the law,'' said
the government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas.

Rebuking Netanyahu, lawmakers set stage for early-election push
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with opposition reaction, next meeting of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators on Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a slap at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted on a
preliminary measure that would pave the way to early elections.
	   Passage of the bill to dissolve parliament, approved for
consideration 60-6 on the last day of parliament before the summer
recess, would be tantamount to toppling the government.
	   Netanyahu's government faces no immediate threat: The bill needs
committee approval and three more parliamentary votes, procedures
that will take weeks or months after parliament reconvenes in late
October.
	   Lawmakers who voted to consider the bill Wednesday are not
obliged to back it in its later stages.
	   Wednesday's vote was nonetheless a bellwether of sentiment on
Netanyahu's handling of negotiations with the Palestinians.
	   ``It is a huge scandal for Netanyahu,'' said Abdel Wahab
Darawshe, head of the Arab Democratic Party, which has four
parliamentary seats. ``Sixty Knesset members gave him what amounts
to a no-confidence vote.''
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago.
Negotiators from both sides have been trying over the past 10 days
to get the talks going again, but no breakthrough has been
achieved. They were to meet again Thursday.
	   Leaders of Netanyahu's coalition had urged a boycott of the
parliamentary vote, but some took part anyway _ and seven of them
supported the measure.
	   Those voting in favor included Dan Meridor, who quit as
Netanyahu's finance minister last year and is widely viewed as a
potential challenger for the leadership of Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   In brief but raucous debate before the parliamentary vote, the
prime minister, jeered and heckled by lawmakers, denounced the vote
as an ``empty exercise.''
	   Netanyahu scolded members of the opposition Labor Party, telling
them: ``You are so distant and so elitist.'' And he derided their
chances of passing the dissolution measure in the next session of
parliament.
	   Final approval would require 61 votes, a majority of the
120-seat parliament _ only one more vote than Netanyahu's opponents
garnered on Wednesday.
	   ``You are scared to go to elections, because you know full what
will happen,'' Netanyahu told the opposition. ``The people of this
country prefer a government...that is really fighting to bring
peace and security to the people.''
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept a U.S.-authored initiative calling for an
Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu's coalition partners all have different views on the
proposed redeployment, narrowing his room to maneuver in the
negotiations.
	   The prime minister, who holds a narrow 61-59 majority in
parliament, survived three opposition no-confidence motions on
Monday.

German Jewish official calls federal archives a ``Bermuda Triangle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany (AP) _ A Jewish official called the
federal archives office a ``Bermuda Triangle'' Wednesday, after the
agency confirmed that records on gold stolen by the Nazis during
World War II have disappeared.
	   Michel Friedman, a member of Germany's Central Committee of
Jews, alleged the records were purposely destroyed and demanded an
investigation into who was responsible for the move, which he
called ``unfathomable.''
	   Last Thursday, the federal archives said a search had concluded
that a group of 26 folders believed to contain information on gold
stolen from Jewish concentration camp victims were lost by the
mid-1970s.
	   The archives denied Germany television reports that officials
had concluded the records probably were destroyed, saying there was
not enough evidence to verify that.
	   Friedman said the documents could have been of great importance
in compensating Nazi victims. They should also have been seen as
vital for historical researchers, Friedman said.
	   U.S. researchers, German archivists and Germany's Bundesbank
have been searching for records of the so-called ``Melmer''
accounts to help account for gold stolen from Jewish victims. SS
Capt. Bruno Melmer was in charge of valuables stolen from Nazi
victims between 1942 and 1944.
	   The U.S. Army had access to the Melmer documents and other
records of the Nazi-era central bank after World War II. It
microfilmed most of the material, but for some reason did not film
the 26 folders on the Melmer accounts.
	   U.S. officials then handed over the material to the forerunner
of Germany's current central bank, the Bundesbank, in 1948.
	   The archives agency, working together with Bundesbank
historians, concluded that the documents disappeared by the
mid-1970s but reached no conclusion about who was responsible for
the disappearance.

Government clashes with legislators over political reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of debate; CORRECTS in graf 10
consultation ends Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Political parties clashed with the government
Wednesday over whether to scrap two local councils in a dispute
that pits calls for democracy against demands for better
government.
	   Michael Suen, secretary for constitutional affairs, told the
legislature in a debate that the government wants to set up a new
department to take control over food safety and the environment
back from the councils.
	   Suen also implied the government would like to scrap the two
councils _ one for urban Hong Kong and one for the rural New
Territories _ which also control arts and entertainment policies.
He proposed giving that control to an appointed board of experts,
which he said would help conserve resources and help develop the
arts in the territory.
	   ``It's extremely doubtful whether elected counselors have the
expertise in arts and entertainment,'' Suen said.
	   But lawmakers, accusing the government of curbing democracy,
instead voted 36-16 for a motion to merge the two councils.
	   The motion has no legal effect, but indicates the government was
unlikely to obtain the legislators' endorsement for its future
proposals.
	   A series of scares over the quality of Hong Kong's food supply
in the past year has raised concern over whether the existing
system is working. These included the so-called ``bird flu,'' red
tides that wiped out fish farms and other problems. Pollution also
is a growing concern.
	   Independent legislator Ambrose Cheung, who represents the urban
council, said the public would lose its right to monitor the
government in municipal services under Suen's proposal.
	   ``The beauty of democracy is that you can choose not to re-elect
a counselor if you disapprove of his performance,'' Cheung said.
	   A period of public consultation on the issue ends Friday, and a
final government decision isn't expected until October. However,
government officials repeatedly have indicated they would prefer to
scrap the local councils altogether. Lawmakers claimed the
consultation was only ``a show.''
	   ``The government has been working the propaganda machine in full
speed to create public opinion, to influence public opinion, and
then use the biased public opinion to justify to kill the two
councils,'' said legislator and counselor Fred Li of the Democrats,
the territory's largest party.
	   The two councils were the only policymaking bodies in Hong Kong
that were chosen by fully democratic means before the return to
Chinese rule last year. Beijing allowed all the counselors,
including critics, to stay after the handover, but added a group of
pro-Beijing counselors to ensure overall control.
	   Local councils are seen as a political training ground for
legislators, and several of them also are council members.
	   Voter turnouts ordinarily have been low for local council
elections.
	   Legislators were split over whether some experts or district
representatives should be appointed to the councils. They voted
27-19 against scrapping all appointed seats.
	   A survey by Hong Kong University's Social Science Research
Center indicated that 45 percent of respondents supported setting
up a government department to oversee food safety, and 25 percent
were against it.
	   Sixty-one percent of respondents said they prefer merging the
two councils, compared with 16 percent against it.
	   The survey has a margin of error of 2 percent.

Sudan to try el-Mahdi on charges of anti-government activities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's government will try in absentia
the prime minister it ousted in a coup in 1989 on charges of
conspiring to topple the government, local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   A military tribunal ordered former Prime Minister Sadiq
el-Mahdi, in exile in Eritrea, his son and 14 other members of
opposition groups advocating democracy to appear in court on
Saturday, the Akhbar al-Saa and other newspapers said.
	   The newspapers did not say how or where the summonses were
served. It was not clear where the others were.
	   The 16 are charged with conspiring and attempting to wage war
against the state, possession of weapons and undermining public
order and security. It was not clear what punishments would result
from conviction.
	   An aide to el-Mahdi in Cairo rejected the charges and said he
has no intention of handing himself over to the court.
	   El-Mahdi was the elected prime minister of Sudan when the army,
supported by an Islamic party, toppled his government in 1989 and
replaced it with an Islamic oriented regime headed by President
Omar el-Bashir.
	   He fled to Eritrea in December 1996 donning horse-riding gear
and tricking security men into thinking he was going out for a
ride.
	   The summonses, signed by the head of the court, Brig. Osman
Khalifa Mohammed, said that el-Mahdi and the others will be tried
in absentia if they do not appear before the court.
	   In June, the government accused opposition leaders abroad of
planting bombs at several sites in Khartoum, set to explode during
celebrations on the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military coup.
	   Some twenty people were arrested and accused of participating in
placing the bombs, which did not explode.
	   In another development, the government accused neighboring
Eritrea of launching an attack against its forces on the borders.
	   A military statement Wednesday said the Eritreans attacked the
Sudanese forces with heavy artillery and rockets. There were no
reports of casualties on both sides.
	   El-Mahdi's Umma Party has joined with the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, in a larger opposition
alliance-in-exile against el-Bashir's government.
	   The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for
the southern districts, predominantly Christian and animist, from
the Islamic north.

Russia sees no political will in council for scaling back Iraq
</HEADLINE>
nuclear probe &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council considered the latest
report on Iraq's nuclear abilities Wednesday but wasn't expected to
scale back inspections because of what Russia says is a lack of
political will among some council members.
	   Russia, along with France and China, had taken a leading role in
pushing to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to less
intrusive monitoring after the last report from the International
Atomic Energy Agency was released in April.
	   That report, and a subsequent one released this week, said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program but said they also couldn't certify
that no such evidence existed.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Wednesday the council
should move immediately to shift the IAEA's focus to monitoring and
verification visits rather than intrusive inspections.
	   ``The IAEA has admitted in past reports, and also in Tuesday's
report, that there is no prohibited activities in Iraq,'' Hamdoon
said as the council began discussing the IAEA report.
	   He said there was no point in delaying the decision until the
next IAEA report, due in October.
	   Council diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Baghdad would have to provide a good deal more information between
now and October if the council _ in particular the United States _
would agree to scale back inspections.
	   Washington successfully blocked the scaleback effort this spring
and could do so again in October.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said the IAEA's work in Iraq
had essentially already been reduced to long-term monitoring. But
in an interview Tuesday, he said ``I don't believe there is the
political will'' in the council now to formally codify such a
scaleback.
	   The United States and Britain traditionally have taken the
hardest line against the lifting of sanctions, while the other
three permanent council members Russia, France and China have been
more sympathetic to the Iraqi cause.
	   The IAEA report noted that ``Iraq had made significant progress
in weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when the
inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf War.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It urged that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring system
continue to try to answer the remaining questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.

British competitors offered drugs handbook
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British competitors headed for the Commonwealth
Games have been offered clear guidelines on avoiding medication
that could accidentally lead to positive drugs tests.
	   The nation's Sports Council has published a 230-page handbook
which lists the substances that could land the athletes in trouble
at Kuala Lumpur at the Sept. 11-21 event.
	   In a clear message aimed at drug cheats, it also clearly
explains what damage banned drugs such a steroids and stimulants
can to do the body.
	   The Sports Council said the book should ensure that potential
pitfalls can be avoided by making athletes and team officials aware
of what substances are permitted.
	   ``We have produced this guide for all our competitors as part of
out commitment to eliminating drugs misuse in sport,'' said Michele
Verroken, the Sports Council's Director of Ethics and Anti-Doping.
	   ``For both the athletes who are likely to be subjected to tests
and the officials who will have the responsibility to manage test
results, we have described clearly, step by step, the procedures in
order to demystify the drug testing process.
	   ``Ultimately I hope this book will help athletes to understand
not only their responsibilities but also, more importantly, their
rights.''
	   The book will make interesting reading for two English track
athletes who hope to head for Kuala Lumpur in September.
	   Diane Modahl, then the 800-meter defending titlist, was sent
home from the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British
Colombia, after excessive amounts of testosterone showed up in a
test in Lisbon. She blamed flawed procedures in the lab, was later
cleared and now is suing the British Athletics Federation for
compensation.
	   Solomon Wariso, a 400-meter runner, hopes to overturn a lifetime
ban imposed by the Commonwealth Games Council for England after he
served a three-month suspension imposed after the 1994 European
Championship when he tested positive for the stimulant
pseudoephedrine.
	   Although Wariso can run for Britain at next month's European
Championship, the ban forbids him running for the English team at
the Commonwealth Games unless he gets it overturned at an appeals
hearing next week. The Council's rules state that anyone who serves
a ban for a doping violation is automatically suspended for life
from competing for England.

China calls Cambodian elections fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Wednesday urged the contestants in
Cambodia's general elections to accept an apparent victory by the
party of close ally Prime Minister Hun Sen.
	   ``China hopes that all parties involved in the Cambodian general
election respect the choice of the Cambodian people and stabilize
the situation as soon as possible,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang was quoted saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   Initial appraisals of the election found that it ``basically
reflected the principle of freedom, democracy, justice and the will
of the Cambodian people,'' Tang was quoted as saying.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party claims a landslide
victory in the elections, but opposition leaders Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have complained of widespread
irregularities, demanding a recount and new voting in some areas.
	   International observers have generally said voting was not
without incident but fair enough to be valid.
	   China speedily endorsed Hun Sen after he forced out coalition
partner Ranariddh last July and booted Taiwan's representatives out
of Phnom Penh. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and seeks
to block any moves by the island to establish a presence overseas.
	   China also has strong ties dating back four decades with
Ranariddh's father, King Norodom Sihanouk, and Tang said the king
should have an important role in any settlement.
	   Hun Sen was to hold talks with Sihanouk, whose endorsement could
be vital to gaining international legitimacy and development aid.

Houses are blown up to discourage refugees from returning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIRSAD BEHRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The night before 70 Muslims
were to return to their homes in a Bosnian Croat-controlled
village, six of their houses were blown up, international officials
said on Wednesday.
	   ``There is a very clear and obvious link between that criminal
activity and the return of 70 Bosniaks (Muslims) to Pjesivac-Kula
today,'' Neil Wright, the head of U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees office in Mostar, said.
	   ``They (the Muslims) arrived in the morning to discover these
houses had been destroyed last night. These people are individuals
who are expressing and carrying out their right to return,'' he
said.
	   The village Pjesivac-Kula lies some 15 kilometers (ten miles)
southwest of Stolac, one of the most disputed towns in southern
Bosnia.
	   The area was predominantly Muslim before the Muslim-Croat war in
1993, but then became ethnically ``clean'' after the Croats
expelled the local Muslim population.
	   Bosnia, once an ethnic mix, is now ethnically divided due to the
wartime expulsions.
	   Neither the peace accords signed between the Muslims and Croats
in 1994 and then between them and the Serbs in 1995 nor
international pressure and sanctions were able to persuade local
authorities in certain areas of Bosnia to allow the return of
refugees from another ethnic group.
	   One of such places is the Stolac area, where local Croats are
reluctant to allow Muslims to come back. Despite constant
harassment and blowing up of returnees' houses, some 1,000 Muslims
from a pre-war population of 8,000 have returned.
	   Since the end of March, a total of 37 incidents of ethnic
hostility have occurred in the Stolac area, Kelly Moore, a U.N.
spokeswoman said.
	   ``This continued criminal activity, without any criminal being
brought to justice, is intolerable,'' Wright said.
	   Despite the expulsions, some 100 Muslims returned to the village
on Wednesday, according to the office of the Muslim president of
the municipal council, Kemal Isakovic.

EU approves British aid for production of Jaguar car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission on Wednesday approved 43 million pounds (dlrs 47
million) in British regional aid for Jaguar Cars Ltd.
	   The funds will help finance the entry into production of the
Jaguar X-400 model at the Ford Halewood plant in Merseyside, a
region in northwest Britain, beginning 2001, the Commission said in
a statement.
	   The EU executive arm found that the aid was justified since the
project will help safeguard some 2,400 jobs and could lead to the
creation of 1,000 new jobs.
	   Furthermore, ``the handicaps of investing at Halewood, in
comparison to alternative locations, outweighed the aid amount.''
	   The Jaguar X-400 will compete with the BMW-3 series and the Audi
A4. The car will be produced only at Ford Halewood, where output of
the Ford Escort will cease in 2000, the statement said.
	   The EU Commission can veto state and regional aid plans it
judges violate fair competition rules in the 15-nation bloc.
	   Merseyside is a region that suffers from a skills deficiency and
has a higher than average unemployment rate, according to the
Commission.

Venice Film Festival opens with `Saving Private Ryan'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: changes actor/director to actress/director in final graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The 55th Venice Film Festival opens with a bang this
year _ literally. The inaugural movie will be Stephen Spielberg's
acclaimed World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   The festival starts on Sept. 3 with lifetime achievement awards
for actress Sophia Loren and Polish director Andrzej Wajda. It ends
on Sept. 10 with a host of awards, including the coveted Golden
Lion for best film.
	   In between, movie buffs will get a chance to see 80 films, 19 of
them in competition, according to the program unveiled Wednesday.
	   Among them are Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth,'' Abel Ferrara's
``New Rose Hotel,'' Anand Tucker's ``Jackie'' with Emily Watson,
and John Dahl's ``Rounders'' with Matt Damon, John Turturro and
John Malkovich.
	   The festival will also feature its first script and film market,
a nod to commerce in a festival that prides itself on art, and a
section called called ``Outlook'' featuring 31 films ranging from
Wim Wenders' ``Buena Vista Social Club'' to ``The Loss of Sexual
Innocence'' by Mike Figgis, perhaps best known for ``Leaving Las
Vegas.''
	   More than 50 movies will have their world premieres at Venice,
including French director Eric Rohmer's ``Conte d'Automne,'' Irish
director Pat O'Connor's ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' with Meryl Streep,
Canadian director Francois Gerard's ``The Red Violin'' with Samuel
L. Jackson, and British director James Ivory's ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries'' with Barbara Hershey and Kris Kristofferson.
	   Although less glitzy than Cannes, Venice attacts its share of
stars and among those expected to attend are Tom Hanks, Michael
Douglas, Catherine Deneuve, Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Ed
Harris, James Caan, Kenneth Branagh, Sean Penn, George Clooney and
Sandrine Bonnaire.
	   The festival features movies from around the world, including a
healthy contingent from the United States. Among them are ``The
Truman Show,'' ``Out of Sight,'' ``A Perfect Murder,'' ``Poodle
Springs,'' and Spike Lee's ``He Got Game'' and Woody Allen's
``Celebrity.''
	   The festival is also premiering several American films,
including Larry Clark's ``Another Day in Paradise'' with James
Woods and Melanie Griffith and ``Shadrach'' directed by Susanne
Styron, the 22-year-old daughter of author William Styron, with
Harvey Keitel, Andie MacDowell and Martin Sheen.
	   This year's jury includes Brazilian director Hector Babenco,
German director Reinhardt Hauff, the French film critic Daniele
Heymann, the Chilean writer Luis Sepulveda, British
actress/director Tilda Swinton, Lithuanian director Sharunas
Bartas, American director Kathryn Bigelow and producer Ismail
Merchant.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The second round of talks aimed at
ending ethnic and political conflict in Burundi ended Wednesday
with the mediator, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere,
expressing satisfaction.
	   ``My assessment of the meeting is that it was very positive and
fruitful,'' Nyerere told reporters. ``I can say we have done
well.''
	   The 19 groups participating in the all-party talks agreed to
meet again Oct. 12 in this northern Tanzanian town.
	   ``The next round of talks will be longer than the first two,''
Nyerere said. ``It is proper to give ourselves enough time for
preparations.''
	   Some news reports speculated that a shortage of funds forced the
early closure of the current round of talks, but Nyerere did not
comment on the conjecture.
	   Delegates agreed on 16 rules of procedure, a general debate on
the root causes of the conflict and up to five committees to deal
with specific areas like peace and security and democracy and good
governance.
	   But all objected to the inclusion of observers from Burundi in
the third round, saying only those participants represented in the
first and second rounds should participate.
	   Nyerere said he plans to continue consultations with all parties
on democracy, good governance and security in Burundi.
	   At least 200,000 people have been killed since the fighting
between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels began in 1993
after the assassination of the country's first democratically
elected president, a Hutu, in a failed coup.
	   A cease-fire agreed upon during the first round of talks was
supposed to begin July 20. However, since then, there have been
reports of clashes between the rebels and the military.
	   On Wednesday, Radio Burundi said at least 21 people had been
killed in fighting between the Tutsi-led Burundi army and Hutu
rebels.
	   The radio said the skirmish occurred near Kibira National Park
north of the capital, Bujumbura, and 10 of those killed were
rebels.
	   Several rebel groups have distanced themselves from the talks
and said they are not bound by any cease-fire agreement.
	   Although 65 percent of Burundi's 6 million people are Hutus, the
minority Tutsis who make up 14 percent have controlled the country
for all but four months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   In 1972, several hundred thousand Hutus were slaughtered after a
Hutu uprising sought to overthrow the Tutsi leadership.

Brazil sells state-run telecommunications giant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo RIO101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil on Wednesday began selling
off its controlling stake in the state-run telecommunications
giant, Telebras, in what was billed as the largest privatization in
Latin America.
	   The highlight of the bidding, expected to last several hours,
was a showdown between American telecommunications giants MCI and
Sprint for control of long distance carrier Embratel, one of 12 the
companies that make up the Telebras holdings.
	   Government regulations forced the two companies into live
bidding after the sealed-envelope auction revealed only a 5 percent
difference between their respective bids.
	   MCI first offered dlrs 2.13 billion, while Sprint came up with
an offer of dlrs 2.15 billion.
	   After a tense 10-minute bidding showdown, MCI emerged the winner
with an offer of dlrs 2.28 billion.
	   ``MCI believes Embratel is the jewel in the Telebras
telecommunications crown,'' said Jerry Di Martino, a company senior
vice president. He said MCI planned to operate the long distance
carrier alone, but would consider future partnerships.
	   Outside the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchanges, where the auction
was being held, police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of
demonstrators protesting the privatization.
	   The opponents, who claimed Telebras was being sold too cheaply,
failed in their efforts to block the sale in the courts.
	   Brazil, which established a dlrs 11.7 billion minimum price for
the entire Telebras system, raised dlrs 12 billion with the sale of
the first four companies.
	   ``It is a fantastic start for the privatization,'' said Celso de
Barros of the Salomon Brothers Investment Bank, which advised the
government on the sale. ``It is an historic moment for this
country. I think people are going to get phones now.''
	   There are 20 million people in Brazil waiting for phones lines
they paid as much as dlrs 836 to be installed.
	   The average wait for a legally purchased line, when available,
is about two years. The shortage of lines has created an enormous
black market, with prices listed in the newspapers like stock
market quotes.
	   The government has set performance goals for the new companies
to meet to ensure service improves.
	   The new companies will have to create 33 million new fixed phone
lines by 2007 and these phones will have be installed within a week
of purchase by 2005.
	   To ensure prices remain low, the government will also sell off
concessions creating new phone companies that will compete with the
Telebras spinoffs.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The prominent Jewish group B'nai B'rith
said Wednesday it hopes that ``justice will be done'' in the case
of Dinko Sakic, the commander of Croatia's worst World War II
concentration camp.
	   ``We do not intend to in any way prejudge the outcome of the
Sakic trial,'' Tommy Baer, the group's international director, told
reporters. ``But it is our hope that the process reflects the
highest standards, of both justice and of the Croatian people, and
that justice will be done.''
	   The delegation from B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League, whose
years-long efforts led to the arrest of Sakic, arrived this week to
observe the government's handling of the case.
	   Sakic, 76, was extradited to Croatia in June from Argentina and
is in a Zagreb prison while prosecutors prepare a case against him
for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Sakic ran the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp in World
War II, when Croatia was a Nazi puppet state.

US says no reason to scale back Iraq nuclear inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with US saying there's no reason to
scaleback inspections, TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council considered the latest
report on Iraq's nuclear abilities Wednesday but wasn't expected to
scale back inspections after the United States said Baghdad still
hadn't come forward with enough information about its weapons
program.
	   Iraq has made no progress in giving U.N. inspectors information
about weapons design, uranium enrichment and nuclear exports, U.S.
ambassador Bill Richardson said as the council was debating the
report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``There is absolutely no progress,'' Richardson said. ``And if
there is no progress, there is no closure on the nuclear file.''
	   Washington successfully blocked an effort this spring by Russia,
France and China to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to
less intrusive passive monitoring and verification visits after the
last IAEA report was released in April.
	   That report, and the one being considered Wednesday, said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program but said they also couldn't certify
that no such evidence existed.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov conceded in an interview
Tuesday that he didn't think there was the ``political will''
within the council to codify any scaleback Wednesday.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Wednesday the council
should move immediately to shift the IAEA's focus to monitoring and
verification visits.
	   ``The IAEA has admitted in past reports, and also in Wednesday's
report, that there is no prohibited activities in Iraq,'' Hamdoon
said as the council began discussing the IAEA report.
	   He said there was no point in delaying the scaleback until the
next IAEA report, which is due in October, when all sanctions are
up for review.
	   The United States and Britain traditionally have taken the
hardest line against the lifting of sanctions, while the other
three permanent council members Russia, France and China have been
more sympathetic to the Iraqi cause.
	   The IAEA report noted that ``Iraq had made significant progress
in weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when the
inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf War.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It urged that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring system
continue to try to answer the remaining questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.

Gas blast in Moscow apartment building kills at least three

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 10-story brick apartment building collapsed
after an apparent gas explosion, killing at least three people _ a
child and an engaged couple _ officials and neighbors said. Five
people were injured.
	   Part of the building in eastern Moscow was demolished from top
to bottom and an entire column of ruined apartments gaped open.
Only the wallpaper was left.
	   Rescue workers accompanied by sniffer dogs cleared away sections
of prefabricated wall, mattresses, window and door frames as they
searched for more victims.
	   ``I felt that the wall had fallen,'' said Konstantin, 32, who
was sleeping when the explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (1030
GMT).
	   ``The windows were blown out. Then I went into the kitchen and a
corner of my kitchen was gone,'' he said, refusing to give his last
name.
	   Three people died and five were injured in the incident on
Sherbakovskaya Street near Izmailovo Park, the Ministry for
Emergency Situations said.
	   One of those killed was a child, said district mayor Boris
Ulyanov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The other two were a man and a woman engaged to be married on
Saturday, neighbors said.
	   A distraught man they said was the woman's father rushed among
the crowd of bystanders held back by crime tape, demanding to talk
to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Police restrained him.
	   At least one of the injured was taken by helicopter to Moscow's
main trauma center, the Sklifosovsky Hospital. The chief doctor at
the hospital, identified by the RTR television station as A.
Shcherbyuk, said that the injured woman was in critical condition,
with burns over 90 percent of her body.
	   Smoke began billowing from underneath the collapsed building
shortly after the explosion, but there was no open fire, said
Viktor Beltsov, a spokesman for the Ministry for Emergency
Situations.
	   Thick police cordons surrounded the area and several ambulance
crews were waiting on the ground.
	   Luzhkov went to the site to personally direct the rescue
efforts.
	   He said investigators had preliminarily concluded that the blast
was caused by a gas leak or buildup.
	   ``There are no signs of an explosive device,'' Luzhkov said.
	   He said the blast was equivalent to the force of 5 kilograms (11
pounds) of TNT.
	   Neighbors challenged the investigators' conclusions, saying
there had been no smell of gas before the collapse.
	   ``It was not a gas fire, there was just smoke. You can't have a
gas explosion without fire,'' said Galina Lomonosova, who lived in
another section of the damaged building.

Myanmar rejects request for U.S., Japan diplomats to meet Suu Kyi

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In an unusual public scolding,
Western officials expressed deep displeasure to Myanmar's foreign
minister Wednesday over his country's refusal to let diplomats
visit opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent a sixth day in
her car at a police roadblock.
	   ``It's unbearable and regrettable,'' Wolfgang Schuessel,
president of the EU Council, told a news conference as Myanmar
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw listened several seats away. ``This
response is not satisfactory.''
	   Ohn Gyaw had told the news conference that his country's
military government would not allow the diplomats to visit Suu Kyi
at the roadblock on a highway outside the capital.
	   ``At this juncture the meeting is not urgently needed,'' Ohn
Gyaw said. ``We have our ways to deal with the impasse.''
	   The news conference came at the end of several days of meetings
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other Asian
and Western countries on security and other issues.
	   During a break in the sessions Tuesday, seven foreign ministers
met with Ohn Gyaw to press concerns about human rights and ask that
the Japanese ambassador and the U.S. charges d'affaires in Myanmar
be allowed to visit Suu Kyi.
	   The opposition leader was stopped by police last Friday as she
traveled by car to meet with members of her party, the National
League for Democracy. The party said her car was blocked by barbed
wire, sandbags and soldiers.
	   Two doctors who examined her Tuesday in her car found she was
showing signs of dehydration, the party said.
	   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer, sitting next to Ohn Gyaw at the news conference
and looking at him as he spoke. He said another attempt would be
made Wednesday to get permission for Western diplomats to see Suu
Kyi.
	   ``I'm not very hopeful that we will be able to meet with her,''
Downer said. ``Her doctor said her blood pressure is falling, and
she's not so well.''
	   Ohn Gyaw said the government had arranged for food to be taken
to Suu Kyi and that an ambulance was standing by. Party members,
however, said she would not use it.
	   Schuessel said the pressure placed on Myanmar during Tuesday's
meeting _ which included ministers from New Zealand, Australia,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, the European Union and the United
States _ and in Wednesday's news conference was unprecedented.
	   ``I think they have never seen that before _ such strong
pressure from the world,'' he said. ``We're able and willing to do
our utmost to solve the crisis.''
	   The government in Myanmar has accused Suu Kyi of staging a
publicity stunt to draw attention during the ASEAN meetings in
Manila. Ohn Gyaw told the news conference that Suu Kyi had left the
capital without saying where she was going.
	   Myanmar was accepted as a member by ASEAN last year despite
opposition from Western nations and from Suu Kyi, who said the
military government should be pressured, not embraced.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who left Manila
Wednesday morning after attending the meetings, said the United
States would hold the Myanmar military responsible for the 1991
Nobel Peace Prize winner's health and safety.
	   ``Aung San Suu Kyi should be able to travel freely in her own
country,'' Albright said.
	   Later Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Foley, in
Sydney, Australia, with Albright, said, ``We understand there may
be a question about the deterioration of her health. ... It's time
to find a way out of this situation.''
	   ``We're still purusing vigorously a meeting with her through our
embassy in Burma. And also we're continuing to press for a meeting
with senior govenrment officials in Burma to seek a resolution,''
he said.

Angolan gov't reports more rebel attacks; rebels say peace accord
</HEADLINE>
close to collapse
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mussende reportedly captured by UNITA in 5th graf
 &UR; CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government Wednesday reported new
attacks on outlying towns by the former rebel movement UNITA while
the guerrillas warned that Angola's four-year-old peace accord was
on the verge of collapse.
	   ``The peace in Angola is hanging by a thread,'' UNITA official
Rui Oliveira said, referring to the deepening tension between the
former foes which threatens to undermine their 1994 peace
agreement.
	   The government claims UNITA has killed hundreds of civilians and
police in attacks in recent months, including the massacre of some
200 people last week, while the rebels allege that police have
tortured and murdered their supporters.
	   There was no independent verification of the charges which have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA forces Tuesday captured the strategic town of Mussende,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Luanda, after ``fierce
fighting'' with local police, the local governor told state-run
media Wednesday. No information was available about the number of
casualties.
	   Mussende lies on a main road leading to Luanda.
	   Rebel soldiers earlier this week also occupied two villages near
Mussende, in Cuanza Sul province, state radio RNA reported, citing
unidentified government sources.
	   UNITA last year had handed back control of the towns to the
government as part of the United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
	   Jonas Savimbi's rebels, regarded as one of Africa's strongest
guerrilla forces, seized more than half of the country during the
war.
	   Meanwhile Oliveira, a UNITA official who lives in Lisbon, said
the group's supporters had reported a massive government troop
build-up in Huambo province, 560 kilometers (350 miles) south of
the capital, within striking distance of UNITA's remaining central
highland strongholds where its leadership is based.
	   He denied the government reports of UNITA attacks.
	   Oliveira complained that European Union sanctions against his
movement, announced Tuesday, were ``unfair'' and further undermined
the peace process.
	   ``The international community is biased against UNITA and is in
fact giving the government a carte blanche to launch an attack
against us,'' Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   The EU sanctions included restrictions on UNITA's diamond sales,
which provide the movement with hundreds of millions of dollars
annually, and a freeze of its bank accounts.
	   The U.N. passed similar sanctions earlier this year.
	   Oliveira alleged the army and police had committed human rights
abuses in areas returned to government control but had escaped
punishment.

Volleyball chief slams Nebiolo over drug issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with IAAF reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ In an extraordinary public war of
words between international sports leaders, Primo Nebiolo and Ruben
Acosta exchanged bitter accusations Wednesday on the issue of
doping.
	   Acosta, the Mexican president of the international volleyball
federation (FIVB), accused Nebiolo, Italian leader of track and
field's world governing body, of making ``totally false''
allegations and acting ``in bad faith.''
	   Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, responded by accusing Acosta of making ``useless,
personal polemics.''
	   Acosta and Nebiolo have been political rivals for years within
the Olympic movement, but this week's developments brought the
emnity into the public domain for the first time.
	   In a press release Monday, Nebiolo condemned volleyball, cycling
and tennis for allegedly refusing to sign an agreement on doping
rules and sanctions drawn up five years ago by the International
Olympic Committee.
	   Acosta fired back at Nebiolo in own press release Wednesday.
	   ``Primo Nebiolo should spend his time wiping out the systematic
doping in track and field instead of inventing lies on other
sports,'' Acosta said in a statement released by FIVB headquarters
in Lausanne.
	   ``He is in bad faith when he declares that volleyball, together
with other sports, refused to sign the convention agreed by the IOC
and the other international federations.
	   ``Although doping is almost non-existent in volleyball .... FIVB
was the first international federation to join the convention with
the IOC, even accepting the international court of arbitration for
sport, exclusively concerning appeals on doping control
decisions.''
	   Acosta also attacked Nebiolo's proposal to hold a worldwide
conference on doping, saying Nebiolo would try to use the meeting
for his own ends.
	   ``The world meeting called by Nebiolo would lead to an impasse
specially if he intends to manipulate it to his advantage as he has
on other occasions, rejecting reasonable opinions from other
international federations,'' Acosta said.
	   ``As president of ASOIF (Association of Summer Olympic
International Federations), Nebiolo should follow certain ethical
rules and be more prudent when mentioning other international
federations than his own. He should also stop taking powers that he
was not accorded at any official federation meeting.''
	   The IAAF issued a response Wednesday from its headquarters in
Monaco, expressing ``strong disappointment'' at Acosta's remarks.
	   The IAAF contested Acosta's claim that the FIVB was the first
federation to sign the anti-doping agreement, saying the original
accord signed Jan. 12/13, 1994 does not include the FIVB's
signature.
	   ``The IAAF categorically and adamantly rejects Mr. Acosta's
statements which only serve to cast grave doubt on the veracity and
good faith of Mr. Acosta's own intentions,'' the IAAF said.
	   ``The IAAF regrets to see that a problem as critical as doping
is reduced to question of useless, personal polemics through
comments and insinuations which contravene every concept of
reasonable relations between sports administrators.''

UNHCR acknowledges accounting `problems' in `clean bill of health'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Responding to a report that the U.N. refugee
agency was losing millions of dollars because of bad management,
the agency said Wednesday its overall performance was good despite
some ``problems.''
	   The London-based Financial Times reported Wednesday that its
research and an independent auditors' report highlight ``serious
failings'' in UNHCR's financial management.
	   The newspaper said incompetent management, dubious accounting
and possibly fraud were costing the agency millions of dollars.
	   Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, dismissed the report as ``mistaken and inaccurate.''
	   ``We sometimes have to bend or even break the rules in the name
of helping people quickly,'' said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ``The audit report in its
final conclusion actually gives us a clean bill of health.''
	   The newspaper said auditors express concern in their study, due
to be presented to the U.N. General Assembly this fall, that UNHCR
financial statements fail to accurately reflect and justify annual
spending.
	   In one case, it said the audit found a contract for materials to
repair 900 homes and eight schools _ but auditors found only 719 of
the homes and none of the schools had been repaired.
	   The newspaper says it obtained its information from ``sources
close'' to UNHCR and internal documents made available to it.
	   U.N. organizations including UNHCR, which has an annual dlrs 1
billion budget, have come under pressure from donor countries such
as Britain and the United States to tighten their purse strings.
	   A spokeswoman for the British government's Department for
International Development, speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to comment directly on the report and said that as far as
officials were aware, the leaked documents had not come from her
department.
	   She said, however, that while there were areas of UNHCR's work
with which Britain was ``very happy,'' there were others in which
there is ``scope for improvement.''
	   The United States has in the past expressed solid support for
UNHCR and has praised Sadako Ogata's leadership of the agency as an
example to the rest of the United Nations.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States believes UNHCR is
demonstrating an ``admirable willingness to undertake self
examination and to cooperate with external examiners.''
	   But the spokesman, who declined to comment on The Financial
Times' report, said the United States also believed weaknesses in
the performance of U.N. agencies should be corrected.
	   The last page of the audit, made available to The Associated
Press, appeared to back up Janowski's claim of an overall clean
bill of health.
	   ``In our opinion, the transactions of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees which we have tested as part of our
audit, have in all significant respects been in accordance with the
financial regulations and legislative authority,'' it said.
	   It was signed by Vijay Krishna Shunglu, comptroller and auditor
general of India; Osei tutu Prempeh, auditor-general of Ghana; and
Sir John Bourn, British comptroller and auditor general
	   Janowski said that under Ogata's leadership, an inspection team
was set up in 1993 which investigates suspected irregularities.
	   UNHCR would write to the Financial Times to express its
disappointment with the newspaper's report and point out what it
believed to be errors.
	   ``Senior management has been totally open,'' Janowski said.

Philippine navy guards site of possible ancient shipwreck
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine navy has sent
troops to guard the site of what may be the wreck of an ancient
Chinese junk that sank in southern Philippines waters, the military
said Wednesday.
	   The navy said a local resident has recovered as many as 400
porcelain and clay jars, plates and bowls from the site off the
town of Luuk on Jolo Island, about 950 kilometers (590 miles) south
of Manila.
	   It said its own divers have recovered 62 pieces of intact
porcelain and clay items, 150 damaged items, seven human bones and
a wooden plank. Some of the items have been sent to a museum in
Manila for identification.
	   It was uncertain what authorities would do to recover the
artifacts that are in private hands.
	   The wreck, discovered early this month and still unidentified,
lies under 130 feet (about 40 meters) of water and is buried in
sand.
	   In Manila, Eusebio Dizon, chief of underwater archeology of the
National Museum, said the site is along an ancient Chinese trading
route. He said ancient Chinese artifacts have been found on Jolo
Island in the past but he was unaware of any previous wreck.
	   Dizon lamented that the site had been disturbed instead of being
immediately secured and protected for systematic excavation.
	   ``We have no concept of the importance of an archeological find
and some are only interested to make money,'' he said. ``They
should not have touched it. They should not disturb what has been
left.''
	   Dizon was thankful for the navy's action, but expressed fears
that some of the items may be lost forever.
	   He said a tight budget prevents the museum from immediately
sending an archeological mission.

Top Russian economist says ruble devaluation inevitable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian economist issued a new warning
Wednesday that a devaluation of the Russian currency is inevitable,
and that a recently approved international bailout package will
only delay it.
	   Andrei Illarionov, director of the independent Economic Analysis
Institute, predicted the devaluation of the ruble would come as
early as October, despite the government's repeated statements that
it has no such plans.
	   The ruble has been trading steadily recently, at about 6.2 to
the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank has spent millions of dollars to
keep it there.
	   Illarionov said these efforts are choking economic growth.
	   ``Tight monetary policies and government tax demands necessary
to maintain the ruble ... will only deepen the economic problems,''
Illarionov said. ``Devaluing the ruble now would give the Russian
economy a chance to turn around, since it would cut the
government's debt and lower the (interest) rates.''
	   Illarionov rocked Russian financial markets last month when he
predicted a devaluation of at least 50 percent. He has close
contacts with reformers in the Russian government, and is widely
respected within the country.
	   Russia and a group of lenders led by the International Monetary
Fund agreed earlier this month on an aid package to shore up
Russian markets and restore confidence in the ruble. Together with
previously approved loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion.
	   The first installment of the loan was deposited in the Central
Bank to boost its foreign currency reserves and assure investors
the government had the resources to defend the ruble.
	   However, the plan has failed to restore confidence. Russian
stocks have also failed to recover much, after falling more than 60
percent since the beginning of the year.
	   On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher. The Russian Trading
System Index rose 0.46% to close at 147.96 points, up from 147.28
points Tuesday. Volume rose to dlrs 26.6 million from dlrs 23.5
million Tuesday.
	   The State Statistics Committee had some good news Wednesday:
Russia's budget deficit fell to 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product in the first five months of 1998, down from 3.8 percent in
the same period a year earlier.
	   In January-May 1998, the deficit totaled 35.5 billion rubles
(dlrs 5.7 billion), down from 36.2 billion rubles (dlrs 5.8
billion) in the same period last year.
	   Lowering the deficit was a precondition set by the IMF for the
loan package.
	   Illarionov said Russia can probably hold the ruble steady until
late October, when most of dlrs 8 billion in foreign loans taken by
Russian banks mature.
	   He disputed notions that devaluation would lead to a free-fall
of the ruble and that it would spark spiraling inflation.

Indonesia offers travel packages to woo jittery tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Indonesia is pushing to gain back
tourists who stopped visiting the Southeast Asian nation due to
recent protests, rioting and a regional economic slump, a diplomat
said Wednesday.
	   The number of tourists traveling to Indonesia has plunged by
about 60 percent this year after it received 5 million visitors in
1997, said Nasaruddin Koro, deputy chief of Indonesia's embassy in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``The government is now putting a lot of effort to boost this
industry, which has lagged since the economic slump last year,'' he
told reporters.
	   In addition, riots in May, in which about 1,200 people were
killed in the capital and other cities, shocked Indonesians and
scared off tourists.
	   The government has organized a slew of tourist programs to woo
back jittery vacationers, Koro said.
	   Indonesia's national airline, Garuda Indonesia, will be offering
discounted tickets in promotional packages dubbed ``Let's Go
Indonesia,'' ``Happy Day'' and ``Magic Month.''
	   Koro added that Indonesian officials would be sent abroad to
encourage tourists to visit their country after attending the
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia this September. About 80,000 people
are expected for the sports extravaganza.
	   Tourism officials in Indonesia have repeatedly blamed the
foreign media for scaring off tourists by exaggerating their
country's political and economic strife.

One year later, Tyson seeks license in New Jersey to fight again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike Tyson's lawyer told boxing
regulators on Wednesday that he would show them a different side of
the former heavyweight champion, who was banned from the sport
after biting Evander Holyfield.
	   Anthony Fusco Jr., who has known Tyson only six weeks, told the
New Jersey Athletic Control Board that Tyson was ``a very
extraordinary man.''
	   ``We want to show a brighter side of Mike Tyson, not just a
darker side,'' said Fusco.
	   Tyson was expected to be among the last of 10 witnesses to
testify at the hearing to determine whether the 32-year-old fighter
will be licensed in the state of New Jersey. The American state of
Nevada revoked his license after the Holyfield fight.
	   Tyson has not fought since last year when he bit Holyfield on
both ears during a heavyweight bout in Las Vegas.
	   Two boxers testifying on Tyson's behalf said that in the heat of
battle, almost anything can happen in the ring, and that the
fighter is not always conscious of his actions.
	   Former heavyweight contender Chuck Wepner said even Muhammad Ali
was known to lose his composure in the ring.
	   ``It's something that happens to you in the ring and it's hard
to explain,'' Wepner told the panel.
	   No mention was made of the Holyfield fight until 45 minutes into
the hearing when Assistant Attorney General Michael Haas brought it
up, questioning Wepner.
	   Former light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz echoed Wepner's
comments, saying Tyson snapped in the ring, but that it shouldn't
prevent him from returning to it.
	   ``A piece of the street came out in him,'' Czyz said.
	   He also said that if he was fighting an opponent and knocked the
guy's eye out, he would eat it before the guy had a chance to get
it back.
	   ``That's the kind of mentality you have to have,'' Czyz said.
	   Testifying via videotape was 93-year-old Camille Ewald, former
companion of Tyson's longtime mentor Cuss D'Amato. She said Tyson
continues to support her financially and calls her his ``white
mother.''
	   Holding hands with his wife, Tyson was cheered as he arrived for
the hearing. But there were also scattered boos and a half-dozen
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, a feminist rights organization, demonstrated outside.
	   The three-member panel will have 45 days to decide whether Tyson
has ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as
required by the state's boxing law. No immediate decision was
expected, according to spokesman Roger Shatzkin.
	   Questions have been raised whether New Jersey should be the
state to grant Tyson a license. Some say Tyson should return to
Nevada for his regulatory repentance.
	   Fighting for Holyfield's WBA title June 28, 1997, in Las Vegas,
Tyson bit his right ear. After a four-minute delay, the fight
resumed and he bit him on the left ear, prompting referee Mills
Lane to disqualify him.
	   The Nevada State Athletic Commission swiftly revoked Tyson's
license and fined him dlrs 3 million, leaving him eligible to apply
for reinstatement after one year. He has not done so.
	   Fusco said Tyson applied in New Jersey because he likes fighting
in the coastal resort town and casino gambling venue of Atlantic
City, adding he may later seek a license in Nevada.
	   But there also was the fear by Tyson's handlers that Nevada
regulators would make him wait longer to get his license, and a
further layoff would diminish his skills. Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he did not think
Nevada would have re-licensed the fighter.
	   Asked about the reports that Nevada would have delayed granting
Tyson a license, Marc Ratner, the commission's executive director,
said: ``It is unfair to prejudge what the Nevada commission would
have done, just as it would be unfair for the Nevada commission to
prejudge what would be done at this hearing.''
	   The move to New Jersey has drawn criticism from boxing insiders
and regulators.
	   ``They should direct him to Nevada, which revoked the license in
the first place,'' boxing promoter Bob Arum said. ``Let Nevada make
the first ruling. To do anything otherwise is to destroy the sport
of boxing.''
	   Under U.S. federal law, one state does not have to abide by
suspensions levied by others.
	   Yet Nevada wants other states to respect its ban. Dennis Vacco,
the lead prosecutor for the state of New York, said the granting of
a license by New Jersey for Tyson would violate the spirit of
cooperation between states.
	   ``If any state breaks ranks with Nevada and awards Mr. Tyson a
license at this point, it would severely undermine the objective of
discipline and weaken the solidarity we are trying to achieve
through interstate cooperation in the policing of boxing,'' Vacco
wrote last week in a letter to New Jersey Attorney General Peter
Verniero, his counterpart in the neighboring state.

Jerusalem mayor: Israel wants to annex surrounding settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel wants to annex the Jewish West Bank
settlements surrounding Jerusalem, the city's mayor acknowledged
Wednesday. But he denied that a widely criticized plan to expand
Jerusalem's authority was a step in that direction.
	   ``The ultimate goal of Israel is to annex those territories,''
Ehud Olmert said in an interview with foreign reporters. ``We want
greater Jerusalem to be part of the state of Israel, period.''
	   But Olmert insisted that the controversial plan approved by
Israel's Cabinet last month was not an attempt to alter the
political status of Jerusalem or of the settlements ahead of a
negotiated agreement with the Palestinians. The Palestinians hope
to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with its
capital in east Jerusalem.
	   According to the interim Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the
final status of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem _ captured
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War _ is supposed to be determined in
negotiations on a final agreement.
	   Palestinians have charged that Israel's plan to extend some
Jerusalem municipal authorities to nearby settlements pre-empts
those negotiations by unilaterally expanding Jerusalem's borders
and de facto annexing West Bank settlements. The United States
called the plan ``provocative.''
	   Olmert said the plan, which would set up an umbrella authority
to provide certain services _ including planning and building _ to
settlements, was an administrative, ``entirely non-political'' move
to coordinate the delivery of services.
	   The main purpose of the plan, which in addition to extending
municipal services would also formally annex several suburbs inside
Israel, is to expand Jerusalem's economic base and help ensure its
Jewish majority, Olmert said.
	   Israel has never tried to hide that it wants to retain
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem and the settlements around the
city, Olmert said.
	   ``We hope that at the end of the political process, all of these
places will be part of Israel,'' he said. ``This has been spelled
out by all Israeli leaders since 1967.''
	   But Olmert said Israel has made clear that any annexation of
settlements would come out of the political negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   ``We will not do anything which is violating the international
commitments which Israel took upon itself as part of the Oslo
agreements,'' he said.
	   A final peace agreement was supposed to be reached by next May,
but negotiations have failed to begin since Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took office in 1996.
	   Also Wednesday, Olmert said that the city's effort to ensure its
Jewish majority involves bringing more Jews into the city and
making it more attractive for them to stay, not restricting the
number of Arab residents _ although he said Palestinians from the
West Bank should not be allowed to move to Jerusalem.
	   Jerusalem is currently about 70 percent Jewish and 30 percent
Arab.
	   Olmert criticized the Interior Ministry's policy of confiscating
Jerusalem residency permits from Palestinian residents, and said
that policy had been changed.
	   ``It is not a secret ... that we want to have a very clear and
substantial Jewish majority,'' he said. ``But the only way that we
can achieve it is by attracting more Jews to live in the city.''
	   Olmert also said that Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub's
agents are working in east Jerusalem in violation of the
Israel-Palestinian accords, which bar the Palestinian Authority
from operating in the city, and he said Netanyahu's government was
not doing enough to stop them.
	   Asked about Rajoub's comment this week that Netanyahu a ``racist
and a liar'' who is out for bloodshed, Olmert accused Rajoub of
involvement in kidnappings and killings and called him ``the symbol
of the brutality and hooliganism of some of the Palestinians.''

Labor-management standoff continues at Hyundai Motor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Motor Co. said Wednesday it
was extending the shutdown of its main plant by four days, but
thousands of unionized workers refused to leave until they were
guaranteed job security.
	   Assembly lines at Hyundai's plant in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175
miles) southeast of Seoul, remained idle for the 10th day. Hyundai
had tried in vain to restart its assembly lines Tuesday after an
eight-day shutdown intended to ease labor tension.
	   Some 26,000 workers belonging to the Hyundai Motor union, one of
the country's most militant, refused to return to work unless
management canceled its plan to fire 2,687 workers this month.
Management says layoffs are inevitable.
	   A company helicopter scattered leaflets urging 5,000 striking
workers holed up in the plant to remove their barricades and leave.
	   At dusk Wednesday, the workers rallied near the plant's main
gate, shouting ``No to layoffs!'' the national news agency Yonhap
reported. A brief scuffle erupted when company guards tried to
prevent labor activists from entering the plant to join the rally.
	   Earlier Wednesday, labor activists trying to join a rally in
front of the Ulsan city hall kicked and punched at riot police.
	   No injuries were reported in either clash.
	   ``We have to shut down our factory again because illegal union
activities make normal operation impossible,'' said Hyundai Motor
executive Kim Pan-kon.
	   Hyundai, the nation's leading automaker, wants to cut redundant
workers as its domestic sales plummet because of the nation's
economic crisis. Its plants are operating at 40 percent of their
capacity of 1.25 million vehicles a year.
	   The company fired some 5,000 workers earlier this year.
	   South Korea's economy was bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund in December, but stiff conditions were imposed. With

United States opens worlds by routing Brazil

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Yugoslavia wins. DELETES old material. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Wendell Alexis led the way with 13 points
and eight rebounds as the United States overcame a slow start
Wednesday to beat Brazil 83-59 in the opener for both teams at the
World Basketball Championship.
	   With the Dream Teamers at home because of the NBA labor dispute,
the U.S. cast of understudies relied on defense and plenty of
second-efforts to subdue the South Americans.
	   The American stars' no-show brought down the skill level and the
attendance figures.
	   About 500 fans showed up at cavernous, 18,000-seat Olympic
Stadium for the U.S.-Brazil game, and organizers said the
tournament, which ends Aug. 9, is likely to lose money.
	   The United States went more than four minutes at the start of
the game without a field goal, missing its first six shots, and
trailed by five after 10 minutes.
	   But an end-to-end drive by Michael Hawkins (12 points, 10
assists) capped a 13-1 run that helped give the U.S. team a 40-32
halftime lead.
	   The United States held Brazil to 36.4 percent shooting from the
field and converted several easy breakaway baskets into the
second-half spurt that won the game.
	   It was a team effort, as 11 of the 12 Americans scored.
	   Alexis, 34, typifies the group. The 6-foot-10 (2.06-meter)
forward was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 1986 but was
cut, and embarked on a career that has brought him to Spain, Italy
and now Germany.
	   Duke's Trajan Langdon, a late roster replacement for Big Ten
Player of the Year Mateen Cleaves (twisted ankle), sparked the U.S.
offense with two 3-pointers late in the first half.
	   Langdon is the only college player on coach Rudy Tomjanovich's
roster. The rest are either in the CBA, with European teams _ or
looking for work.
	   The United States will face Lithuania on Thursday, and South
Korea on Friday in preliminary round play.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday, Miroslav Beric's 23 points paced European
champion Yugoslavia's 80-66 defeat of Puerto Rico.
	   Lithuania and Russia, two countries that used to supply players
for the Soviet juggernaut, both enjoyed blowout victories.
	   Darius Lukminus scored 20 points and Arturas Karnishovas added
19 as Lithuania beat South Korea 97-56. Russia had five players in
double figures in its 83-58 win over Japan.
	   Lithuania struggled through the first 20 minutes against South
Korea, trailing by as many as five points, before running away in
the second half.
	   Once it got going, Lithuania _ bronze medalist at the last two
Olympics _ didn't seem to miss its NBA big-man tandem of Arvydas
Sabonis and Zydrunas Ilgauskas.
	   With the NBA lockout in place, only one player from the league _
Australia's Chris Anstey _ is participating in the tournament.
	   In other opening action Wednesday, it was: Nigeria vs. Spain,
Senegal vs. Italy, Australia vs. Argentina, and Greece vs. Canada.
	   The other venue for the championhip, 14,000-capacity Peace and
Friendship Stadium across town, was also nearly empty Wednesday.
	   Before USA Basketball dumped the Dream Team in mid-June, local
organizers predicted ticket and merchandise sales would be enough
to cover expenses and perhaps turn a profit. But now they are
facing the likelihood of about 100 million drachmas (about dlrs
330,000) in losses, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   ``After the absence of the American team, expectations are not
so good,'' said Vassilis Skountis, head of the organizing
committee's media office. ``We have sold about half as many tickets
as we had hoped.''

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Satellite photos this morning showed a tropical wave moving west
across 60 degrees west and into the Lesser Antilles.
	   Most showers and thunderstorms associated with this wave had
affected the Windward Islands as of 5 a.m., but showers were
approaching the southern Leeward Islands and should reach there by
early afternoon.
	   Drier and more stable air is moving ahead of the wave, and it
will remain across our islands for much of the day today. Scattered
showers and isolated thunderstorms associated with the tropical
wave are expected to move into the Virgin Islands around sunset
Wednesday evening and across Puerto Rico Wednesday night.
	   Until then, look for mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies today
with widely scattered to scattered afternoon showers. Upper-level
conditions may allow one or two showers to intensify into
thunderstorms across western Puerto Rico.
	   Moderate to fresh trade winds will accompany this tropical wave
into the east and northeast Caribbean this afternoon and tonight.
	   Tropical storm Alex was located behind this tropical wave and
over the central tropical Atlantic this morning. It was moving west
at 18 knots.
	   Alex is expected to move generally west to west-northwest
through Friday and could approach the northeast Caribbean or the
Atlantic waters to our northeast on Saturday.
	   Alex marks the beginning of hurricane season activity, and
residents are urged to closely monitor this and upcoming tropical
systems. Now is the time to finalize your hurricane preparedness
plans.

Albright views ravaged coastline, announces more U.S disaster aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with more details, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright got a bird's eye view of a stretch of desolate
coastline in Papua New Guinea where entire villages were flattened.
``It simply staggers the imagination,'' she said Wednesday in
announcing a new installment of U.S. disaster aid.
	   During a two-hour stopover, Albright was briefed by Prime
Minister Bill Skate on the progress of rescue and cleanup
operations in the aftermath of the destruction caused when giant
sea waves pounded the coastline on July 17, claiming thousands of
lives.
	   ``Words can only begin to describe the sorrow we feel at the
death of so many thousands of people, so many of whom where
children,'' Albright said at an airport news conference with Skate.
	   Three giant waves caused by earthquakes smashed across a 22-mile
(35-kilometer) stretch of coast on the island nation's northern
shore, sweeping the four fishing villages into Sissano Lagoon and
sending thousands of survivors fleeing into the jungle.
	   Albright brought with her an announcement that the United States
would contribute an additional dlrs 650,000 in disaster relief,
bringing U.S. assistance so far to just over dlrs 1 million, most
of it in basic supplies like tents, cots, water bottles and medical
supplies.
	   She viewed the damaged coastline from 25,000 feet. Her plane, en
route from the Philippines where she had attended a three-day
diplomatic conference, altered course to take her right over the
Sissano Lagoon.
	   Under a bright mid-afternoon sky, the beaches below appeared
empty and deserted, although rescue operations were under way. ``We
could only imagine the horror of what took place. It simply
staggers the imagination,'' Albright said. ``It's hard not to feel
helpless before the awesome destructive power of nature.''
	   Later, Albright flew on to Sydney, Australia, where she and
Defense Secretary William Cohen were to spend the next few days
meeting with their Australian counterparts on a range of issues.
	   She was the first high-ranking U.S. official to visit the South
Pacific nation since the tsunami disaster _ and the first secretary
of state to ever visit. She was greeted at the airport by dancers
and drummers in native costumes. A flower lei was draped around her
neck.
	   ``We appreciate your presence,'' Skate told Albright, also
thanking her for the new U.S. aid.
	   The aid announced by Albright includes dlrs 250,000 in medical
and rehabilitation assistance for survivors and dlrs 400,000 to
improve seismic early warning systems throughout the country.
Previously, the United States had flown in dlrs 400,000 in relief
supplies.
	   Albright also announced additional U.S. money to support United
Nations peace efforts in Bougainville and praised Skate for helping
to frame a compromise to help bring peace there. Bougainville, 800
miles (1,300 kilometers) northeast of here, is the largest of the
Solomon Islands archipelago but politically is part of Papua New
Guinea.
	   A peace agreement in May between rebel leaders and the Papua New
Guinea government closed the Pacific's longest conflict since World
War II. Since 1988, fighting has killed up to 20,000 people and
driven 40,000 from their homes.
	   ``Papua New Guinea has a historic opportunity to end permanently
a conflict that claimed thousands of innocent lives,'' Albright
said.
	   Death counts vary for the tsunami disaster vary, with some
putting it over 2,000 and growing. Skate told reporters Wednesday
that 1,654 were known to have perished. He said there were 8,200
survivors.
	   Officials have said that about 10,000 lived in the area, mostly
relying on subsistence farming and fishing.
	   Albright was asked by local reporters why she didn't plan a
closer look at the affected area. ``I wanted to make clear my own
personal concern for what has happened. But I did not want to put
any burden on the rescue effort. I didn't want to create another
tidal wave,'' she said.

Jerusalem mayor: Israel wants to annex surrounding settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel wants to annex the Jewish West Bank
settlements surrounding Jerusalem, the city's mayor acknowledged
Wednesday. But he denied that a widely criticized plan to expand
Jerusalem's authority was a step in that direction.
	   ``The ultimate goal of Israel is to annex those territories,''
Ehud Olmert said in an interview with foreign reporters. ``We want
greater Jerusalem to be part of the state of Israel, period.''
	   But Olmert insisted that the controversial plan approved by
Israel's Cabinet last month was not an attempt to alter the
political status of Jerusalem or of the settlements ahead of a
negotiated agreement with the Palestinians. The Palestinians hope
to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with its
capital in east Jerusalem.
	   According to the interim Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the
final status of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem _ captured
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War _ is supposed to be determined in
negotiations on a final agreement.
	   Palestinians have charged that Israel's plan to extend some
Jerusalem municipal authorities to nearby settlements pre-empts
those negotiations by unilaterally expanding Jerusalem's borders
and de facto annexing West Bank settlements. The United States
called the plan ``provocative.''
	   Olmert said the plan, which would set up an umbrella authority
to provide certain services _ including planning and building _ to
settlements, was an administrative, ``entirely non-political'' move
to coordinate the delivery of services.
	   The main purpose of the plan, which in addition to extending
municipal services would also formally annex several suburbs inside
Israel, is to expand Jerusalem's economic base and help ensure its
Jewish majority, Olmert said.
	   Israel has never tried to hide that it wants to retain
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem and the settlements around the
city, Olmert said.
	   ``We hope that at the end of the political process, all of these
places will be part of Israel,'' he said. ``This has been spelled
out by all Israeli leaders since 1967.''
	   However, Olmert said Israel has made clear that any annexation
of settlements would come out of the political negotiations with
the Palestinians.
	   ``We will not do anything which is violating the international
commitments which Israel took upon itself as part of the Oslo
agreements,'' he said.
	   A final peace agreement was supposed to be reached by next May,
but negotiations have failed to begin since Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took office in 1996.
	   Also Wednesday, Olmert said that the city's effort to ensure its
Jewish majority involves bringing more Jews into the city and
making it more attractive for them to stay, not restricting the
number of Arab residents _ although he said Palestinians from the
West Bank should not be allowed to move to Jerusalem.
	   Jerusalem is currently about 70 percent Jewish and 30 percent
Arab.

Muster advances; Karbacher upsets Berasategui at Generali Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Germany's Bernd Karbacher, deep in a
career slump, Wednesday upset fourth-seeded Alberto Berasategui of
Spain in three hard-fought sets at the Generali Open.
	   Karbacher, whose ranking has plummeted from 22nd to 178th the
past three years, reached the third round of the dlrs 535,000 event
with the 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) victory.
	   ``I haven't played this good for months,'' said Karbacher.
``It's a great feeling. Now I know I'm capable of beating anybody
again.''
	   Thomas Muster, Austria's former world No. 1, also climbed into
the third round by slipping past Jan Kroslak of Slovakia, 6-2, 4-6,
6-2.
	   The fifth-seeded Muster now faces defending champion Filip
DeWulf after the Belgium player ousted France's Sebastien Grosjean,
6-7 (7-9), 6-3, 6-3.
	   Karbacher, 23, won two tour titles and reached the quarterfinals
of several grand slams before his career took a downward spin.
	   But playing on courts located just five minutes from his home,
the one-time Davis Cup player started nervously and then grew
stronger during the two-hour match against Berasategui, a former
French Open finalist.
	   Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic was another upset victim,
with Argentina's Lucas Arnold ousting the ninth-seed, 6-2, 6-2.
	   The eighth-seeded Australian, Richard Fromberg, managed to
advance with a 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 win against Austrian qualifier Thomas
Schiessling.
	   But for the Austrian, ranked 455th, the battle he gave Fromberg
was a moral victory. At 23, he has already undergone seven knee
operations.
	   ``This is my fourth comeback,'' said Schiessling. ``I've only
been playing three weeks since the last operation, but no one
believes me.''
	   Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov, seeded No. 2, is the top seeded
player in the draw following the withdrawal of Marcelo Rios because
of an injury.
	   Brazil's Fernando Meligeni and Argentina's Franco Squillari also
won to reach the third round. Both are lower seeds.

	   SAINT-JORIOZ, France (AP) _ The 17th stage of the Tour de France
ended 32-kms (20 miles) into Wednesday's competition, with riders,
angered by an expanding doping investigation, coasting their way to
the finish.
	   Police, meanwhile, were busy. They descended on the Chambery
hotel of the ONCE team of French star Laurent Jalabert for the
second search in two days.
	   Police closed the hotel off to reporters before apparently
searching the place. They were seen removing garbage bags full of
objects from a camping car, then sealing the vehicle off.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest before his team simply
dropped out of the go-slow race.
	   It was the second protest by riders since the July 11 start of
the cycling classic, being overshadowed by the doping scandal which
has knocked the Festina team out of the race.
	   Last Friday, riders held up the 12th stage for two hours in a
similar protest.
	   On Wednesday, riders halted at the 32 kms mark of the 149-km
(92.5-mile) leg from the Alpine ski station of Albertville to
Aix-les-Bains.
	   Some of the 133 riders began to race again, only to fall into
line with the go-slow decision. Others stripped off their race
numbers.
	   All were protesting the way French officials are carrying out an
investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs on the
Tour.
	   On Tuesday night, members of the Dutch TVM were taken away and
held for hours for medical testing while police searched luggage.
	   More police searches were expected Wednesday evening, and riders
feared the same.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Jalabert is ranked the No. 1 cyclist in the world by the
International Cycling Union based on results over the year.
Jalabert was the world champion in the time trial last year and has
been France's top hope in cycling since Richard Virenque was kicked
out of the Tour with his Festina team.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc appealed over Radio Tour, the race's radio
station, for riders to restart the race. To no avail.
	   However, Leblanc said later that he felt he had assurances that
further police action would be done with dignity.
	   Citing the ``traumatism'' of the riders, he said in an interview
with France 2 television that further testing should involve just a
``very, very small number of riders'' and ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   Riders ``merit reaching the apotheosis Sunday in Paris on the
Champs Elysees,'' Leblanc said, referring to the Sunday finish on
the famed avenue.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Standa, one of Italy's largest retailers, announced
Wednesday the sale of its supermarkets and department stores.
	   The buyers are the Franchini Group, a former owner of another
supermarket chain, with bank Mediocredito Lombardo, and the Coin
group.
	   Standa said it will get 100 billion lire (dlrs 56 million) while
700 billion lire (dlrs 393 million) are needed to take on Standa's
existing contract obligations and debt.
	   Franchini will buy Standa's 193 supermarkets, while Coin will
take over its 167 department stores.
	   The negotiations don't include real estate holdings of the group
or its Toys Center and Blockbuster Italia units.
	   Standa is controlled by media magnate and former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi through his Fininvest holding company.

Man is knight for a day _ a bad day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a mock medieval battle that suddenly
turned too authentic, a man playing the role of a knight was
severely stabbed by another player, the Baltic News Service
reported Wednesday.
	   Gatis Indrevics, 18, was sparring in knights' garb with an
opponent who apparently became overexcited, pulled a real knife and
plunged it into Indrevics' side, BNS said.
	   Participants in such mock battles usually use blunted knives.
	   BNS said Indrevics was in intensive but that his life was not in
danger.
	   The incident occurred Saturday in Cesis, 75 kilometers (45
miles) northeast of Riga, a stronghold of 13th century German
knights.
	   The report said prosecutors were discussing whether to charge
the assailant with reckless endangerment, which carries a prison
sentence of up to one year.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mussende reportedly captured by UNITA in 5th
graf; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government Wednesday reported new
attacks on outlying towns by the former rebel movement UNITA, while
the guerrillas warned that Angola's four-year-old peace accord was
on the verge of collapse.
	   ``The peace in Angola is hanging by a thread,'' UNITA official
Rui Oliveira said, referring to the deepening tension between the
former foes which threatens to undermine their 1994 peace
agreement.
	   The government claims UNITA has killed hundreds of civilians and
police in attacks in recent months, including the massacre of some
200 people last week, while the rebels allege that police have
tortured and murdered their supporters.
	   There was no independent verification of the charges which have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA forces Tuesday captured the strategic town of Mussende,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Luanda, after ``fierce
fighting'' with local police, the local governor told state-run
media Wednesday. No information was available about the number of
casualties.
	   Mussende, a town in Cuanza Sul province near where rebel
soldiers had occupied two villages earlier this week, lies on a
main road leading to Luanda.
	   UNITA last year had handed back control of the towns to the
government as part of the United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
	   Jonas Savimbi's rebels, regarded as one of Africa's strongest
guerrilla forces, seized more than half of the country during the
war.
	   Meanwhile Oliveira, a UNITA official who lives in Lisbon, said
the group's supporters had reported a massive government troop
build-up in Huambo province, 560 kilometers (350 miles) south of
the capital, within striking distance of UNITA's remaining central
highland strongholds.
	   He denied the government reports of UNITA attacks.
	   Oliveira complained that European Union sanctions against his
movement, announced Tuesday, were ``unfair'' and further undermined
the peace process.
	   ``The international community is biased against UNITA and is in
fact giving the government a carte blanche to launch an attack
against us,'' Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   The EU sanctions included restrictions on UNITA's diamond sales,
which provide the movement with hundreds of millions of dollars
annually, and a freeze of its bank accounts.
	   The U.N. passed similar sanctions earlier this year.
	   Oliveira alleged the army and police had committed human rights
abuses in areas returned to government control but had escaped
punishment.

B'nai B'rith hopes justice will be done in the Sakic case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The prominent Jewish group B'nai B'rith
expressed hope Wednesday that ``justice will be done'' in the case
of Dinko Sakic, commander of Croatia's worst World War II
concentration camp.
	   Sakic, 76, was extradited to Croatia in June from Argentina and
is in a Zagreb prison while prosecutors prepare a case against him
for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   ``We do not intend to in any way prejudge the outcome of the
Sakic trial,'' Tommy Baer, the group's international director, told
reporters. ``But it is our hope that the process reflects the
highest standards, of both justice and of the Croatian people, and
that justice will be done.''
	   The delegation from B'nai B'rith, which worked for years to get
Sakic arrested, is this week observing the Croatian government's
handling of the case.
	   Sakic has admitted of running the Jasenovac concentration camp,
where tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and anti-Nazi
Croats died.
	   During an April television interview in Argentina, Sakic denied
any wrongdoing or that prisoners were killed under his command. He
said they died of natural causes.
	   About 30,000 Jews, the majority of its pre-World War II
population, were killed during World War II by the wartime when
Croatia was a Nazi puppet state ruled by the Ustasha regime.
	   Noting that Sakic's fate will have to be determined by Croatian
authorities, Baer emphasized that ``credibility and integrity of
Croatia's system of justice is now under scrutiny and the world
indeed will be watching.''
	   B'nai B'rith was invited by President Franjo Tudjman to attend
the trial, Baer said. Tudjman, who has in the past flirted with the
kind of nationalism that characterized the wartime Ustasha regime,
has increasingly tried to improve his image in the West.
	   ``At stake is a larger issue than Dinko Sakic, and that is the
necessity for the people of Croatia to look honestly at the part of
their past,'' Baer said. The leader of the prominent Jewish group
added that the Sakic case is a chance for Croatia ``to show the
world, the West ... (that) it has no affinity and no bonds'' to the
World War II period.

Russians: Sub that sank poses no environmental damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian expedition examined a Soviet submarine
that sank off the coast of Norway in 1989 and found it poses no
environmental damage, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The Komsomolets caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea,
killing 42 of its 69 crew members. It has leaked small amounts of
plutonium and radioactive cesium.
	   Norwegian experts believe the reactor and two nuclear-tipped
torpedoes on the sunken vessel contain 28 pounds of deadly
plutonium.
	   Russian specialists examined the Komsomolets with
camera-carrying robots _ similar to those shown in the opening
scenes of the move ``Titanic'' _ photographed and videotaped the
vessel's bow and took samples of the water and seabed, Interfax
said, quoting the Emergency Situations Ministry.

	   SAINT-JORIOZ, France (AP) _ The 17th stage of the Tour de France
ended 32-kms (20 miles) into Wednesday's competition, with riders,
angered by an expanding doping investigation, coasting their way to
the finish.
	   Police, meanwhile, were busy. They descended on the Chambery
hotel of the ONCE team of French star Laurent Jalabert for the
second search in two days, and took up positions around the Novotel
hotel in Chambery, where the Polti and Casino teams were staying.
	   Police closed the ONCE team's Chateau de Candie hotel off to
reporters before apparently searching the place. They were seen
removing garbage bags full of objects from a camping car bearing
the team insignia, then sealing the vehicle off.

Nicaragua seals quarterfinal spot with victory over Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL update with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Julio Cesar Osejo cracked two homers in a 13-run
second inning Wednesday to help Nicaragua crush Russia 26-5 at the
Baseball World Championships.
	   Nicaragua (5-2) secured a berth in Friday's quarterfinals, while
Russia, which failed to win a single game in preliminary rounds,
was sent packing. The pool B game ended in the seventh inning
because of the 10-run mercy rule.
	   The top four teams from each of the two eight-country pools
advance to Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Australia (5-1), the pool B leader, has already qualified.
	   Also in pool B, Taiwan (3-4) defeated Korea 2-0, but failed to
earn a quarterfinal berth. At the 1994 Worlds, South Korea finished
runner-up to Cuba.
	   Qualification for South Korea (4-3) depends on the outcome of
later games involving the United States, the Netherlands and
Canada, which are currently tied for fourth place in their group
with a 3-3 record.
	   To make the cut, the U.S. team of college players needs to beat
Canada and the Netherlands must lose to Australia.
	   The Americans have not won these championships since 1974, the
last time the country hosted the event.
	   Cuba, the five-time defending titlist, is the undefeated leader
of group A. It has won 36 consecutive games at the Worlds.
	   All four pool A games are set for Wednesday night, including
Cuba vs. Panama (3-3).
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from the Major Leagues are participating. Some minor
leaguers are playing for Canada, the Dominican Republic and other
countries.

The worlds come to the Hoosiers for 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The world championship will have a Hoosier
flavor in 2002 when the event comes to the United States for the
first time.
	   The next championship will be played in Indianapolis at the RCA
Dome and the Conseco Fieldhouse, which will be completed next year
and will be the new home of the NBA's Indiana Pacers.
	   ``For those of you who don't know,'' said Warren Brown,
executive director of USA Basketball. ``The state of Indiana has a
love affair with the game of basketball.''
	   Unlike this year's championship, which is being played at two
sites separated by 15 miles (25 kilometers) of clogged, congested
Athens streets, the 2002 worlds will be played at arenas within
walking distance of each other.
	   Indiana Supreme Court justice Ted Boehm, co-chairman of the 2002
organizing committee, sympathized with Greek organizers who were
still painting, cutting and fitting as play began Wednesday amid a
heatwave sweeping Greece with temperatures reaching 100 F (38 C).
	   ``We know how it is when things go wrong at the last minute and
our Greek hosts have been very patient with us,'' Boehm said.
	   This is the 13th world championship. They've been held nine
times in the Americas, but never in the continental United States.
The 1974 games were played in Puerto Rico.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OOOPS: &LR;  FIBA, the governing body of world basketball, slipped up
on this one, adorning the cover of its July FIBA Basketball
magazine with a picutre of Grant Hill.
	   Hill and his NBA mates, of course, aren't here.
	   The headline over the story on the now-absent U.S. team reads:
Good Dreams, Bad Dreams.
	   The other major story is a long feature on Yugoslavia. ``If any
team is going to beat the USA, it would have to be Yugoslavia,''
the story reads.
	   Also weakened by the NBA lockout and without Vlade Diva,
Yugoslavia is probably still the favorite to win the title Aug. 9.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FIBA NOTE: &LR;  The FIBA World Congress meeting this week in Athens
elected Abdoulaye Seye Moreau of Senegal as its new president. He
replaces American George E. Killian who served for eight years.
	   The congress also voted to penalize the use of marijuana
(cannabis) by players in FIBA competitions.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GREEK PRESSURE: &LR;  The pressure is one in Greece, one of the few
European countries where basketball is more popular than soccer.
Popularity exploded when Greece won the 1987 European championship
and _ with the NBA players out _ fans are looking for a repeat
following the fourth place in 1994 in Toronto behind the U.S.,
Russia and Croatia.
	   ``I am concerned about the high expectation of the fans,'' said
coach Panagiotis Giannakis, who played on the 1987 team. ``They
must be patient. This young team will be together for 10 years. It
will come sooner or later.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JAPANESE? &LR;  Japan got almost half its points Wednesday from
Michael Takahashi, a Japanese-born star whose father is American
and mother Japanese. Takahashi scored 23, but it wasn't enough as
Russia won the first-round game 83-58.
	   Takahashi was born in Japan but grew up in California and played
college basketball briefly at Cal-Northridge. He now plays
professionallly in Japan for the Isuzu Motors team.

Breakaway republic declares UNDP official persona non grata
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The breakaway Republic of Somaliland
has declared the ranking U.N. official in Somalia persona non grata
and has ordered a U.N. official based in Somaliland to leave
immediately.
	   A letter from Somaliland President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal made
public Wednesday accused Dominick Lagenbacher, a Swiss national
working for the U.N. Development Program based in Nairobi, Kenya,
of standing in the way of international recognition of the republic
in the northwestern corner of Somalia.
	   The letter also ordered the UNDP Somaliland envoy Paul Knight to
leave the capital, Hargeisa, within 24 hours. Reports from
Somaliland said armed police had been stationed around Knight's
residence in Hargeisa.
	   When clan-based factions ousted Somali dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre in 1991, Egal proclaimed the independence of Somaliland, the
western portion of the former British Somaliland which merged with
Italian Somaliland to form the Republic of Somalia in 1960.
	   No nation has recognized the self-styled republic, which is the
most peaceful part of Somalia, much of which is still fraught with
factional violence.
	   The Somaliland parliament recently debated the status of U.N.
organizations in the territory and concluded that they were
standing in the way both of international recognition and access to
international development aid.
	   No comment was immediately available from the UNDP regional
office in Nairobi.

Printer cancels contract with right-wing paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOLOTHURN, Switzerland (AP) _ The leader of a far-right Swiss
Italian party suffered a setback Wednesday when the printer of his
free-distribution Sunday newspaper canceled its contract, citing
charges of anti-Semitism.
	   Giuliano Bignasca, leader of the Lega dei Ticinesi, is currently
under investigation for alleged anti-Semitic articles in Il Mattino
della Domenica, a Sunday paper which he claims has a circulation of
40,000 in the southern canton (state) of Ticino.
	   Its printer, Vogt Schild of Solothurn, confirmed a report in the
Zurich Jewish weekly Israelitisches Wochenblatt that it had pulled
out of the contract. The firm cited the charges against Bignasca as
the reason.
	   Bignasca has been railing in recent weeks against threats of
sanctions by U.S. states and cities against Switzerland over its
handling of Holocaust victims' assets.
	   The paper has said the U.S. policy is being directed by Jews who
hold key positions in the Clinton administration. The July 5
edition listed 60 U.S. officials whom it identified as being
Jewish.
	   The regional anti-immigrant party, which has one seat in the
200-member lower house of parliament, received more than 12 percent
of the vote in the most recent regional vote in Ticino,
Switzerland's only Italian-speaking state.
	   Over the years Bignasca has been sentenced a number of times for
slander and drug-related charges.
	   Last week, a Swiss court ordered fines and prison terms under
Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law for an author and his publisher
for producing books denying the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.

Houses are blown up to discourage refugees from returning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIRSAD BEHRAM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The night before 70 Muslims
were to return to their homes in a Bosnian Croat-controlled
village, six of their houses were blown up, international officials
said on Wednesday.
	   The village Pjesivac-Kula lies some 15 kilometers (ten miles)
southwest of Stolac, one of the most disputed towns in southern
Bosnia.
	   ``There is a very clear and obvious link between that criminal
activity and the return of 70 Bosniaks (Muslims) to Pjesivac-Kula
today,'' said Neil Wright, the head of U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees office in Mostar.
	   ``They (the Muslims) arrived in the morning to discover these
houses had been destroyed last night. These people are individuals
who are expressing and carrying out their right to return,'' he
said.
	   The area was predominantly Muslim before the Muslim-Croat war in
1993, but then became ethnically ``clean'' after the Croats
expelled the local Muslim population.
	   Bosnia, once an ethnic mix, is now ethnically divided due to the
wartime expulsions.
	   In some areas, local authorities have blocked the return of
refugees from another ethnic group despite peace accords,
international pressure and sanctions.
	   One of such places is the Stolac area, where local Croats are
reluctant to allow Muslims back. Despite constant harassment and
blowing up of returnees' houses, some 1,000 Muslims from a prewar
population of 8,000 have returned.
	   Since the end of March, a total of 37 incidents of ethnic
hostility have occurred in the Stolac area, Kelly Moore, a U.N.
spokeswoman said.
	   ``This continued criminal activity, without any criminal being
brought to justice, is intolerable,'' Wright said.
	   Despite the expulsions, some 100 Muslims returned to the village
on Wednesday, according to the office of the Muslim president of
the municipal council, Kemal Isakovic.

UNHCR acknowledges accounting `problems' in `clean bill of health'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DROPS redundant reference to Janowski; UPDATES in 2 final
grafs with comment from Annan spokesman &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Responding to a report that the U.N. refugee
agency was losing millions of dollars because of bad management,
the agency said Wednesday its overall performance was good despite
some ``problems.''
	   The London-based Financial Times reported Wednesday that its
research and an independent auditors' report highlight ``serious
failings'' in UNHCR's financial management.
	   The newspaper said incompetent management, dubious accounting
and possibly fraud were costing the agency millions of dollars.
	   Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, dismissed the report as ``mistaken and inaccurate.''
	   ``We sometimes have to bend or even break the rules in the name
of helping people quickly,'' said Janowski. ``The audit report in
its final conclusion actually gives us a clean bill of health.''
	   The newspaper said auditors express concern in their study, due
to be presented to the U.N. General Assembly this fall, that UNHCR
financial statements fail to accurately reflect and justify annual
spending.
	   In one case, it said the audit found a contract for materials to
repair 900 homes and eight schools _ but auditors found only 719 of
the homes and none of the schools had been repaired.
	   The newspaper says it obtained its information from ``sources
close'' to UNHCR and internal documents made available to it.
	   U.N. organizations including UNHCR, which has an annual dlrs 1
billion budget, have come under pressure from donor countries such
as Britain and the United States to tighten their purse strings.
	   A spokeswoman for the British government's Department for
International Development, speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to comment directly on the report and said that as far as
officials were aware, the leaked documents had not come from her
department.
	   She said, however, that while there were areas of UNHCR's work
with which Britain was ``very happy,'' there were others in which
there is ``scope for improvement.''
	   The United States has in the past expressed solid support for
UNHCR and has praised Sadako Ogata's leadership of the agency as an
example to the rest of the United Nations.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States believes UNHCR is
demonstrating an ``admirable willingness to undertake self
examination and to cooperate with external examiners.''
	   But the spokesman, who declined to comment on The Financial
Times' report, said the United States also believed weaknesses in
the performance of U.N. agencies should be corrected.
	   The last page of the audit, made available to The Associated
Press, appeared to back up Janowski's claim of an overall clean
bill of health.
	   ``In our opinion, the transactions of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees which we have tested as part of our
audit, have in all significant respects been in accordance with the
financial regulations and legislative authority,'' it said.
	   It was signed by Vijay Krishna Shunglu, comptroller and auditor
general of India; Osei tutu Prempeh, auditor-general of Ghana; and
Sir John Bourn, British comptroller and auditor general
	   Janowski said that under Ogata's leadership, an inspection team
was set up in 1993 which investigates suspected irregularities.
	   UNHCR would write to the Financial Times to express its
disappointment with the newspaper's report and point out what it
believed to be errors.
	   ``Senior management has been totally open,'' Janowski said.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York, a spokesman for
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said it was dismaying that an early
draft of the report had been leaked.
	   ``I'm told typically the final reports are changed and
apparently with some frequency,'' Fred Eckhard said. '' ...So it's
unfortunate, it's unfair, that the initial draft was leaked to the
press.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Alexis, Tomjanovich quotes. Hawkins U.S. assists
record. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Wendell Alexis led the way with 13 points
and eight rebounds as the United States overcame a slow start
Wednesday to beat Brazil 83-59 in the opener for both teams at the
World Basketball Championship.
	   With the Dream Teamers at home because of the NBA labor dispute,
the U.S. cast of understudies relied on defense and plenty of
second-efforts.
	   The American stars' no-show brought down the skill level and the
attendance figures.
	   About 500 fans showed up at cavernous, 18,000-seat Olympic
Stadium for the U.S.-Brazil game, and organizers said the
tournament, which ends Aug. 9, is likely to lose money.
	   The United States went more than four minutes at the start of
the game without a field goal, missing its first six shots, and
trailed by five after 10 minutes.
	   ``If it was bad shots, I'd worry. But we were taking great shots
and just missing them,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We
just had to knock the dust off, break the seal. Then our defense
really helped us get some easy baskets.''
	   An end-to-end drive by Michael Hawkins (12 points and 10
assists, a record for a U.S. player at the world championship)
capped a 13-1 run that helped give the U.S. team a 40-32 halftime
lead.
	   The United States held Brazil to 36.4 percent shooting from the
field and converted several easy breakaway baskets into the
second-half spurt that won the game.
	   ``We know we don't have any dominant players, players who are
going to take over a game,'' Alexis said. ``It's going to be a
different player every night.''
	   The former Syracuse standout typifies the group. The 6-foot-10
(2.06-meter) forward was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in
1986 but was cut, and embarked on a career that has brought him to
Spain, Italy and now Germany.
	   ``I'm the most experienced, so I shouldn't let the other guys
get rattled,'' said Alexis, at 34 the team's elder statesman.
	   Duke's Trajan Langdon, a late roster replacement for Big Ten
Player of the Year Mateen Cleaves (twisted ankle), sparked the U.S.
offense with two 3-pointers late in the first half.
	   Langdon is the only college player on Tomjanovich's roster. The
rest are either in the CBA, with European teams _ or looking for
work.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday, Miroslav Beric's 23 points paced European
champion Yugoslavia's 80-66 defeat of Puerto Rico.
	   Lithuania and Russia, two countries that used to supply players
for the Soviet juggernaut, both enjoyed blowout victories.
	   Darius Lukminus scored 20 points and Arturas Karnishovas added
19 as Lithuania beat South Korea 97-56. Russia had five players in
double figures in its 83-58 win over Japan.
	   With the NBA lockout in place, only one player from the league _
Australia's Chris Anstey _ is participating in the tournament.
	   In other opening action Wednesday, it was: Nigeria vs. Spain,
Senegal vs. Italy, Australia vs. Argentina, and Greece vs. Canada.
	   Before USA Basketball dumped the Dream Team in mid-June, local
organizers predicted ticket and merchandise sales would be enough
to cover expenses and perhaps turn a profit. But now they are
facing the likelihood of about 100 million drachmas (about dlrs
330,000) in losses, a spokesman said Wednesday.

Eleven die in bus-truck collision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least 11 people were killed and
about 50 were wounded Wednesday when a truck slammed into a bus at
a crossroads in northern Serbia, the government's Tanjug news
agency reported.
	   The accident near the town of Novi Sad, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
northwest of Belgrade, occurred when the the truck ignored a red
light and crashed into the commuter bus full of passengers.
	   The truck driver, apparently unhurt, fled the scene but turned
himself in shortly afterward at a police station, Tanjug said.
	   Also on Wednesday, a woman died when her car collided with a
truck, also near the town of Novi Sad, Tanjug reported.

UNHCR gets access to Angola refugees massing in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
has approval from the Congo to try to help the thousands of
Angolans who have recently crossed the border to escape fighting in
their homeland.
	   The UNHCR estimates that 21,000 of the estimated 30,000 new
refugees are massing in the southern Congolese province of Katanga,
with others arriving in Bandundu further west. Congolese
authorities estimate the total number is 100,000, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   Congo hadn't prevented the UNHCR from getting to the refugees,
but the UNHCR wanted to get formal approval of the mission
considering the security concerns in the area, U.N. officials said.
	   A protocol agreement was signed Tuesday, Eckhard said.
	   Relations between the Congo and the United Nations have worsened
since the U.N. human rights team was withdrawn from the country
earlier this year. The team ran into consistent obstacles in trying
to investigate massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees allegedly carried
out by troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila during his sweep to
power in 1996-97, U.N. officials have said.
	   In neighboring Angola, a recent increase in hostilities between
government troops and the former rebel movement UNITA has forced
thousands of refugees across the border, including government
officials and national police officers who fled with their
families, Eckhard said.
	   Fearing the escalating violence could undermine Angola's 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord, Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched
an envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to meet with government and UNITA
officials this weekend in Angola.

British Airways takes off again for Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways resumed flights to Nigeria on
Wednesday, after being shut out for 14 months in a dispute that
began when Britain banned Nigerian Airways flights over safety
concerns.
	   British Airways said it would fly initially five times a week
between London and Lagos, with plans eventually to fly daily using
Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
	   The carrier was barred from the Nigerian market in May 1997,
when Nigeria retaliated over Britain's decision to halt Nigerian
Airways flights to London. British aviation regulators said they
were concerned about defects in some of the Nigerian-operated jets,
but the two sides have now patched up their differences.
	   The British Department of Transport was ready to consider
applications from Nigerian carriers that wish to fly to Britain
from the West African nation, a spokesman said late Wednesday.

Arafat to visit Turkey for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will pay
a one-day visit to Turkey Friday to seek Ankara's support to get
the stalled Middle East peace process moving, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   Arafat called off talks between Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators until Israel accepts an American peace proposal for
Israel to gradually withdraw troops from parts of the West Bank.
The plan also requires Palestinians to crack down on Islamic
militants.
	   Arafat is scheduled to meet President Suleyman Demirel and other
Turkish leaders.
	   ``Turkey supports efforts to revive the Middle East peace
process and will do whatever it can,'' ministry spokesman Necati
Utkan told reporters.
	   Turkey enjoys close ties with both the Palestinians and Israel.

Cuba's worst drought in decades threatens to bring widespread

	   LOS CEREZOS, Cuba (AP) _ A strange wind came to Los Cerezos six
months ago. A strong wind that tugged at the banana trees and
manioc leaves. A dry wind that sucked all the moisture from the
pasture and made the river disappear.
	   Carlos Lopez had to abandon his fields and take his ox cart into
the hills that surround this remote village in eastern Cuba and
search for firewood to survive.
	   ``The wind dries the air. It dries the plants. It even makes
people sick,'' said Lopez, 35. ``We are being punished.''
	   It hasn't rained all year in Los Cerezos, or in many other
farming villages of eastern Cuba. The island, which already had
been having trouble feeding its people, is experiencing its worst
drought since Fidel Castro took power 40 years ago.
	   Cuba normally receives between dlrs 2 million and dlrs 3 million
in food aid from the U.N. World Food Program every year, and still
has to import more grain _ it won't say how much _ to make ends
meet, according to James Conway, director of the U.N. agency for
Latin America and the Caribbean.
	   Even before the drought, the average Cuban consumed only about
1,900 calories a day, below the minimum requirement of 2,100 to
2,300 calories a day set by the U.N. agency, Conway said in a
telephone interview from Rome on Wednesday.
	   The drought, blamed on the weather phenomenon El Nino, has
destroyed 42 percent of the crops in five provinces and brought
with it the danger of starvation.
	   ``There is no margin,'' Conway said. ``The crop shortfalls will
hit hard their ability to import food with limited hard currency,
and in terms of people's intake, the ration system is strained to
the limit.''
	   The World Food Program is shipping dlrs 7 million worth of
emergency food rations that it says will feed more than 500,000
people for six months.
	   The agency is even negotiating with the United States and Cuba
to see if the aid could come from America, a sensitive issue given
the decades-old U.S. economic embargo on Cuba.
	   It is unclear exactly how much of Cuba's food production has
been affected by the dry weather. Neither the Cuban government nor
the U.N. agency knows how much of the country's overall food
production the shortfall accounts for.
	   Lack of drinking water is also becoming a problem. Government
news media reported Tuesday that dams in Holguin province serving
628,000 people will run dry in little more than a month unless
there is rain.
	   Ten thousand head of cattle have been evacuated from that
province and moved farther south, according to the Communist Party
newspaper Granma. On Tuesday, Holguin was placed on a state of
alert.
	   Cuba says it is using pipes to divert water from dams farther
away from the hardest hit areas. But that will take time, and for
now nearly half of Holguin province is receiving water from tanker
trucks, Granma said.
	   No such help has arrived farther east in Los Cerezos, a hamlet
of several dozen people 525 miles (850 kilometers) southeast of
Havana in Guantanamo province. The only way for a truck to reach
the village would be to drive up the dry riverbed and down a rocky
dirt path.
	   The village milk cooperative is closed. Some of the cows have
died, and the cooperative sold most of the others. Only a few cows
remain, and survive on sparse clumps of dried grass in a field
crisscrossed by empty irrigation pipes.
	   The rusty pipe that carries water from the hills for villagers
also is nearly dry. Nilsa Guilarte, 26, squatted over a valve in a
parched field to capture half a bucketful of water.
	   ``I'm just taking a little bit,'' she said apologetically.
``Just enough to bathe my little girl.''
	   Down a dirt path, an 88-year-old woman hobbled bowlegged,
pulling an emaciated donkey by a leash across the riverbed filled
only with pebbles and dust. She said she had never seen a drought
like this.
	   ``We used to raise goats, plant pasture, grow bananas,'' Juana
Ramirez Ribera said. ``But the drought is too strong and the winds
are too dry. We're suffering a great, great deal.''

Printer cancels contract with right-wing paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOLOTHURN, Switzerland (AP) _ The leader of a far-right Swiss
Italian party suffered a setback Wednesday when the printer of his
free-distribution Sunday newspaper canceled its contract, citing
charges of anti-Semitism.
	   Giuliano Bignasca, leader of the Lega dei Ticinesi, is currently
under investigation for alleged anti-Semitic articles in Il Mattino
della Domenica, a Sunday paper which he claims has a circulation of
40,000 in the southern canton (state) of Ticino.
	   Its printer, Vogt Schild of Solothurn, confirmed a report in the
Zurich Jewish weekly Israelitisches Wochenblatt that it had pulled
out of the contract. The firm cited the charges against Bignasca as
the reason.
	   Bignasca has been railing in recent weeks against threats of
sanctions by U.S. states and cities against Switzerland over its
handling of Holocaust victims' assets.
	   The paper has said the U.S. policy is being directed by Jews who
hold key positions in the U.S. government. The July 5 edition
listed 60 U.S. officials whom it identified as Jews.
	   The regional anti-immigrant party, which has one seat in the
200-member lower house of parliament, received more than 12 percent
of the vote in the most recent regional vote in Ticino,
Switzerland's only Italian-speaking state.
	   Over the years Bignasca has been sentenced a number of times for
slander and drug-related charges.
	   Last week, a Swiss court ordered fines and prison terms under
Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law for an author and his publisher
for producing books denying the existence of the Nazi gas chambers.

Polish leaders blame moral decline for Jewish grave desecration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo WAR150 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The prime minister laid wreaths Wednesday
at a cemetery where vandals desecrated dozens of tombstones of Jews
executed by the Nazis, and called on Polish society to uphold moral
values.
	   Jerzy Buzek said he deeply regretted the desecration in which
vandals tore plaques from the tombstones over the past week at the
cemetery and museum at Palmiry, 18 miles northwest of Warsaw.
	   There were no suspects yet in the vandalism.
	   Buzek promised government money for reconstructing the tomb
plaques, but said the ``problem is not about money but what to do
to prevent such acts of vandalism.''
	   ``This is related to the system in which many young people have
a feeling they are beyond rules,'' Buzek said, and called for a
reform of Polish public life to revive moral values.
	   Maciej Plazynski, speaker of parliament's lower house, echoed
Buzek's sentiments, saying the desecration displays ``moral
devastation'' in Polish society.
	   During World War II, Nazi occupiers executed about 3,500
prominent Polish citizens, many of them Jewish, at Palmiry.
	   About 20,000 Jews live in Poland now, a fraction of the thriving
prewar community of 3.5 million.

Kazak JV to boost Tengiz production despite oil price drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY (AP) _ A joint venture of Kazak and western oil companies
plans to boost production at the massive Tengiz oil field in
western Kazakstan in spite of the sharp drop in world oil prices,
an official said Wednesday.
	   An official with the consortium said lower oil prices have
lately forced investors to dig into their own pockets to finance
the project. But that has not dampened the investors' resolve, he
said.
	   ``Unlike before, we are not able to finance all our expansion
projects with our own cash flow,'' said Nick Zana, president of the
Eurasia Business Unit of Chevron Overseas Petroleum. ``It has not
affected our expansion plans.''
	   U.S. oil companies Mobil and Chevron are involved in the
project, along with Kazakstan's national oil company Kazakoil and
Russia's Lukoil and Arco.
	   Zana said that the joint venture produced around 4 million
metric tons of oil in the first six months of the year, and plans
to exceed its target of 8.2 million tons this year.
	   By 2000, the venture plans to boost production to around 12
million tons, he said.
	   That should coincide with the completion of the pipeline of the
Caspian Pipeline Consortium from Tengiz to Russia's Black Sea in
the first half of 2001.
	   ``We are ready for the CPC,'' he said. ``We will have a capacity
in excess of the CPC commitment.''
	   The shareholders have also recently decided that the CPC
pipeline won't end at the Black Sea part Novorossiisk, but at a new
terminal _ Novorossiisk-2 _ to be built 10 kilometers (6 miles)
northwest of the Russian port, Zena added.

Russia, Azerbaijan sign statement on Caspian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Azerbaijan agreed Wednesday to continue
talks on the status of the Caspian Sea, which has some of the
world's largest known oil and gas reserves, news agencies said.
	   Officials from the two countries _ among the five that border
the sea _ held talks in the Azerbaijani capital Baku. The five
countries have been unable to agree on how to divide the sea's
resources.
	   The three countries with oil near their coastlines _ Kazakstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ want the Caspian divided into
national sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
	   But Russia and Iran want the sea's resources to be shared by
all.

Top Russian economist says ruble devaluation inevitable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 new grafs at end with 1999 budget based on 1 percent
growth. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian economist issued a new warning
Wednesday that a devaluation of the Russian currency is inevitable,
and that a recently approved international bailout package will
only delay it.
	   Andrei Illarionov, director of the independent Economic Analysis
Institute, predicted the devaluation of the ruble would come as
early as October, despite the government's repeated statements that
it has no such plans.
	   The ruble has been trading steadily recently, at about 6.2 to
the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank has spent millions of dollars to
keep it there.
	   Illarionov said these efforts are choking economic growth.
	   ``Tight monetary policies and government tax demands necessary
to maintain the ruble ... will only deepen the economic problems,''
Illarionov said. ``Devaluing the ruble now would give the Russian
economy a chance to turn around, since it would cut the
government's debt and lower the (interest) rates.''
	   Illarionov rocked Russian financial markets last month when he
predicted a devaluation of at least 50 percent. He has close
contacts with reformers in the Russian government, and is widely
respected within the country.
	   Russia and a group of lenders led by the International Monetary
Fund agreed earlier this month on an aid package to shore up
Russian markets and restore confidence in the ruble. Together with
previously approved loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion.
	   The first installment of the loan was deposited in the Central
Bank to boost its foreign currency reserves and assure investors
the government had the resources to defend the ruble.
	   However, the plan has failed to restore confidence. Russian
stocks have also failed to recover much, after falling more than 60
percent since the beginning of the year.
	   On Wednesday, stocks ended slightly higher. The Russian Trading
System Index rose 0.46% to close at 147.96 points, up from 147.28
points Tuesday. Volume rose to dlrs 26.6 million from dlrs 23.5
million Tuesday.
	   The State Statistics Committee had some good news Wednesday:
Russia's budget deficit fell to 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product in the first five months of 1998, down from 3.8 percent in
the same period a year earlier.
	   In January-May 1998, the deficit totaled 35.5 billion rubles
(dlrs 5.7 billion), down from 36.2 billion rubles (dlrs 5.8
billion) in the same period last year.
	   Lowering the deficit was a precondition set by the IMF for the
loan package.
	   Illarionov said Russia can probably hold the ruble steady until
late October, when most of dlrs 8 billion in foreign loans taken by
Russian banks mature.
	   He disputed notions that devaluation would lead to a free-fall
of the ruble and that it would spark spiraling inflation.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the Finance
Ministry would prepare the 1999 budget on the assumption the
economy will grow by 1 percent next year, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The ministry recently said Russia's economy will shrink by 0.5
percent this year because of the current sharp and severe financial
crisis. The ministry had originally estimated 2 percent growth for
1998, following a 0.8 percent increase last year _ Russia's first
growth since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Brazil sells state-run telecommunications giant

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil on Wednesday began selling
off its controlling stake in the state-run telecommunications
giant, Telebras, in what was billed as the largest privatization in
Latin America.
	   The highlight of the bidding, expected to last several hours,
was a showdown between American telecommunications giants MCI and
Sprint for control of long distance carrier Embratel, one of 12 the
companies that make up the Telebras holdings.
	   Government regulations forced the two companies into live
bidding after the sealed-envelope auction revealed only a 5 percent
difference between their respective bids.
	   MCI first offered dlrs 2.13 billion, while Sprint came up with
an offer of dlrs 2.15 billion.
	   After a tense 10-minute bidding showdown, MCI emerged the winner
with an offer of dlrs 2.28 billion.
	   ``MCI believes Embratel is the jewel in the Telebras
telecommunications crown,'' said Jerry Di Martino, a company senior
vice president. He said MCI planned to operate the long distance
carrier alone, but would consider future partnerships.
	   Outside the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchanges, where the auction
was being held, police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of
demonstrators protesting the privatization.
	   The opponents, who claimed Telebras was being sold too cheaply,
failed in their efforts to block the sale in the courts.
	   Brazil, which established a dlrs 11.7 billion minimum price for
the entire Telebras system, raised dlrs 12 billion with the sale of
the first four companies.
	   In other sales Wednesday, the Sao Paulo state fixed line service
was bought by Spain's Telefonica SA for dlrs 4.98 billion _ far
higher than the minimum bid price of dlrs 3.03 billion. Two other
fixed line companies, covering the rest of the country, were sold
for a total of dlrs 4.7 billion.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team led the pack
across the finish line in Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour de
France -- a leg that became a protest ride against the widening
doping investigation and was annuled by Tour officials.
	   Riders, fearing further police action Wednesday night, cruised
slowly through more than three-quarters of the leg. They crossed
the finish line, hands joined and held aloft in a symbolic victory.
	   The stage ended more than two hours later than it should have.

Divac. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Basketball's World Championship will go
home to its birthplace, sort of, in 2002 when the event is staged
in the United States for the first time.
	   The quadrennial championship will be played next in Indianapolis
at the RCA Dome and the Conseco Fieldhouse, which will be completed
next year and will be the new home of the NBA's Indiana Pacers.
	   ``For those of you who don't know,'' said Warren Brown,
executive director of USA Basketball. ``The state of Indiana has a
love affair with the game of basketball.''
	   Basketball originated in the United States in 1891 in the town
of Springfield, Massachusetts, when a Canadian-born physical
education instructor, James Naismith, had a custodian nail two
peach baskets to the balcony of a local gymnasium.
	   The game spread throughout the United States and is very popular
in the state of Indiana, and even prompted the 1986 feature-length
film ``Hoosiers.''
	   Unlike this year's championship, which is being played at two
sites separated by 25 kilometers (15 miles) of clogged, congested
Athens streets, the 2002 worlds will be played at arenas within
walking distance of each other.
	   Indiana Supreme Court justice Ted Boehm, co-chairman of the 2002
organizing committee, sympathized with Greek organizers who were
still painting, cutting and fitting as play began Wednesday amid a
heatwave sweeping Greece with temperatures reaching 38 degrees
Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
	   ``We know how it is when things go wrong at the last minute and
our Greek hosts have been very patient with us,'' Boehm said.
	   The tournament in Athens is the 13th world championship. The
championship has held nine times in the Americas, but never in the
continental United States. The 1974 games were played in Puerto
Rico.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OOOPS: &LR;  FIBA, the governing body of world basketball, slipped up
on this one, adorning the cover of its July FIBA Basketball
magazine with a picutre of Grant Hill.
	   Because the U.S. National Basketball Association and its players
union are in a labor dispute, the NBA has locked the players out,
and Hill and his fellow NBA mates, of course, aren't here.
	   The headline over the story on the now-absent U.S. team reads:
Good Dreams, Bad Dreams.
	   The other major story is a long feature on Yugoslavia. ``If any
team is going to beat the USA, it would have to be Yugoslavia,''
the story reads.
	   Also weakened by the NBA lockout and without Vlade Divac,
Yugoslavia is probably still the favorite to win the title Aug. 9.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FIBA NOTE: &LR;  The FIBA World Congress meeting this week in Athens
elected Abdoulaye Seye Moreau of Senegal as its new president. He
replaces American George E. Killian who served for eight years.
	   The congress also voted to penalize the use of marijuana
(cannabis) by players in FIBA competitions.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GREEK PRESSURE: &LR;  The pressure is one in Greece, one of the few
European countries where basketball is more popular than soccer.
Popularity exploded when Greece won the 1987 European championship
and _ with the NBA players out _ fans are looking for a repeat
following the fourth place in 1994 in Toronto behind the U.S.,
Russia and Croatia.
	   ``I am concerned about the high expectation of the fans,'' said
coach Panagiotis Giannakis, who played on the 1987 team. ``They
must be patient. This young team will be together for 10 years. It
will come sooner or later.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JAPANESE? &LR;  Japan got almost half its points Wednesday from
Michael Takahashi, a Japanese-born star whose father is American
and mother Japanese. Takahashi scored 23, but it wasn't enough as
Russia won the first-round game 83-58.
	   Takahashi was born in Japan but grew up in California and played
college basketball briefly at Cal-Northridge. He now plays
professionallly in Japan for the Isuzu Motors team.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - Two months after they entered the
nuclear arena, India and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to resume an
interrupted dialogue to discuss their differences, including the
restive territory of Kashmir.
	   The agreement was the most positive sign since the two rival
nations conducted tit for tat nuclear tests, heightening tensions
in one of the world's most volatile regions and raising fears of a
nuclear conflagration.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, meeting at a seafront hotel in Sri Lanka's
capital during a break in a regional summit, agreed that modalities
would be worked out by senior officials over the next two days in
the Sri Lankan capital.
	   ``Nawaz Sharif and I have agreed that the dialogue process
should be resumed,'' said Vajpayee.
	   ``It is for us to steer away from the gathering storm,'' said
Sharif, , meeting reporters separately after their 75-minute
meeting.
	   If they succeed, the two sides will announce the date and venue
for the next round of bilateral talks in the Sri Lankan capital.
	   The three-day regional summit has brought together the leaders
of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Lanka, Pakistan, the Maldives
and Bhutan.
	   India has agreed to discuss Kashmir, the cause of two wars
between the neighbors and where fighting between Muslim separatists
and Indian the military has killed more than 15,500 people.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the militants, a
charge Islamabad denies.
	   ``I had a very good meeting,'' Sharif said. But he said India
needed to show more flexibility on the question of Kashmir, where
he wants a third party to mediate.
	   ``Kashmir is the core issue. The sooner it is resolved, it is
better for the two countries,'' Pakistan Prime Minister Sharif
said.
	   India ontinues to reject Pakistan's demand for third party
intervention in its bilateral dispute with Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee, during his brief news conference, refused to give
details, only saying the two sides discussed all issues, including
Kashmir and terrorism.
	   It also was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office in March.
	   Earlier, Sharif and Vajpayee sounded conciliatory as they spoke
at the summit inauguration of the South Asia Association for
Regional Cooperation.
	   ``The inescapable reality that confronts us today is that South
Asia is now nuclearized,'' said Sharif.
	   Talks between the foreign ministry officials broke down last
September over the Kashmir issue.
	   In his speech on Wednesday, Vajpayee discussed the nuclear
question, even though it was not on the summit agenda. He
reasserted India's commitment to a nuclear free world. India has
said it will not give up its own right to develop nuclear weapons
unless all other countries do.
	   The Vajpayee-Sharif talks overshadowed the broader summit topic
of economic cooperation in South Asia, a region that is home to
one-fifth of humanity and 40 percent of its poorest people.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Lisbon has declared war on pigeons,
dogs, clean cars and garbage cans.
	   It's part of a citywide cleanup.
	   The new rules are backed by stiff fines: 56,000 escudos (dlrs
307)--equivalent to the national minimum monthly wage--for dogs
that foul sidewalks or for washing a car on the street and 10,000
escudos (dlrs 55) for not replacing a garbage can lid properly or
feeding the pigeons.
	   The city is placing 1,000 special garbage cans around the city
for residents to separate waste into paper, glass and batteries.
	   Lisbon City Councillor Rui Godinho said Wednesday the new rules
will take effect in October.

Germany wants to stop flow of money to Kosovo militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The government is looking for ways of
deterring Albanians in Germany from sending money to militant
Albanians in Yugoslavia's separatist province of Kosovo, the
foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   Klaus Kinkel was quoted in an advance of the daily Sueddeutsche
Zeitung's Thursday edition as saying officials are mulling bans of
Albanian groups who are believed to be collecting money in Germany
to help arm the separatists.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Markus Ederer in Bonn confirmed the
comments.
	   Kinkel also reiterated Germany's position that it cannot accept
independence as a goal for Albanians in Kosovo. Germany supports
only their autonomy within Yugoslavia, Kinkel said.

Angolan gov't reports more rebel attacks; rebels say peace close to
</HEADLINE>
collapse
 &UR; With UN-Congo-Angola
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with last two grafs, regional leaders urging UNITA to
take its place in government &QL; 
 &UR; CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government Wednesday reported new
attacks on outlying towns by the former rebel movement UNITA, while
the guerrillas warned that Angola's four-year-old peace accord was
on the verge of collapse.
	   ``The peace in Angola is hanging by a thread,'' UNITA official
Rui Oliveira said, referring to the deepening tension between the
former foes which threatens to undermine their 1994 peace
agreement.
	   The government claims UNITA has killed hundreds of civilians and
police in attacks in recent months, including the massacre of some
200 people last week, while the rebels allege that police have
tortured and murdered their supporters.
	   There was no independent verification of the charges which have
further delayed full implementation of the peace accord that ended
a two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA forces Tuesday captured the strategic town of Mussende,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Luanda, after ``fierce
fighting'' with local police, the local governor told state-run
media Wednesday. No information was available about the number of
casualties.
	   Mussende, a town in Cuanza Sul province near where rebel
soldiers had occupied two villages earlier this week, lies on a
main road leading to Luanda.
	   UNITA last year had handed back control of the towns to the
government as part of the United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
	   Jonas Savimbi's rebels, regarded as one of Africa's strongest
guerrilla forces, seized more than half of the country during the
war.
	   Meanwhile Oliveira, a UNITA official who lives in Lisbon, said
the group's supporters had reported a massive government troop
build-up in Huambo province, 560 kilometers (350 miles) south of
the capital, within striking distance of UNITA's remaining central
highland strongholds.
	   He denied the government reports of UNITA attacks.
	   Oliveira complained that European Union sanctions against his
movement, announced Tuesday, were ``unfair'' and further undermined
the peace process.
	   ``The international community is biased against UNITA and is in
fact giving the government a carte blanche to launch an attack
against us,'' Oliveira said in a telephone interview.
	   The EU sanctions included restrictions on UNITA's diamond sales,
which provide the movement with hundreds of millions of dollars
annually, and a freeze of its bank accounts.
	   The U.N. passed similar sanctions earlier this year.
	   Oliveira alleged the army and police had committed human rights
abuses in areas returned to government control but had escaped
punishment.
	   In Swakopmund, Namibia, regional leaders condemned the Angolan
rebel movement for threatening full scale war and demanded UNITA
take its rightful place in the elected government.
	   Interrupting a planned discussion on economic progress, Southern
African Development Community leaders ``strongly urged UNITA and
Savimbi to ...desist forthwith from prolonging the suffering of the
people of Angola.''

Serb battlefield gains likely make Kosovo Albanians reconsider
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES new battlefield reports, context;
EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance, as they seek to unite their different factions, a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations.
	   But it was unclear Wednesday if the key element in the Kosovo
equation, the rebel Kosovo Liberation army, would be part of a
unified, self-styled government the top Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, has said will be set up.
	   If the KLA agrees to participate in Rugova's government, this
would be a clear sign that they would also join him in negotiations
with the Serbs.
	   The underground army is fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and the
West. It has so far refused to be associated with any political
faction.
	   Rugova announced earlier Wednesday he had reached a compromise
with other ethnic Albanians on a coalition government, saying it
would include ``all political forces'' and ``create pre-conditions
for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav government.
	   For almost two weeks, the Albanian guerrillas have suffered a
string of bitter defeats across the rebellious province, testifying
to the government forces' superior weaponry and equipment.
	   Rugova's announcement came on the heels of several fresh Serb
victories in an offensive launched Friday night, a development that
may lead the rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Fighting was heaviest on Wednesday in the north-central Drenica
region, where the conflict escalated earlier this year.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported that Serb police
had gained full control of a contested stretch of the Kosovska
Mitrovica-Pec road in that region.
	   New clashes were also reported in the border region of Djakovica
near the Albanian border, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb forces were shelling from afar villages believed to
be KLA strongholds. No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   Meanwhile, thousands were reported to have fled Malisevo, a
rebel stronghold captured by Serb forces Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said that at
least three elderly civilians were killed and two other
unidentified bodies were also found in the Malisevo area.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, heavily armed Serb forces, backed by
helicopters, were trying to capture another KLA bastion, Junik,
where about 1,000 fighters are trapped, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   An unspecified number of ``terrorists'' from Junik surrendered
Tuesday night, Tanjug reported Wednesday, quoting police sources.
They reportedly said they had fled from several ``notorious
terrorist leaders'' who threatened those remaining that their
property would be burned down if they surrendered to police.
	   More fighting was also reported south of Pristina, the
province's capital, on the road to the southern town of Prizren.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the posts of defense and interior, meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Although Yugoslavia would likely not recognize Rugova's
``government,'' it could form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team
to negotiate the status of the province with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of American and European
diplomacy. Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million-strong
population.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation, which arrived here in the
latest international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rohan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.

Tearful Tyson says he's sorry for biting Holyfield's ear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Tyson testifying. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Choking back tears, a repentant Mike
Tyson told boxing regulators on Wednesday he ``just snapped'' when
he bit Evander Holyfield in their title fight last year.
	   Testifying at a license hearing aimed at returning him to the
ring, Tyson told the New Jersey Athletic Control Board he was foggy
from repeated head butts by Holyfield in the third round of their
June 28, 1997 bout.
	   ``I just snapped. Nothing mattered anymore at that particular
point,'' Tyson said, pausing to gather himself as his voice broke.
``I'm sorry for what I did. I wish it never happened. It will haunt
me for the rest of my life.''
	   He told Assistant Attorney General Michael Haas, the
second-ranking prosecutor for the state of New Jersey, that he
doubts he is capable of doing it again. He said his personal life
has been devastated by the incident.
	   Tyson was testifying at a hearing to determine whether he will
be licensed in the eastern state of New Jersey. The western state
of Nevada revoked his license after the Holyfield fight.
	   The 32-year-old Tyson has not fought since last year when he bit
Holyfield on both ears during their bout in Las Vegas.
	   Two boxers testifying on Tyson's behalf said that in the heat of
battle, almost anything can happen in the ring, and that the
fighter is not always conscious of his actions.
	   Former heavyweight contender Chuck Wepner said even Muhammad Ali
was known to lose his composure in the ring.
	   ``It's something that happens to you in the ring and it's hard
to explain,'' Wepner told the panel.
	   No mention was made of the Holyfield fight until 45 minutes into
the hearing when Haas brought it up, questioning Wepner.
	   Former light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz echoed Wepner's
comments, saying Tyson snapped in the ring, but that it shouldn't
prevent him from returning to it.
	   ``A piece of the street came out in him.'' said Czyz.
	   He also said that if he was fighting an opponent and knocked the
guy's eye out, he would eat it before the guy had a chance to get
it back.
	   ``That's the kind of mentality you have to have,'' Czyz said.
	   Testifying via videotape was 93-year-old Camille Ewald, former
companion of Tyson's longtime mentor Cuss D'Amato. She said Tyson
continues to support her financially and calls her his ``white
mother.''
	   Holding hands with his wife, Tyson was cheered as he arrived for
the hearing. But there were also scattered boos and a half-dozen
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, a feminist group, demonstrated outside.
	   The three-member panel will have 45 days to decide whether Tyson
has ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as
required by state boxing law. No immediate decision was expected,
according to spokesman Roger Shatzkin.
	   Questions have been raised whether New Jersey should be the
state to grant Tyson a license. Some said Tyson should return to
Nevada for his regulatory repentance.
	   Fighting for Holyfield's WBA title June 28, 1997, in Las Vegas,
Tyson bit his right ear. After a four-minute delay, the fight
resumed and he bit him on the left ear, prompting referee Mills
Lane to disqualify him.
	   The Nevada State Athletic Commission swiftly revoked Tyson's
license and fined him dlrs 3 million, leaving him eligible to apply
for reinstatement after one year. He has not done so.
	   Fusco said Tyson applied in New Jersey because he likes fighting
in Atlantic City, adding he may later seek a license in Nevada.
	   But there also was the fear by Tyson's handlers that Nevada
regulators would make him wait longer to get his license, and a
further layoff would diminish his skills. Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he did not think
Nevada would have re-licensed the fighter.

Judge orders Microsoft to turn over Windows code to rival firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A federal magistrate has ordered Microsoft
Corp. to hand over its top-secret computer source code for Windows
'95 to Caldera Inc., a small Utah software company suing it for
alleged antitrust violations.
	   Magistrate Ron Boyce on Tuesday ordered Caldera to show the
source code only to its attorneys and expert witnesses. He refused,
however, to grant Microsoft's request to prohibit Caldera's
witnesses from consulting on the design of any operating systems
for the next 12 to 18 months.
	   The judge did agree to warn the Caldera experts and lawyers the
code cannot be used for any purpose other than the litigation.
	   The source code for Windows '95 ``is among the most valuable and
confidential pieces of intellectual property in the world,''
Microsoft lawyer James Jardine.
	   Jardine said Microsoft will provide the code within five days.
	   Caldera, based in Orem, purchased Novell's DR-DOS operating
program and business in 1996. It claims that Microsoft, developer
of the competing MS-DOS system, has made false claims about the
compatibility of its dominant Windows software with DR-DOS. It
alleges Microsoft intentionally built ``incompatibilities'' into
the system.
	   The accusations parallel in some ways the U.S. government's
antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. Justice Department officials
claim the firm's alleged aggressive marketing strategies have hurt
competitors.
	   Both DOS programs are operating systems, which enable personal
computers to execute basic commands. Windows is a software overlay
that allows a user to ``point-and-click'' on visual images using a
computer mouse instead of typing commands.
	   Caldera also claims Microsoft used overly aggressive licensing
agreements, selling MS-DOS and Windows software to computer
manufacturers at unfair prices.

Women in Canadian civil service win huge equal-pay ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
 &UR; Eds: Figures are U.S. dollars &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ In a landmark decision, a human rights tribunal
ruled Wednesday that public servants in female-dominated job
categories deserve compensation for years of unequal pay.
	   The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's decision was a major
turning point in a 14-year legal battle involving more than 200,000
present and former federal civil servants, most of them women.
	   The complainants initiated legal action in 1984 arguing that
various female-dominated occupations in the civil service, ranging
from hospital workers to secretaries, were paid less than
comparable job categories dominated by men.
	   The tribunal upheld the complaint Wednesday, and said the
affected public servants should be eligible for retroactive
payment, plus interest, dating to March 1985.
	   The exact amount of the settlement is to be worked out in
negotiations over the next year. The public service union has said
about dlrs 1.33 billion is owed, while the federal Treasury Board
last year offered a settlement of dlrs 870 million.
	   Individual complainants are expecting to receive payments in the
range of dlrs 10,000 to dlrs 20,000.
	   Daryl Bean, president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada,
called the tribunal's decision ``a historic victory for working
women in Canada.''
	   The government said it was analyzing the ruling, which could be
appealed. It noted there could be an impact on the private sector
as well as the civil service because of the tribunal's
interpretation of pay equity provisions.
	   ``The government is committed to resolving this issue in a
manner that is both fair to employees and responsible to
taxpayers,'' the Treasury Board said in a statement.
	   Of the 200,000 people affected by the ruling, 54,000 are still
working in the public service. The rest have either retired or
switched jobs.
	   The dispute stems from the passage of the Canadian Human Rights
Act in 1977, which for the first time required men and women doing
basically the same work to be paid the same.
	   In the following decade, the federal government, like private
employers across the country, wrestled to comply with the
legislation.

EU Commission approves car manufacturers' plan to cut pollution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission endorsed
Wednesday an offer by European car manufacturers to voluntarily cut
carbon dioxide emissions in new cars by 25 percent over the next 10
years.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the proposal by the
Brussels-based Association of European Car Manufactures (ACEA) will
contribute ``significantly'' to EU efforts to cut pollution.
	   It ``shows that one of the key sectors of European industry is
willing to contribute actively to our efforts to reduce CO2
emissions,'' the EU's Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard
said.
	   But environmentalists say the plan doesn't go far enough.
	   ``In our view the Commission is chickening out. They've pushed
back the targets because of pressures from car manufacturers in
Italy, France, Germany and Britain,'' said Delia Villagrasa, a
director at the European Federation for Transport and Environment.
	   The Federation also argues that a voluntary agreement means the
EU will be powerless to ensure that car manufacturers hold to their
commitment.
	   The EU is expected to give the ACEA proposal formal backing
later this year after it has been examined by the European
parliament and the 15 EU countries.

US envoy meets Kosovo Liberation Front representatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A special American envoy traveled
to a key stronghold of ethnic Albanian rebels Wednesday for talks
with Kosovo Liberation Army leaders, Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, met for three hours with KLA
representatives in the village of Likoc in the Drenica region.
	   There are no information about outcome of the meeting and no
confirmation from U.S. officials.
	   The Albanian center said the meeting was attended by several
Albanain political representatatives: Veton Suroi and Blerim Shala,
members of the existing Albanian negotiating team; and also Hidajet
Hiseni and Mehmet Hajrizi, another two activists considered close
to the KLA.
	   Hill is trying to help put together a joint Albanian team for
peace talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   KLA acceptance of such a team could be crucial to the success of
the U.S. effort.

Malaysian prime minister visits Mozambique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ On the final leg of a weeklong visit
to southern Africa, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad flew
Wednesday to Mozambique.
	   President Joaquim Chissano greeted Mohamad at the airport.
	   The Malaysian minister plans to spend three days in this Indian
Ocean country, where Malaysian businessmen are interested in
investing in transport, communications, fishing and tourism.
	   Last year, Malaysian Southern Bank bought 30.6 per cent of the
shares in the Mozambican Development Bank.
	   Plans to open another Malaysian bank _ an International Commerce
and Investment Bank _ are to be finialized during the visit.
	   Malaysia is a large investor in the region. Last year, Telkom
Malaysia, along with the U.S.-based SBC Communications, bought 30
percent stake in Telkom South Africa, with an investment of dlrs
1.26 billion.

Georgia: Russian statement is ``irresponsible and groundless''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia on Wednesday angrily denied
Russian accusations that it was fueling tension in a breakaway
region.
	   In an unusually harsh statement issued on Tuesday, the Russian
Foreign Ministry accused the Georgian government of fueling tension
in the Black Sea province of Abkhazia and blamed authorities for
failing to curb violence against Russian peacekeepers. The
statement came one day after a bombing that injured three Russian
peacekeepers in the separatist region.
	   Georgia's Foreign Ministry called Russia's accusations
``irresponsible and groundless.''
	   ``The Georgian ministry has always supported and continues to
support the principle of joint investigation of tragic facts in the
Ghali region (of Abkhazia) and again calls on all participants in
the settlement of the conflict to refrain from hasty assessment of
events and to create all the conditions for normal work of a joint
investigation task force,'' it said in a statement.
	   The mine explosion on Monday was the third such attack on
Russian troops in two weeks. Altogether, five peacekeepers have
been killed and 12 wounded in the bombings.
	   The peacekeepers arrived in Abkhazia in 1994 following a civil
war in which separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
Large-scale hostilities have seized, but sporadic clashes between
separatists and pro-government militia have continued in spite of
the peacekeepers' presence.

Husband of slain U.S. citizen is murdered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan doctor married to a U.S.
citizen murdered in January was himself shot to death Wednesday at
the hospital where he worked.
	   Dr. Ricardo Orellana was the widower of Danita Gonzalez Plank de
Orellana, a Philadelphia native who was kidnapped and murdered in
January.
	   National police said an unknown man killed Dr. Ricardo Orellana
on the fourth floor of the San Juan de Dios Hospital here and fled.
	   No motive was known, nor was it clear if the shooting was
related to the attack on his wife.
	   Police said Orellana's colleagues at the hospital worked
frantically to save him, but the 37-year-old doctor died within an
hour of the shooting.
	   The shooting left the couple's three children as orphans, said
Dr. Daniel Gonzalez Estrada, father of Mrs. Orellana and an
unsuccessful candidate for the country's vice presidency in 1995.
	   Mrs. Orellana, 32, was kidnapped near Quetzaltenango in western
Guatemala on Jan. 6, together with her 6-month-old baby daughter.
	   The baby was found soon after alive inside a cardboard box, but
the woman's body was discovered eight days. She had been shot in
the head.
	   Police arrested several suspects, but prosecutors were unable to
produce evidence against them and all were freed.
	   Guatemala has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the Western
Hemisphere.

 &UR; Drug prevents recurring herpes infection of the eye &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The medicine acyclovir, already a standard
treatment for genital herpes, also prevents recurrence of
potentially dangerous herpes infections of the eye.
	   A study in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine found that the pills reduced recurrence of eye herpes by
nearly one-half. Researchers say the results make acyclovir _ also
known as Zovirax _ the first treatment proven to lower this risk.
	   An estimated 400,000 Americans have ocular herpes. There is
about a 10 percent chance the infection will come back within a
year. This rises to about a 50 percent chance of recurrence over 20
years.
	   The latest study was financed by the National Eye Institute and
led by Dr. Roy W. Beck of the Jaeb Center for Health Research in
Tampa, Florida.
	   Doctors randomly assigned 703 victims of recurring eye herpes to
take either acyclovir or dummy placeboes. After one year, the
infection came back in 19 percent of the acyclovir patients and 32
percent on placeboes.
	   The infection can cause painful sores on the eyelid or the
surface of the eye. Its worst form, called stromal keratitis, scars
the cornea and can lead to blindness.
	   In an editorial, Dr. Douglas A. Jabs of Johns Hopkins University
said people with recurring episodes of stromal keratitis should be
considered good candidates for acyclovir.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Unable to persuade the Security Council to
scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq, Russia instead sought
Wednesday to acknowledge Baghdad's previous progress and set the
stage for a future reduction.
	   The United States strongly objected to any such recognition and
the council adjourned for the day without taking any formal action
on the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 10-story brick apartment building collapsed
after an apparent gas explosion, killing at least four people _
including a child and an engaged couple _ officials and neighbors
said. Five people were injured.
	   Part of the building in eastern Moscow was demolished from top
to bottom and an entire column of ruined apartments gaped open.
Only the wallpaper was left.
	   Rescue workers accompanied by sniffer dogs cleared away sections
of prefabricated wall, mattresses, window and door frames as they
searched for more victims.
	   ``I felt that the wall had fallen,'' said Konstantin, 32, who
was sleeping when the explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (1030
GMT).
	   ``The windows were blown out. Then I went into the kitchen and a
corner of my kitchen was gone,'' he said, refusing to give his last
name.
	   It was at least the ninth gas explosion in Russia this year, the
NTV television station reported.
	   Four people died and five were injured in the building collapse
on Sherbakovskaya Street near Izmailovo Park, NTV said. The fourth
body was pulled from the rubble on Wednesday evening, shortly
before rescuers called a break in the search due to heavy smoke.
	   One of those killed was a child, said district mayor Boris
Ulyanov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Two of the dead were a man and a woman engaged to be married in
three weeks, neighbors said.
	   A distraught man they said was the woman's father rushed among
the crowd of bystanders held back by crime tape, demanding to talk
to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Police restrained him.
	   At least one of the injured was taken by helicopter to Moscow's
main trauma center, the Sklifosovsky Hospital. The chief doctor at
the hospital, Alexander Shcherbyuk, said that the injured woman was
in critical condition, with burns over 90 percent of her body.

Indians block highway to protest power line in prized Venezuelan

 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 400 Indians blocked Venezuela's
main highway to Brazil with huge logs to protest a high-voltage
power line being built in the ``Lost World'' of Amazon rain
forests.
	   The Indians shut down the El Dorado-Santa Elena International
Highway near the gold mining town of El Dorado, about 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Caracas, on Monday and Tuesday,
said Nicolas Betis of the Bolivar State Indian Federation. They
might carry out the action again Friday.
	   Construction of the (dlrs) 110 million, 500-kilometer (300-mile)
power line is deforesting swaths of jungle and destroying Indian
yuca, corn, banana, sugar and pineapple crops, he said.
	   The project is affecting about 15,000 people in 30 communities
of Pemon, Karina, Akawaio and Arawako Indians.
	   ``The deforestation is just horrible,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin,
vice president of the Venezuela branch of the Audubon Society, who
was at the protest site.
	   Some of the logs the Indians rolled onto the highway were nearly
as wide as she is tall, she said.
	   One-third of the power line is to run through the 3-million
hectare (7.4 million-acre) Canaima National Park, a popular tourist
destination. It is home to Angel Falls, which at 978 meters (3,208
feet) is the world's longest cascade, and to the eerily beautiful,
flat-topped mountains that were the inspiration for Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World.''
	   Government officials say the power line is to run mainly
alongside highways already built in the region and will cause
little environmental damage.
	   The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities
in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to
Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin
America.
	   Environmentalists say the companies will increase damage to the
forests.
	   The Indians say much of the land where the power line is going
up belongs to them and they were never consulted.

Castro launches Caribbean tour

<TEXT>
	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro begins a historic
Caribbean tour Wednesday, highlighting a campaign by the region's
leaders to influence the United States to end its three-decade
embargo of Cuba.
	   Castro's three-island tour starts in Jamaica, which has led a
Caribbean movement to re-establish diplomatic and trade links with
communist Cuba and has urged Washington to increase its contacts
with Havana.
	   ``There are many (U.S.) congressmen who feel strongly that the
U.S. ought to put an end to the embargo,'' Jamaica's Deputy Premier
Seymour Mullings said recently. ``We believe that within the U.S.
administration there is a strong feeling that more dialogue should
take place.''
	   Castro will spend six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. In
August, he joins other Caribbean leaders at a summit in the
Dominican Republic, which this year restored the diplomatic
relations it severed 37 years ago.
	   The most visible opposition to Castro's trip has come from
Grenada, where some politicians call his visit an insult to
Americans who invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists who had
overthrown a Cuba-allied regime. At the time, some U.S. strategists
feared Grenada could help Castro export his revolution.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 U.S. troops were killed
during the invasion.
	   In Jamaica, ``we still have bitter memories'' of Castro's
attempt to export his revolution in the 1970s, said conservative
opposition leader Edward Seaga.
	   Seaga, a former prime minister, told The Associated Press that
he still blamed Castro for Jamaica's 1970s experiment in socialism
that bankrupted the country. After his 1980 election, Seaga closed
the Cuban Embassy.
	   Yet Seaga, who meets with Castro on Thursday, said that the end
of the Cold War had neutralized Cuba as a threat. ``I don't think
we need to fight yesterday's war today,'' he said.
	   Relations with Cuba were restored in 1989 when socialist leader
Michael Manley was re-elected. Manley's protege, Prime Minister
P.J. Patterson, invited Castro to Jamaica.
	   While arguing that the time for isolating Cuba is past,
Caribbean leaders also have expressed frustration with Washington,
which they say has neglected the region after the Cold War.
	   U.S. aid has declined, promised trade benefits haven't
materialized and the United States has challenged European trade
preferences for bananas, a key regional export.
	   Caribbean officials say Cuba eventually could become a member of
the Caribbean Community trade bloc _ a move they say would
strengthen the bloc when it comes to trade negotiations with the
United States and Europe. Cuban membership would swell Caricom's
economic product from dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Deep differences remain about Cuba's human rights record. A
conference of Caribbean journalists voted in May to oppose Cuba's
joining the Caribbean Community unless Havana loosens control of
its state-run news media. Regional leaders, meanwhile, say
engagement is the way to improve the rights situation in Cuba.
	   Castro, 71, was traveling after dismissing a report that he was
critically ill last year. El Nuevo Herald reported last week that a
Cuban defector, Elizabeth Trujillo Izquierdo, said Castro was
hospitalized after his blood pressure rose dangerously high.
Trujillo described herself as a doctor.
	   U.S. analysts expressed doubts about her story, and El Nuevo
Herald and people who claim to know Trujillo said Wednesday that
the details may have been fabricated or altered.

Tyson loses temper at hearing on boxing license
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tyson losing temper and using expletive. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike Tyson lost his temper and cursed
during a hearing on Wednesday before a panel of New Jersey state
sports regulators considering returning him to the ring after being
banned from boxing for a year.
	   At his testimony, during which he choked back tears, Tyson
refused to read a statement.
	   ``I don't want to say it now, 'cause I'm angry,'' he said.
	   When his lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., tried to calm him, Tyson
then used an expletive.
	   ``You know what I mean, man? Why do I got to go through this,''
he said.
	   Tyson was choked up as he spoke of biting Evander Holyfield on
both ears in their June 28, 1997 title bout, but as his testimony
neared an end, he grew frustrated with the questioning by Assistant
Attorney General Michael Haas, the second-ranking prosecutor for
the state of New Jersey.
	   After Tyson's outburst, Fusco apologized to regulators, saying
it showed Tyson's frustration with his absence from boxing.
	   ``You're seeing a guy ripped apart,'' said Fusco.
	   Earlier, a repentant Tyson told the New Jersey Athletic Control
Board he ``just snapped'' when he bit Holyfield in their title
fight last year.
	   Tyson told the panel he was foggy from repeated head butts by
Holyfield in the third round of their June 28, 1997 fight in Las
Vegas.
	   ``I just snapped. Nothing mattered anymore at that particular
point,'' Tyson said, pausing to gather himself as his voice broke.
``I'm sorry for what I did. I wish it never happened. It will haunt
me for the rest of my life.''
	   He told Haas that he doubts he is capable of doing it again. He
said his personal life has been devastated by the incident.
	   Nevada revoked his license after the fight. The 32-year-old
Tyson has not fought since.
	   Two boxers testifying on Tyson's behalf said that in the heat of
battle almost anything can happen in the ring, and that the fighter
is not always conscious of his actions.
	   Former heavyweight contender Chuck Wepner said even Muhammad Ali
was known to lose his composure in the ring.
	   ``It's something that happens to you in the ring and it's hard
to explain,'' Wepner told the panel.
	   No mention was made of the Holyfield fight until 45 minutes into
the hearing when Haas brought it up, questioning Wepner.
	   Former light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz echoed Wepner's
comments, saying Tyson snapped in the ring, but that it shouldn't
prevent him from returning to it.
	   ``A piece of the street came out in him.'' said Czyz.
	   He also said that if he was fighting an opponent and knocked the
guy's eye out, he would eat it before the guy had a chance to get
it back.
	   ``That's the kind of mentality you have to have,'' Czyz said.
	   Testifying via videotape was 93-year-old Camille Ewald, former
companion of Tyson's longtime mentor Cuss D'Amato. She said Tyson
continues to support her financially and calls her his ``white
mother.''
	   Holding hands with his wife, Tyson was cheered as he arrived for
the hearing. But there were also scattered boos and a half-dozen
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, a feminist group, demonstrated outside.
	   The three-member panel will have 45 days to decide whether Tyson
has ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as
required by state boxing law. No immediate decision was expected,
according to spokesman Roger Shatzkin.
	   Questions have been raised whether the eastern state of New
Jersey should be the state to grant Tyson a license. Some said
Tyson should return to the western state of Nevada for his
regulatory repentance.
	   Fighting for Holyfield's WBA title, Tyson bit his right ear.
After a four-minute delay, the fight resumed and he bit him on the
left ear, prompting referee Mills Lane to disqualify him.
	   The Nevada State Athletic Commission swiftly revoked Tyson's
license and fined him dlrs 3 million, leaving him eligible to apply
for reinstatement after one year. He has not done so.
	   Fusco said Tyson applied in New Jersey because he likes fighting
in the coastal resort and gambling venue of Atlantic City, adding
he may later seek a license in Nevada.
	   But there also was the fear by Tyson's handlers that Nevada
regulators would make him wait longer to get his license, and a
further layoff would diminish his skills. Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he did not think
Nevada would have re-licensed the fighter.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former Cabinet minister and 11 others
were convicted Wednesday of kidnapping a French businessman,
concluding a trial that exposed the former government's role in
death squads that targeted Basque separatists.
	   The Supreme Court found Jose Luis Barrionuevo, the minister in
charge of internal security from 1982 to 1988, guilty of kidnapping
Segundo Marey in 1983.
	   Barrionuevo, currently a member of parliament, was sentenced to
10 years in prison and banned from public office for 12 years.
	   Marey's abduction was the first attributed to the so-called GAL
death squad. GAL killed 27 people in a campaign against the armed
Basque separatist group ETA between 1983-87. Many victims had no
connection with ETA.
	   Marey was released after 10 days when his kidnappers realized he
was not the ETA hitman they were hunting. He was awarded 30 million
pesetas (about dlrs 200,000) in compensation by the court and said
he was ``satisfied'' with the trial's outcome.
	   Rafael Vera, Barrionuevo's deputy, and former Basque security
chief Julian Sancristobal were sentenced to 10 years. Nine other
former police and ministry officials were given lesser terms.
	   None of the 12 defendants was present at Wednesday's verdict.
The trial ended July 14.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera, the only defendants to plead innocent,
have said they would appeal a guilty verdict to the Constitutional
Court.
	   The verdict damages former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who
has claimed the trial was a plot to discredit him and his Socialist
Party. The GAL scandal contributed to the Socialists' electoral
defeat two years ago after nearly 14 years in office.
	   Critics have charged that Gonzalez was ultimately responsible
for creating the GAL.
	   Defendants Ricardo Garcia Damborenea, a former head of the
Basque branch of the Socialist party, has said that he talked about
the GAL with Gonzalez himself in the prime minister's office.
	   After a probe by an investigating magistrate, the Supreme Court
ruled in November 1996 that there were insufficient grounds to try
Gonzalez.
	   The former prime minister refused to comment on the verdicts as
he arrived in Madrid Wednesday from a visit to Morocco.
	   Socialist spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters the
party executive would meet Thursday to discuss the verdict. But he
emphasized that four of the 11 judges had voted against the guilty
verdict.
	   A lawyer representing one of the defendants said he would seek
clarification of the sentence, a move that would keep all 12 out of
prison for at least a month.
	   Several foreign mercenaries contracted to carry out the killings
by GAL, a Spanish acronym for Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups,
were jailed in the late 1980s.
	   The Marey trial was the first to directly involve members of the
former government. Barrionuevo and Vera were indicted after two
police officers already sentenced for GAL murders, fingered their
former employers. There are another 12 GAL-linked cases currently
in the courts.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for
independence. It was particularly active during the GAL years.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was handed a
stinging rebuke Wednesday over his peace policies by lawmakers who
gave lopsided preliminary approval to a measure aimed at bringing
about early elections.
	   But the setback for the prime minister was all but overshadowed
by a larger one for the opposition: racially tinged remarks by one
of its lawmakers drew angry reaction from Jews of Sephardic, or
Middle Eastern descent, and badly damaged the Labor party's chances
for returning to government.
	   In an interview to the Haaretz daily Wednesday, Orr said that
Sephardic Jews _ who suffered discrimination after arriving in the
early 1950s at the hands of the ruling Ashkenazi or
European-descended elite _ use past injustices in order to unfairly
advance.
	   ``I have the feeling that people of Sephardic descent want to
hold onto their feelings of ethnic frustration ... so they can
exploit them for political gain,'' Orr said.
	   Orr, an ex-army general of Ashkenazi descent also touched on
negative stereotypes when he suggested that Sephardic Israelis,
including members of his own party, were ``problematic,'' and
backwards. ``High caliber individuals ... have not emerged from
among them.''
	   Wednesday's parliament session should have been a victory for
Labor, which successfully mustered up enough support for an
important vote against Netanyahu. Even eight disgruntled members of
Netanyahu's own coalition broke ranks to join Labor in the vote.
	   But Orr's comments, which he later apologized for, became the
focal point in the house with members of his own party calling for
his dismissal. At the end of the day, political analysts crowned
Netanyahu's Likud party the political winner and said Labor was in
trouble.
	   ``The Labor party took its own life today,'' said Israel TV's
political correspondent, Yaron Dekel.
	   Israel's Jewish population is roughly split among Sephardic and
Ashkenazi Jews, with the Sephardic community traditionally voting
for Netanyahu's Likud. But Labor has been trying to win over some
of that support in order to return to power in the 2000 elections.
	   Last year, Labor leader Ehud Barak apologized to Sephardic Jews
for the ill treatment they received under his predecessors, who ran
government when they first immigrated. Wednesday, Barak suspended
Orr from representing the party on an upcoming trip to the United
States.
	   In spite of the furor against Labor, its bill to dissolve
parliament passed by a massive 60 votes to 6.
	   The government's defeat however was largely symbolic because
Wednesday's vote was only for the preliminary stage of the bill. It
still has to go through a committee plus three more voting rounds
in parliament.
	   Even though it had no practical results, the vote was a
bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago.
Negotiators from both sides have been trying over the past 10 days
to get the talks going again, but no breakthrough has been
achieved. They were to meet again Thursday.
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept an American-authored peace initiative
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   But Netanyahu, who has survived numerous no-confidence motions
in the past two years, seemed unphased by Wednesday's vote. ``It
will take months ... until we get to a third reading and then you
won't have a majority, you know it,'' he told Labor.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team led the pack
across the finish line in Wednesday's 17th stage of the Tour de
France -- a protest ride against the widening doping investigation
that was annuled by Tour officials.
	   Riders who participated cruised without effort through more than
three-quarters of the leg to protest police investigations Tuesday
night and more Wednesday. They crossed the finish line, hands
joined and held aloft in a symbolic victory.
	   Seventeen riders from three teams -- ONCE, Banesto Riso Scotti
-- dropped out of the leg altogether.
	   The stage ended more than two hours later than it should have.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annuled, but
that the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday.
	   It was not immediately clear whether those who abandoned,
including French star Laurent Jalabert of ONCE, are exluded from
the rest of the competition, scheduled to end Sunday in Paris.
	   Police, meanwhile, were busy. They descended on three team
hotels around the Alpine town of Chambery, including the ONCE team,
a day after testing and searching the Dutch TVM team.
	   Police were seen removing garbage bags full of objects from a
camping car bearing the ONCE insignia, then sealing off the
vehicle.
	   France 2 television said that Jalabert was among those
questioned.
	   Also under search were the hotels of the Casino team and the
Francaise des Jeux, according to French TV.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest before his team simply
dropped out of the go-slow race.

	   Washington would oppose any presidential statement or resolution
``because it would appear to be rewarding Iraq when in fact it has
moved backward,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   A Russian-sponsored draft resolution would acknowledge Baghdad
had complied with Security Council resolutions requiring it destroy
its nuclear weapons.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said he was disappointed that
the council wasn't able to agree that Baghdad had complied with the
resolutions. As a compromise, Russia was trying to acknowledge
previous progress and register movement towards the eventual
shifting of nuclear inspections into less intrusive long-term
monitoring.
	   That too was unacceptable, Richardson said.

UNITED NATIONS: Richardson said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Iraq has made no progress in giving U.N. inspectors information
about weapons design, uranium enrichment and nuclear exports,
Richardson said.
	   ``There is absolutely no progress,'' Richardson said. ``And if
there is no progress, there is no closure on the nuclear file.''
	   Washington successfully blocked an effort this spring by Russia,
France and China to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to
less intrusive passive monitoring and verification visits after the
last IAEA report was released in April.
	   That report, and the one being considered Wednesday, said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program but said they also couldn't certify
that no such evidence existed.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Wednesday the council
should move immediately to shift the IAEA's focus to monitoring and
verification visits.
	   ``The IAEA has admitted in past reports, and also in Wednesday's
report, that there is no prohibited activities in Iraq,'' Hamdoon
said as the council began discussing the IAEA report.
	   He said there was no point in delaying the scaleback until the
next IAEA report, which is due in October, when all sanctions are
up for review.
	   The United States and Britain traditionally have taken the
hardest line against the lifting of sanctions, while the other
three permanent council members Russia, France and China have been
more sympathetic to the Iraqi cause.
	   The IAEA report noted that ``Iraq had made significant progress
in weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when the
inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf War.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It urged that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring system
continue to try to answer the remaining questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.

United States opens worlds by routing Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Italy, Spain wins. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Wendell Alexis led the way with 13 points
and eight rebounds as the United States overcame a slow start
Wednesday to beat Brazil 83-59 in the opener for both teams at the
World Basketball Championship.
	   With the Dream Teamers at home because of the NBA labor dispute,
the U.S. cast of understudies relied on defense and plenty of
second-efforts.
	   The American stars' no-show brought down the skill level and the
attendance figures.
	   About 500 fans showed up at cavernous, 18,000-seat Olympic
Stadium for the U.S.-Brazil game, and organizers said the
tournament, which ends Aug. 9, is likely to lose money.
	   The United States went more than four minutes at the start of
the game without a field goal, missing its first six shots, and
trailed by five after 10 minutes.
	   ``If it was bad shots, I'd worry. But we were taking great shots
and just missing them,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We
just had to knock the dust off, break the seal. Then our defense
really helped us get some easy baskets.''
	   An end-to-end drive by Michael Hawkins (12 points and 10
assists, a record for a U.S. player at the world championship)
capped a 13-1 run that helped give the U.S. team a 40-32 halftime
lead.
	   The United States held Brazil to 36.4 percent shooting from the
field and converted several easy breakaway baskets into the
second-half spurt that won the game.
	   ``We know we don't have any dominant players, players who are
going to take over a game,'' Alexis said. ``It's going to be a
different player every night.''
	   The former Syracuse standout typifies the group. The 6-foot-10
(2.06-meter) forward was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in
1986 but was cut, and embarked on a career that has brought him to
Spain, Italy and now Germany.
	   ``I'm the most experienced, so I shouldn't let the other guys
get rattled,'' said Alexis, at 34 the team's elder statesman.
	   Duke's Trajan Langdon, a late roster replacement for Big Ten
Player of the Year Mateen Cleaves (twisted ankle), sparked the U.S.
offense with two 3-pointers late in the first half.
	   Langdon is the only college player on Tomjanovich's roster. The
rest are either in the CBA, with European teams _ or looking for
work.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday, Miroslav Beric's 23 points paced European
champion Yugoslavia's 80-66 defeat of Puerto Rico.
	   Lithuania and Russia, two countries that used to supply players
for the Soviet juggernaut, both enjoyed blowout victories.
	   Darius Lukminus scored 20 points and Arturas Karnishovas added
19 as Lithuania beat South Korea 97-56. Russia had five players in
double figures in its 83-58 win over Japan.
	   Spain beat Nigeria 80-68 with 14 points each from Alfonso Reyes
and Julio Ignacio Rodilla. Nigeria, supported by raucous, chanting
and drum-pounding fans, was led by Mohammed Acha's 23 points. Italy
got past Senegal 76-66 without star guard Carlton Myers, who was
sidelined by a sore throat and fever.
	   With the NBA lockout in place, only one player from the league _
Australia's Chris Anstey _ is participating in the tournament.
	   Before USA Basketball dumped the Dream Team in mid-June, local
organizers predicted ticket and merchandise sales would be enough
to cover expenses and perhaps turn a profit. But now they are
facing the likelihood of about 100 million drachmas (about dlrs
330,000) in losses, a spokesman said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ British sprinter Christian Malcolm won the
100-meter gold medal at the World Junior Championships Wednesday,
missing the world junior record by just six hundreths of a second.
	   Malcolm, 19, won in impressive style, posting a time of 10.12
seconds to cross the line ahead of Amar Johnson, of the United
States, who recorded a personal best of 10.34.
	   Britain's Dwain Chambers holds the world junior record, with a
time of 10.06.
	   In the women's 100 meter event, U.S. runner Shakedia Jones, from
Los Angeles, won the gold with a time of 11.19, ahead of fellow
American Angela Williams, who ran in 11.27.
	   Jones is the U.S. junior champion at 200 meters.
	   In the women's pole vault, a 4.20 meter leap by world junior
record holder Monika Gotz of Germany was enough to win the
competition.
	   Gotz, who set the junior record in May with a jump of 4.31, beat
off challenges by Mar Sanchez of Spain, Monika Pyrek of Poland and
Germany's Yvonne Buschbaun, who each posted jumps of 4.10.
	   The women's hammer competition also went to form, with favorite
Bianca Achilles of Germany winning the gold medal with a throw of
61.79.

Liechtenstein presses property claims with European Union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Liechtenstein has filed a human
rights complaint with the European Union over hundreds of millions
of dollars in property seized from its royal family by
Czechoslovakia after World War II, the family's lawyer said
Wednesday.
	   Though the tiny alpine principality was neutral during the war,
Czechoslovakia deemed Liechtenstein's royal family German and
confiscated their property along with that of other Germans as war
compensation.
	   Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, a non-EU country of about
30,000 people between Austria and Switzerland, unsuccessfully has
tried to get compensation from Prague.
	   But the complaint filed Tuesday with the EU Commission for Human
Rights in Strasbourg, France, technically is against the German
government, lawyer Alexander Goepfert said in Duesseldorf.
	   Germany became involved in the issue after the Czech government
in 1991 loaned a Cologne museum a painting by Pieter van Laer that
originally belonged to the Liechtenstein royal family.
	   Prince Hans-Adam II had German officials seize the painting. But
German courts later decided Germany had no authority over the
painting, saying Germany gave up any authority over property
confiscated in Czechoslovakia as part of postwar agreements.
	   The royal family now says that Germany is responsible not only
for the painting but for all the property it lost after the war
because Germany improperly relinquished the family's claims in
those postwar agreements.
	   Prince Hans-Adam said in a recent interview with Der Spiegel
magazine the total claims are worth about 1 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 675 million), including castles, land, and artwork.
	   Goepfert said discussions with Germany's government over a
possible settlement have been fruitless, prompting the royal family
to go before the EU agency.

	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The government on Wednesday
approved a sweeping crackdown on smokers and tobacco advertising
that is expected to pass Parliament later this year.
	   Smokers will be banned from lighting up in indoor public places,
such as airports, and on buses and trains. Owners of restaurants
and bars will have to provide large non-smoking areas.
	   In factories and other workplaces, smoking will be banned in
stairwells, corridors, cafeterias and lobbies.
	   Tobacco advertising will be banned.
	   Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma also said that existing
sponmsorship contracts between sports events and tobacco firms
would be respected, but no new ones allowed.
	   Tobacco firms said the new rules are among the toughest in the
world and could cut off support for developing sports in South
Africa.
	   Zuma said her primary duty was to protect the health of
citizens, especially children who she said are targeted by tobacco
firms.
	   ``They want ... young people to think that to be a good sports
person, or succeed at anything, you need to be a smoker,'' she
said.
	   ----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP)_ Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau on
Wednesday announced that 12 people ``who may include cabinet
ministers'' will soon face prosecution.
	   Investigators had nearly completed follow-ups of more than 40
complaints made by members of the public, said the ACB director
Gilton Chiwaula.
	   ``We reckon that half will end up in court,'' he said.
	   Chiwaula said irregularities were found in the education
ministry and sugar trade.
	   Introduction of free primary education in 1994 saw school
enrollment soar from 1.9 to 3.2 million students, with alleged
creation of ``ghost teachers'' by corrupt colleagues who collected
their salaries.
	   Earlier this year, a U.S. government-funded report implicated
President Bakili Muluzi and top ruling party colleagues in
irregular sugar trading deals that led to shortages of sugar.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ African women need to increase their
participation in government if they want to have a greater impact
in their countries, a delegate at a forum for West African first
ladies said.
	   ``Our countries and continent need to take advantage of all our
human resources ... and the ingenuity of women,'' said Josephine
Ouedraogo, of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa,
addressing representatives Monday.
	   First ladies from Niger, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Guinea, Togo and
Nigeria attended the conference, which focused on the role of women
in conflict resolution, fund raising for humanitarian assistance,
refugees and women and development.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Commercial farmers agreed on Wednesday
to pay workers a 32 percent wage increase, a concession aimed at
ending a gathering wave of wildcat strikes.
	   A delegation flew to the southeastern region with the hope of
ending a walkout by 10,000 sugar plantation workers who were
demanding a 50 percent wage increase.
	   Last week, stoppages occurred in several rural areas to protest
falling living standards as inflation has grown to more than 25
percent.
	   There are about 500,000 workers on the country's 4,500
commercial farms. Most of the owners are white.
	   The new minimum wage for farm workers was put at 664 Zimbabwe
dollars (dlrs 36) a month.
	   Critics of President Robert Mugabe's plan to redistribute
white-owned farms to landless black peasants has triggered fears
that many workers would lose their jobs and homes.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ More than 20 editorial staff walked off
their jobs at the government-controlled daily newspaper to protest
against a two-hour longer work day.
	   The Herald's editor-in-chief, Bornwell Chakadoza, demanded that
reporters stay longer because he was disappointed by the poor
quality of stories.
	   Chakadoza recently replaced a relative of President Robert
Mugabe, who died in April soon after taking over the job.

Lawmakers vote against Netanyahu; Opposition stumbles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: restores first name in 1st reference to Ori Orr, 3rd graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was handed a
stinging rebuke Wednesday over his peace policies by lawmakers who
gave lopsided preliminary approval to a measure aimed at bringing
about early elections.
	   But the setback for the prime minister was all but overshadowed
by a larger one for the opposition: racially tinged remarks by one
of its lawmakers drew angry reaction from Jews of Sephardic, or
Middle Eastern descent, and badly damaged the Labor party's chances
for returning to government.
	   In an interview to the Haaretz daily Wednesday, Ori Orr said
that Sephardic Jews _ who suffered discrimination after arriving in
the early 1950s at the hands of the ruling Ashkenazi or
European-descended elite _ use past injustices in order to unfairly
advance.
	   ``I have the feeling that people of Sephardic descent want to
hold onto their feelings of ethnic frustration ... so they can
exploit them for political gain,'' Orr said.
	   Orr, an ex-army general of Ashkenazi descent also touched on
negative stereotypes when he suggested that Sephardic Israelis,
including members of his own party, were ``problematic,'' and
backwards. ``High caliber individuals ... have not emerged from
among them.''
	   Wednesday's parliament session should have been a victory for
Labor, which successfully mustered up enough support for an
important vote against Netanyahu. Even eight disgruntled members of
Netanyahu's own coalition broke ranks to join Labor in the vote.
	   But Orr's comments, which he later apologized for, became the
focal point in the house with members of his own party calling for
his dismissal. At the end of the day, political analysts crowned
Netanyahu's Likud party the political winner and said Labor was in
trouble.
	   ``The Labor party took its own life today,'' said Israel TV's
political correspondent, Yaron Dekel.
	   Israel's Jewish population is roughly split among Sephardic and
Ashkenazi Jews, with the Sephardic community traditionally voting
for Netanyahu's Likud. But Labor has been trying to win over some
of that support in order to return to power in the 2000 elections.
	   Last year, Labor leader Ehud Barak apologized to Sephardic Jews
for the ill treatment they received under his predecessors, who ran
government when they first immigrated. Wednesday, Barak suspended
Orr from representing the party on an upcoming trip to the United
States.
	   In spite of the furor against Labor, its bill to dissolve
parliament passed by a massive 60 votes to 6.
	   The government's defeat however was largely symbolic because
Wednesday's vote was only for the preliminary stage of the bill. It
still has to go through a committee plus three more voting rounds
in parliament.
	   Even though it had no practical results, the vote was a
bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago.
Negotiators from both sides have been trying over the past 10 days
to get the talks going again, but no breakthrough has been
achieved. They were to meet again Thursday.
	   The prime minister has been under pressure from both inside and
outside Israel to accept an American-authored peace initiative
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   But Netanyahu, who has survived numerous no-confidence motions
in the past two years, seemed unphased by Wednesday's vote. ``It
will take months ... until we get to a third reading and then you
won't have a majority, you know it,'' he told Labor.

Cyprus hails ``landmark'' EU court decision against Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus on Wednesday hailed a decision by
the European Court of Human Rights to order Turkey to pay 320,000
Cyprus pounds (dlrs 700,000) to a Greek Cypriot woman forced from
the Turkish-occupied north of the island.
	   The European Court in Strasbourg ordered Turkey on Tuesday to
pay the money to Titina Loizidou for depriving her of her property
in the northern town of Kyrenia.
	   Hundreds of similar cases are pending before the European Court.
	   ``This is a historic landmark decision that creates a legal
precedent for all the refugees,'' Attorney General Alecos Markides
told a news conference.
	   Some 180,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north fled or were
forcibly expelled in the wake of the 1974 Turkish invasion. They
have not been allowed to return.
	   The court ruled in favor of Loizidou saying she was denied
access to her property in northern Cyprus ``as a result of the
presence of Turkish forces there.''
	   Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the north is only
recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   ``The court decision for the first time puts a monetary cost for
the violation of human rights and this is likely to result in
Turkey being forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in
compensation if it continues to reject the legal right of the
refugees to return to their homes and properties,'' Loizidou's
lawyer, Achilleas Demetriades, told The Associated Press.
	   The court rejected a submission by Turkey that it could not be
held responsible for the actions of the breakaway state in northern
Cyprus.
	   It ruled that ``the continuous denial of the applicant's access
to her property in northern Cyprus and the ensuing loss of all
control over the property is a matter that falls within Turkey's
jurisdiction and is thus imputable to Turkey.''
	   The court ordered Turkey to pay 300,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs
660,000) for the loss of the use of her property and an additional
20,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 44,000) for the anguish that the loss
caused her.
	   The court ruled that additional compensation and interest must
be paid to Loizidou until she is allowed to return to her property.
	   It also ordered Turkey to pay Loizidou's court costs of 137,084
Cyprus pounds (dlrs 300,000).

Tyson loses temper at hearing on boxing license
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with board adjourned hearing, scheduled Aug. 6
session. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike Tyson lost his temper and cursed
Wednesday during a hearing before New Jersey state boxing
regulators aimed at returning him to the ring after being banned
from the sport for a year.
	   Tyson choked back tears during his testimony before the New
Jersey Athletic Control Board, then turned angry under repeated
questioning as to why he bit Evander Holyfield's ear.
	   Tyson then was supposed to read a closing statement, but he
refused.
	   ``I don't want to say it now, 'cause I'm angry,'' he said.
	   When his lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., tried to calm him, Tyson
then used an expletive.
	   ``You know what I mean, man? Why do I got to go through this ...
all the time?''
	   ``Relax, relax,'' Fusco said, putting his hand on Tyson
shoulder.
	   Tyson was choked up as he spoke of biting Evander Holyfield on
both ears in their June 28, 1997 title bout, but as his testimony
neared an end, he grew frustrated with the questioning by Assistant
Attorney General Michael Haas, the second-ranking prosecutor in the
state of New Jersey.
	   After Tyson's outburst, Fusco apologized to regulators, saying
it showed Tyson's ``frustration'' with his absence from boxing.
	   ``You're seeing a guy ripped apart,'' said Fusco.
	   The three-member panel will have 45 days to decide whether Tyson
has ``good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as
required by state boxing law.
	   No immediate action was taken. The board adjourned and scheduled
an executive session for Aug. 6.
	   At a news conference later, Tyson denied losing his temper.
	   ``I never lost my cool,'' he told reporters. ``I was just
expressing my hurt.''
	   During his testimony, a repentant Tyson told the board he ``just
snapped'' when he bit Holyfield in their title fight last year.
	   Tyson told the panel he was foggy from repeated head butts by
Holyfield in the third round of their June 28, 1997 fight in Las
Vegas.
	   ``I just snapped. Nothing mattered anymore at that particular
point,'' Tyson said, pausing to gather himself as his voice broke.
``I'm sorry for what I did. I wish it never happened. It will haunt
me for the rest of my life.''
	   He told Haas that he doubts he is capable of doing it again. He
said his personal life has been devastated by the incident.
	   The western state of Nevada revoked his license after the fight.
The 32-year-old Tyson has not fought since.
	   Two boxers testifying on Tyson's behalf said that in the heat of
battle almost anything can happen in the ring, and that the fighter
is not always conscious of his actions.
	   Former heavyweight contender Chuck Wepner said even Muhammad Ali
was known to lose his composure in the ring.
	   ``It's something that happens to you in the ring and it's hard
to explain,'' Wepner told the panel.
	   No mention was made of the Holyfield fight until 45 minutes into
the hearing when Haas brought it up, questioning Wepner.
	   Former light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz echoed Wepner's
comments, saying Tyson snapped in the ring, but that it shouldn't
prevent him from returning to it.
	   ``A piece of the street came out in him.'' said Czyz.
	   He also said that if he was fighting an opponent and knocked the
guy's eye out, he would eat it before the guy had a chance to get
it back.
	   ``That's the kind of mentality you have to have,'' Czyz said.
	   Testifying via videotape was 93-year-old Camille Ewald, former
companion of Tyson's longtime mentor Cuss D'Amato. She said Tyson
continues to support her financially and calls her his ``white
mother.''
	   Holding hands with his wife, Tyson was cheered as he arrived for
the hearing. But there were also scattered boos and a half-dozen
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, a feminist group, demonstrated outside.
	   Questions have been raised whether New Jersey should be the
state to grant Tyson a license. Some said Tyson should return to
Nevada for his regulatory repentance.
	   Fighting for Holyfield's WBA title, Tyson bit his right ear.
After a four-minute delay, the fight resumed and he bit him on the
left ear, prompting referee Mills Lane to disqualify him.
	   Besides revoking his license, the Nevada State Athletic
Commission fined Tyson dlrs 3 million and left him eligible to
apply for reinstatement after one year. He has not done so.
	   Fusco said Tyson applied in New Jersey because he likes fighting
in the coastal resort and gambling venue of Atlantic City, adding
he may later seek a license in Nevada.
	   But there also was the fear by Tyson's handlers that Nevada
regulators would make him wait longer to get his license, and a
further layoff would diminish his skills. Tyson adviser Shelly
Finkel told the Las Vegas Sun last week that he did not think
Nevada would have re-licensed the fighter.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team led the pack
across the finish line in the 17th stage of the Tour de France -- a
protest ride against the widening doping investigation that by
Wednesday touched six teams.
	   Tour officials annuled the leg that ended more than two hours
later than scheduled, with riders cruising through it without
effort to the finish in Aix-Les-Bains.
	   TVM riders crossed the finish line with hands joined and held
aloft in a symbolic victory.
	   Seventeen riders from three teams -- ONCE, Banesto, Riso Scotti
-- dropped out of the leg altogether.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annuled, but
said the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday.
	   It was not immediately clear whether those who abandoned,
including French star Laurent Jalabert of ONCE, are definitviely
exluded from the rest of the competition, scheduled to end Sunday
in Paris.
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said Bjarne Riis of the Dutch Telekom team
who won the 1996 Tour.
	   ``What we did today was to save the Tour, save cycling because
it's our life,'' Riis said, referring to the slowdown protest.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the Dutch TVM team, whose members were tested Tuesday night and
their bags searched. ``I have the impression the Tour is finished.
I'm sick.''
	   Police were busy on Wednesday too. They descended on three team
hotels around the Alpine town of Chambery, including the ONCE team,
a day after testing and searching the Dutch TVM team.

Serb battlefield gains may make Kosovo Albanians reconsider
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. envoy meeting KLA representatives, statement
by KLA spokesman. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance, as they seek to unite their different factions _ a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations.
	   But it was unclear Wednesday if the key element in the Kosovo
equation, the rebel Kosovo Liberation army, would be part of a
unified, self-styled government the top Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, has said will be set up.
	   If the KLA agrees to participate in Rugova's government, this
would be a clear sign that they would also join him in negotiations
with the Serbs.
	   The underground army is fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and the
West. It has so far refused to be associated with any political
faction.
	   Rugova announced earlier Wednesday he had reached a compromise
with other ethnic Albanians on a coalition government, saying it
would include ``all political forces'' and ``create pre-conditions
for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav government.
	   For almost two weeks, the Albanian guerrillas have suffered a
string of bitter defeats across the rebellious province, testifying
to the government forces' superior weaponry and equipment.
	   Rugova's announcement came on the heels of several fresh Serb
victories in an offensive launched Friday night, a development that
may lead the rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Fighting was heaviest on Wednesday in the north-central Drenica
region, where the conflict escalated earlier this year.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported that Serb police
had gained full control of a contested stretch of the Kosovska
Mitrovica-Pec road in that region.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. enovy Christopher Hill met Wednesday for three
hours with KLA members in the village of Likoc in the Drenica
region, where the guerrillas are believed to have their general
staff headquarters, the Kosovo Information Center reported. There
was no word on how the meeting went.
	   Hill was accompanied by several ethnic Albanian political
representatives, including Mehmet Hajrizi, a Pristina-based
activist who, in interviews with American newspapers, had said he
was speaking on behalf of the KLA.
	   Without mentioning Hajrizi by name, an enraged Jakup Krasniqi,
the recently appointed KLA spokesman, told Albanian state TV that
``so-called politicians and military people'' were speaking in
behalf of the KLA in an ``irresponsible way'' about the Serb
offensive.
	   Krazniqi said he was authorized to explain that no political
leader was permitted to speak for the KLA, which was authorizing
Bardhyl Mahmutin, an Albanian living in Geneva, to establish
contact with the outside world.

Minister warns of hunger menacing Cameroon's far north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Thousands of people are threatened by
hunger after seasonal drought, heavy rains and rampaging animals
destroyed crops and depleted food stores in northern Cameroon, a
government minister said Wednesday.
	   Agriculture Minister Zacharie Perevet also blamed locust and
vulture infestations for reducing stocks of staple grains in the
West African country's Far North province to about one-tenth of
normal levels.
	   Heavy rains earlier this month washed away crops that had
already suffered several months of drought.
	   The U.N. feeding agency, World Food Program, had begun
distributing food stocks donated by the U.N., European Union and
Cameroonian government, Perevet said.
	   He made the comments following a fact-finding visit to the
province with U.N. officials.
	   While authorities have not given exact figures, a Yaounde daily
newspaper, Le Messager, reported Friday that as many as 440,000 of
the 2.2 million people in the Cameroonian province were threatened
by hunger.
	   Drought and accompanying flooding have for years plagued the
region, which has among highest rate of child malnutrition and
infant mortality in the world.
	   Most people in the province survive on a staple of rice, maize
and millet.
	   Although much of southern Cameroon lies in lush, fertile
forests, the northern part of the country is arid and vulnerable to
the steady advancement of the Sahara desert from Cameroon's
northern neighbors Chad and Niger.

El Guerrouj misses record in mile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Hicham El Guerrouj had his poorest performance of
the season and missed the world record by nearly five seconds in
the mile Wednesday at the Gaz de France international meet.
	   The Moroccan, who had been hoping for a world mark, did 3
minutes, 49.02 seconds, well off Noureddine Morceli's three-year
old mark of 3:44.39. El Guerrouj ran 3:44.60 July 16 in Nice.
	   El Guerrouj, the indoor and outdoor world champion, has been the
top runner this season. On July 14 he broke Morceli's 1,500-meter
mark by 1.37 seconds with 3:26.00. Two days later he missed the
mile record by .21 seconds.
	   Three days later he missed Morceli's 2,000 mark of 4:47.88 by
less than a half second at a meet in Gateshead, England.
	   But Wednesday he was never in the chase for the record. Although
Kenyan Robert Kibet had a fast pace of 53.55 and 1:50.32, El
Guerrouj was trailing and not looking as if he could accelerate.
	   By 1,200 meters, with El Guerrouj passing in 2:50, the record
seemed out of reached. Even more when El Guerrouj barely broke 59
seconds for the final lap.
	   In other events, Marion Jones set a meet record of 10.88 in the
women's 100, the 12th time she has been under 11.00 this year. She
held off the rising French stt meeting of the three since an
ill-will meeting at the Goodwill Games for the first three.
	   Greene won there in 9.96, running into a wind, edging Boldon.
What angered Greene was Bailey's matter of not racing when Bailey
saw he was beaten.
	   Fredericks was missing from that race but had been the most
legal sub 10-00 clockings in the 100 with 22 entering the evening.

Champions Cup: FC Kosice wins 8-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ FC Kosice on Wednesday trounced
Cliftonville of Nothern Ireland 8-0 on home grounds in the
Champions Cup qualifying round, advancing on an incredible 13-1
aggregate score.
	   Four minutes into the first half, Jan Kozak opened the score
after a pass from Miroslav Sovic. Irish goalie Paul Reese was again
defeated in the 14th minute by Vladimir Janocko. Szilard Nemeth
scored the third goal in the 32 minute, again after a pass from
Sovic.
	   Things turned from bad to worse for the Irish after change of
sides.
	   In the 54th minute, Ruszlan Ljubarskij kicked the ball to
Vladimir Janocko, who shot the fourth goal of the match. Martin
Prohaszka scored four minutes later.
	   The Irish team apparently gave up trying afterward.
	   The 1,950 viewers saw three more goals: Ruszlan Ljubarskij's in
the 67th minute, Martin Prohaszka's in the 72nd minute and Jozef
Kozlej's in the 83rd minute.
	   FC Kosice will play Denmark's Brondby IF on Aug. 14 in the next
round.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Dutch TVM team led the pack
across the finish line in the 17th stage of the Tour de France -- a
protest ride against the widening doping investigation that by
Wednesday touched six teams.
	   Tour officials annuled the leg that ended more than two hours
later than scheduled, with riders cruising through it without
effort to the finish in Aix-Les-Bains.
	   TVM riders crossed the finish line with hands joined and held
aloft in a symbolic victory.
	   Seventeen riders from three teams -- ONCE, Banesto, Riso Scotti
-- dropped out of the leg altogether.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annuled, but
said the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday.
	   It was not immediately clear whether those who abandoned,
including French star Laurent Jalabert of ONCE, are definitviely
exluded from the rest of the competition, scheduled to end Sunday
in Paris.
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said Bjarne Riis of the Deutsche Telekom team
who won the 1996 Tour.

Annan supports UNHCR head despite financial management report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Refugee Agency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed
support Wednesday for the head of the U.N. refugee agency following
a report that the organization was losing millions of dollars
because of bad management.
	   The London-based Financial Times reported Wednesday that its
research and an independent auditors' report highlight ``serious
failings'' in the financial management of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Sadako Ogata, 71, who has headed the UNHCR since 1991, is in New
York this week. Annan said he spoke to her about the newspaper
report earlier Wednesday.
	   ``I have confidence in what's she's done and what she's trying
to do with the organization,'' Annan said at a news conference.
	   ``Mrs. Ogata, in a very difficult period, has done very well and
provided good leadership to the organization,'' he said.
	   The UNHCR has a yearly budget of dlrs 1 billion.
	   The newspaper report said incompetent management, dubious
accounting and possibly fraud were costing the agency millions of
dollars.
	   As a result of the newspaper report, Annan said he has asked for
additional information from UNHCR.
	   ``I would need to look at all the papers and the facts when I
receive them before I enter into the details,'' he said.
	   Ogata's term expires this fall. It has been reported that she
may seek a shortened third term.

US says no reason to scale back Iraq nuclear inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, RECASTS lede, ADDS Lavrov comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia failed Wednesday to persuade the
Security Council to scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq after
the United States said such a move would unjustly reward Iraq for
continued noncompliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Acknowledging a scaleback couldn't be achieved now, Russia
instead sought to acknowledge Baghdad's previous progress and set
the stage for a future reduction in inspections to less intrusive
monitoring and verification visits.
	   The United States strongly objected to any such recognition and
the council adjourned for the day without taking any formal action
on the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   Washington opposed any presidential statement or resolution
``because it would appear to be rewarding Iraq when in fact it has
moved backward,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   Washington successfully blocked an effort this spring by Russia,
France and China to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to the
passive monitoring and verification visits after the last IAEA
report was released in April.
	   That report, and the one being considered Wednesday, said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program but said they also couldn't certify
that no such evidence existed.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said he was disappointed that
the council couldn't agree on a scaleback considering the IAEA
report signaled that all remaining questions about Iraq's nuclear
abilities ``could be handled easily and entirely'' by monitoring.
	   He circulated a draft resolution and presidential statement that
would acknowledge that there is no evidence Baghdad is trying to
maintain its nuclear weapons program. The statement also
acknowledges previous progress and registers movement towards the
eventual shifting of nuclear inspections into monitoring.
	   ``This leaves the thorny and controversial issue of ongoing
monitoring for a later stage,'' Lavrov said.
	   That too was unacceptable, Richardson said.
	   Iraq has made no progress in giving U.N. inspectors information
about weapons design, uranium enrichment and nuclear exports,
Richardson said.
	   ``There is absolutely no progress,'' Richardson said. ``And if
there is no progress, there is no closure on the nuclear file.''
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Wednesday the council
should move immediately to shift the IAEA's focus to monitoring and
verification visits.
	   ``The IAEA has admitted in past reports, and also in Wednesday's
report, that there is no prohibited activities in Iraq,'' Hamdoon
said as the council began discussing the IAEA report.
	   He said there was no point in delaying the scaleback until the
next IAEA report, which is due in October, when all sanctions are
up for review.
	   The United States and Britain traditionally have taken the
hardest line against the lifting of sanctions, while the other
three permanent council members Russia, France and China have been
more sympathetic to the Iraqi cause.
	   The IAEA report noted that ``Iraq had made significant progress
in weaponization technologies before April 1991,'' when the
inspections began under terms for ending the Gulf War.
	   ``It is also clear that there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program,'' the report said.
	   It urged that a rigorous and intrusive monitoring system
continue to try to answer the remaining questions about Iraq's
nuclear capabilities.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.

Serb battlefield gains may make Kosovo Albanians reconsider

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance as they seek to unite their different factions _ a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations.
	   But it was unclear if the key element in the Kosovo equation,
the rebel Kosovo Liberation army, would be part of a unified,
self-styled government that the top Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced Wednesday will be set up.
	   The underground army is fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and the
West. It has so far refused to be associated with any political
faction.
	   Rugova said he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, saying it would include ``all
political forces'' and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with
the Serb-led Yugoslav government.
	   For almost two weeks, the Albanian guerrillas have suffered a
string of bitter defeats across the rebellious province, testifying
to the government forces' superior weaponry and equipment.
	   Rugova's announcement came after several new Serb victories in
an offensive launched Friday night, a development that may lead the
rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Fighting was heaviest Wednesday in the north-central Drenica
region, where the conflict escalated earlier this year.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported that Serb police
had gained full control of a contested stretch of the Kosovska
Mitrovica-Pec road in that region.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Wednesday with KLA
members in the village of Likoc in the Drenica region, where the
guerrillas are believed to have their general staff headquarters,
the Kosovo Information Center reported. No details of the
three-hour meeting were available.
	   New clashes also were reported in the border region of Djakovica
near the Albanian border, 75 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb forces were shelling villages believed to be KLA
strongholds. No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   Meanwhile, thousands were reported to have fled Malisevo, a
rebel stronghold captured by Serb forces Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said that at
least three elderly civilians were killed and two other
unidentified bodies were also found in the Malisevo area.
	   In southwestern Kosovo, heavily armed Serb forces, backed by
helicopters, were trying to capture another KLA bastion, Junik,
where about 1,000 fighters are trapped, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   An unspecified number of people from Junik surrendered Tuesday
night, Tanjug reported Wednesday, quoting police sources. They
reportedly said they had fled from several ``notorious terrorist
leaders'' who threatened those remaining that their property would
be burned down if they surrendered to police.
	   More fighting was also reported south of Pristina, the
province's capital, on the road to the southern town of Prizren.
	   Albanian language media have speculated that Rugova would offer
the KLA the posts of defense and interior, meaning it would control
the provincial police.
	   Yugoslavia is unlikely to recognize Rugova's government, but it
might form the basis for an ethnic Albanian team to negotiate the
status of the province with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Arranging those talks has been the goal of American and European
diplomacy. Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million-strong
population.
	   Before his announcement, Rugova met Wednesday with a
three-member European Union delegation as part of the latest
international effort to halt the bloodshed.
	   ``We cannot tolerate the increasing amount of victims, the
destruction, the refugee situation,'' Albert Rohan, the Austrian
delegation leader. He called for an immediate end to the fighting.
	   The inability of the Albanians to agree on the composition of a
negotiating team has been a major stumbling block to international
efforts to resolve the conflict.
	   Some hard-core members of the KLA want to unite all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans into a
``Greater Albania,'' a plan rejected by Yugoslavia, the United
States, Russia and other major powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989, but refuses to consider independence. The
international community also opposes independence.

Head of presidential commission calls for Lenin to be buried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Yakovlev, the veteran democratic
reformer who heads President Boris Yeltsin's commission for
rehabilitating victims of political repression, called Wednesday
for the body of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin to be taken from its
Red Square Mausoleum and buried.
	   Yakovlev addressed his appeal to Russia's intellectuals,
political parties and ordinary citizens, and said he would ask
Yeltsin to make a decision. He also said he would talk to the
parliament, dominated by Communists and other hard-liners who
oppose Lenin's removal from its pedestal in the center of Moscow.
	   ``The Russian people should not be treated like this, forced to
follow pagan ways,'' Yakovlev told the NTV television station. ``We
have a tradition of burying the dead in the earth.''
	   He said his appeal was inspired by the July 17 burial of the
remains of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his family _ and
what he called a resounding silence on the question of Lenin's
burial following that event.
	   Lenin authorized Nicholas' execution in 1918. The Soviet
leader's embalmed remains, on display in Red Square, still draw
Communist pilgrims.
	   The communist revolution spearheaded by Lenin brought
``innumerable victims and inestimable suffering,'' Yakovlev said,
adding that the societal and political split in Russia personified
by Lenin could only bring the country further trouble.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Organizers annulled Wednesday's
stage of the Tour de France after angry riders either dropped out
or slowed down the race to protest the ongoing drug investigation
rocking the cycling classic.
	   The riders ended the day's stage holding hands as they crossed
the finish line of the 17th stage, with the Dutch team TVM leading
the pack.
	   Tour officials then annulled the leg that ended more than two
hours later than scheduled.

Spanish teenager nabbed over e-mail bomb threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A teenager sent officials an e-mail
threatening to blow up his town's library unless they paid him 25
million pesetas (170,000 dollars), police said Wednesday.
	   The 15-year-old boy was traced to his e-mail address at a
computer sciences school and arrested after making the threat in
the town of Vic, about 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of Barcelona,
a police spokesman said.
	   The message to town hall on Tuesday said a bomb would explode in
the library unless the money was placed near a trash can in the
downtown area.
	   There was no bomb. ``All indications are that it was just a
prank,'' the spokesman said.
	   The boy was released to the custody of his parents. A juvenile
court will decide whether to press charges against the boy, whose
name was not released.

Villages in flames: Serbs roust Albanian rebels -- and civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Everyone is gone.
	   The cafe loungers, vegetable vendors, cigarette peddlers and
their towers of cartons, the doctors and patients in the hospital
down the dusty road: by Wednesday, all had fled the Serb police
blistering of Albanian rebels who just days ago controlled this
town as a headquarters.
	   The vacancy and silence of Malisevo were stark evidence of how
Serb forces fighting to keep control of Kosovo province have wiped
the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from strategic towns and
roads in recent days.
	   Malisevo (Mal-ee-SHAVE-o) is just part of the picture. The smell
of charcoal filled the air Wednesday from smoldering Albanian
villages along 60 kilometers (37 miles) of road, and fresh flames
leaping from rooftops late in the day indicated a burning operation
was still underway.
	   Ethnic Albanian civilians fleeing the recent fighting have
swelled a refugee population already estimated at more than 100,000
after five months of fighting. Some KLA rebels apparently fled into
the hills east of Malisevo, where the crack of artillery fire could
be heard from the road.
	   The six-day Serb offensive, which drove the rebels from this
town, followed frustration by American and European diplomats in
convincing the rebels to join moderate Albanian politicians in
peace talks with the Serb-led government.
	   The absence of any Western condemnation of the Serb operation
indicates major powers are not altogether displeased with the KLA
rout.
	   Serbs were vague about how many police took part in the
fighting, saying only ``a sufficient number.'' They claimed no
civilians had been killed.
	   Compared to the burning villages, Malisevo was relatively
undamaged. Serb police said they encountered little resistance, and
the KLA had apparently started retreating as early as Monday.
	   Rebel headquarters -- usually guarded by stern-faced men in
black uniforms -- was empty Wednesday except for sacks of green
peppers, jugs of gasoline and boxes of aid from the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Broken glass covered the sidewalks. A wedding apparel store had
been ransacked, its accounting book open in the street and its
mannequin grotesquely stripped of its arms and its aqua dress.
	   Out on the road between the cities of Pec and Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, cars vibrated from the ruts cut by Serb tanks. KLA
blockades had been bulldozed aside, leaving a mess of sandbags,
bricks and wrecked cars.
	   Red, white and blue Serb flags flew from telephone poles at
empty gas stations. But even as Serb forces claimed victory, they
warned that sections of the road were unsafe from KLA guerrillas
and land mines.
	   In the town of Kijevo, grinning young boys helped police unload
green crates of ammunition and boxes of food for newly established
Serb posts. Under police guard, an Albanian family of five sat in
the beds of two open trucks -- three men in one, women huddling
arm-in-arm in the other.
	   Sacer Krasnici, the father, said his family was feeling its home
village when Serb police stopped their car. Police found a gun --
``just a hobby thing'' Krasnici explained -- and 700 German marks.
	   ``When police shot at us, we ran away (from the village). There
were bombardments, children were crying,'' he said. ``My son ran
with his children but I don't know where he is. I don't know if my
house is burned or anything about the fate of my family.''
	   Serb police said they were not ``mistreating'' their captives,
whose destination was not explained.
	   Down the road a few kilometers (miles), in the village of
Drenovac, an elderly Serb stood in his yard. He was one of the last
of 2,000 people left.
	   ``Every day there's still shooting,'' he said, waiving his arms
to indicate his Albanian neighbors had all fled.
	   In the city of Pec, European Union vehicles stood parked outside
a hotel, part of a diplomatic mission that has been weighing the
damage in Kosovo for about three weeks.
	   On Wednesday, representatives of Austria, Britain and Germany
met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist ways
have put him at odds with the bellicose KLA.
	   Back on the road to Pristina, a tractor pulled a flatbed with 11
Albanian refugees, their faces smudged with dirt and the elderly
women wearing head scarves.
	   They were headed for their relatives in a village near the
capital. ``Right now, they're shooting in the hills above my
house,'' said Mehmed Isufi.
	   The tractor puttered down the road. Going the other way were two
buses packed with Serb police, headed for Malisevo in an apparent
move to repopulate the town as a Serb stronghold.

El Guerrouj misses record in mile, Bailey wins 100

 &UR; Eds: Updates with 100, CORREECTS official mile time to 3:49.01 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Hicham El Guerrouj had his poorest performance of
the season and missed the world record by nearly five seconds in
the mile Wednesday at the Gaz de France international meet.
	   The Moroccan, who had been hoping for a world mark, did 3
minutes, 49.01 seconds, well off Noureddine Morceli's three-year
old mark of 3:44.39. El Guerrouj ran 3:44.60 July 16 in Nice.
	   In a men's 100 that featured the top performers of the past two
seasons, world recordholder and Olympic champion Donovan Bailey won
in 10.02. Ato Boldon was second in 10.10 followed by Frankie
Fredericks, 10.11. Greene, never in the race, was eighth and last
in 10.39.
	   It was the first meeting for Bailey, Greene and Boldon since an
ill-will 100 in the Goodwill Games.
	   Greene won there in 9.96, running into a wind, edging Boldon.
What angered Greene was Bailey's matter of not racing when Bailey
saw he was beaten.
	   This time it was Greene seeming to cut his effort when he was
well back.
	   Bailey took the victory with pleasure, striding around the track
in a manner reminiscent of his victory in the Olympic 100 in
Atlanta in 1996.
	   El Guerrouj, the indoor and outdoor world champion, has been the
top middle distance runner this season. On July 14 he broke
Morceli's 1,500-meter mark by 1.37 seconds with 3:26.00. Two days
later he missed the mile record by .21 seconds.
	   Three days later he missed Morceli's 2,000 mark of 4:47.88 by
less than a half second at a meet in Gateshead, England.
	   But Wednesday he was never in the chase for the record. Although
Kenyan Robert Kibet had a fast pace of 53.55 and 1:50.32, El
Guerrouj was trailing and not looking as if he could accelerate.
	   By 1,200 meters, with El Guerrouj passing in 2:50, the record
seemed out of reached. Even more when El Guerrouj barely broke 59
seconds for the final lap.
	   In other events, Marion Jones set a meet record of 10.88 in the
women's 100, the 12th time she has been under 11.00 this year. She
held off the rising French star Christine Aaron, second in 10.98.
	   It was far from Jones' best of the season. She did 10.71 earlier
in the season.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Wendell Alexis described it as playing
before an intimate crowd of family and friends.
	   You could hear many of the baskets swish from 20 rows back
Wednesday, and the clangers rang out in every corner of the nearly
empty 18,000-seat Olympic stadium.
	   This is the 13th World Basketball Championship, and it's a good
thing there are countless signs hung to point it out.
	   ``Now that we're here, there still seems to be a little
uncertainty _ on your part, but not on ours'' said Alexis, one of
the no-name NBA stand-ins who led the Americans with 13 points in
an 83-59 opening-round victory Wednesday over Brazil.
	   Under different conditions _ had there been no NBA lockout _
opening day would have been a sellout at this site and 14,000-seat
Peace and Friendship stadium.
	   Instead, the Americans played before about 500 in Europe's most
basketball-mad country. Fortunately for battered Greek organizers _
bracing for a modest loss after hoping for profits of about dlrs l
million _ attendance at cross-town Peace and Freedom was a
respectable 10,000 drawn to watch Greece play its opener.
	   ``We have our family and friends out there rooting for us and
really that's the only thing we're concerned about,'' said Alexis,
who turns 34 Friday and has kicked around at least three European
leagues in the last dozen years after being a star at Syracuse in
the mid 1980s.
	   ``This is the start of the trek we want to have,'' added the
6-10 (2.06 meter) forward, the gray flecks around his temple and in
his two-day beard showing his mileage.
	   ``We know we don't have any dominant players, players who will
take over a game. Every night it's going to be somebody
different.''
	   In the opener, it was almost everybody. Eleven of 12 scored with
Brad Miller and Michael Hawkins joining Alexis in double figures
with 12 apiece.
	   The Americans won with pressure defense, scored off an up-tempo
offense as they forced Brazil into frequent turnovers, and overcame
early jitters after slipping five behind after 10 minutes.
	   Nobody said replacing NBA stars would be easy. In their absence,
the tournament is wide-open with seven or eight teams condending.
	   ``We were definitley anxious at the start,'' said Hawkins, who
has played in the NBA, CBA, and most recently in Greece for
Olympiakos.
	   ``I guess I should feel a little more comfortable here in
Greece, maybe more than some of the other guys. But not right away
I wasn't,'' added Hawkins, whose 10 assists were a record for a
U.S. player in the championship.
	   ``If it was bad shots, I'd worry. But we were taking great shots
and just missing them,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We
just had to knock the dust off, break the seal. Then our defense
really helped us get some easy baskets.''
	   ``What you saw tonight was a team that's 12 deep. That's going
to be our strength.''
	   Actually, 13 deep.
	   Duke's Trajan Langdon, a late roster replacement to fill out the
12-man team, was added to replace Big Ten Player of the Year Mateen
Cleaves (twisted ankle).
	   He sparked the U.S. with two 3-pointers late in the first half
after they trailed by five early, but recovered to lead 40-32 at
halftime.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday, Miroslav Beric's 23 points paced European
champion Yugoslavia's 80-66 defeat of Puerto Rico.
	   Lithuania and Russia, two countries that used to supply players
for the Soviet juggernaut, both enjoyed blowout victories.
	   Darius Lukminus scored 20 points and Arturas Karnishovas added
19 as Lithuania beat South Korea 97-56. Russia had five players in
double figures in its 83-58 win over Japan.
	   Spain beat Nigeria 80-68 with 14 points each from Alfonso Reyes
and Julio Ignacio Rodilla. Nigeria, supported by raucous, chanting
and drum-pounding fans, was led by Mohammed Acha's 23 points. Italy
got past Senegal 76-66 without star guard Carlton Myers, who was
sidelined by a sore throat and fever.
	   With the NBA lockout in place, only one player from the league _
Australia's Chris Anstey _ is participating in the tournament.

Iran arrests journalist for publishing letter critical of Khomenei
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Security forces have arrested the managing
director of a newspaper that printed a letter in which an anonymous
young woman criticized the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
official Iranian news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, managing director of the Khaneh newspaper,
was arrested for publishing ``material insulting the Islamic
sanctities and the late Imam Khomeini,'' the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   It did not say when the journalist was arrested.
	   Criticism of Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has
been taboo in Iran.
	   The agency said Za'eri will face trial on Aug. 3.
	   In her letter to the newspaper, the woman wrote: ``When I think
of Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of
the midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   Khomeini led Iran during the 1980-88 war with Iraq.

Break Sabbath for emergencies, rabbi tells Canada's Orthodox Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Keep the Sabbath holy _ except in an emergency.
	   That's the word Orthodox Jews are getting from their leaders and
police, after a spate of burglaries between sundown Friday and
sundown Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
	   Whoever is behind the break-ins has relied on the belief that
Orthodox Jews observing the Sabbath laws may not use telephones.
But Rabbi Yoel Wenger said the Sabbath may be broken to report
emergencies.
	   Wenger said most Orthodox Jews know they can set off an alarm if
they think a home has been broken into.
	   ``Any prowler that occupies your home is a threat to life. In
that case you can call 911,'' he said.

Brazil sells state-run telecommunications giant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of auction, comment, sale of cell phone
companies. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo RIO101
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil on Wednesday sold off its
controlling stake in the state-run telecommunications holding
company, Telebras, in what was billed as the largest privatization
in Latin America.
	   Telebras' 12 subsidiaries _ three fixed-line companies, eight
cellular companies and a long distance carrier _ were sold for a
total 22 billion, reals (dlrs 19 billion), or 64.74 percent more
than the government-set minimum of 13.5 billion reals (dlrs 11.7
billion).
	   The highlight of the four-hour bidding process, was a showdown
between American telecommunications giants MCI and Sprint for
control of long distance carrier Embratel.
	   Government regulations forced the two companies into live
bidding after the sealed-envelope auction revealed only a 5 percent
difference between their respective bids.
	   MCI first offered 2.47 billion reals (dlrs 2.13 billion), while
Sprint came up with an offer of 2.49 billion reals (dlrs 2.15
billion).
	   After a tense 10-minute bidding showdown, MCI emerged the winner
with an offer of 2.65 billion reals (dlrs 2.28 billion).
	   ``MCI believes Embratel is the jewel in the Telebras
telecommunications crown,'' said Jerry Di Martino, a company senior
vice president. He said MCI planned to operate the long distance
carrier alone, but would consider future partnerships.
	   Outside the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchanges, where the auction
was held, police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of
demonstrators protesting the privatization.
	   The opponents, who claimed Telebras was being sold too cheaply,
failed in their efforts to block the sale in the courts.
	   Also considered one of the jewels of the Telebras system, the
Sao Paulo state fixed line service, Telebras was bought by Spain's
Telefonica SA for 5.78 billion reals (dlrs 4.98 billion), or 64
percent more than the minimum bid price of 3.52 billion reals (dlrs
3.03 billion).
	   Two other fixed line companies, covering the rest of the
country, were sold for a total of 5.5 billion reals (dlrs 4.7
billion). The minimum price was 5.35 billion reals (dlrs 4.61
billion).
	   The eight cellular companies went for a total of 8.05 billion
reals (dlrs 6.9 billion), far more than the minimum of 3.02 billion
reals (dlrs 2.6 billion).
	   ``It is an historic moment for this country. I think people are
going to get phones now,'' said Celso de Barros of the Salomon
Brothers Investment Bank, which advised the government on the sale.
	   There are 20 million people in Brazil waiting for phones lines
they paid as much as 970 reals (dlrs 836) to be installed.
	   The average wait for a legally purchased line, when available,
is about two years. The shortage of lines has created an enormous
black market, with prices listed in the newspapers like stock
market quotes.
	   The government has set performance goals for the new companies
to meet to ensure service improves.
	   The new companies will have to create 33 million new fixed phone
lines by 2007 and these phones will have be installed within a week
of purchase by 2005.
	   To ensure prices remain low, the government will also sell off
concessions creating new phone companies that will compete with the
Telebras spinoffs.
	   Analysts have said that improved telecommunications will help
attract new investors who have been kept at bay because of the
country's poor telecommunications system.
	   In this country of 160 million, which has world's worst
distribution of wealth the distribution of telephones is equally
skewed: 16 percent of the richest Brazilians have 81 percent of the
lines, while 57 percent of the poorest have only two percent of the
lines.
	   Only half of Brazil's commercial enterprises have any phones at
all.
	   ``We got it done. We got it at a great price that went beyond
our expectations,'' said Barros of Salomon Brothers at the end of
the auction. ``It has helped set Brazil apart from other emerging
markets, showing that we are moving forward. It will change the
world's perception of Brazil.'''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia failed Wednesday to persuade the
Security Council to scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq, after
the United States said this would unjustly reward Iraq for
continued noncompliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Acknowledging a scaleback couldn't be achieved now, Russia
instead sought to acknowledge Baghdad's previous progress and set
the stage for a future reduction in inspections to less intrusive
monitoring and verification visits.
	   The United States strongly objected to any such recognition _ in
the form of a resolution or presidential statement _ and the
council adjourned for the day without taking any formal action on
the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``We would oppose any statement or resolution because we don't
think Iraq needs to be rewarded for inaction, for noncooperation,''
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   Washington successfully blocked an effort this spring by Russia,
France and China to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to the
passive monitoring and verification visits after the last IAEA
report was released in April.
	   That report, and the one being considered Wednesday, said U.N.
inspectors had found no evidence that Baghdad was trying to
maintain its nuclear program but said they also couldn't certify
that no such evidence existed.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering
the Gulf War.
	   While the Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections,
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission handles the missile,
chemical and biological inspections.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said he was disappointed that
the council couldn't agree on a scaleback considering the IAEA
report signaled that all remaining questions about Iraq's nuclear
abilities ``could be handled easily and entirely'' by the
monitoring program.
	   He circulated a draft resolution and presidential statement that
would acknowledge that there was no evidence Baghdad is trying to
maintain its nuclear weapons program. The statement also
acknowledges previous progress and registers movement towards the
eventual shifting of nuclear inspections into monitoring.
	   ``This leaves the thorny and controversial issue of ongoing
monitoring for a later stage,'' Lavrov said. He said he hoped the
council would take up his proposals soon.
	   Richardson said both were unacceptable because Iraq had made no
progress in giving U.N. inspectors information about weapons
design, uranium enrichment and nuclear exports.
	   ``There is absolutely no progress. And if there is no progress,
there is no closure on the nuclear file,'' he said.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Wednesday the council
should move immediately to shift the IAEA's focus to monitoring and
verification visits.
	   ``The IAEA has admitted in past reports, and also in Wednesday's
report, that there is no prohibited activities in Iraq.''
	   He said there was no point in delaying the scaleback until the
next IAEA report, which is due in October, when all sanctions are
up for review.
	   The United States and Britain, which traditionally have taken
the hardest line against the lifting of sanctions, were expected to
again come under pressure to agree to a scaleback. The other
permanent council members Russia, France and China have generally
been more sympathetic to the Iraqi cause, and China on Wednesday
backed Russia's proposal.

Argentina's Caniggia looking to leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ First Argentina's Claudio
Caniggia was passed over by national team coach Daniel Passarella.
Now he wants to leave his Argentine club Boca Juniors, but they are
reluctant to release him.
	   After Passarella chose not to include Caniggia, who starred
along side Diego Maradona in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, the
31-year-old striker decided it was time to leave Argentina.
	   ``I decided there were no way I could continue with Boca,''
Caniggia told Buenos Aires daily Clarin Wednesday.
	   To release him, Boca wants dlrs 750,000, a price Cannigia
considers too much for a player his age. Not to mention, too
expensive for the smaller European clubs that have expressed
interest in him.
	   Plagued by drug and contractual problems over the last few
years, Cannigia appeared to be returning to his old form with Boca
Juniors in the months leading up to the World Cup.
	   Caniggia, who onced played in Italy and Portugal, had hoped a
successful World Cup would help him return to a competitive
European club.
	   With few World Cup roster spots remaining, Caniggia began a
frantic public relations campaign to be added to the team. But
Passarella never called.

UN chief: methods of prevention key to conflict solving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After a two-day meeting with world leaders
on improving U.N. cooperation with regional groups,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that developing methods
of prevention is crucial to dealing with world conflicts.
	   ``There was wide recognition of the critical need to develop a
culture of prevention and specific forms of action and
interaction,'' he said after the conference which stressed the need
for coordinated, preventive action.
	   Annan said there was a consensus that ``practical follow-up''
should follow the meeting that included the European Union, the
Organization of Islamic Conference and the Organization of American
States.
	   Annan said he recommended more frequent consultations, better
information and staff exchanges after meeting with regional groups.
	   The conference came amid an announcement that for the first
time, the number of U.N. civilian personnel killed has outstripped
the number of U.N. soldiers slain during the world organization's
military operations.
	   Seventeen U.N. civilians have been killed so far this year _ the
same number killed during all of 1997. At the same time, 13 U.N.
soldiers have been killed since January, compared with 44 over all
of last year.
	   Annan has called for a review of the security of U.N. personnel.
	   In response to a reporter's question about staff security, he
also acknowledged that there may come a time when the United
Nations will refuse to send civilian staff to a conflict area
because of high safety risks.
	   ``Not only should we say `it's too dangerous, we are not going,'
but we should be able to say `it's become too dangerous for us
operate and to be effective' or `it's become too dangerous for us
to risk that many staff, and it is not worth the effort,''' he
said.

Women's bypass risk greater than for men
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Women are significantly more likely to die
after heart bypass surgery than men even if the men are just as old
and sick when they go under the knife, says a massive study
released Wednesday.
	   Concluding for the first time that gender alone is a risk _ not
just that women are in worse health by the time they reach surgery
_ doctors now must figure out why.
	   ``I don't know the answer and I don't think anyone does,'' said
study author Dr. Fred Edwards, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the
University of Florida who is preparing to research just what kills
these women so that perhaps it can be prevented.
	   The risk of death from bypass surgery within days after the
operation is very low for both men and women, so the study
shouldn't scare anyone away from what often is a lifesaving
operation, stressed Dr. Sidney Smith, past president of the
American Heart Association.
	   But the fact that women fare worse is a disturbing finding that
must be explored quickly, Smith said. Bypass surgery may not be the
only problem: Doctors are finding early signs that women also do
more poorly after angioplasties, in which a balloon clears clogged
arteries, he added.
	   ``The next step is very much to understand whether the cause of
death is different, because that could hold the clue as to why it's
occurring,'' said Smith.
	   Women's survival of heart bypasses has long been a thorny issue.
Some studies indicate they do as well as men; others conclude women
are twice as likely to die because they're older and sicker than
the average male patient by the time they have surgery.
	   To clear the confusion, Edwards tapped the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons' national database for the medical records of 344,000
patients _ 97,000 of them women _ who had heart bypasses between
1994 and 1996.
	   Some 4.5 percent of the women died after surgery compared with
2.6 percent of the men, Edwards reported Wednesday in The Annals of
Thoracic Surgery.
	   Overall, the women were older, had a higher incidence of
diabetes, high blood pressure and other complicating illnesses.
	   But unlike previous research, the database was big enough so
that Edwards could test whether any of those risks explained
women's vulnerability. When he compared men and women with
identical risk factors, more women died each time, sometimes twice
as often as men.

<SLUG> Large earthquake recorded in western Indonesia,0160 </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   RESTON, Virginia (AP) _ A magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred
early Thursday in extreme western Indonesia, 200 miles (320
kilometers) from an earthquake that caused a devastating tsunami a
week ago, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
	   The survey's seismographs in Golden, Colorado., placed the
earthquake's epicenter 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Jaya Pura
on the Indonesian island Irian Jaya. It struck about 3 a.m. local
time, or 1800 GMT, said USGS spokeswoman Marion Fisher.
	   The quake was 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of a magnitude 7.1
earthquake on July 17, which generated a tsunami in Sissano, Papua
New Guinea, that killed at least 1,600 people and caused extensive
damage.
	   Fisher said she had no report of damage or casualties from
Thursday's earthquake but said it had the potential to cause damage
due to its location and size.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Everyone is gone.
	   The cafe loungers, vegetable vendors, cigarette peddlers and
their towers of cartons, the doctors and patients in the hospital
down the dusty road _ by Wednesday, all had fled the Serb police
blistering of ethnic Albanian rebels who just days ago controlled
this town as a headquarters.
	   The vacancy and silence of Malisevo were stark evidence of how
Serb forces fighting to keep control of the Serbian province of
Kosovo have wiped the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from
strategic towns and roads in recent days.
	   Malisevo (Mal-ee-SHAVE-o) is just part of the picture. The smell
of charcoal filled the air Wednesday from smoldering Albanian
villages along about 35 miles (55 kilometers) of road, and new
flames leaping from rooftops indicated a burning operation was
still under way.
	   Ethnic Albanian civilians fleeing the recent fighting have
swelled a refugee population already estimated at more than 100,000
after five months of fighting. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent
of Kosovo's population.
	   Some KLA rebels apparently fled into the hills east of Malisevo,
where the crack of artillery fire could be heard from the road.
	   The six-day Serb offensive that drove the rebels from this town
came as American and European diplomats grew increasingly
frustrated in their efforts to convince the rebels to join Kosovo's
moderate ethnic Albanian politicians in peace talks with the
Serb-led government.
	   The absence of any Western condemnation of the Serb operation
indicates major powers are not altogether displeased with the rout
of the KLA.
	   Serbs were vague about how many police took part in the
fighting, saying only ``a sufficient number.'' They claimed no
civilians had been killed.
	   Compared to the burning villages, Malisevo was relatively
undamaged. Serb police said they encountered little resistance, and
the KLA had apparently started retreating as early as Monday.
	   Rebel headquarters _ usually guarded by stern-faced men in black
uniforms _ was empty Wednesday except for sacks of green peppers,
jugs of gasoline and boxes of aid from the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
	   Broken glass covered the sidewalks. A wedding apparel store had
been ransacked, its accounting book open in the street and its
mannequin grotesquely stripped of its arms and its aqua dress.
	   On the road between the cities of Pec and Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, cars vibrated from the ruts cut by Serb tanks. KLA
blockades had been bulldozed aside, leaving a mess of sandbags,
bricks and wrecked cars.
	   Red-white-and-blue Serb flags flew from telephone poles at empty
gas stations. But even as Serb forces claimed victory, they warned
that sections of the road were unsafe because of KLA guerrillas and
land mines.
	   In the town of Kijevo, grinning young boys helped police unload
green crates of ammunition and boxes of food for newly established
Serb posts. Under police guard, an Albanian family of five sat in
the beds of two open trucks _ three men in one, women huddling
arm-in-arm in the other.
	   Sacer Krasniqi, the father, said his family was fleeing their
village when Serb police stopped their car. Police found a gun _
``just a hobby thing,'' Krasniqi said _ and 700 German marks.
	   ``When police shot at us, we ran away (from the village). There
were bombardments, children were crying,'' he said. ``My son ran
with his children but I don't know where he is. I don't know if my
house is burned or anything about the fate of my family.''
	   Serb police said they were not mistreating their captives, whose
destination was not given.
	   Down the road a few miles (kilometers), in Drenovac, an elderly
Serb stood in his yard. He was one of the last left in a village
once home to 2,000 people.
	   ``Every day there's still shooting,'' he said.
	   In Pec, European Union vehicles stood parked outside a hotel,
part of a diplomatic mission that has been reviewing the damage in
Kosovo for about three weeks.
	   On Wednesday, representatives of Austria, Britain and Germany
met with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist ways
have put him at odds with the bellicose KLA.
	   Back on the road to Pristina, a tractor pulled a flatbed with 11
Albanian refugees, their faces smudged with dirt and the elderly
women wearing head scarves.
	   They were headed for their relatives in a village near Pristina.
``Right now, they're shooting in the hills above my house,'' said
Mehmed Isufi.
	   The tractor puttered down the road. Going the other way were two
buses packed with Serb police, headed for Malisevo in an apparent
move to repopulate the town as a Serb stronghold.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A medical panel investigating the
decision to allow Brazil's star forward Ronaldo to play in the
World Cup final hours after suffering convulsions will make a
preliminary report in about three weeks, the panel announced
Wednesday.
	   The Regional Council of Medicine in the state of Rio de Janeiro
opened a preliminary inquiry into the decision of physicians Lidio
Toledo and Joaquim da Matta to allow Ronaldo to play in the World
Cup final on July 12 hours after suffering some kind of attack.
	   The results of the inquiry are subject to an ongoing debate here
as Brazilians continue to look for an explanation for their 3-0
loss to France in the World Cup final.
	   Toledo and da Matta allowed Ronaldo to play after he suffered
some kind of attack just hours before the game started. The exact
nature of what happened to Ronaldo was never made clear.
	   ``It won't be until the middle of August that we have something
new,'' the press office of the Regional Council of Medicine
announced.
	   The panel could uphold the decision to allow Ronaldo to play or
it could call for further investigations that could lead to
sanctions.

	   RESTON, Virginia (AP) _ A magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred
early Thursday in extreme western Indonesia, 200 miles (320
kilometers) from an earthquake that caused a devastating tsunami a
week ago, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
	   The survey's seismographs in Golden, Colorado., placed the
earthquake's epicenter 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Jaya Pura
on the Indonesian island Irian Jaya. It struck about 3 a.m. local
time, or 1800 GMT, said USGS spokeswoman Marion Fisher.
	   The quake was 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of a magnitude 7.1
earthquake on July 17, which generated a tsunami in Sissano, Papua
New Guinea, that killed at least 1,600 people and caused extensive
damage.
	   Fisher said she had no report of damage or casualties from
Thursday's earthquake but said it had the potential to cause damage
due to its location and size.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Celtic cruised into the second qualifying
round of the European Champions Cup Wednesday after a 2-0 victory
at St. Patrick's Athletic.
	   Held 0-0 at home and jeered off the field by its fans in
Glasgow, the Scottish titlist had no problems in Dublin and looked
a different class against the semi-pros of St. Patrick's.
	   Norwegian forward Harald Brattback gave Celtic a 12th minute
lead and Swedish international Henrik Larsson added the second 18
minutes from the end.
	   Brattbakk was put into space on the right by Alan Stubbs, and
the Norwegian cut inside defender Colin Hawkins to shoot the first.
	   Stubbs backheeled against the post in the 60th but the Scottish
champion made sure of victory in the 72nd when Larsson ran round a
defender and the advancing 'keeper to collect a long ball from Regi
Blinker and roll the ball into an empty net,

Third-seed Kucera, Puerta advance to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Third-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia
advanced to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 400,000 Croatia Open
tennis tournament, ousting the world's No. 391, Slovene Borut Urh.
	   The result was 7-5, 6-2.
	   In the quarterfinals on Friday, Kucera meets sixth-seeded Magnus
Norman of Sweden, who defeated Stefano Cobolli of Italy, 7-6 (7-5),
3-6, 6-2.
	   In another second-round clash, Mariano Puerta of Argentina also
advanced, defeating Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
	   In the quarterfinals, Puerta faces fourth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil, who ousted Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic, 4-6, 7-6
(7-1), 6-3.
	   For Kucera, the ATP's No. 11 and a finalist in last week's
tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, it wasn't a walkover against Urh.
	   In the first set, Urh even led 4-2. Kucera broke his service and
then went on winning up to 5-4. He then served for the set, but Urh
broke back. When Urh served for the set, Kucera broke back again
and used his advantage to win the set.
	   Urh started with a 2-1 lead in the second set, but then he lost
five games in a row.
	   Norman also faced a tough opponent in qualifier Cobolli. In the
first set, Norman served for the set at 5-4, failed, and Cobolli
forced him into a tie-break. Cobolli then won the second set, but
had no chance in the third.
	   Kuerten also had troubles with Novak, who won the first set and
led the second to a tie-break, but Kuerten struggled to win.
	   Puerta, ranked 95th on the ATP list, made his way to the second
ATP quarterfinals in his carrier.
	   Puerta was ahead 5-3 in the first set and had a set point. But
Sanchez broke his serve and made it to 5-4, yet lost the set.
	   Sanchez then won the second set and had a chance to win the
match when he was leading 4-3 up with his serve in the third set.
But he failed to grab that chance.

Lawmakers vote against Netanyahu, Labor stumbles
</HEADLINE>

against the government in graf 6; CHANGES byline &QL;

 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Lawmakers handed Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a stinging rebuke Wednesday over his peace policies,
giving lopsided preliminary approval to a measure aimed at bringing
about early elections.
	   But the setback for the prime minister was all but overshadowed
by a larger one for the opposition: racially tinged remarks by one
of its lawmakers drew angry reaction from Jews of Sephardic, or
Middle Eastern descent, and badly damaged the Labor party's chances
for returning to government.
	   In an interview with the Haaretz daily Wednesday, Ori Orr said
that Sephardic Jews _ who suffered discrimination after arriving in
the 1950s at the hands of the ruling Ashkenazi, or
European-descended elite _ use past injustices in order to advance
unfairly.
	   ``I have the feeling that people of Sephardic descent want to
hold onto their feelings of ethnic frustration ... so they can
exploit them for political gain,'' Orr said.
	   Orr, an ex-army general of Ashkenazi descent also touched on
negative stereotypes when he suggested that Sephardic Israelis,
including members of his own party, were ``problematic,'' and
backwards. ``High caliber individuals ... have not emerged from
among them.''
	   Wednesday's parliament session should have been a victory for
Labor, which successfully mustered up enough support for an
important vote against Netanyahu. Even eight disgruntled members of
Netanyahu's own coalition broke ranks to join the opposition.
	   But Orr's comments, which he later apologized for, became the
focal point in the house, with members of his own party calling for
his dismissal.
	   Israel's Jewish population is roughly split among Sephardic and
Ashkenazi Jews, with the Sephardic community traditionally voting
for Netanyahu's Likud. But Labor has been trying to win over some
of that support in order to return to power in the 2000 elections.
	   Last year, Labor leader Ehud Barak apologized to Sephardic Jews
for the ill treatment they received under his predecessors, who ran
government when they first immigrated. Wednesday, Barak suspended
Orr from representing the party on an upcoming trip to the United
States.
	   In spite of the furor against Labor, its bill to dissolve
parliament passed 60-6.
	   However, the bill still has to go through a committee plus three
more voting rounds in parliament.
	   Even though it had no practical results, Wednesday's vote was a
bellwether of sentiment on Netanyahu's handling of negotiations
with the Palestinians.
	   Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down 16 months ago.
Negotiators trying to restart the talks meet again Thursday.
	   The prime minister has been under pressure to accept an American
peace initiative calling for an Israeli withdrawal from another 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   But Netanyahu, who has survived numerous no-confidence motions
in the past two years, seemed unfazed by the vote.
	   Also Wednesday, Jerusalem's mayor denied that a widely
criticized plan to give the city control over Jewish West Bank
settlements surrounding the capital was a step toward annexing the
areas.
	   But Mayor Ehud Olmert acknowledged that eventually annexing the
settlements and keeping all of Jerusalem part of Israel was still
one of the country's priorities. The Palestinians hope to establish
a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with its capital in east
Jerusalem.

Mexico's TV giant Televisa investigated for alleged soccer
</HEADLINE>
monopoly &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An antitrust commission has opened an
investigation into a contract signed by the Mexican Soccer
Federation giving exclusive television coverage rights to media
giant Televisa.
	   A decision Saturday by the Federal Competition Commission, made
public on Wednesday, ordered both Televisa and the federation not
to implement the contract until the investigation is completed.
	   The commission acted on a complaint by Televisa's archrival,
Television Azteca, Mexico's No. 2 network.
	   Soccer coverage has been part of a broader battle for supremacy
between the networks since Azteca was created in the early 1990s
with the privatization of a stodgy state broadcast operation.
	   Both Televisa and Azteca spokespersons were not available for
comment on the commission's decision.
	   Federation spokesman Ricardo Saenz Martinez dismissed questions,
saying: ``Ask Televisa, they signed the contract.''
	   For decades, Televisa _ the biggest media conglomerate in the
Spanish-speaking world _ dominated broadcasting in Mexico, not only
in entertainment and news but in sports coverage. It also has
traditionally wielded strong influence on the federation's board,
made up of the 15 presidents of first division teams.
	   On July 16, the federation board signed an agreement renewing a
1994 contract giving Televisa exclusive right to coverage of
Mexico's national selection for another four years.
	   In a statement, the federation claimed that no one else had
applied for coverage rights.
	   Not so, Azteca officials said Saturday. They displayed copies of
letters dated Feb. 25 and March 3 asking to purchase rights.
	   Azteca officials claimed they never got an answer and filed a
complaint with the commission. They say they also plan to sue both
the federation's board and its individual members for violation of
antitrust laws.

<TEXT>
	   CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
charged Wednesday that Israel's Jerusalem policy risks inflaming
the region and destroying the peace process.
	   Arafat, speaking at the start of a two-day meeting by the
Organization of the Islamic Conference's Al Qods (Jerusalem)
Committee, accused Israel of ``the expulsion and ethnic cleansing
of Palestinians'' in Jerusalem and the ``changing of the city's
Arab-Muslim identity.''
	   ``Israel is leading the big and final battle for Judaization,''
Arafat said at the start of the meeting, the 17th since the group
was formed in 1979.
	   ``It will lead unavoidably to the total destruction of the peace
process and will inflame the region,'' Arafat said.
	   Officials and delegations from 16 nations were attending the
session, hoping to voice a clear warning to Israel and find ways to
oppose Israel's Jerusalem policy.
	   There were suggestions here that another objective was to
present a united viewpoint to encourage the United States to bring
more pressure to bear on Israel.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state, and Israel's
decision in June to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to West
Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians. They accuse
Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian accords by unilaterally
making decisions on Jerusalem's future.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of suburbs inside Israel to ensure the Jewish
majority of 70 percent in Jerusalem, where Palestinians hope to set
up the capital of a future state.
	   ``Israel wants to turn east Jerusalem into a small Arab quarter
inside a large Jewish town,'' said Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Chareh, shortly before the session began.
	   ``The city of Jerusalem isn't just a Palestinian city. It is the
city for all Muslims in the world,'' said Faycal Husseini, in
charge of the Jerusalem issue for the Palestinian Authority. He
suggested that the coming weeks would be ``decisive.''
	   In his opening speech, Morocco's King Hassan II, who heads the
Al Qods Committee, proposed a ``political communique'' with a
muscled tone.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, after arriving from Paris
where he discussed a French-Egyptian initiative to hold an
international conference on the peace process, said the session
``must give a clear message to Israel.''
	   He lamented that there are ``no serious negotiations between
Arabs and Israel'' at the moment.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from 13
percent more of the West Bank as a way to revive talks that have
been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish
housing unit in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Israel has far
refused.
	   The Jerusalem Committee is made up of Morocco, Saudi Arabia,
Palestine, Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, Niger, Guinea, Indonesia,
Irak, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Senegal and Syria.

Laver in serious condition after stroke
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Laver still in serious condition on Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver, the only tennis player to win two
Grand Slams, remained in serious condition Wednesday, two days
after a stroke that impaired his speech.
	   Laver, who turns 60 on Aug. 9, was in the intensive care unit at
UCLA Medical Center, where he is expected to remain for a week to
10 days.
	   ``He's still having some difficulty speaking. It may be just a
hair better,'' said Dr. Neil Martin, co-director of the hospital's
stroke center. ``There may be a little bit of improvement of the
movement in his right arm, which is encouraging.''
	   The stroke caused Laver to become weak on his right side, but he
is not paralyzed.
	   ``He's going to have a substantial job in front of him as far as
physical therapy,'' Martin said. ``We're talking months of
therapy.''
	   The Australian, who lives in Newport Beach, was stricken Monday
while being interviewed for a television show.
	   Nicknamed ``Rocket'' for his powerful ground strokes, Laver is
the only player to have won two Grand Slams _ the Australian,
French and U.S. championships and Wimbledon _ in one calendar year,
accomplishing the feat as an amateur in 1962 and again seven years
later.
	   He was the world's No. 1 player in 1961, 1962, 1968 and 1969,
and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
1981.
	   Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than career
leader Roy Emerson. Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras have also won 11
Grand Slam events.
	   Laver won Wimbledon four times, the Australian crown three times
and the U.S. and French titles twice each. He also won nine Grand
Slam doubles championships.

Serb battlefield gains may make Kosovo Albanians reconsider
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with four Yugoslav army soldiers reported killed. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance, as they seek to unite their different factions _ a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations.
	   But it was unclear Wednesday if the key element in the Kosovo
equation, the rebel Kosovo Liberation army, would be part of a
unified, self-styled government the top Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, has said will be set up.
	   If the KLA agrees to participate in Rugova's government, this
would be a clear sign that they would also join him in negotiations
with the Serbs.
	   The underground army is fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and the
West. It has so far refused to be associated with any political
faction.
	   Rugova announced earlier Wednesday he had reached a compromise
with other ethnic Albanians on a coalition government, saying it
would include ``all political forces'' and ``create pre-conditions
for a dialogue'' with the Serb-led Yugoslav government.
	   For almost two weeks, the Albanian guerrillas have suffered a
string of bitter defeats across the rebellious province, testifying
to the government forces' superior weaponry and equipment.
	   Rugova's announcement came on the heels of several fresh Serb
victories in an offensive launched Friday night, a development that
may lead the rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Fighting was heaviest on Wednesday in the north-central Drenica
region, where the conflict escalated earlier this year.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported that Serb police
had gained full control of a contested stretch of the Kosovska
Mitrovica-Pec road in that region.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. enovy Christopher Hill met Wednesday for three
hours with KLA members in the village of Likoc in the Drenica
region, where the guerrillas are believed to have their general
staff headquarters, the Kosovo Information Center reported. There
was no word on how the meeting went.
	   Hill was accompanied by several ethnic Albanian political
representatives, including Mehmet Hajrizi, a Pristina-based
activist who, in interviews with American newspapers, had said he
was speaking on behalf of the KLA.
	   Without mentioning Hajrizi by name, an enraged Jakup Krasniqi,
the recently appointed KLA spokesman, told Albanian state TV that
``so-called politicians and military people'' were speaking in
behalf of the KLA in an ``irresponsible way'' about the Serb
offensive.
	   Krazniqi said he was authorized to explain that no political
leader was permitted to speak for the KLA, which was authorizing
Bardhyl Mahmutin, an Albanian living in Geneva, to establish
contact with the outside world.
	   New clashes were also reported in the border region of Djakovica
near the Albanian border, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb forces were shelling from afar villages believed to
be KLA strongholds. No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   Three Yugoslav army officers and a private were killed and a
recruit was wounded in several shootouts along the border with
Albania Monday and Tuesday, an army statement carried by the
government's Tanjug news agency said Wednesday.
	   It said an unspecified number of ``terrorists'' trying to cross
over from Albania were ``liquidated and captured,'' and a
significant amount of weapons was seized from them.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Wendell Alexis said it was like playing
before an intimate crowe of family and friends.
	   You could hear many of the baskets swish from 20 rows back
Wednesday, and the clangers rang out in every corner of the nearly
empty 18,000-seat Olympic stadium.
	   This is the 13th World Basketball Championship, and it's a good
thing there are countless signs hung to point it out.
	   ``Now that we're here, there still seems to be a little
uncertainty _ on your part, but not on ours'' said Alexis, one of
the no-name NBA stand-ins who led the Americans with 13 points in
an 83-59 opening-round victory Wednesday over Brazil.
	   Under different conditions _ had there been no NBA lockout _
opening day would have been a sellout at this site and 14,000-seat
Peace and Friendship stadium.
	   Instead, the Americans played before about 500 in Europe's most
basketball-mad country. Fortunately for battered Greek organizers _
bracing for a modest loss after hoping for profits of about dlrs l
million _ attendance at cross-town Peace and Freedom was a
respectable 10,000 drawn to watch Greece play its opener.
	   ``We have our family and friends out there rooting for us and
really that's the only thing we're concerned about,'' said Alexis,
who turns 34 Friday and has kicked around at least three European
leagues in the last dozen years after being a star at Syracuse in
the mid 1980s.
	   ``This is the start of the trek we want to have,'' added the
6-10 (2.06 meter) forward, the gray flecks around his temple and in
his two-day beard showing his mileage.
	   ``We know we don't have any dominant players, players who will
take over a game. Every night it's going to be somebody
different.''
	   In the opener, it was almost everybody. Eleven of 12 scored with
Brad Miller and Michael Hawkins joining Alexis in double figures
with 12 apiece.
	   The Americans won with pressure defense, scored off an up-tempo
offense as they forced Brazil into frequent turnovers, and overcame
early jitters after slipping five behind after 10 minutes.
	   Nobody said replacing NBA stars would be easy. In their absence,
the tournament is wide-open with seven or eight teams condending.
	   ``We were definitley anxious at the start,'' said Hawkins, who
has played in the NBA, CBA, and most recently in Greece for
Olympiakos.
	   ``I guess I should feel a little more comfortable here in
Greece, maybe more than some of the other guys. But not right away
I wasn't,'' added Hawkins, whose 10 assists were a record for a
U.S. player in the championship.
	   ``If it was bad shots, I'd worry. But we were taking great shots
and just missing them,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We
just had to knock the dust off, break the seal. Then our defense
really helped us get some easy baskets.''
	   ``What you saw tonight was a team that's 12 deep. That's going
to be our strength.''
	   Actually, 13 deep.
	   Duke's Trajan Langdon, a late roster replacement to fill out the
12-man team, was added to replace Big Ten Player of the Year Mateen
Cleaves (twisted ankle).
	   He sparked the U.S. with two 3-pointers late in the first half
after they trailed by five early, but recovered to lead 40-32 at

with five players in double figures.
	   In Group A, Italy got past Senegal 76-66 without star guard
Carlton Myers, who was sidelined by a sore throat and fever. Also
in the group, Greece defeated Canada 78-72 as Fragiskos Alvertis
scored 21 and Nikos Economou 20. Canada was led by Joey Vickery
with 23.
	   In Group D, Spain beat Nigeria 80-68 with 14 points each from
Alfonso Reyes and Julio Ignacio Rodilla. Nigeria, supported by
raucous, chanting and drum-pounding fans, was led by Mohammed
Acha's 23 points. Also in the group, Argentina beat Australia 66-62
as Fabricio Oberto had 19 and Marcelo Nicola 12.
	   With the NBA lockout in place, only one player from the league _

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ten people were killed and 46 were
wounded Wednesday when a truck slammed into a bus at a crossroads
in northern Serbia, the government's Tanjug news agency reported.
	   The accident near the town of Novi Sad, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
northwest of Belgrade, occurred when the the truck did not stop at
a red light and crashed into the commuter bus full of passengers.
	   The truck driver, apparently unhurt, fled the scene but turned
himself in shortly afterward at a police station, Tanjug said.
	   Dragan Todorovic, the Serbian transport minister, said the scene
of the bus practically cut in two by the truck was ``shocking'' and
that aninvestigation was under way.
	   The three most seriously hurt passengers underwent surgery but
were not in life-threatening condition. Another 11 eleven remained
hospitalized while the rest of the wounded were released from the
hospital after being treated for minor injuries.
	   Also on Wednesday, a woman died when her car collided with a
truck, whose driver was wounded in the accident, also near Novi
Sad, Tanjug reported.

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Finnish striker Jonatan Johansson
scored his first two goals in Rangers colors to ensure the Scottish
club gained the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup Wednesday
in a 2-0 victory over Ireland's Shelbourne.
	   Already 5-3 up from the first leg when it trailed 3-0 with 32
minutes to go, Rangers took control of the second game at its Ibrox
Park stadium when Johansson scored after just four minutes.
	   The Finn took a right wing cut back from record signing Andrei
Kanchelskis to put Rangers ahead 6-3 overall.
	   Although Rangers dominated, it didn't add to its total until a
minute from the end when Johansson struck again with a close range
shot after Gabriel Amato's effort had been saved.

A national treasure loses some gloss

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ It's one of the most cherished
sports traditions in France _ waiting at roadside as the Tour de
France cyclists whiz by.
	   That's what people did in Aix-les-Bains on Wednesday, as the
grand cycling race passed through this Alpine town for the 21st
time since it began in 1903.
	   But along with the excitement there was sadness. No one could
ignore the drug scandal that has enveloped this national treasure.
	   ``I admire the riders so much _ they are all champions,'' said
Danielle Thullet, a 75-year-old retired teacher. ``But I must say,
I'm a bit disappointed in them.''
	   Yet she wasn't about to miss the arrival of the riders,
descending from three tough climbing days in the Alps. Neither was
16-year-old Laetitia Gelloz, who spent three hours sitting on a
curb in the hot sun.
	   ``Doping is bad, of course, but I think the media has
exaggerated everything,'' Gelloz said. ``They're going to end up
accusing everybody, including innocent people.''
	   Both fans cheered when the riders finally arrived, unaware the
race had unraveled during the day _ only four days before its
finale on the Champs-Elysees in Paris.
	   The cyclists, angered by police tactics in an investigation that
already has left one team disqualified and subjected five others to
police searches, basically went on strike, forcing organizers to
cancel the stage that began in the morning in Albertville. The
riders coasted through the course, arriving at the finish line two
hours late.
	   Three teams pulled out in protest, including France's top
cyclist, Laurent Jalabert. Riders lashed out at police treatment
that included strip searches, detention and officers searching
through personal affairs in their hotel rooms.
	   While the fans in Aix-les-Bains didn't belittle the seriousness
of the drug charges, many felt the Tour's riders have been unfairly
targeted for an offense many suspect has long been widespread.
	   ``Everybody knows there's doping in cycling,'' said bartender
Eric Guninand. ``Why does it have to be here, in France? Why can't
they do this in Spain or Italy?
	   ``Look at the kids out there,'' he said, pointing to the
children lining the streets. ``It's a great atmosphere. It's sad
that this event has been spoiled.''
	   At about 7:15 p.m., the crowds in front of the train station
finally got what they'd been waiting for. After a long parade of
sponsors' cars, manned by dancing employees handing out drinks,
hats or flags, the whirring of press helicopters came into earshot.
	   Police hurriedly pushed people onto the curb, and the media cars
came tearing around the corner onto President Wilson Boulevard.
Then, suddenly, the riders, all in one pack, shining in their
fluorescent outfits, came dashing through _ not at top speed, but
enough to put a smile on the face of 10-year-old Virginie
Guiaunnet.
	   ``This is my first time _ it was cool!'' she said.
	   One person was already gone when the colorful convoy arrived.
Roger Casile, 88, a retired mapmaker, had put on a suit, grabbed
his walking stick, and taken the train from nearby Chambery for the
arrival. But after two hours at a roadside cafe, he had to catch
the 7 p.m. train back.
	   ``I've seen this race 20 times, and I'll have another chance,''
he said. ``I'll still be around next year, and so will the Tour de
France.''

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Casino team coach taken in by police &QL;

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Organizers annulled Wednesday's
stage of the Tour de France after angry riders either dropped out
or slowed down the race to protest the ongoing drug investigation
rocking the cycling classic.
	   The riders ended the day's stage holding hands as they crossed
the finish line of the 17th stage, with the Dutch team TVM leading
the pack.
	   Tour officials then annulled the leg that ended more than two
hours later than scheduled.
	   Seventeen riders from three teams -- ONCE, Banesto, Riso Scotti
-- dropped out of the leg altogether.
	   The Tour appeared increasingly vulnerable in the face of the
growing police investigation into the use of performance-enhancing
drugs. The Festina team has been expelled, and at least five other
teams have come under suspicion.
	   On Wednesday night, police in nearby Chambery detained Casino
team coach Vincent Lavenu following a search of the team hotel.
Casino was one of at least three teams subjected to searches
Wednesday.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annulled. He
said only the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday.
	   That put French star Laurent Jalabert of ONCE out of the
competition, scheduled to end Sunday in Paris.
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said Bjarne Riis of the Deutsche Telekom team
who won the 1996 Tour.
	   ``What we did today was to save the Tour, save cycling because
it's our life,'' Riis said, referring to the slowdown protest.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the Dutch TVM team, whose members were tested Tuesday night and
their bags searched. ``I have the impression the Tour is finished.
I'm sick.''
	   Police were busy on Wednesday. They descended on team hotels
around the Alpine town of Chambery, including the ONCE team, a day
after testing and searching the Dutch TVM team.
	   Police were seen removing garbage bags full of objects from a
van bearing the ONCE insignia.
	   France 2 television said that Jalabert was among those
questioned.
	   Also searched were the hotels of the Casino team and the La
Francaise des Jeux team.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest before his team simply
dropped out of the go-slow race.

Pak eyes third straight major at du Maurier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Se Ri Pak is chasing history at the du
Maurier Classic, only she's not breaking much of a sweat.
	   Tiny greens and tight fairways lined with huge oak trees at the
Essex Golf and Country Club make it clear the Donald Ross course is
set up for a major championship.
	   To Pak, it is just another course to learn, just another stop on
a tour she has turned into child's play the past month.
	   ``I want to have fun this week because this is the last major of
the year,'' she said. ``I don't want to think about winning.''
	   Everyone else is doing that for her.
	   Pak already made LPGA history by becoming the first player to
win two majors before turning 21 _ the LPGA Championship in May and
the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff four weeks ago.
	   She further separated herself from the rest of the tour by
winning twice more since the Open. One of those was the Jamie Farr
Kroger Classic, where she had the lowest round (61) and lowest
72-hole score (261) in LPGA history.
	   Not bad for a 20-year-old who first picked up a club six years
ago.
	   ``If you're good, you're good,'' Laura Davies said. ``If you're
young and you're good, you're better off, because you're not scared
of anything or anybody. She doesn't care who's name is on the
leaderboard, but everyone else is worried about her.''
	   By winning the du Maurier, Pak could become the first player to
win three straight majors in one year since 1953, when Ben Hogan
won the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open.
	   Those were the only three majors Hogan played that year _ the
PGA Championship was the same week as the British Open.
	   Pak missed the first major, the Dinah Shore, because she had not
won enough money by the last weekend in March to qualify.
	   The only other woman to win all three majors she played was Babe
Zaharias in 1950, when the LPGA only had three majors _ the U.S.
Open, the Titleholders and the Western Open.
	   If Pak understands what is at stake, she doesn't show it.
	   ``I just want to play my game,'' she said. ``I know many things
better now _ first major, second major. I have more confidence in
my game and am more comfortable in this country. I don't have
pressure. I am happy.''
	   There has been plenty of reason to smile. Pak is on her way to
the most successful rookie season since Nancy Lopez won nine
tournaments, including a major, 20 years ago.
	   Lopez remembers the crush of expectations that followed her
during a stretch of five straight wins in 1978. Her refuge was
always on the course. Watching Pak makes her believe the South
Korean can handle the attention.
	   ``Being inside the ropes is like your safety place, where you
can really concentrate on what you're doing. I think Se Ri feels
that,'' Lopez said. ``She is a perfectionist, and she has a lot of
maturity in her game. You can tell she knows what she's doing out
there. She has total confidence in her game.''
	   Pak is accommodating during interviews and signs autographs
after her round. Once she's on the course, she seems to block out
everything around her, rarely showing emotion.
	   ``Sometimes I have a poker face,'' she said.
	   And she has been cashing in with regularity. By winning last
week in Ohio, her third victory in four weeks, Pak regained the
lead on the money list over Annika Sorenstam.
	   Pak and Sorenstam have won the last five tournaments, and
Sorenstam could be the only player with a chance to keep Pak from
winning player of the year.
	   Davies, winless on the LPGA Tour this year, could also be a
factor this week, especially after her eagle-birdie finish that
gave her a six-stroke victory in Sweden last week.
	   ``It really helped my confidence,'' Davies said. ``Instead of
worrying about making the cut, I can think about getting into
contention on Sunday.''
	   If that happens, Davies won't be surprised to see Pak there,
too.

Apartheid hit squad chief describes bomb plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid hit squad chief Eugene
de Kock on Wednesday described how South African police operatives
used Russian explosives to divert attention from their involvement
in two bomb plots.
	   De Kock is seeking amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission for helping to carry out bombings of a church
headquarters and a trade union building in Johannesburg in the late
1980s.
	   The former commander of Vlakplaas, as the unit was known, is on
temporary release from his maximum security cell, where he is
serving two life terms and 212 years in prison for crimes he
committed.
	   He told the panel that the missions to destroy the buildings
were extremely hazardous because the policeman had to carry high
power bombs in densely populated areas.
	   Their discovery would have embarrassed the government.
	   ``It would then be revealed that the security forces had turned
to state-sanctioned terrorism,'' De Kock said.
	   There were no deaths but several injuries in the bomb blasts.
	   By using Russian explosives, the plotters made it appear that
anti-apartheid activists _ who received backing from some communist
governments _ had stored them in the buildings.
	   The apartheid government, voted out of power in 1994 in the
country's first all-race elections, was anti-communist.
	   Last week, the panel heard how former President P.W. Botha
directly ordered the Khotso House bombing. Botha has denied being
involved.
	   The panel, whose mandate to investigate apartheid-era human
rights abuses expires on Friday, will continue to consider amnesty
applications. Applicants must prove they are telling the truth and
acted from political motives.

Celtic cruises through in Dublin, Kiev goes easy on Barry Town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Perhaps Glasgow Celtic should play all its games
in Dublin.
	   Jeered off the field by 57,000 fans a week ago when it was held
0-0 at home by the semi-pro players of St. Patrick's Athletic, the
Scottish titlist went to Dublin for the second leg Wednesday and
cruised to a 2-0 victory in the first qualifying round of the
European Champions Cup.
	   This time the large number of Celtic fans who traveled across
the Irish see cheered as Norwegian forward Harald Brattback fired
his team ahead after 12 minutes and Swedish international striker
Henrik Larsson added the second 18 minutes from the end.
	   Celtic, having ended Rangers streak of nine domestic league
titles in a row, now goes into the second qualifying round where it
has a tough matchup with Croatia Zagreb.
	   Zagreb has six of the players who helped debutant Croatia gain
the semifinal of the World Cup while Celtic has 11 World Cup
players, including eight from Scotland's national team.
	   Quarterfinalist last season, Dynamo Kiev looked set for huge
second leg total total having scored an 8-0 victory in the first
leg against the Welsh part-timers from Barry Town.
	   It looked bad for the Welsh titlist when Dimitri Mikhailenko
burst clear in the 11th minute and beat goalkeeper Pat Mountain to
stretch his team's advantage to nine.
	   But Barry hit back with an equalizer on the half hour when
Eision Williams climbed to head Danny Carter's center home.
	   Oleg Venglinski netted Kiev's second in the 50th minute for a
2-1 victory and 10-1 aggregate triumph and Kiev meets Sparta Prague
in the next round.
	   Waiting for Latvia's Skonto after a 2-1 win at Dynamo Minsk is
Italian powerhouse Inter Milan while Bayern Munich, a three-time
Champions Cup winner, now knows it faces Yugoslav titlist Obilic,
which downed Iceland's Vestmannaeyja 2-1 to advance 4-1 overall.
	   LKS Lodz gained a 3-1 victory at Kapaz of Azerbaijan to win 7-2
on aggregate and the reward is a lucrative matchup with mighty
Manchester United in the second qualifying round.
	   In the UEFA Cup, Red Star Belgrade overwhelmed Kolkheti 1913 of
Georgia 7-0 to run up an 11-0 aggregate triumph. Second-half
substitute Dragan Micic scored three goals and Yugoslav national
team winger Perica Ognjenovic netted two.
	   There was eight goals in an amazing match in Belfast in which
Linfield hit back from 3-1 down to win 5-3 yet go out of the
competition 8-6 on aggregate.

Iran arrests journalist for publishing letter critical of Khomenei
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have arrested the managing
director of a newspaper that printed an anonymous letter
criticizing the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, official media
reported Wednesday.
	   Mohammad-Reza Za'eri of the Khaneh newspaper was arrested for
publishing ``material insulting the Islamic sanctities and the late
Imam Khomeini,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The letter, written by an anonymous woman, referred to the
1980-88 war with Iraq.
	   ``When I think of Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the
horrifying sounds of the midnight bombs that used to fall on
Tehran, and the blood of thousands of innocent young Iranians who
died in that war,'' the letter said.
	   The agency said Za'eri will face trial Monday.

	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro began a historic
Caribbean tour in this Jamaican tourist mecca Wednesday,
highlighting a campaign by the region's leaders to end the
three-decade U.S. embargo of communist Cuba.
	   Lightning flashed overhead and thunder rolled as Castro, wearing
his signature olive drab fatigues and bill cap, marched between the
ranks of an honor guard at the Montego Bay airport, his hand held
stiffly to his cap in salute.
	   Following cheers from airport workers and a 21-gun salute, a
smiling Castro, accompanied by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson,
walked down a long line of dignitaries, vigorously shaking hands
and hugging an acquaintance.
	   He and Patterson then headed to a public rally in Montego Bay.
	   Jamaica has led a Caribbean movement to re-establish diplomatic
and trade links with communist Cuba and has urged Washington to
increase its contacts with Havana.
	   ``There are many (U.S.) congressmen who feel strongly that the
U.S. ought to put an end to the embargo,'' Jamaica's Deputy Premier
Seymour Mullings said recently. ``We believe that within the U.S.
administration there is a strong feeling that more dialogue should
take place.''
	   Castro will spend six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. In
August, he joins other Caribbean leaders at a summit in the
Dominican Republic, which this year restored the diplomatic
relations it severed 37 years ago.
	   The most visible opposition to Castro's trip has come from
Grenada, where some politicians call his visit an insult to
Americans who invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists who had
overthrown a Cuba-allied regime. At the time, some U.S. strategists
feared Grenada could help Castro export his revolution.
	   Forty-five Grenadians, 29 Cubans and 18 U.S. troops were killed
during the invasion.
	   In Jamaica, ``we still have bitter memories'' of Castro's
attempt to export his revolution in the 1970s, said conservative
opposition leader Edward Seaga.
	   Seaga, a former prime minister, told The Associated Press that
he still blamed Castro for Jamaica's 1970s experiment in socialism
that bankrupted the country. After his 1980 election, Seaga closed
the Cuban Embassy.
	   Yet Seaga, who meets with Castro on Thursday, said that the end
of the Cold War had neutralized Cuba as a threat. ``I don't think
we need to fight yesterday's war today,'' he said.
	   Relations with Cuba were restored in 1989 when socialist leader
Michael Manley was re-elected. Manley's protege, Patterson, invited
Castro to Jamaica.
	   While arguing, 11th graf.

Lawmakers and baseball owners, players agree on antitrust bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM ABRAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Senate leaders say they have ironed out
the last issues in a bill that would revise professional baseball's
76-year-old exemption from U.S. antitrust laws and reduce the
chances of another crippling players' strike.
	   ``As fans are returning to the ballparks, they deserve to know
that players will be on the field, not mired in labor disputes,''
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said Wednesday. ``I
am pleased that Congress will, it now appears, be able to help
guarantee that this is the case.''
	   Hatch has for years been pushing legislation that would overturn
parts of what he called an ``aberrant'' 1922 Supreme Court ruling
exempting baseball from antitrust laws. His bill revokes that
exemption for labor relations, while keeping it for relocation and
minor leagues.
	   Passage has been stymied in the past both by the turmoil of the
1994-95 players' strike and by minor league concerns that they
weren't adequately protected. But Hatch, joined at a news
conference by the committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy
of Vermont, said they had made small changes to satisfy the minors.
	   Stanley Brand, vice president of the National Association of
Professional Baseball Leagues, the parent organization of the
minors, wrote Hatch a letter confirming that support. ``We have
been consulted about proposals to amend the bill to assure the
continued survival of minor league baseball.''
	   Donald Fehr, head of the Major League Baseball Players
Association, and Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also
wrote Hatch to express their support. ``It will be a significant
step toward minimizing the labor discord and disruptions in play
that have plagued our national pastime,'' Fehr said in a separate
statement.
	   The legislation would revoke only the antitrust exemption that
deals with labor relations in the major leagues. It would allow
players to go to court over antitrust disputes with the owners _
but according to a recent Supreme Court decision, only if their
union decertifies. Currently, players have the options only of
accepting the owners' contract offer, going on strike or having the
National Labor Relations Board go to court on their behalf.
	   The bill is named for Curt Flood, the former St. Louis Cardinal
outfielder who died last year. Flood was a pioneer in advancing the
labor rights of players, going to the Supreme Court in 1972 to
challenge, unsuccessfully at the time, the reserve clause that had
bound players to one team for life.

Third-seed Kucera, Puerta advance to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Third-seeded Karol Kucera of Slovakia
advanced to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 400,000 Croatia Open
tennis tournament, ousting Slovenia's Borut Urh 7-5, 6-2.
	   In the quarterfinals on Friday, Kucera meets sixth-seeded Magnus
Norman of Sweden, who defeated Stefano Cobolli of Italy 7-6 (7-5),
3-6, 6-2.
	   In another second-round clash, Mariano Puerta of Argentina
defeated Javier Sanchez of Spain 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. Puerta will face
fourth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who ousted Jiri Novak of
the Czech Republic 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.
	   For Kucera, the ATP's No. 11 and a finalist in last week's
tournament at Stuttgart, Germany, it wasn't a walkover against Urh.
	   Urh led 4-2 in the first set, but Kucera broke service and then
went up 5-4. He then served for the set, but Urh broke back. When
Urh served for the set, Kucera broke back again and went on to win
the set.
	   Urh started with a 2-1 lead in the second set, but then lost
five games in a row.
	   Norman also faced a tough opponent in Cobolli, who had to
qualify to get into the tournament. In the first set, Norman served
for the set at 5-4 but was broken, and Cobolli forced a tiebreaker.
	   Kuerten also had troubles with Novak, who won the first set and
led the second to a tiebreaker before Kuerten pulled away.
	   Puerta, ranked 95th, advanced to the second ATP quarterfinal in
his career by overcoming a 4-3 deficit in the third set.

Serb battlefield gains may make Kosovo Albanians reconsider
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 11-12 with report of four Yugoslav
soldiers killed. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP ) _ Recent Serb battlefield gains
appear to have made Kosovo Albanians reconsider their hard-line
stance as they seek to unite their different factions _ a likely
step toward meaningful negotiations.
	   But it was unclear if the key element in the Kosovo equation,
the rebel Kosovo Liberation army, would be part of a unified,
self-styled government that the top Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced Wednesday will be set up.
	   The underground army is fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
which is being rejected both by the Serbian government and the
West. It has so far refused to be associated with any political
faction.
	   Rugova said he had reached a compromise with other ethnic
Albanians on a coalition government, saying it would include ``all
political forces'' and ``create preconditions for a dialogue'' with
the Serb-led Yugoslav government.
	   For almost two weeks, the Albanian guerrillas have suffered a
string of bitter defeats across the rebellious province, testifying
to the government forces' superior weaponry and equipment.
	   Rugova's announcement came after several new Serb victories in
an offensive launched Friday night, a development that may lead the
rebels to be more amenable to talks with the Serbs.
	   Fighting was heaviest Wednesday in the north-central Drenica
region, where the conflict escalated earlier this year.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported that Serb police
had gained full control of a contested stretch of the Kosovska
Mitrovica-Pec road in that region.
	   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met Wednesday with KLA
members in the village of Likoc in the Drenica region, where the
guerrillas are believed to have their general staff headquarters,
the Kosovo Information Center reported. No details of the
three-hour meeting were available.
	   New clashes also were reported in the border region of Djakovica
near the Albanian border, 75 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Serb forces were shelling villages believed to be KLA
strongholds. No reliable casualty figures were available.
	   Three Yugoslav army officers and a private were killed and a
recruit was wounded in several shootouts along the border with
Albania on Monday and Tuesday, an army statement carried by the
government's Tanjug news agency said Wednesday.
	   It said an unspecified number of ``terrorists'' trying to cross
over from Albania were ``liquidated and captured,'' and a
significant amount of weapons was seized from them.

Paralyzed Chinese gymnast yearns to see Leonardo DiCaprio

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Chinese gymnast paralyzed at the Goodwill
Games has a Titanic-size wish: a visit from heartthrob Leonardo
DiCaprio.
	   If DiCaprio can't make it, Celine Dion or the Spice Girls also
are high on Sang Lan's wish-list.
	   Sang remained in a pediatric intensive care unit at the Nassau
County Medical Center on Wednesday. A bulletin board, adorned with
DiCaprio's picture and cards from hundreds of well-wishers, were on
a wall near her bed.
	   The 17-year-old, China's 1997 national vault champion, ``is
fascinated with American pop culture,'' says Shelley Lotenberg,
spokeswoman for the Nassau County Medical Center on Long Island.
``She told us she wanted to meet with Leonardo.''
	   Sang, who broke her neck last week during a warmup vault at the
Nassau Coliseum, underwent surgery Saturday. She has no sensation
from the chest down, and doctors say she probably never will walk
again. Her toes moved during one examination, but her doctors
discounted it as an involuntary twitch.
	   Still, the operation left her in good spirits.
	   ``I am so happy. I feel no more pain in my neck,'' she told a
Chinese reporter Tuesday. She's also inquiring about how her fellow
gymnasts are doing in the games.
	   And she dreams of seeing ``Titanic.'' She was disappointed when
told the movie wasn't yet available on video; Lotenberg is trying
to get a copy from Paramount.
	   DiCaprio's Los Angeles publicist, Cindy Guagenti, said she told
him of Sang's wish, and he was deciding exactly how he might
respond. Lotenberg said later Wednesday that the hospital had been
contacted by ``about a possible arrangement for a visit by
DiCaprio.''
	   Just in case the 23-year-old movie star were to appear at her
bedside, the diminutive athlete has learned a few words of English,
and can say, ``Hi, how are you?''
	   Kim Jakwerth, Dion's Los Angeles publicist, said she had left a
message at the singer's home in Florida and was waiting to hear
from her. ``I know Celine likes to do anything she can for
people,'' Jakwerth said.
	   A representative for the Spice Girls, based in England, would
not comment on the request.
	   When the athlete's parents arrived from China on Saturday, she
reassured them: ``Mother, Father, don't cry, be strong, OK?''
	   On Tuesday, one of China's vice premiers, Qian Qichen, made a
special stopover in New York to see her on his way home from a
Caribbean trip. He was joined in Sang's hospital room by China's
ambassador to the United States, its vice minister of foreign
affairs and the Chinese consul general in New York.
	   Earlier in the week, she also received a visit from former U.S.
football player Dennis Byrd of the Jets, who overcame paralysis
suffered six years ago when he collided with a teammate.
	   Her parents are considering several options for long-term
rehabilitation, including facilities in the United States,
Lotenberg said. For now, Sang is being treated with SYGEN, the same
nerve-building drug that helped Byrd recover.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Organizers annulled Wednesday's
stage of the Tour de France after angry riders either dropped out
or slowed down the race to protest the ongoing drug investigation
rocking the cycling classic.
	   The riders ended the day's stage holding hands as they crossed
the finish line of the 17th stage, with the Dutch team TVM leading
the pack.
	   Tour officials then annulled the leg that ended two and-a-half
hours later than scheduled.
	   Seventeen riders from three teams -- ONCE, Banesto, Riso Scotti
-- dropped out of the 149 km (92-5-mile) Alpine leg from
Albertville to Aix-Les-Bains altogether.
	   The Tour appeared increasingly vulnerable in the face of the
growing police investigation into the use of performance-enhancing
drugs. The Festina team has been expelled, and at least five other
teams have come under suspicion.
	   On Wednesday night, police in nearby Chambery detained Casino
team coach Vincent Lavenu following a search of the team hotel.
Casino was one of four teams subjected to searches Wednesday.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annulled. He
said only the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday.
	   Thursday's 18th stage would take place without French star
Laurent Jalabert of ONCE -- the first to abandon the race on
Wednesday.
	   The three-week Tour is set to end Sunday in Paris.
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said the Dane Bjarne Riis of the Deutsche
Telekom team and winner of the 1996 Tour.
	   ``What we did today was to save the Tour, save cycling because
it's our life,'' Riis said, referring to the slowdown protest.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team. ``I have the impression the Tour is finished. I'm
sick.''
	   It was the police search and lengthy medical tests on TVM
members Tuesday night that set off the protest -- along with word
that some 40 team members, riders and officials, would be checked
Wednesday.
	   About 100 police descended on team hotels around the Alpine town
of Chambery for searches of the Casino team, ONCE, La Francaise des
Jeux and Polti.
	   Police were seen removing garbage bags full of objects from a
van bearing the ONCE insignia during a four-hour investigation of
the team that ended at 10:30 p.m. (2030 GMT).
	   France 2 television said Jalabert was among those questioned.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest before his team simply
dropped out of the race.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Jalabert is ranked world No. 1 cyclist by the International
Cycling Union based on results over the year and was France's top
hope since Richard Virenque was kicked out of the Tour with his
Festina team.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc, trying to save the stage,
appealed for riders to restart the race. To no avail.
	   However, Leblanc procured assurances from police and judicial
authorities that further police action would be carried out ``with
a maximum of dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and
not at police stations.''
	   Riders ``merit reaching the apotheosis Sunday in Paris on the
Champs Elysees,'' Leblanc said.
	   Italian Marco Pantani, the leader at the start of the stage, was
one of the first to remove his number, at the 32nd km (20th mile).
``The pack stopped because they are continuing to persecute the
riders ...,'' he said.
	   Fans along the route appeared divided in their reaction, with
some whistling the riders in discontent. Others applauded.
	   This year's Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since
its July 11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   The TVM cyclists underwent lengthy tests Tuesday for illegal
substances -- checking blood, urine and hair -- the same day French
authorities placed two top team officials under formal
investigation for allegedly supplying racers with EPO, a
hard-to-detect performance-enhancing drug.
	   TVM entered the police spotlight when it emerged that EPO was
found in the car of a team official in March.
	   Another team, Bigmat, came under suspicion Tuesday when French
police seized suspect medication in a van in Chambery driven by
team officials.
	   An analysis shoed no illegal substances in the medication.
	   Festina was thrown out of the Tour after its director admitted
an organized plan to administer banned substances to the riders to
improve performances.
	   Since, at least five Festina riders admitted using EPO. Festina
star, Richard Virenque, has denied using drugs.

UN convenes special conference on Sierra Leon, Kabbah forces
</HEADLINE>
accused &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations will convene a special
conference Thursday on Sierra Leone, where human rights groups say
killings and torture have not only been committed by former junta
members but by forces loyal to the newly restored president.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone arrived Wednesday
and was to address the conference on Thursday. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was to open the meeting, said he
hopes the conference can help raise money to ``prepare the ground
for the international community to assess Sierra Leone, to
reconstruct, to rebuild the society and establish assisting
institutions.''
	   Kabbah was restored to power in February when a West African
coalition army led by Nigeria drove Lt. Col. Johnny Koroma's
military junta from power.
	   Renegade soldiers allied with Koroma continue to run amok in the
eastern region near the border with Liberia. Armed with machetes,
they hack, kill, maim and brutalize thousands of civilians.
	   But a Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday said Kabbah's
forces have also ``committed human rights abuses and violations of
international humanitarian law,'' in the last six months.
	   Extrajudicial killings and torture of rebels soldiers and their
suspected allies were among the crimes, the report said. The report
also accused both rebels and Kabbah's forces of forcibly recruiting
children in the West African nation.
	   At a press conference, Annan said he was told by Kabbah during a
meeting Wednesday that ``he appealed to his supporters to stop the
killing and to stop the maiming of people.''
	   A recent report by Amnesty International said children have
suffered the most in Sierra Leone's conflict. Besides losing their
families, ``thousands of children have been and continue to be
abducted ... and forced to fight. Girls and women have been
systematically raped and forced into sexual slavery,'' it said.
	   During Thursday's meeting, U.N. officials and the delegation
from Sierra Leone will deal with the issues of political and human
rights, security, military support, as well as humanitarian issues,
refugees and peace-building efforts.
	   The Security Council recently agreed to send military observers
to Sierra Leone to help disarm warring factions.

Fishing boat nets mini-sub; navy can have it back - for a fee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos LON102 and 103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The owner of a Cornish fishing trawler that caught
a missing navy mini-sub won't turn it over until he is paid a hefty
salvage fee, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   John Leach is keeping the remote-operated yellow submarine,
which is used for hunting mines and shipwrecks, at a secret
location until the Royal Navy pays a reward, The Independent said.
	   Leach is hoping for between 50,000 and 150,000 pounds (dlrs
82,000 and dlrs 246,000) according to Charles Hattersley, whose law
firm represents Leach, the newspaper said.
	   Although the value of the submarine was not immediately clear,
Hattersley was quoted as saying, ``If the submarine is worth 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.64 million) and Mr. Leach has performed a
professional salvage job, there is no reason why we should not be
looking at sums in that area.''
	   The sub, about 13 feet (4 meters) long, was lost in March from
the British navy ship Cromer while it was searching for a sunken
fishing boat off the French coast, according ot the Ministry of
Defense, which said Leach's salvage claim is under consideration.
	   Leach said the skipper of his boat found the sub floating on the
surface in April and towed it back to the Mevagissey fishing port
in Cornwall, on the southwest coast of England, The Daily Telegraph
reported.
	   Leach has had several offers from people interested in buying
the sub, the newspaper said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Bobby Hill cracked a home run in the sixth inning
Wednesday to lead the United States to a 3-2 victory over Canada at
the Baseball World Championships. But neither team advanced to the
quarterfinals.
	   South Korea and the Netherlands, both 4-3 like the U.S., got
through instead, along with group B leader Australia (5-2) and
Nicaragua.
	   In pool A, Cuba, Japan, the Dominican Republic and Italy made
the cut. The top four teams of each of the two eight-country pools
will play in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   A grand slam by infielder Eddy Dix helped the Netherlands seal
an 11-9 victory over Australia and claim fourth place in pool B.
	   The United States, the Netherlands and Canada, were tied for
fourth place in their group with a 3-3 record going into the last
round of preliminary play Wednesday.
	   The Americans have not won these championships since 1974, the
last time the country hosted the event.
	   Julio Cesar Osejo hit two homers in a 13-run second inning to
help Nicaragua (5-2) crush Russia 26-5. Russia, which failed to win
a single game in preliminary rounds, was sent packing after the
game which ended in the seventh inning because of the 10-run mercy
rule.
	   Also in pool B, Taiwan (3-4) defeated Korea 2-0, but failed to
earn a quarterfinal berth. At the 1994 Worlds, South Korea finished
runner-up to Cuba.
	   Cuba, the five-time defending titlist, is the undefeated leader
of group A. It has won 37 consecutive games at the Worlds.
	   On Wednesday, Cuba (6-0) beat Panama 8-5.
	   In other pool A games, China (2-5) defeated the winless South
Africa 5-0 and Japan (6-1) crushed Spain 13-1.
	   The tournament is open to professionals for the first time but
no players from the Major Leagues are participating. Some minor
leaguers are playing for Canada, the Dominican Republic and other
countries.
	   Cuba and the Dominican Republic are scheduled to play Friday to
make up a game that was canceled Tuesday due to rain. Although both
teams have qualified they need to play to determine the final
rankings of group A.
	   The other teams get a day off before Friday's quarterfinals.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra said
Wednesday he thought President Alberto Fujimori would not run for a
third consecutive term in 2000.
	   In his annual Independence Day address to the nation Tuesday,
Fujimori did not say whether he would run again. But he said that
``at the end of my mandate in 2000, I want to leave a country that
is solid and headed on the right road.''
	   Peru's Fujimori-controlled Congress passed a controversial law
that circumvents a constitutional ban on a third straight
presidential bid, leading to speculation he was preparing another
election run.
	   Fujimori was elected as an unknown in 1990 and re-elected in a
1995 landslide. In recent years, however, his popularity has fallen
due to lingering poverty and the perception that he is
authoritarian.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A doctor who was married to a U.S. citizen
slain in January was himself shot to death Wednesday at the
hospital where he worked.
	   Dr. Ricardo Orellana was the widower of Danita Gonzalez Plank de
Orellana, a Philadelphia native who was kidnapped and murdered
January in western Guatemala.
	   National police said Ricardo Orellana, 37, was killed on the
fourth floor of the San Juan de Dios Hospital here. The attacker
fled, and it was unclear if the shooting was related to the attack
on his wife.
	   Mrs. Orellana, 32, and her 6-month-old baby daughter were
kidnapped Jan. 6 near Quetzaltenango in western Guatemala.
	   The baby was found alive inside a cardboard box. Her mother's
body was found later with a gunshot wound to the head.
	   Police arrested several suspects, but all were freed because of
a lack of evidence.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The National Human Rights Commission called
on the attorney general's office Wednesday to wipe out the use of
unofficial, unpaid assistants by the federal judicial police.
	   Those assistants, known as ``godmothers,'' are almost always
associated with corruption. They depend on their police sponsors
for pay _ generally the shared spoils of payoffs or extortion.
	   Many are former policemen who were fired for crimes or violence.
	   The commission urged Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar to
act ``to eradicate ... in a definitive way the use of civilians
known as `godmothers' in the investigation and prosecution of
crimes.''
	   Madrazo, a former chief of the human rights agency, has called
for ending the practice as part of broader efforts to wipe out
corruption.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela has denied political asylum
to a former Peruvian official who took refuge in Venezuela's
embassy in Lima three days ago, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Guido Pennano, who served as Peru's Industry Minister from 1990
to 1995, claimed he was being persecuted because he had criticized
officials in the administration of President Alberto Fujimori.
	   Pennano is under investigation for tax fraud for the equivalent
of (dlrs) 400,000 in connection with two agriculture companies he
ran after leaving the government.
	   Venezuela determined that Pennano is not a victim of political
persecution and that Peru's courts should decide the tax fraud
issue, said Venezuela government spokesman Fernando Egana.
	   Egana said he did not know when Pennano would leave Venezuela's
embassy.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Ernesto Samper accepted state
responsibility Wednesday for a series of massacres and summary
executions in which 49 people died, opening the way for the
government to compensate victims' families.
	   ``The national government wants to ... express with this act of
amends its shame for these incidents of senseless violence,''
Samper said during a memorial act attended by the families at the
presidential palace.
	   Human rights activists say state abuses have increased during
Samper's four year-tenure, which ends Aug. 7. The number of
extrajudicial killings and disappearances rose from 2,036 in 1996
to 2,416 in 1997, according to the Colombian Jurists Commission, a
human rights group.
	   Twenty-six human rights activists have also been murdered in the
past four years, said the Commission's acting director, Carlos
Rodriguez. Right-wing paramilitary death squads committed most of
those killings, he said.

Trapp named to coach Blues

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Maurice Trapp, Graham Henry's
predecessor, was named Thursday as Auckland rugby union coach for
the domestic season following the departure of Henry to Wales.
	   Trapp will take up his position immediately and his first game
in charge will be the warmup match against Canterbury at Eden Park
in Auckland on Aug. 8.
	   Trapp had an impressive record as coach of Auckland from 1989 to
1991, leading the Blues to 86 wins, a draw and three losses in 90
matches.
	   Like Henry, Trapp won four national titles with Auckland.
	   Trapp, who will step down as a member of the Auckland Rugby
Union's directors board, will review his continuation as coach at
the end of the season.
	   ``I'm absolutely thrilled to be involved again,'' Trapp said
Thursday.
	   Former All Blacks standoff Grant Fox was named back coach and
Guy Smith is the other member of the coaching staff. (djp)

Henry elects to coach Wales at risk of never coaching All Blacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last graf with new Auckland coach named Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Graham Henry was en route to
Britain on Wednesday to start a five-year contract as coach of
Wales, knowing the New Zealand Rugby Football Union will never
allow him to coach the All Blacks.
	   The Auckland Blues coach, who had been tipped to take over from
current All Blacks coach John Hart after next year's World Cup, was
released by the NZRFU after three months of legal wrangling.
	   Henry was head-hunted by Welsh rugby union officials who made
him an offer he could not refuse.
	   ``I feel very privileged to be asked do the job, it is a rugby
nation that has a great tradition in rugby,'' he said Wednesday
before heading for Wales.
	   With four national titles as coach of the Blues and two Super 12
championships from three finals appearances behind him, Henry is
looking forward to taking on the challenge ahead.
	   Asked about his views while watching Wales crash 96-13 to South
Africa last month, he replied: ``I thought they needed a bit of
improvement.''
	   The 52-year-old takes over as full-time coach, filling a void
left by Kevin Bowring.
	   NZRFU chief executive David Moffett said Henry's decision means
he will forego any opportunity to coach the All Blacks and, on that
basis, he was released from his contract.
	   Henry said the NZRFU's ruling was a knee-jerk reaction to his
departure and it lacked maturity.
	   ``I think it is a one-off case because rugby players can play
for different nations as long as they have a stand-down period, yet
rugby coaches in New Zealand who coach another national side get
banned for life,'' he said.
	   ``That to me lacks logic, lacks thought, lacks sensitivity,
lacks maturity, and I'm sure they will change that when they have
got some time to consider it.''
	   Henry said Wales offered him the opportunity to coach the game
at the hightest level, including World Cup campaigns in 1999 and
2003 _ an opportunity he said he did not have in New Zealand.
	   ``It may have occurred, but it was a dream which meant a lot to
my life and when you have to make a decision between reality versus
a dream, it is a non-decision,'' he said.
	   ``It is a huge challenge, and that is what makes it so exciting
and demanding. I guess that is why you do these things and I'm
looking forward to it.''
	   In Cardiff, WRU chairman Glanmor Griffiths predicted that
Henry's appointment signalled a new era for Welsh rugby.
	   ``This is a tremendous coup for Welsh rugby and it shows we are
determined to make Wales a major force in the world game once
again,'' he said.
	   ``We said we wanted to find the best available coach in the
world, and that is exactly what we've done.''
	   Henry's wife, Raewyn, the Auckland provincial netball coach,
will remain in New Zealand until November but there is speculation
that she may end up coaching the Welsh netball team.
	   Henry said he will return from Wales for a proper farewell with
the Auckland team which he has coached since 1992.
	   Maurice Trapp, Henry's predecessor, was named Thursday as the
new Auckland coach. Trapp will take up his position immediately and
his first game in charge will be the warmup match against
Canterbury at Eden Park in Auckland on Aug. 8.
	   Trapp had an impressive record as coach of Auckland from 1989 to
1991, leading the Blues to 86 wins, a draw and three losses in 90
matches.
	   Former All Blacks standoff Grant Fox was named back coach and
Guy Smith is the other member of the coaching staff. (djp-jp)

A French national treasure loses some gloss

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ It's one of the most cherished
sports traditions in France _ waiting at roadside as the Tour de
France cyclists whiz by.
	   That's what people did in Aix-les-Bains on Wednesday, as the
grand cycling race passed through this Alpine town for the 21st
time since it began in 1903.
	   But along with the excitement there was sadness. No one could
ignore the drug scandal that has enveloped this national treasure.
	   ``I admire the riders so much _ they are all champions,'' said
Danielle Thullet, a 75-year-old retired teacher. ``But I must say,
I'm a bit disappointed in them.''
	   Yet she wasn't about to miss the arrival of the riders,
descending from three tough climbing days in the Alps. Neither was
16-year-old Laetitia Gelloz, who spent three hours sitting on a
curb in the hot sun.
	   ``Doping is bad, of course, but I think the media has
exaggerated everything,'' Gelloz said. ``They're going to end up
accusing everybody, including innocent people.''
	   Both fans cheered when the riders finally arrived, unaware the
race had unraveled during the day _ only four days before its
finale on the Champs-Elysees in Paris.
	   The cyclists, angered by police tactics in an investigation that
already has left one team disqualified and subjected five others to
police searches, basically went on strike, forcing organizers to
cancel the stage that began in the morning in Albertville. The
riders coasted through the course, arriving at the finish line two
hours late.
	   Three teams pulled out in protest, including France's top
cyclist, Laurent Jalabert. Riders lashed out at police treatment
that included strip searches, detention and officers searching
through personal affairs in their hotel rooms.
	   While the fans in Aix-les-Bains didn't belittle the seriousness
of the drug charges, many felt the Tour's riders have been unfairly
targeted for an offense many suspect has long been widespread.
	   ``Everybody knows there's doping in cycling,'' said bartender
Eric Guninand. ``Why does it have to be here, in France? Why can't
they do this in Spain or Italy?
	   ``Look at the kids out there,'' he said, pointing to the
children lining the streets. ``It's a great atmosphere. It's sad
that this event has been spoiled.''
	   At about 7:15 p.m., the crowds in front of the train station
finally got what they'd been waiting for. After a long parade of
sponsors' cars, manned by dancing employees handing out drinks,
hats or flags, the whirring of press helicopters came into earshot.
	   Police hurriedly pushed people onto the curb, and the media cars
came tearing around the corner onto President Wilson Boulevard.
Then, suddenly, the riders, all in one pack, shining in their
fluorescent outfits, came dashing through _ not at top speed, but
enough to put a smile on the face of 10-year-old Virginie
Guiaunnet.
	   ``This is my first time _ it was cool!'' she said.
	   One person was already gone when the colorful convoy arrived.
Roger Casile, 88, a retired mapmaker, had put on a suit, grabbed
his walking stick, and taken the train from nearby Chambery for the
arrival. But after two hours at a roadside cafe, he had to catch
the 7 p.m. train back.
	   ``I've seen this race 20 times, and I'll have another chance,''
he said. ``I'll still be around next year, and so will the Tour de
France.''

National Organization for Women protests outside Tyson hearing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH ROLNICK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Allowing Mike Tyson to box again in
New Jersey would be ``an insult to women'' and would undermine
their safety, the National Organization for Women said Wednesday.
	   About a half dozen members of the New Jersey chapter of NOW
protested outside the justice complex as Tyson appeared before the
New Jersey Athletic Control Board to seek reinstatement.
	   Tyson had his boxing license revoked by Nevada regulators after
biting the ear of Evander Holyfield in a June 28, 1997 title bout
in Las Vegas.
	   Bear Atwood, president of the state chapter, said Tyson's 1992
rape conviction should figure just as prominently when considering
the boxer's license application.
	   Tyson was convicted of raping Desiree Washington, a Coventry,
Rhode Island college student who had been competing in the Miss
Black America pageant in Indianapolis. He was released from prison
in March 1995.
	   ``It goes back to the rape,'' Atwood said shortly after Tyson
left the building. ``To give a boxing license to a convicted rapist
would be an insult to every woman in our state.''
	   NOW protested Tyson's return to the ring when he was released
from prison, and the Southern Nevada chapter last month called on
the Nevada State Athletic Commission to deny Tyson a new license.
	   Atwood said if Tyson is given a license to fight in New Jersey,
that sends a message that ``they value money more than they
consider women's safety.''
	   Though the ear-biting incident figured most prominently in
Wednesday's hearing, several witnesses were asked to comment on the
rape conviction as well.
	   Tyson's character will be the key issue as the panel considers
whether to reinstate his license.
	   When asked about the rape conviction by Assistant Attorney
General Michael Haas, former light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz
said he doesn't believe Tyson committed the crime.
	   ``Mike told me straight away back then he didn't do it,'' Czyz
said. ``I don't think that particular crime has any relevance today
... he did his time.''
	   Haas questioned Tyson directly about the crime, but only to
establish that Tyson was convicted on one count of rape and two
counts of criminal deviant conduct.
	   Tyson was sentenced to 10 years in prison on each count, but the
terms were set to run concurrently and four years were suspended.
Tyson was released on probation after serving three years.
	   Atwood, wearing a sticker that read ``Stop honoring and
rewarding violent athletes,'' said the biting incident only shows
Tyson has not changed.
	   Noting that Tyson lost his temper at the end of the hearing,
Atwood said, ``He's here to say, `I'm a reformed man' and he can't
even make it through a hearing.
	   ``He has been a man out of control in his personal life and in
his public life for a long time.''
	   But Bert Rotman, a New Jersey psychologist who examined Tyson
last week in preparation for the hearing, said the boxer showed no
signs of clinical pathology.
	   ``This man is a totally honest person,'' Rotman said,
``sometimes to a fault.''

charged Wednesday that Israel's Jerusalem policy risks inflaming
the region and destroying the peace process.
	   Arafat, speaking at the start of a two-day meeting by the
Organization of the Islamic Conference's Al Qods (Jerusalem)
Committee, accused Israel of ``the expulsion and ethnic cleansing
of Palestinians'' in Jerusalem and the ``changing of the city's
Arab-Muslim identity.''
	   ``Israel is leading the big and final battle for Judaization,''
Arafat said at the start of the meeting, the 17th since the group
was formed in 1979.
	   ``It will lead unavoidably to the total destruction of the peace
process and will inflame the region,'' Arafat said.
	   Officials and delegations from 16 nations were attending the
session at the royal palace of King Hassan II, hoping to voice a
clear warning to Israel and find ways to oppose Israel's Jerusalem
policy.
	   There were suggestions here that another objective was to
present a united viewpoint to encourage the United States to bring
more pressure to bear on Israel.
	   But it was also a time for questioning.
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa chided the gathering.
``We don't apply our own resolutions,'' he said. ``How is Israel to
respect international resolutions if we don't respect our own?''
	   He was apparently referring to a resolution at a 1997 Al Qods
meeting calling for a reevaluation of existing Arab relations with
Israel.
	   The king dismissed the comment. ``We are here to talk about the
Judaization of Al Qods,'' Hassan II said.
	   He offered an ominous assessment in his opening address.
	   ``We wanted the problem to be political with a political
solution,'' Hassan II said. ``But in the face of the evolution of
the internal Israeli situation, it risks becoming religious.''
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state, and Israel's
decision in June to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to West
Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians. They accuse
Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian accords by unilaterally
making decisions on Jerusalem's future.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of suburbs inside Israel to ensure the Jewish
majority of 70 percent in Jerusalem, where Palestinians hope to set
up the capital of a future state.
	   ``Israel wants to turn east Jerusalem into a small Arab quarter
inside a large Jewish town,'' said al-Sharaa shortly before the
session began.
	   ``The city of Jerusalem isn't just a Palestinian city. It is the
city for all Muslims in the world,'' said Faycal Husseini, in
charge of the Jerusalem issue for the Palestinian Authority.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the session ``must
give a clear message to Israel.''
	   He lamented that there are ``no serious negotiations between
Arabs and Israel'' at the moment.
	   The United States has proposed Israel withdraw from 13 percent
more of the West Bank as a way to revive talks stalled since March
1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing unit in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Israel has far refused.
	   The Jerusalem Committee is made up of Morocco, Saudi Arabia,
Palestine, Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, Niger, Guinea, Indonesia,
Irak, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Senegal and Syria.

US heads off scaleback on Iraq nuclear inspections _ for now
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian proposals seen as posturing for October
sanctions review. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia failed Wednesday to persuade the
Security Council to scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq after
the United States said the move would unjustly reward Iraq for
continued noncompliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Acknowledging a scaleback couldn't be achieved now, Russia
instead sought to acknowledge Baghdad's previous progress and set
the stage for a future reduction in inspections to less intrusive
monitoring and verification visits.
	   The United States strongly objected to any such recognition _ in
the form of a resolution or presidential statement _ and the
council adjourned for the day without taking any formal action on
the latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``We would oppose any statement or resolution because we don't
think Iraq needs to be rewarded for inaction, for noncooperation,''
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said.
	   Washington successfully blocked an effort this spring by Russia,
France and China to have nuclear inspections in Iraq reduced to the
passive monitoring and verification visits after the last IAEA
report was released in April.
	   Lavrov had conceded Tuesday that he didn't think there was the
``political will'' in the council for any scaleback this time
around. His proposals were seen then as posturing for the next
sanctions review in October.

Shops under fire attack after bomb alert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Fire bombers were believed to
be behind a series of fires which broke out in shops around
Portadown late Wednesday, hours after an incendiary bomb was
defused in another local store.
	   Police put the town, 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of
Belfast, on alert against bombers and urged shopkeepers to search
their stores after the army defused a device found hidden among
clothing in a store at a shopping center.
	   There had been no warning or claim of responsibility, but police
immediately put businesses on the alert and called for searches.
	   But within hours, a furniture store a short distance away caught
fire and was extensively damaged before firemen got the blaze under
control.
	   Later there were sudden fires in two more shops in the area.
	   Security forces were continuing to investigate Thursday but said
they believe incendiary bombers were responsible for the fires.
	   Meanwhile, about one hundred Protestants rallied in Portadown in
support of the Orange Order fraternal organization, which is still
insisting on its right to march through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood which security forces have blocked them from entering.
	   Police prevented several hundred who gathered at one end of the
Garvaghy Road from getting through Wednesday night.
	   Police and soldiers, enforcing an order by the
government-appointed Parades Commission, prevented members of the
Orange Order from marching down the Garvaghy Road on July 5.
	   Orangemen gathered on a nearby hillside every night for a week,
underlining their determination to follow their traditional parade
route. But the number of protesters fell after arsonists killed
three young sons of a Catholic woman July 12 in the town of
Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.

	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro began a historic
Caribbean tour in this Jamaican tourist mecca Wednesday,
highlighting a campaign by the region's leaders to end the
three-decade U.S. embargo of communist Cuba.
	   Lightning flashed overhead and thunder rolled as Castro, wearing
his signature olive drab fatigues and bill cap, marched between the
ranks of an honor guard at the Montego Bay airport, his hand held
stiffly to his cap in salute.
	   Following cheers from airport workers and a 21-gun salute, a
smiling Castro, accompanied by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson,
walked down a long line of dignitaries, vigorously shaking hands
and hugging an acquaintance.
	   ``We need to put up a fight for the Caribbean nations and for
all the peoples of the Third World region. Our strength united
cannot be ignored,'' Castro later told a crowd of several thousand
people.
	   Patterson condemned the U.S. embargo and the Helms-Burton law,
which was designed to discourage foreign investment in Cuba by
punishing foreign companies investing in property confiscated from
Americans after Castro's takeover.
	   ``We are implacably opposed to the economic blockade against
Cuba, which is morally wrong and contravenes the right to
sovereignty,'' Patterson said.

Maradona to sue Caniggia's wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona's controversial
antics continue as his lawyer said Wednesday the Argentine star
plans to sue the wife of his close friend and former teammate,
Claudio Caniggia.
	   Guillermo Coppola, Maradona's lawyer, said the lawsuit stems
from Mariana Nannis' recent comments calling Maradona a homosexual
for the public kisses he used to give Caniggia.
	   ``At times I believe Diego is in love with my husband,''
Caniggia's wife recently told a local cable television station.
``It must be the long hair and big muscles.''
	   Coppola said the lawsuit could be avoided if Nannis would simply
retract the statement.
	   While playing, Maradona frequently gave Caniggia, a teammate on
Argentina's national team and later on the Argentine club Boca
Juniors, a peck on the lips after one of the players scored.
	   Most fans assumed Maradona's action was a sign of affection
between the two close friends.
	   Maradona was irked by some of Nannis' past comments, Coppola
said, but had been willing to overlook them because of his close
friendship with Caniggia.

Bandits rob bus load of tourists in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Armed bandits ambushed 23 tourists visiting a
pre-Incan cemetery near the Nazca Lines in southern Peru, robbing
them of their cash and cameras, police said Wednesday.
	   None of the tourists, who were from Italy, Germany, Israel,
England and Canada, were injured, a spokesman for the Nazca police
said.
	   The tourists were visiting the pre-Incan cemetery of Chauchilla,
250 miles (400 kilometers) southeast of Lima, on Tuesday when three
armed men emerged from hiding as they prepared to board their bus.
	   The men fired six shots in the air, forcing the tourists to
throw themselves to the ground. They then forced the tourists to
hand over their belongings, police said.
	   The tourists had left most of their valuables in their hotel,
but the thieves made off with about dlrs 5,000, police said. Police
have arrested three suspects.
	   The Nazca Lines are one of Peru's most-visited tourist
attractions, consisting of more than a thousand lines and figures
that were etched in the desert sand centuries ago by the Nazca
Indians.
	   Among the giant figures, which stretch over 35 miles (50
kilometers) of desert plain, are a monkey, a hummingbird, a dog, a
whale, a spider and a flower.

category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton will provide videotaped
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky investigation on Aug. 17,
Clinton's personal attorney said Wednesday. As part of the
agreement, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr withdrew a subpoena
that had been issued to the attorney, David Kendall, according to a
senior White House official. Clinton's personal lawyers will be
present for the testimony, which will be given at the White House,
Kendall said. Last week, Kendall received the historic subpoena
ordering Clinton to testify before the grand jury investigating
allegations of a presidential affair and cover-up. Clinton's
lawyers have said they did not want him to be the first sitting
president to testify in person before a grand jury under subpoena
and had sought a forum for furnishing testimony outside a
courthouse. (US-CLINTON INVESTIGATION)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia failed Wednesday to persuade the
Security Council to scale back nuclear inspections in Iraq, after
the United States said this would unjustly reward Iraq for
continued noncompliance with U.N. resolutions. After failing to
achieve agreement on a scaleback, Russia instead sought to
acknowledge Baghdad's previous progress and set the stage for a
future reduction in inspections to less intrusive monitoring and
verification visits. The United States strongly objected to any
such recognition _ in the form of a resolution or presidential
statement _ and the council adjourned for the day without taking
any formal action on the latest report from the International
Atomic Energy Agency. Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass
destruction for the council to lift sanctions imposed after the
1990 invasion of Kuwait. (UN-IRAQ)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former Cabinet minister and 11 others
were convicted Wednesday of kidnapping a French businessman,
concluding a trial that exposed the former government's role in
death squads that targeted Basque separatists. The Supreme Court
found Jose Luis Barrionuevo, the minister in charge of internal
security from 1982 to 1988, guilty of kidnapping Segundo Marey in
1983. Barrionuevo, currently a member of parliament, was sentenced
to 10 years in prison and banned from public office for 12 years.
Marey's abduction was the first attributed to the so-called GAL
death squad. GAL killed 27 people in a campaign against the armed
Basque separatist group ETA between 1983-87. Many victims had no
connection with ETA. Marey was released after 10 days when his
kidnappers realized he was not the ETA hitman they were hunting.
(SPAIN-DIRTY WAR VERDICT)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Lawmakers handed Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a stinging rebuke Wednesday over his peace policies,
giving lopsided preliminary approval to a measure aimed at bringing
about early elections. But the setback for the prime minister was
all but overshadowed by a larger one for the opposition: racially
tinged remarks by one of its lawmakers drew angry reaction from
Jews of Sephardic, or Middle Eastern descent, and badly damaged the
Labor party's chances for returning to government. In an interview
with the Haaretz daily Wednesday, Ori Orr said that Sephardic Jews
_ who suffered discrimination after arriving in the 1950s at the
hands of the ruling Ashkenazi, or European-descended elite _ use
past injustices in order to advance unfairly. Orr said. Wednesday's
parliament session should have been a victory for Labor, which
successfully mustered up enough support for an important vote
against Netanyahu. (ISRAEL-POLITICIANS)
	   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro began a historic
Caribbean tour in this Jamaican tourist mecca Wednesday,
highlighting a campaign by the region's leaders to end the
three-decade U.S. embargo of communist Cuba. Lightning flashed
overhead and thunder rolled as Castro, wearing his signature olive
drab fatigues and bill cap, marched between the ranks of an honor
guard at the Montego Bay airport. A smiling Castro, accompanied by
Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, walked down a long line of
dignitaries. Jamaica has led a Caribbean movement to re-establish
diplomatic and trade links with communist Cuba and has urged
Washington to increase its contacts with Havana. Castro will spend
six days in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada. (JAMAICA-CASTRO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell modestly Wednesday, steadying from
the wild gyrations of recent days, but extending a sharp retreat
from record highs set less than two weeks ago. On Wall Street, the
Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.82 _ or 0.2 percent _ to
8,914.96, the lowest finish in more than a month and 423 points
below the closing record of 9,337.97 set just eight sessions
earlier on July 17. (US-STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Factory orders for big-ticket items declined
in June for the second consecutive month as American manufacturers
struggled to cope with battered export markets in Asia and a strike
at the country's largest corporation. The 0.2 percent decrease,
coming on top of a steep 3.3 percent slide in May, reduced orders
for durable goods _ items expected to last three or more years _ to
a seasonally adjusted dlrs 182.3 billion last month, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday. It was the first back-to-back decline in
a year and a half and the fourth drop this year. May's drop, even
worse than a previously reported 2.7 percent decrease, was the
largest in five months. (US-ECONOMY)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil on Wednesday sold off its
controlling stake in the state-run telecommunications holding
company, Telebras, in what was billed as the largest privatization
in Latin America. Telebras' 12 subsidiaries _ three fixed-line
companies, eight cellular companies and a long distance carrier _
were sold for a total 22 billion, reals (dlrs 19 billion), or 64.74
percent more than the government-set minimum of 13.5 billion reals
(dlrs 11.7 billion). The highlight of the four-hour bidding
process, was a showdown between American telecommunications giants
MCI and Sprint for control of long distance carrier Embratel. MCI
emerged the winner with an offer of 2.65 billion reals (dlrs 2.28
billion). (BRAZIL-PHONE SALE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Quarterly profits at BAT Industries PLC fell 25
percent to 490 million pounds (dlrs 803 million) as the cigarette
and insurance group paid out millions to settle tobacco litigation
in Minnesota, the company said Wednesday. The pre-tax earnings for
the three months ending June 30 compared with profits of 656
million pounds in the same period a year earlier. Quarterly
revenues came to 6.35 billion pounds (dlrs 10.41 billion) at BAT,
which soon will separate into two companies, one handling the
tobacco and the other handling financial services including
insurance. Revenues were 5.81 billion pounds in the same period a
year earlier. (BRITAIN-EARNS-BAT INDUSTRIES)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission proposed
Wednesday to slap five-year anti-dumping duties on imports of
unbleached cotton fabrics from China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and
Pakistan. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, called for a
five-year extension of duties imposed in April on these countries
for a six-month period. The proposal must be approved by EU
ministers by October 9, Commission spokesman Nigel Gardner said.
Once approved, it would go into effect immediately. The Commission
proposed at the same time to end anti-dumping duties imposed in
April on imports of unbleached cotton fabrics from Turkey.
(EU-ANTI-DUMPING)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian economist issued a new warning
Wednesday that a devaluation of the Russian currency is inevitable,
and that a recently approved international bailout package will
only delay it. Andrei Illarionov, director of the independent
Economic Analysis Institute, predicted the devaluation of the ruble
would come as early as October, despite the government's repeated
statements that it has no such plans. The ruble has been trading
steadily recently, at about 6.2 to the U.S. dollar. The Central
Bank has spent millions of dollars to keep it there. Illarionov
said these efforts are choking economic growth. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Boosted by strong pharmaceutical
activities, Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel NV said Wednesday its
net profit in the second quarter rose 5 percent to 483 million
guilders (dlrs 242 million). Operating income rose in all divisions
in the quarter, but especially the pharmaceuticals division, which
posted an increase of 11 percent to 258 million guilders (dlrs 129
million). Akzo said the Organon unit was the main contributor. For
the remainder of the year, Akzo said it expects growth to continue,
although the increase in earnings of ongoing operations in the
second half will slow compared with the first half of this year.

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ In a mock medieval battle that suddenly
turned too authentic, a man playing the role of a knight was
severely stabbed by another player, the Baltic News Service
reported Wednesday.
	   Gatis Indrevics, 18, was sparring in knights' garb with an
opponent who apparently became overexcited, pulled a real knife and
plunged it into Indrevics' side, BNS said.
	   Participants in such mock battles usually use blunted knives.
	   BNS said Indrevics was in intensive but that his life was not in
danger.
	   The incident occurred Saturday in Cesis, 75 kilometers (45
miles) northeast of Riga, a stronghold of 13th century German
knights.
	   The report said prosecutors were discussing whether to charge
the assailant with reckless endangerment, which carries a prison
sentence of up to one year.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ City leaders find themselves fumbling for
their keys.
	   After U.N. chief Kofi Annan walked away with a ceremonial key to
the city last week, city administrators found they had none left,
not even a display model, the Reforma newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   What's more officials who took office in December found no
record of who has received keys in the past _ prompting a search of
newspaper archives to find out, Reforma said.
	   The 6 1/2-inch-long (15 cms), gold-plated keys have been awarded
to visiting dignitaries since 1936.
	   A recent contest to pick a new design drew only four
submissions, none of which was thought suitable, according to Raul
Dominguez, manager of the shop which has made the keys for the past
15 years, Reforma reported.
	   The next likely recipient, French President Jacques Chirac, is
due to arrive in October.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Bob Hope gave folks at one Starbucks an added
kick with their morning coffee.
	   The entertainer showed up at the coffee store in suburban
Sherman Oaks Tuesday morning and waited on a bar stool at the
window counter while his driver got him a small drip coffee and a
pastry.
	   Customers soon began approaching Hope for autographs _ including
one on a brown paper bag and another on a comic strip hastily torn
from the morning newspaper.
	   After about 20 minutes, the 95-year-old Hope rose to leave,
prompting four men a few tables away to put down their coffees and
break into a spontaneous rendition of Hope's theme song, ``Thanks
for the Memory.''
	   It was a little off-key, but everyone smiled anyway.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI BEACH, Florida (AP) _ The Bee Gees are releasing a live
album commemorating 30 years of hits, the group announced
Wednesday.
	   The songs on ``One Night Only'' were recorded at the group's
only U.S. concert in 1997. The album will be released in September,
just weeks before an Oct. 17 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
That concert will be the group's premiere performance in Latin
America.
	   ``We have to make music we love,'' said Robin Gibb. who along
with brothers Barry and Maurice make up one of the most successful
pop groups in history. ``If you do something you love other people
might latch on to it.''
	   The brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in 1997.
	   Their last album, ``Still Waters,'' sold more than 4 million
copies worldwide.

	   HarperBusiness, a division of HarperCollins, said Wednesday it
will publish ``Direct From Dell: Strategies that Revolutionized an
Industry.''
	   Dell, 33, will tell how the company he founded in 1984 has
challenged conventional wisdom, from selling directly to consumers
to more recently selling computers via the Internet.
	   The book, which is to be released in March, is being written
with Catherine Fredman.
	   Dell began the company that bears his name by building and
selling personal computers out of his University of Texas dorm
room.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Whitney Museum of American Art has named
Maxwell L. Anderson as its new director.
	   Anderson, 42, a native New Yorker and the grandson of playwright
Maxwell Anderson, replaces David Ross, who quit four months ago to
become director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
	   Anderson will take over in September at the Whitney, which has
just completed a dlrs 30 million renovation and expansion program,
adding new galleries for its permanent collection.
	   Anderson has served for the past three years as director of the
Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto. Before that he spent six years
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Greek and Roman department and
eight years as director of the Michael C. Carlos Museum at
Atlanta's Emory University.
	   The Whitney board approved Anderson's appointment on Tuesday.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra said
Wednesday he thought President Alberto Fujimori would not run for a
third consecutive term in 2000.
	   In his annual Independence Day address to the nation Tuesday,
Fujimori did not say whether he would run again. But he said that
``at the end of my mandate in 2000, I want to leave a country that
is solid and headed on the right road.''
	   Peru's Fujimori-controlled Congress passed a controversial law
that circumvents a constitutional ban on a third straight
presidential bid, leading to speculation he was preparing another
election run.
	   Fujimori was elected as an unknown in 1990 and re-elected in a
1995 landslide. In recent years, however, his popularity has fallen
due to lingering poverty and the perception that he is
authoritarian.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A doctor who was married to a U.S. citizen
slain in January was himself shot to death Wednesday at the
hospital where he worked.
	   Dr. Ricardo Orellana was the widower of Danita Gonzalez Plank de
Orellana, a Philadelphia native who was kidnapped and murdered
January in western Guatemala.
	   National police said Ricardo Orellana, 37, was killed on the
fourth floor of the San Juan de Dios Hospital here. The attacker
fled, and it was unclear if the shooting was related to the attack
on his wife.
	   Mrs. Orellana, 32, and her 6-month-old baby daughter were
kidnapped Jan. 6 near Quetzaltenango in western Guatemala.
	   The baby was found alive inside a cardboard box. Her mother's
body was found later with a gunshot wound to the head.
	   Police arrested several suspects, but all were freed because of
a lack of evidence.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The National Human Rights Commission called
on the attorney general's office Wednesday to wipe out the use of
unofficial, unpaid assistants by the federal judicial police.
	   Those assistants, known as ``godmothers,'' are almost always
associated with corruption. They depend on their police sponsors
for pay _ generally the shared spoils of payoffs or extortion.
	   Many are former policemen who were fired for crimes or violence.
	   The commission urged Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar to
act ``to eradicate ... in a definitive way the use of civilians
known as `godmothers' in the investigation and prosecution of
crimes.''
	   Madrazo, a former chief of the human rights agency, has called
for ending the practice as part of broader efforts to wipe out
corruption.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela has denied political asylum
to a former Peruvian official who took refuge in Venezuela's
embassy in Lima three days ago, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Guido Pennano, who served as Peru's Industry Minister from 1990
to 1995, claimed he was being persecuted because he had criticized
officials in the administration of President Alberto Fujimori.
	   Pennano is under investigation for tax fraud for the equivalent
of (dlrs) 400,000 in connection with two agriculture companies he
ran after leaving the government.
	   Venezuela determined that Pennano is not a victim of political
persecution and that Peru's courts should decide the tax fraud
issue, said Venezuela's Information Minister Fernando Egana.
	   Egana said he did not know when Pennano would leave Venezuela's
embassy.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Ernesto Samper accepted state
responsibility Wednesday for a series of massacres and summary
executions in which 49 people died, opening the way for the
government to compensate victims' families.
	   ``The national government wants to ... express with this act of
amends its shame for these incidents of senseless violence,''
Samper said during a memorial act attended by the families at the
presidential palace.
	   Human rights activists say state abuses have increased during
Samper's four year-tenure, which ends Aug. 7. The number of
extrajudicial killings and disappearances rose from 2,036 in 1996
to 2,416 in 1997, according to the Colombian Jurists Commission, a
human rights group.
	   Twenty-six human rights activists have also been murdered in the
past four years, said the Commission's acting director, Carlos
Rodriguez. Right-wing paramilitary death squads committed most of
those killings, he said.

Tobacco ban could cloud du Maurier future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ The future of the du Maurier remains
uncertain because the Canadian government is considering
legislation that would ban tobacco companies as title sponsors.
	   If women's golf lost the du Maurier, the LPGA would might
consider the British Women's Open for its fourth major.
	   ``It would be a disaster if we lost the du Maurier,'' said Laura
Davies, who counts the 1996 du Maurier among her four major
championships.
	   ``It seems that the government isn't looking at the wider
picture. They (du Maurier) contribute so much to the community.
They don't just sponsor golf.''
	   The du Maurier is the final major on the LPGA tour, following
the Nabisco Dinah Shore, the McDonald's LPGA Championship and the
U.S. Women's Open.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; COMING UP: &LR;  The du Maurier Classic, after two years in Ontario,
will move back to Alberta next year.
	   The tournament will be played July 26-Aug. 1, 1999 at Priddis
Greens Golf and Country Club near Calgary.
	   ``We had many courses to choose from, from across the country,''
said Jocelyne Bourassa, the only Canadian to win the LPGA tour's
fourth major, in Montreal in 1973.
	   Lorie Kane is one of 16 Canadian women, including one amateur,
entered this week.
	   ``The du Maurier Classic is very special to all the Canadians,''
she said. ``To win anything in Canada is important. This tournament
is like a homecoming to us.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LAURA'S TRAVELS: &LR;  Laura Davies is the undisputed world traveler
of golf.
	   Davies arrived Tuesday night in Canada for the du Maurier
Classic, fresh off a victory in Sweden. On Monday, it's back to
Europe for a tournament in Scotland.
	   In fact, the 34-year-old from England is in the midst of a
stretch that has her playing in 11 events, changing countries from
one week to the next _ the United States, England, Austria, Sweden,
Canada, Scotland, England, Sweden, Ireland and back to America.
	   Davies, who has won 16 times and four majors in her 10 years on
the LPGA Tour, say she might have been able to win at least five
more if not for her global travels.
	   But then, she wouldn't have it any other way.
	   ``I'm pretty happy with the 53 I've won all around the world,''
she said.
	   She earned about dlrs 30,000 by winning in Sweden last week _ Se
Ri Pak earned four times that much at the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic
in Ohio. But Davies took great delight in winning in Sweden for the
first time in 13 years.
	   ``It's lovely to win all the big money and everything,'' Davies
said. ``But there are more important things than money.''
	   The one drawback to this trip is not having a chance to hit the
casinos along the Detroit River.
	   ``First and foremost, I'm going to check out this golf course,''
she said. ``I've heard the casino is quite good. I'm sure we'll get
by there.''
	    &UR; ____ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS &LR; : The du Maurier is being played at Essex Golf &AMP; Country
Club, a course Donald Ross designed in 1929 and remodeled by Arthur
Hills in 1969. Bruce and Jerry Matthews did a touch up in 1976. ...
Essex hosted the Canadian Open in 1976 when Jerry Pate held off a
field that included Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom
Watson, Ray Floyd and Johnny Miller. Pate still holds the
competitive course record with his closing 63.

Wave of boat immigrants shows problems of `border-free' Europe

	   LAMPEDUSA, Italy (AP) _ The desperate who sail by night from
Tunisian ports to this wind-swept speck of an island are kept out
of sight of the tourists.
	   They are caught and crowded into barracks doubling as a holding
center. When that fills up, military planes whisk the illegal
immigrants away to elsewhere in Italy. Yet another temporary
shelter for the unwelcome was hastily thrown together Wednesday in
Sicily.
	   This summer's wave of clandestine job-seekers to southern
Italian shores is aggravating an unresolved dilemma: How should the
new ``border-free'' Europe deal with the unwanted seeking a better
life?
	   Encouraged by good sailing weather, more than 3,000 would-be
immigrants were caught arriving on southern shores in July alone _
nearly as many as arrived in the first six months of the year.
	   Now, by the hundreds, and with tempers sometimes flaring, they
await expulsion back to Morocco, Tunisia, Sierra Leone or other
poor African countries.
	   Illegal immigrants from Africa pay about U.S. dlrs 2,000 to
smugglers who cram them into barely seaworthy fishing boats bound
for Italy, which has long coastlines that are particularly enticing
to those bound for Europe.
	   Lampedusa is one of the easiest points to reach, 120 nautical
miles from Sicily, but only half that from Tunisia.
	   The immigrants don't expect to hide on Lampedusa's eight square
miles (20 square kilometers) of mainly flat rock, but they see
reaching Italian soil as tantamount to getting a foothold in
France, Switzerland, Germany and other points north where relatives
and jobs await.
	   Until this year, that was largely true.
	   In the past, Italy would hand illegal immigrants expulsion
papers giving them 15 days to leave, but make little effort to
actually expel them.
	   But after howls from Germany and others that too many Kurds were
reaching them via Italy's largely unpatrolled coasts, Rome cracked
down.
	   ``Before when the immigrants came, we islanders would give them
blankets, something to eat from our house. They left the next
day,'' said hotelier Giovanni Cappello.
	   Now they are confined to sweltering detention centers. Three
days ago a brawl broke out over a sandwich in the center in
Lampedusa, which holds 146 men. As a result, on Tuesday they
started getting hot meals.
	   ``We can't keep them in locked-up barracks. It's not humane,''
said Luigi Vallone, the mayor of a small Sicilian town vacationing
in Lampedusa. ``We need a diplomatic solution.''
	   But this country is now trying to live up to its obligations
under the Schengen agreement, which requires members to control
Europe's external borders so that its internal borders can remain
open. So Italy is seeing that the immigrants are escorted home.
	   The system doesn't always work.
	   Coast guard commander Michele Niosi said Tunisia quit escorting
returnees in December.
	   ``The other day, we had 60 immigrants ... in a boat meant for
four fishermen. We waited hours for the Tunisians to arrive,'' he
said. ``They never answered our radio calls.''
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's trip to Rabat this week
produced an agreement for Morocco to take back its immigrants; on
Wednesday more than 100 people were flown home. But Dini's visit to
Tunis failed to bring results.
	   In the meantime, many in Lampedusa worry that their livelihood
is threatened. The tourist season runs from May to September _ also
prime immigrant season.
	   ``My friends call me on my cellphone to say, `We just saw on TV
that another 200 arrived. Be careful,''' Vallone said from the
shade of his beach umbrella.
	   August looks grim. Hoteliers report up to 30 percent vacancies
in the peak, always-booked-solid month.

Internet child porn scandal disgusts the Dutch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note contents. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ This is Holland's summer of shame.
	   The discovery of a Netherlands-based ring that trafficked in the
most shocking kinds of child _ even infant _ pornography on the
Internet has unleashed a lurid scandal, which gained momentum with
the firing of a Justice Ministry official who allegedly downloaded
child porn for personal use.
	   With ties to Germany, Italy and the United States, the case has
brought calls for the revival of anti-porn vice squads and a more
aggressive approach to electronic smut.
	   The public outrage stands in contrast to the generally tolerant
attitude toward personal vice in the Netherlands, where
prostitution and use of ``soft'' drugs like marijuana are legal.
	   But the Dutch are not ready to tolerate the pornography
discovered on computer drives and diskettes in mid-July, when
police raided a cluttered apartment in the sleepy North Sea town of
Zandvoort and the scandal broke.
	   The apartment owner, convicted German pedophile Gerrie Ulrich,
49, was shot to death in Pisa, Italy, in June, allegedly by a rival
gang member. Dutch authorities are seeking extradition of the
slaying suspect, Robert van der Plancken, 24, of Belgium.
	   The seized materials include digital photos and video that
depict children as young as 12 months old being raped and
sodomized. Among the films is one titled ``Oh Daddy,'' in which
balding, middle-aged men have intercourse with 5-year-old and
8-year-old girls, one of whom appears to have been so heavily
drugged that some experts fear she may have been dead.
	   This week, the scandal took a startling new turn. A top employee
of the Justice Ministry, which is leading the investigation, was
ousted for downloading child pornography from his office computer
for personal use.
	   The case has shattered the tranquility of the summer holidays
and erased lingering exuberance over the national soccer team's
ascent to the World Cup semifinals. Newspapers blare the latest
developments, feeding a national obsession for details.
	   It echoes the uproar in Belgium over apparent police ineptitude
that let a serial child rapist and killer, Marc Dutroux, prey on
young girls for years, and even escape briefly in April.
	   Now the Dutch, many of whom were openly smug about their
neighbors' troubles, are trying to come to terms with the hard-core
child porn being traded in their country, even at the highest
levels of law and order.
	   ``The Internet is a place where anything can happen, and a lot
of people like this stuff,'' said Christine Karman, a mother of two
who runs an Amsterdam child pornography hotline. ``I'm afraid this
is just the tip of the iceberg.''
	   ``Sometimes what you see makes you sick. Sometimes I can't sleep
at night,'' she said Wednesday.
	   Authorities say little if any of the material seized in
Zandvoort was actually produced in the Netherlands; they think much
of it came from central and eastern Europe and originally was
posted on the World Wide Web in the United States.
	   Though possession of child pornography carries a maximum
sentence of six years' imprisonment in the Netherlands, traffickers
are difficult to catch. Pedophiles who once posted illicit images
openly on World Wide Web home pages now shelter in Internet chat
rooms, hiding behind fake names and bogus e-mail addresses.
	   That has led to calls for stricter controls on Internet
providers and a more coordinated, Europe-wide approach to the
darker corners of cyberspace.
	   This week, the leader of the Christian Democrat party called for
the reinstatement of vice squads that up until a few years ago were
deployed to make sure pornography didn't go too far. They have
since been absorbed into another police force.
	   ``You have to catch them in the act, and only police can do
that,'' said Karman, a software engineer. ``But the police, at
least here, don't have the knowledge to fight child pornography on
the Internet.''
	   Amid the hoopla, there is some caution against trashing the
global computer network that has cemented this small country's ties
with the rest of the world.
	   ``This is giving the impression that the Internet is loaded with
child pornography,'' said Fred Eisner, chairman of the Dutch
Association of Internet Providers. ``That really isn't the case.
You have to consciously hunt it down.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It didn't take long for the defending women's
beach volleyball champions at the Goodwill Games to find out that
four-year-old titles don't count for much with the referees.
	   The San Diego pair of Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan lost to
Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of Australia 15-10 Wednesday in
a preliminary group opener marked by arguments over officials'
calls.
	   The Americans trailed 6-0 and 10-2 before running off six points
in a row to get within 10-8, and trailed 12-10 before Manser hit
three straight kills.
	   ``It (the loss) puts us in a tougher spot,'' Masakayan said.
``We're going to have to beat both of the teams we still have to
play.''
	   That includes Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil, the
world's top-ranked team, who opened with a 15-1 win over Canada's
Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont.
	   Two referees' calls went against Masakayan and Kirby, No. 7 in
the world, including a reversal of a sideline out that would have
cut the deficit to 10-9.
	   ``That was pretty crucial,'' Masakayan said.
	   Pottharst and Manser, ranked No. 6, said the Americans were just
looking for an edge.
	   ``I think Liz and Karolyn were searching for some help, and when
there are calls that are close and you're not playing so well, you
sometimes wish it would go your way,'' Manser said.
	   The highest-ranked U.S. pair, No. 4 Lisa Arce and Holly McPeak
of Manhattan Beach, Calif., be Italy's Laura Bruschini and
Annamaria Solazzi 15-4.
	   Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of German opened the
tournament with a 15-4 victory over Eva Celbova and Sona
Dosoudilova of the Czech Republic.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SOME SANDBOX: &LR;  The beach volleyball court in Central Park,
praised by the men's players last week, drew raves again as the
women's tournament began.
	   The court is made of 1 million pounds of Canadian sand dumped on
the concrete of an ice-skating rink on the southern edge of Central
Park.
	   Players have complimented the quality of the surface, saying it
feels like a real beach, and the backdrop of shade trees and the
looming skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan.
	   ``It has to be the nicest venue,'' Australia's Pauline Manser
said. ``It's the best beach we've been on. The sand is perfect.''
	   ``This is probably the 'funest' place we've ever played,'' added
Germany's Danja Musch. ``It's just great to sit there during time
outs watching the skyscrapers.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THE DEVINE MS. L: &LR;  Anyone paging a Ms. Lee at the opening night
of Goodwill Games swimming might have been overwhelmed with
responses.
	   The surnames of the four athletes in the women's 800-meter
freestyle between the United States and China were Lee, Li, Lees
and Luo.
	   The Americans were Jean Lee of Valrico, Florida and Jennifer
Lees of Pleasanton, California, while the Chinese were Li Yan and
Luo Ping.

Japan's Hashimoto resigns; Obuchi to win Parliament vote for prime

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet
resigned en masse on Thursday, paving the way for a vote in
Parliament later in the day nearly certain to choose ruling party
nominee Keizo Obuchi as Japan's new premier.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party controls the 500-seat lower house,
which can overrule the 252-member upper house in a vote for
premier. The upper house is dominated by opposition parties, and
could pick another candidate, possibly popular Democratic party
leader Naoto Kan.
	   The new prime minister will take over an economy wallowing in
its worst recession since the end of World War II and a government
led by a party battling internal divisions and an increasingly
popular opposition.
	   Obuchi, widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative
ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after meeting with Miyazawa, 78, on Wednesday afternoon.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister from 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's
plan to bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in
the Tokyo markets this week and helped strengthen the yen against
the U.S. dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters.
Hashimoto was forced to announce his resignation after the LDP was
routed in July 12 elections for the upper house, and the party's
approval ratings are at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is
going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is the
ultimate insider.''
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, was expected to be named director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency.

Those who lived war moved by `Saving Private Ryan'

<TEXT>
	   GILBERT, Arizona (AP) _ Ed Porter cried at the scene in ``Saving
Private Ryan'' in which a soldier walked across Omaha Beach,
clutching his own severed arm.
	   For the first time in years, Porter recalled the horrific
moments he endured as a staff sergeant more than a half-century
ago. Tears came with memories of the soldier he found lying on that
beach, also clutching his severed arm, looking up at Porter as if
asking what to do.
	   Porter's only answer was a dose of morphine, easing the
soldier's death.
	   ``It brought back stuff that I'd never remembered, stuff that
happened that I'd brushed out of my mind,'' said Porter, a retired
Tacoma, Washington, policeman now living in suburban Phoenix. ``It
brought it back like a flash. Like I was there.''
	   Director Steven Spielberg has said the film's graphic
re-enactment is his tribute to those who fought and a message to
viewers about the real brutality of war.
	   Harry Pruden of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was a crewman on a
Navy landing craft at Utah Beach, said Spielberg's movie was an
exceptional picture. But, he added, there always will be a
difference between his experience and a war brought to the screen
by Hollywood.
	   ``It was a good movie, but I wouldn't say it made me feel like I
was in combat again,'' Pruden said. ``We knew going in that this is
a movie, and no movie can really do that.''
	   But for some D-Day veterans, the movie is a visceral reminder of
what they lived through decades ago. And for those like Porter, it
is too graphic, too real.
	   ``I don't know why they put a film out like that,'' he said.
	   Joe Perotti Sr., a World War II paratrooper now living in
Tombstone, Arizona, agreed.
	   ``I was hoping I would find a lot of fault with it,'' said
Perotti, who landed behind German lines before the Normandy
landings. ``I want to say that it's just a war movie, but it's too
close to being realistic.''
	   Anticipating emotional reactions, the Department of Veterans
Affairs kept a telephone hotline open over the weekend and received
more than 100 calls by Monday night.
	   VA spokeswoman Laurie Tranter said the 1986 debut of the graphic
Vietnam War film ``Platoon'' was the only other time the department
used its hotline to field calls from veterans upset about a movie.
The hotline, which distributes benefits information, is normally
closed over the weekend.
	   Nancy Scott, a psychologist at the VA Medical Center in Phoenix,
suggested that veterans avoid war movies that can trigger painful
memories.
	   ``Just the colors, the movements _ all of those _ will be very
strong symbols of remembrances of what it was like,'' Scott said.
	   Bud Pyler of Phoenix is following that advice. A soldier in the
Pacific during World War II, he refuses to see the movie.
	   ``I lost a lot of buddies over there. I don't need to bring back
that nasty stuff,'' he said. ``It's something I can talk about, but
I wouldn't want to see it.''

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Since 1903, the only things have
have halted the Tour de France have been the two World Wars.
	   Now, the Tour is verge of stopping again. Race organizers are
scrambling to find solutions to save this year's edition with the
angry reaction over the police tactics threatening to disrupt the
race.
	   Riders have caused protests in two different stages. One team
has been thrown out of the race and three others quit in protest.
At least five have been searched by police who have showed little
respect for them, the riders have said.
	   Wednesday's 17th stage will rank as one of the most chaotic in
the Tour's history.
	   After starting out in Albertville and going through the motions
for the first hour or so, the pack slowed and stopped _ ironically
just past one of the sprint banners which usually has some of the
fastest action of the race.
	   After dicussion, the pack restarted, only to stop again.
	   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour's director, assured the riders that
further police action would be carried out ``with a maximum of
dignity ... at the hotels of the concerned teams and not at police
stations.''
	   Riders ``merit reaching the apotheosis Sunday in Paris on the
Champs Elysees,'' Leblanc said.
	   With that the riders took off again only to please the public.
	   However the public had mixed emotions. Some shouted at the
riders and made angry gestures. Others cheered.
	   The riders ended the day's stage more than two and a half hours
behind schedule in Aix-les-Bain. Many of the riders were holding
hands as they crossed the finish line with the Dutch team TVM
leading the pack.
	   Tour judge Joel Menard announced that the stage was annulled. He
said only the 116 riders who crossed the line could continue the
competition Thursday. The three-week Tour is set to end Sunday in
Paris.
	   The TVM affair was the latest focal point that caussed the rider
revolt.
	   TVM riders were searched and had to give blood and urine samples
in lengthy medical tests that lasted until midnight with the riders
set to go off on another mountain stage on Wednesday
	   ``We're not animals. Everyone, including police, should treat us
like normal people,'' said the Dane Bjarne Riis of the Deutsche
Telekom team and winner of the 1996 Tour.
	   ``What we did today was to save the Tour, save cycling because
it's our life,'' Riis said, referring to the slowdown protest.
	   ``They're robbing our dreams ...,'' said Thierry Bourguignon of
the TVM team. ``I have the impression the Tour is finished. I'm
sick.''
	   Riis has turned into the rider's spokesman after Laurent
Jalabert, France's top rider, quit.
	   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Jalabert said on France Info radio.
	   Jalabert had led the riders' protest on Friday when the race was
delayed two hours in starting.
	   Even after the protests the police came.
	   About 100 police descended on team hotels around the Alpine town
of Chambery for searches of the Casino team, ONCE, La Francaise des
Jeux and Polti.
	   On Wednesday night, police in nearby Chambery detained Casino
team coach Vincent Lavenu following a search of the team hotel.
	   Police were seen removing garbage bags full of objects from a
van bearing the ONCE insignia during a four-hour investigation of
the team that ended at nearing midnight.
	   By that time the ONCE team was no longer on the Tour, not even
being part of the slowdown. Two other teams, Banesto and
Riso-Scotti, followed ONCE out of the race.
	   Other riders protested by removing their number but still were
in the race.
	   Italian Marco Pantani, the overall leader at the start of the
stage, was one of the first to remove his number, at the 32nd
kilometer (20th mile). ``The pack stopped because they are
continuing to persecute the riders ...,'' he said.
	   This year's Tour has been plagued with doping allegations since
its July 11 start in Dublin, Ireland.
	   TVM entered the police spotlight when it emerged that EPO was
found in the car of a team official in March.
	   Festina was thrown out of the Tour after its director admitted
an organized plan to administer banned substances to the riders to
improve performances.
	   Since, at least five Festina riders admitted using EPO. Festina
star, Richard Virenque, has denied using drugs.

Boats ferry commuters in Bangladesh's flooded towns

	   NARAYANGANJ, Bangladesh (AP) _ Boatmen, not motorists, ferry
commuters in this flood-hit town, where many streets have turned
into canals.
	   Schools are closed and attendance at work has dropped by at
least 30 percent since the River Sitalakya overflowed into this
industrial town of 300,000 people, 10 miles (15 kilometers) east of
Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital.
	   Barring the main highway that links Narayanganj with Dhaka,
small streets and lanes are up to waist-high water.
	   For three weeks, torrential monsoon rains have lashed
Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 10 years has claimed at
least 208 lives and marooned another 10 million. The overflowing
rivers _ the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna _ have inundated 36 of
the 64 districts.
	   As a result, from marooned people to relief workers, every one
is now using boats.
	   And carpenters are working overtime making boats instead of
furniture.
	   ``Who needs furniture now? People want more boats,'' said
carpenter Monir Hossain as he hammered nails into a boat he was
making.
	   Prices of a small boat have almost doubled to 10,000 takas (US
dlrs 220), according to Hossain. ``We are now selling an average of
three boats a day,'' he said.
	   Flood waters from the north run down into the country's central
and southern parts even as the swelling rivers flow through
Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal.
	   On Wednesday, water receded in some northern districts, but
water levels rose in central and southern Bangladesh, according to
the Flood Forecasting Center in Dhaka.
	   Weather experts said this year's floods are serious because of
erratic rainfall during the monsoon months of June and July.
	   Up to 1,087 millimeters (42 inches) of rain fell in the northern
region in the past 10 days. That's 38 percent more than the normal
downpour for this time of the year, Sajedur Rahman, a top weather
official said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ It wasn't raining hard. Nor was the wind strong.
And it wasn't exactly cold.
	   But the weather conditions had enough of each to put a damper on
the evening for the Gaz de France meet Wednesday.
	   The star performers such as Marion Jones, Donovan Bailey and
Hicham El Guerrouj won. But none threatened their bests.
	   In a men's 100 that featured the top performers of the past two
seasons, world recordholder and Olympic champion Donovan Bailey won
in 10.02. Ato Boldon was second in 10.10 followed by Frankie
Fredericks, 10.11. World champion Maurice Greene, never in the
race, was eighth in 10.39.
	   Bailey has the world record of 9.84.
	   It was the first meeting for Bailey, Greene and Boldon since an
ill-will 100 in the Goodwill Games.
	   Greene won there in 9.96, running into a wind, edging Boldon.
What angered Greene was Bailey's matter of not racing when Bailey
saw he was beaten.
	   Bailey said he wasn't bothered by what Greene thought.
	   ``If I sat and read what others thought of me or what the media
said, then I would be running 10.5,'' Bailey said.
	   This time it was Greene seeming to cut his effort when he was
well back.
	   El Guerrouj had his poorest performance of the season and missed
the world record by nearly five seconds in the mile.
	   ``The rabbits were good but there was a little wind,'' El
Guerrouj said. ``But I wasn't into it after 600 meters.''
	   The Moroccan, who had been hoping for a world mark, did 3
minutes, 49.01 seconds, well off Noureddine Morceli's three-year
old mark of 3:44.39. El Guerrouj ran 3:44.60 July 16 in Nice.
	   By 1,200 meters, with El Guerrouj passing in 2:50, the record
seemed out of reached. Even more when El Guerrouj barely broke 59
seconds for the final lap.
	   ``I was even having trouble finishing the last lap but I wanted
to finish, '' he said.
	   El Guerrouj, the indoor and outdoor world champion, broke
Morceli's 1,500-meter mark by 1.37 seconds with 3:26.00 on July 14.
	   In other events, Marion Jones set a meet record of 10.88 in the
women's 100, the 12th time she has under 11.00 this year. She held
off the rising French star Christine Aaron, second in 10.98.
	   It was far from Jones' best of the season. She did 10.71 earlier
in the season.
	   Jones came back later in the evening to win the long jump in
6.97 meters duplicating her double at the U.S. championships.
	   Jones was pleased with the victory over world champion Fiona May
of Italy and former Olympic champion Heike Drechsler of Germany.
	   ``I am happy with the performance because I don't have a chance
to work on it so much,'' Jones said.
	   Jeff Hartwig of the United States won the pole vault. Although
the field was loaded with members of the ``6-meter club'',
Hartwig's victory at 5.78 was a modest effort. Hartwig recently set
the American mark of 6.01 meters.

	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Riverbanks Zoo and Garden is
like a slice of rain forest tucked among the downtown skyline of
South Carolina's capital city, the Saluda River and a busy freeway
to the suburbs.
	   With more than 15 million visitors since opening in 1974, the
zoo is the largest public attraction in South Carolina and has been
ranked among the top five North American zoos for its support of
programs of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association.
	   This summer, for the second year, the theme of this 170-acre
(68-hectare) zoo is butterflies.
	   ``Jewels of the Sky,'' a 3,200 square-foot (297-square-meter)
butterfly garden, features swallowtails, monarchs, painted ladies,
zebra longwings and other varieties. They fly freely through the
screen-encased exhibit and sometimes even land on visitors.
	   The winding swath of trees and flowers is made up of
butterfly-attracting varieties such as lantana, bottlebrush and
milkweed.
	   ``We've come to realize, just as amusement parks that add a new
roller coaster or exciting exhibit every year, the public expects
it,'' said zoo spokeswoman Mary Leverette. ``This gives us an
`oomph' for the season.''
	   The butterflies at Riverbanks arrive from The Butterfly Farm in
Florida as chrysalises, the cocooned stage between the larva and
adult, and are put in a display box for visitors to observe.
	   The butterfly garden idea evolved from a trip to the Vancouver
Aquarium.
	   ``A few butterflies flew through the reptile exhibit and people
were more interested in the butterflies than the crocodiles and
snakes,'' Leverette said.
	   The butterflies here live only about a week, but a steady supply
of new ones means there are always 300 flying in the exhibit.
	   Riverbanks' permanent collections include an aquarium and
reptile complex, an African plains exhibit and mammal complexes.
About 200 mammals, 300 birds, 300 reptiles and amphibians and 1,300
fish live at Riverbanks.
	   A 55,000-gallon (208,197-liter) aquarium filled with sharks,
moray eels and other Pacific species is a highlight of the tropics
and ocean gallery. Feeding time at the sea lion and penguin
exhibits is another crowd pleaser.
	   Five years ago, Riverbanks was named the 1993 Travel Attraction
of the Year by the Southeast Tourism Association and three years
ago it added the dlrs 7.2 million, 70-acre (28-hectare) botanical
garden across the river with walking trails, a rose garden and a
walled garden reminiscent of a Spanish hacienda.
	   ``All rolled into one, we're not the biggest, not the most
expensive, but what we have is top-notch,'' Leverette said.

Hair today, wig tomorrow: Donors give locks to children in need

	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Lisa Taylor wrung her hands in
her lap and choked back tears. Her heart raced and her breathing
was labored as she gazed straight ahead, not wanting to see what
was going on behind her.
	   This was no ordinary haircut.
	   Taylor, 38, had spent 10 years growing her strawberry blonde
hair down past her waist _ to 28 inches (71 centimeters) in length.
	   But when she learned about Locks of Love, an organization that
turns donations of real hair into wigs for sick children, she
decided she could spare a few strands.
	   ``It was for kids that didn't have hair,'' she said, her voice
trembling as a stylist chopped off a foot-long (30-centimeter-long)
ponytail from her mane. ``And mine will grow back.''
	   That's not the case for the children who receive the special
wigs. Most have alopecia areata, a disease of the autoimmune system
that causes hair loss. It can range from patchy spots on their
heads to total body hair loss.
	   Other children have suffered severe burns or lost their hair
during treatment for cancer.
	   Peggy Knight understands the trauma baldness can cause for kids.
	   At age 14, alopecia areata robbed her of the hair on her head,
arms and her eyebrows. She founded Locks of Love a year ago after a
childhood friend, now an adult, grew her hair and gave it to
Knight.
	   ``She said, `It was so difficult to watch you endure all the
teasing as a child,''' Knight said.
	   Since it began, the Fort Lauderdale-based nonprofit group has
provided about 35 of the dlrs 3,000 wigs to children who can't
afford the special hair prosthetics. Knight also has a for-profit
company which sells wigs.
	   So far, more than 2,500 bundles of hair have been donated, and
they've come from far and wide.
	   Kasey Anderson, an 8-year-old Girl Scout from Fairhope, Alabama,
snipped off her 24-inch (60-centimeter) locks in February. Her
reasoning: ``This is what Jesus would do if he could do it. Why not
me do it?''
	   Donors must be able to provide at least 10 inches (25
centimeters) of hair bundled in a pony tail or braid. It must be
perfectly dry and not overly damaged by color or treatment. It can
be mailed in a plastic bag in a padded envelope.
	   It takes a dozen pony tails to make one wig. A mold is taken of
each child's head, and then a silicon cap _ something like a
swimming cap _ is made and dyed the proper complexion of their
scalp. A wig maker in New Zealand carefully applies each donated
strand of hair individually to the cap _ a process that takes four
months for each wig.
	   Jennifer Milian thinks it will be worth the wait.
	   The 16-year-old from Bartlett, Tennessee, has alopecia
universalis _ a total loss of hair on her body. It began with
clumps falling out of her head at age 8, then grew back with some
treatments. By the eighth grade, she lost it all.
	   She began wearing a wig. But it was made of synthetic hair and
looked anything but natural. Her classmates were curious, sometimes
cruel.
	   ``That's the one I got teased with,'' she said. ``It was really
noticeable, it didn't move.''
	   The benefit of the Locks of Love wigs is they're made with real
hair and can be cut and styled. Jennifer was overwhelmed when she
learned strangers would donate hair to help her.
	   ``I really appreciate the fact that they cut their hair,'' she
said. ``I wish I could say more than thanks to them.''
	   Brian McGowan, 32, said knowing he was helping a sick child was
thanks enough. Stylist Steve Ramsey at Cut And Dry salon in West
Palm Beach recently ran a razor across McGowan's thick, dark brown
pony tail _ leaving him about 10 inches (25 centimeters) lighter.
	   ``It's going to a good cause _ it's for kids, and I'm sure at
that age it's tough not to have a full head of hair,'' McGowan
said.
	   In the next chair, Taylor was a bit more emotional about her
donation. She broke into tears after the clipping was done.
	   ``The people that are donating their hair, it's almost like
they're giving a part of themselves to somebody,'' Ramsey said.
``It's almost like they're getting a limb cut off.''
	   For those who do not have long enough hair, some area salons
have donated free haircuts in exchange for a monetary donation to
Locks of Love.
	   Knight said she hopes her organization's efforts eventually will
attract a corporate sponsor.
	   ``We're hair rich and cash poor,'' she said.

Rat experiment suggests possible treatment for Parkinson's disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A rat experiment suggests scientists might
someday grow and harvest human fetal brain cells in the laboratory
for transplantation, rather than having to get them from several
fetuses for each transplant.
	   Brain cell transplants are being studied for treating
Parkinson's disease and may be useful for other disorders. But
getting the cells from human fetuses raises ethical objections, as
well as technical concerns such as supply.
	   The new study started out with primitive brain cells from rat
embryos. In the laboratory, these cells were prodded into
multiplying greatly and maturing into the type that's useful for
treating Parkinson's. The matured cells, when transplanted into
rats, greatly reduced the effect of brain damage that serves as an
experimental stand-in for Parkinson's disease.
	   Once scientists improve the laboratory technology, they might be
able to create large stocks of human brain cells in the lab for
transplantation, said the study's senior author, Ronald McKay of
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in
Bethesda, Maryland.

 &UR; Scientists say they have found way to mimic seashells
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ Scientists are mimicking one of
nature's most durable creations _ the seashell.
	   The project is still in the laboratory stage _ a long way from
commercial use. But its creators say it eventually could be used to
provide a tough first coat of paint for a car, or a thin
light-sensitive coating for windows that darkens in bright
sunlight.
	   The shells of abalone and other mollusks _ delicately layered
yet incredibly tough _ have long been the envy of human researchers
trying to make hard materials for special jobs.
	   Sandia National Laboratories scientist Alan Sellinger and
colleagues at the labs and the University of New Mexico, announced
their findings in the July 16 edition of the British scientific
journal Nature.
	   Mollusks use unremarkable materials to make their remarkable
shells _ primarily calcium carbonate, the same material in chalk,
Sellinger said.
	   But shells are much harder than chalk. Abalone pulls off that
trick by adding alternating layers of calcium carbonate and
molecules of a protein substance, Sellinger said.
	   Mimicking the process in labs took 15 years of scientific
effort.
	   Sellinger and his colleagues used a novel trick. Instead of
trying to build up the layers one at a time, they used a well-known
property of substances called ``surfactants'' to do the job.
	   Those are the same kind of substance found in dishwashing
detergents. They work on dishes by building molecular cages around
the grease molecules. Once they're caged, they can easily be washed
away.
	   Sellinger and his colleagues used the technique to build
molecular cages around the materials that makes up their synthetic
shell. The surfactants then chemically do the work of lining up the
caged materials into neat, thin layers.

 &UR; Unfamiliar jellyfish found along south Florida beaches
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Silent, nearly invisible marauders are inflicting
pain on beachgoers in at least three southeast Florida counties,
floating in packs and delivering a nasty sting.
	   Scientists believe the culprits are box jellyfish. Common in the
Caribbean and Indo-Pacific waters, they're usually rare along
Florida coasts. But they arrived along Palm Beach, Broward and
Miami-Dade county shores last month.
	   The same conditions that washed the jellyfish into unfamiliar
territory may be responsible for cooling a swath of the Gulf of
Mexico off the Florida Panhandle. University of Miami oceanographer
Thomas Lee said the Loop Current, which normally takes warm water
from the Caribbean to the northern Gulf, is instead delivering to
the tip of Florida.
	   ``This is something that I have never seen before,'' said Lee,
who has studied currents around Florida for 30 years. ``The current
has shifted and it shows no signs of reforming.''
	   The box jellyfish's venom is more powerful than that of the
usual south Florida jellyfish. Victims itch and burn as long as
three weeks after being stung by one of the newcomers.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks advance in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Thursday
on lingering uncertainty over the fate of Japanese financial
reforms. Tokyo stock prices advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 142.53 yen in early trading, up 1.44 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
142.35 yen overnight.
	   Japan's Parliament will elect a new prime minister later in the
day as incumbent Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet resigned
Thursday morning. Hashimoto quit to take responsibility for a
devastating loss in July 12 elections for the upper house.
	   Incoming premier Keizo Obuchi, foreign minister under Hashimoto,
is virtually certain to be selected as his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party controls the powerful lower house.
	   The yen came under selling pressure following news Wednesday
that former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, will serve as the
new finance minister.
	   Miyazawa, the key figure in the government's plan to bail out
its banking system, is seen by some, however, as being part of a
conservative old guard that won't be aggressive in carrying out
bold reforms to solve Japan's economic woes.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices moved higher, with
investors taking the Miyazawa appointment positively on hopes that
the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 133.62 points, or 0.83
percent, to 16,291.71 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Wednesday, the average gained 43.55 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.26 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,251.96
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.275 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's
finish. Its price also remained unchanged at 111.27 yen.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India and Pakistan have ended a
yearlong stalemate by agreeing to resume stalled talks on their
territorial and other disputes, but Kashmir could remain
contentious.
	   Foreign secretaries of the two South Asian neighbors were
preparing to resume talks Thursday to work out how to handle the
issue of Kashmir. Pakistan has said Kashmir needs to be linked with
all other issues in discussions with India, including the nuclear
arms race.
	   ``Kashmir is the core issue. The sooner it is resolved, it is
better for the two countries,'' Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said after his Wednesday's meeting with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was their first meeting since the
countries conducted tit for tat nuclear tests in May.
	   Thursday's talks between the countries' top foreign ministry
officials will be the first since June, 1997, when negotiations
broke down over the importance of Kashmir. The region was the cause
of two wars between the neighbors and is where fighting between
Muslim separatists and Indian military has killed more than 15,500
people.
	   Kashmir, which was a Hindu kingdom with a Muslim majority before
the first war in 1948, is now split, with India controlling
two-third of the territory. Pakistan demands international
mediation to settle the dispute since it believes it is at a
disadvantage in one-to-one talks with a bigger and more powerful
neighbor. New Delhi rejects any outside interference.
	   Pakistan also wants residents of both Indian and Pakistan-held
Kashmir to be allowed to vote to chose which country they want to
belong to. Such a plebiscite, as outlined in U.N. resolutions from
the 1940s, is opposed by India.
	   The two leaders met in Sri Lankan capital on the sidelines of
the seven-nation South Asian summit, which opened Wednesday.
	   ``I had a very good meeting,'' Sharif said, but added that India
needed to show more flexibility on the question of Kashmir, the
disputed Himalayan territory over which the two countries have
fought two of their three wars.
	   ``Nawaz Sharif and I have agreed that the dialogue process
should be resumed,'' said Vajpayee after their meeting.
	   The agreement to resume talks was intended to ease tensions that
had heightened after the underground nuclear explosions.
	   It also was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government took office in March,
pledging to step up the fight against what India calls a
Pakistan-backed insurgency by Muslim separatists in Kashmir.
Pakistan denies active involvement but says it gives diplomatic and
political support to the militants.
	   On Thursday, Sharif and Vajpayee will join leaders from
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and host Sri Lanka for a
traditional retreat to the resort of Bentota, 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Colombo.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ From skimpily clad revelers to
Bible-toting evangelists, the 1998 Gay Games are drawing an
eclectic crowd for weeklong festivities celebrating gay pride and
culture.
	   With the theme ``Friendship Through Culture and Sports,'' the
quadrennial Olympics-style sports festival begins Saturday,
offering competitors everything from ballroom dancing to wrestling
and more cerebral pastimes such as bridge and chess.
	   This is the first time the Gay Games are being held in Europe
since they began in San Francisco in 1982. New York City hosted the
last Games in 1994; Sydney, Australia, host of the mainstream
Summer Olympics in 2000, will have the first southern hemisphere
Gay Games in 2002.
	   Saturday evening's opening ceremony will feature the Israeli
transsexual pop star Dana International, who gained fame _ and
notoriety _ in May after winning the 25-nation Eurovision song
contest and incensing Orthodox Jewish leaders at home.
	   Some 30 competitions will be staged at these games, which run
through Aug. 8. Up to 14,000 participants and 200,000 visitors are
expected.
	   Amsterdam is renowned for its tolerance of alternative
lifestyles and its lively gay community. Still, there weren't many
signs of the games in the run-up, apart from some posters and a few
more same-sex couples than usual strolling arm in arm along the
canals.
	   One top attraction officially has nothing to do with the Gay
Games: Saturday's yearly canal parade of decorated boats. Games
organizers promise a flotilla of participants on the city's famous
medieval waterways.
	   Participants have been warned to refrain from ``exhibitionism
and sexual behavior'' in public or at gatherings. Art exhibits,
symposiums on gay and lesbian issues and cooking shows are also
being staged in connection with the games.
	   Up to 100 representatives from the international evangelism
group Youth with a Mission plan to stage Christian-themed street
dramas and pray with participants.
	   ``God wants to care for people whether they are homosexuals or
heterosexuals,'' said YWAM spokeswoman Nelleke Bosshardt.
	   Dutchwoman Sigrid Johannisse, who will be competing in the
badminton competition, said she's searching for fun and friendship.
Even so, she hopes the Gay Games one day will disappear as
homosexuals become more accepted.
	   Although heterosexuals are welcome to compete alongside and
against homosexual athletes, few do, triggering criticism within
the gay community that the games create needless segregation.
	   ``I hate all the separation,'' said Johannisse, a 33-year-old
art historian. ``In sports, there isn't so much integration ... it
was just easier to play with gay people.''
	   Eddy Feenstra has a more carefree attitude as he prepares to
compete in ballroom and Latin American dancing with partner Tonny
Ariens.
	   Girding for victory, Feenstra has finally made up his mind about
his costume: He'll be dressed to kill in a body-hugging T-shirt and
black pants.
	   ``I am doing it for the fun,'' he said. ``I would also like to
show off what I am good at.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Trajan Langdon is a fill-in for a fill-in.
He's the new guy. The kid.
	   But the Duke senior, last off the bench for the United States at
the World Basketball Championship, is proof that depth might soon
become the team's hallmark.
	   ``What we saw tonight is that we are a team that's 12-deep.
That's one of our strengths,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
Wednesday after his charges debuted in Athens with an 83-59 rout of
Brazil. ``Our starting lineup is just the guys who start the
game.''
	   They didn't start particularly well against Brazil.
	   The Americans went more than four minutes without a field goal
and trailed by five points early. But they took over with a 13-1
run, highlighted by Langdon's pair of 3-pointers.
	   The guard's only two shots of the game hit all net.
	   ``All my teammates and the coaches say, `When you get an open
look, shoot the ball.' That's my mentality as a shooter,'' Langdon
said.
	   The United States was to play Lithuania Thursday and the other
top matchup had 1990 world champion Yugoslavia against Russia.
Other key games included Greece vs. Italy, Argentina vs. Nigeria,
and Spain vs. Australia.
	   ``That guy,'' Tomjanovich said of Langdon, ``is just solid,
fearless.''
	   Yet he nearly wasn't here.
	   Among the last players cut a week ago when Tomjanovich rushed to
put together his eclectic squad, Langdon was called up Sunday to
replace Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, who sprained an ankle.
	   Of course, neither of the two collegians, or anyone else wearing
the red-white-and-blue here, was supposed to be representing the
United States at the worlds. But the NBA labor dispute led to USA
Basketball dumping the Dream Team.
	   The five players Tomjanovich put on the court at tip-off all
play in either the CBA or European leagues. They averaged less than
17 minutes apiece Wednesday and were outscored 52-31 by the U.S.
bench players.
	   ``We've got balance. That's good. That shows that we have guys
who can pick it up and step it up at any given time,'' said Jimmy
King, the MVP in the CBA last season.
	   While most of the first day's games were lopsided, Wednesday
night produced two gems. Argentina pulled off an upset, edging
Goodwill Games runner-up Australia 66-62, while Greece treated
Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis and a crowd of about 10,000
fans who spontaneously sang the national anthem twice during the
game, to a 78-72 victory over Canada.

Team USA ponders: What's in a name?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ What's in a nickname?
	   That's what the U.S. team at the World Basketball championship
is trying to figure out. Filling in for a group of National
Basketball stars known universally by a rhyming sobriquet, the
collection of castoffs playing for the gold here has been searching
for their own moniker.
	   ``The Dream On Team, the Scream Team. We've come up with a whole
bunch of names,'' 6-foot-11 forward Wendell Alexis said with a
smile, ``but we haven't settled on one yet.''
	   One player forever linked with one of the sport's most famous
collective nicknames _ Jimmy King of Michigan Fab Five fame _ isn't
taking part in the selection process.
	   ``I don't like names,'' King said. ``We're just Team USA.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RAH, RAH: &LR;  Olympic stadium was quite quiet for the first two
games it hosted Wednesday.
	   Then Nigeria showed up.
	   About 50 green-and-white-clad fans cheered, chanted, sang and
played music from the opening tipoff to the final whistle of
Nigeria's game against Spain.
	   It was the same type of support the country's fans provided for
its soccer team last month at the World Cup in France.
	   While a mostly hushed crowd in the hundreds watched earlier
action at the 18,000-seat arena, the vociferous Nigerians created a
carnival atmosphere with their rhythmic drums and piercing horn
blasts.
	   Alas, Spain won 80-68.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RAH, RAH II: &LR;  Things were pretty sedate across town at Peace and
Friendship stadium, too.
	   Until Nick ``God'' Galis showed up.
	   The former star of the Greek national team received a boisterous
standing ovation _ replete with chants of ``Ga-Lis, Ga-Lis'' _ when
he walked along the sideline during Italy's 76-66 defeat of
Senegal.
	   It was a much louder and longer response than anything the game
itself mustered.
	   Galis, 41, averaged 30.5 points per game during an 11-year
career with Greece and helped the team to its top showing, the 1987
European championship. The shooting guard, who played at Seton
Hall, also led his club to nine Greek League titles.
	   In Galis' playing days, fans serenaded him with songs and chants
that invoked his nickname, Theos (``God'').
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOOPS DIPLOMACY: &LR;  There was nothing diplomatic about U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Burns' visit to Olympic stadium.
	   It was as unabashed rooter that Burns dropped by Team USA's
locker room after its 83-59 victory over Brazil to open the
championship.
	   ``He congratulated us on a good game,'' former Syracuse standout
Alexis said. ``He told us he's a fan of (Greek League team)
Panathinaikos and the Boston Celtics.''
	   Burns, a former State Department spokesman, has never hidden his
passion for sports, particularly baseball and the Boston Red Sox.
	   In a tongue-in-cheek pronouncement to reporters in 1996, Burns
declared Roger Clemens a ``traitor'' after the pitcher left the Red
Sox for the Toronto Blue Jays.

Chinese acrobats tumble into diplomatic dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ A troupe of Chinese acrobats has
upset a diplomatic balancing act by performing without permission
in Grenada, a Caribbean country friendly to Taiwan.
	   Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell on Wednesday called the
performance at a local hotel last week an ``alarming'' attempt by
China to expand its influence on the island. ``I consider it a
serious national security issue,'' he said during a radio talk
show.
	   Grenada is one of only 27 countries to recognize the government
of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province. Both China
and Taiwan lobby Grenada intensely for diplomatic support.
	   Mitchell said a group of visiting Chinese diplomats asked him in
May for permission to organize a performance by the troupe. He said
he did not give an answer.
	   ``In diplomatic circles, that means no. And they very well know
that,'' he said.
	   On July 22, the acrobats entered the country anyway. It was
unclear Wednesday if they were admitted on tourist visas.
	   The troupe wanted to perform at a public cultural center but
were barred by Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher because the center
was built with Taiwanese funds, Mitchell said. Instead, they gave
one show in an auditorium of the No Problem Hotel.
	   Mitchell said he would protest to China and Caribbean regional
groups.
	   ``I'm very concerned by this subtle attempt to circumvent the
democratic process in this country,'' he said. ``Having seen what
they attempted, to go behind our backs, so to speak, to do the same
thing that they were literally refused to do, it cannot sit well
with us.''
	   In the past, both Taiwan and China have been sensitive to the
slightest sign Grenada might switch sides.
	   In May, Chinese officials attending a meeting of the Caribbean
Development Bank objected when St. George's hotel hoisted a
Taiwanese flag to honor visiting dignitaries from Taiwan.
	   Hotel officials took it down after an urgent telephone call from
the Grenadian foreign ministry.

Clinton testimony: a safe political route, but a daring legal move
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After a dozen anxious days under subpoena,
President Bill Clinton finally decided that testifying to the
Monica Lewinsky grand jury was his best political course _ even if
it is a risky legal route.
	   The president will testify by videotape from the White House on
Aug. 17. But the fine print was irrelevant to Democratic lawmakers
who didn't care how Clinton testified, just as long as he talked _
and soon.
	   ``Thank God,'' said a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill who was
part of a growing chorus from the president's own party begging him
not to challenge prosecutor Kenneth Starr's subpoena.
	   Democrats in Congress had privately told the White House not to
expect their support if Clinton sparked a constitutional crisis.
They didn't want the issue to dominate the fall campaign, and
further erode their chances of recapturing the House.
	   Clinton's fellow Democrats argued that refusing to testify would
be too much for voters who were promised an explanation from their
president ``sooner, rather than later.'' That was six months ago.
They reminded the White House that first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and the president had already testified to grand juries on
Whitewater matters; it would look bad to refuse now, even under
subpoena.
	   Once the White House announced Friday that Clinton's private
attorney, David Kendall, was negotiating with Starr, the president
had only one excuse to fight the subpoena: if Starr insisted
Clinton appear in person before the grand jury. And that door
closed when Starr conceded to most of Kendall's conditions.
	   ``I have always believed that Bill Clinton will do as he has
said he would do _ he would get all the necessary information to
the independent counsel,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said
last weekend.
	   That kind of talk alarmed White House political advisers, who
had been warning that the president would need the support of
Democrats like Gephardt if the case leads to impeachment
proceedings.
	   Yet some Republicans believe Clinton could have fought the
subpoena without losing public support. ``I'm very distressed to
have to say this,'' said Republican consultant Eddie Mahe, ``but he
can get away with anything.''
	   And polls show that voters are not really paying attention to
what they consider a Washington sideshow. Even the bombshell news
of Ms. Lewinsky's immunity deal has failed so far to galvanize
public opinion.
	   ``I can't imagine there are five people in the country who are
surprised that Monica Lewinsky perjured herself in her original
affidavit and is now saying she had sex with the president,'' said
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ``Monica Lewinsky has no
credibility with the people. Ken Starr has no credibility with the
people.''
	   A new CBS News poll seemed to support Mellman. It showed most
people disapproved of the former White House intern getting
immunity, and most of those surveyed believe Starr is running a
partisan investigation.
	   Asked if the president should testify before the grand jury, 60
percent said yes. Yet four out of 10 said they would be satisfied
if he never said anything more about the allegations.
	   Democrats who work outside Washington were more likely to
believe that Clinton could take advantage of voter ambivalence and
do whatever he needed to save his neck _ even pleading the Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
	   ``I think it's just more noise. I think it's just more static in
the market place,'' said Democratic consultant Ray Strother. ``All
the delaying tactics so far have not hurt him.''
	   ``They're giggling and snickering, but nobody really cares,''
said Bill Carrick, a California Democrat.
	   So with all the mixed opinion and conflicting advice, Clinton
may have chosen the safest political route. It also may have been
the best of several rocky legal roads open to him.
	   Clinton will testify with his lawyer present, an advantage given
to no other grand jury witnesses. And the jurors will see his
smiling, earnest face on large-screen television (Brought to you
from the White House!), a forum the president has mastered.
	   Perhaps there is no better way to confront questions about an
affair with a young White House intern.
	    &UR; ___

October sanctions review looking less and less favorable to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By trying to scale back nuclear
inspections in Iraq, Russia has signaled its position for an even
greater showdown in October, when all U.N. sanctions against
Baghdad are up for review, diplomats say.
	   Such an effort this fall, like the one on Wednesday, is sure to
face strong U.S. and British objections unless Baghdad comes
forward with concrete evidence that it has abandoned its nuclear
program and given full disclosure about foreign assistance to the
program.
	   ``There is absolutely no progress. And if there is no progress,
there is no closure on the nuclear file,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson said Wednesday as the Security Council reviewed the
latest report on Iraq's nuclear capabilities.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had conceded Tuesday that he
didn't think there was the ``political will'' now in the Security
Council to shift the nuclear inspection program to the less
intrusive monitoring and verification visits sought by Iraq.
	   His circulation Wednesday of a resolution that would essentially
declare Iraq in compliance with U.N. demands for nuclear compliance
was seen as an effort to placate Baghdad while paving the way for a
more concerted effort in October, when China and France are
expected to join in pushing for a scaleback, U.N. and council
sources said.
	   Richardson and Britain's new ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock,
rejected any such resolution or presidential statement because
questions still remained about Iraq's nuclear abilities. The report
from the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Iraq has
failed to provide answers to U.N. questions about weapons design,
uranium enrichment and nuclear exports, Richardson said.
	   Baghdad must destroy all weapons of mass destruction _ including
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _
before the council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Vienna-based IAEA carries out the nuclear inspections while
the New York-based U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, handles the
missile, chemical and biological inspections.
	   Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions and has
accused the inspectors of being American spies and manipulating
information to keep the sanctions in place.
	   Iraq's chances of lifting sanctions had improved slightly after
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and U.N. chief Kofi Annan brokered
an agreement in February to open eight presidential complexes to
UNSCOM inspectors.
	   Those chances have been set back, though, with recent
revelations about Baghdad's ability to weaponize the deadly VX gas
and its failure to turn over a sensitive document to UNSCOM
inspectors, U.N. officials and council diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Annan called those instances ``major events,'' though he
wouldn't speculate Wednesday how they would affect the sanctions
review.
	   The chief U.S. weapons inspector Richard Butler travels to
Baghdad next week to review the document, which was discovered
during a July 18 inspection. Butler has said it detailed bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents during the 1980s, when Iraq was at war with Iran.
	   Iraq prevented inspectors from taking the document and agreed to
let Butler and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz review it together.
	   Later next month, preliminary results are due from French and
Swiss laboratories on missile warheads a U.S. Army laboratory says
were loaded with the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Butler has said he has no doubt that the findings were true but
agreed to send other fragments to European laboratories for further
testing after Iraq disputed the findings.
	   Baghdad has said it was never able to move beyond experimenting
with VX to producing it in large quantities for weapons.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet
resigned en masse on Thursday, paving the way for a vote in
Parliament later in the day nearly certain to choose ruling party
nominee Keizo Obuchi as Japan's new premier.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party controls the 500-seat lower house,
which can overrule the 252-member upper house in a vote for
premier. The upper house is dominated by opposition parties, and
could pick another candidate, possibly popular Democratic party
leader Naoto Kan.
	   Hashimoto announced on July 13 that he would quit to take
responsibility for the humiliating LDP defeat in upper house
elections the day before. The mass resignation Thursday morning was
required to allow the vote in Parliament.
	   The new prime minister will take over an economy wallowing in
its worst recession since the end of World War II and a government
led by a party battling internal divisions and an increasingly
popular opposition.
	   Obuchi, widely considered a cautious leader with few innovative
ideas to reactivate Japan's troubled economy, boosted his standing
with the markets this week by tapping former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
	   ``I'm very thankful to have a veteran's wisdom and experience
... to overcome this difficult situation,'' Obuchi told reporters
after meeting with Miyazawa, 78, on Wednesday afternoon after the
elder statesman agreed to take the job.
	   Talk that Obuchi would pick Miyazawa, who served as prime
minister 1991-1993 and is an architect of the government's plan to
bail out its troubled banking system, triggered rallies in the
Tokyo markets this week.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday morning share prices
moved higher, with investors taking the Miyazawa appointment as a
sign the incoming government will take new measures to boost the
economy. The yen, however, slumped slightly against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The finance job is considered the linchpin of Obuchi's so-called
``economic reform Cabinet'' and crucial to Japan's efforts to pull
out of recession. With unemployment and bankruptcies at
record-highs, Obuchi is under intense pressure _ at home and abroad
_ to move quickly to turn the economy around.
	   Obuchi has already pledged to cut income taxes by 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and promised 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9
billion) in new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur
lagging consumption.
	   He is also under political pressure to succeed quickly. Obuchi
won the LDP presidency last week only after a bruising battle with
party reformists, and the party could split or see its popularity
plummet even further if he fails.
	   The ruling party is quickly losing the faith of the voters. The
party lost 13 seats in July 12 elections for the upper house, and
the party's approval ratings are at an all-time low.
	   Obuchi said he is depending on Miyazawa, an expert in finance
and economics, to lead a clean up of Japan's troubled financial
sector, which is weighed down by loads of bad debt left over from
the collapse of the real estate market in the early 1990s.
	   But even before Thursday's vote, some analysts were wondering if
the choice of Miyazawa, a longtime stalwart in the conservative
ruling party, would really provide the innovation needed to solve
Japan's structural problems.
	   ``There's not a whole lot of faith that this is going to be a
very effective government,'' said Brian Rose, senior economist for
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``Miyazawa is not the guy who is
going to clean up, or radically change the system. He is the
ultimate insider.''
	   The national Asahi newspaper on Thursday called on Miyazawa to
account for missteps during his earlier terms as finance minister
blamed for inflating the speculative real estate bubble of the
1980s _ which burst earlier this decade, saddling the economy with
troubles.
	   ``Miyazawa is largely responsible for the economic mismanagement
that got the country into its present predicament,'' the newspaper
said in an editorial.
	   Most other key posts in the new Cabinet looked likely to go to
ruling party veterans instead of reformers.
	   Longtime Liberal Democratic Party politician Hiromu Nonaka, 72,
has been tapped to become chief cabinet secretary, newspapers said.
Kaoru Yosano, 59, a former education minister, is a strong
candidate to become minister of international trade and industry,
the reports said.
	   State Foreign Secretary Masahiko Komura, 56, is a contender to
replace Obuchi as foreign minister. Taichi Sakaiya, a writer and
former bureaucrat, was expected to be named director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Seventh-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe beat
Gianluca Pozzi of Italy 6-3, 6-2 Wednesday in the second round of
the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
	   Black needed only 56 minutes to advance in the men's tournament
being played at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on the UCLA campus.
	   Guillaume Raoux of France outlasted Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark
7-6 (9-7), 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-3) in a match that lasted 2 hours and
47 minutes. Raoux, a semifinalist last year, had upset third-seeded
Goran Ivanisevic in the opening round.
	   In another match, Michael Joyce eliminated Sargis Sargsian of
Armenia 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.
	   Black, a former collegiate star at Southern California, credited
his consistency and experience for the win.
	   ``I have a good record against him. I've beaten him five times
in a row, three times this year,'' Black said. ``I know how to play
him. I think he's psyched out against me.''
	   Black, 28, is ranked 31st in the world and has a 5-2 record
against the 33-year-old Pozzi, who is ranked 58th. He is the oldest
player currently ranked in the top 200 by the ATP Tour.
	   Black was a three-time All-America in singles and four times in
doubles and helped USC to a national title in 1991.

Shops under fire attack after firebomb alert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Recasts, recaps previous

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police were treating three
fires that broke out in shops in Portadown as suspicious Thursday
because they occurred only hours after authorities defused a
firebomb found in another local store.
	   Police put the town of Portadown, 40 miles (65 kilometers)
northwest of Belfast, on alert against firebombers and urged
shopkeepers to search their stores after the army found a firebomb
hidden among clothing in a store in a major shopping area late
Wednesday afternoon and defused the timer before the device went
off.
	   There had been no warning or claim of responsibility, but police
immediately put businesses on the alert and called for searches.
	   Within hours, a furniture store next to the shop where the
firebomb was found caught fire and was extensively damaged before
firemen got the blaze under control.
	   Later there were sudden fires in two more shops a few streets
away.
	   Security forces were continuing to investigate Thursday but
police said they believe the fires were likely caused by firebombs.
	   Meanwhile, about one hundred Protestants rallied in Portadown in
support of the Orange Order fraternal organization, which is still
insisting on its right to march through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood which security forces have blocked them from entering.
	   Police prevented several hundred who gathered at one end of the
Garvaghy Road from getting through Wednesday night.
	   Police and soldiers, enforcing an order by the
government-appointed Parades Commission, prevented members of the
Orange Order from marching down the Garvaghy Road on July 5.
	   Orangemen gathered on a nearby hillside every night for a week,
underlining their determination to follow their traditional parade
route. But the number of protesters fell after arsonists killed
three young sons of a Catholic woman July 12 in the town of
Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of Belfast.

Top-seeded Davenport wins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with late matches. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, ranked
third in the world, took less than an hour to beat Kimberly Po 6-1,
6-3 Wednesday and become the first player to advance to the
quarterfinals of the Bank of the West women's tournament.
	   Davenport, who has reached the quarterfinals in all but two of
the 12 tournaments she has played this year, was never in trouble
against Po, who is ranked No. 56 in the world.
	   ``She's a dangerous opponent,'' Davenport said. ``I've lost to
her before. I was trying to mix it up a little and thought to do
some stuff different. That seemed to work.''
	   In other matches at Stanford University, fifth-seeded Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus defeated Tara Snyder 6-3, 6-4 and Joanette
Kruger of South Africa beat Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 1-6, 6-2,
6-4.
	   Davenport beat Po 6-2, 6-2 in the first round of the French Open
this year.
	   ``I knew she would be better this time around,'' Davenport said.
``She's not at the same level she was last spring (Po was ranked in
the top 20) but I think she'll get back there.''
	   Davenport said she's trying not to rely on hitting the ball hard
all the time.
	   ``I still want to be aggressive, but I have to learn to be able
to do different things,'' she said. ``That can pull you through
some bad days.''

Report: Duty-free liquor not cause of Korean Air crash fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Burning alcohol from spilled
duty-free liquor caused a flash fire during the first stages of the
fatal crash of a Korean airliner in Guam last year, a New Zealand
report released Thursday said.
	   But the alcohol did not cause the major fire on board, in which
at least some of the 255 people killed in the crash died, an
inquiry by New Zealand's Civil Aviation Authority found.
	   The authority investigated claims by New Zealand helicopter
pilot Barry Small, who was one of 29 survivors of flight KA 801
when it crashed on Aug. 6 last year.
	   Small claimed that between the initial impact and leaving the
plane he ``saw a fire initiate within the aircraft fuselage
involving alcohol from smashed duty-free spirit bottles coming free
from the overhead lockers and oxygen flowing from the ruptured
aircraft supply lines,'' the authority's report said
	   In its report, the authority said it was entirely possible the
alcohol could have become a ``volatile'' mist, but it would have
needed something to ignite it.
	   The authority concluded there was ``substance to the assertions
... but in a diminished manner from that expounded by ... Small.''
It found the fire probably came from outside the aircraft cabin.
	   ``It would appear that a flame originating from misted alcohol
was most likely present in the aircraft interior prior to the main
fire which subsequently destroyed the aircraft, but was not
materially fed by the internal aircraft oxygen system,'' the report
said.
	   The report said the fire outside the plane began after the right
wing separated from the fuselage.
	   ``As the fuselage had peeled back and split, flame (or heat)
could have entered the cabin through the rents in the fuselage
walls, and ignited the vapors present,'' it said.
	   The authority strongly recommended that duty-free alcohol should
not be purchased before departure, but rather at the end of a
flight.
	   Among the report's recommendations is that a review be
undertaken into the carrying of duty-free alcohol on New
Zealand-registered aircraft with a view to making such items
available by law on arrival at all New Zealand international
airports.
	   The report also said countries near New Zealand and other
airlines should be involved in discussion about duty-free purchases
on arrival rather than departure.
	   Authority spokesman Martyn Gosling said a copy of the report had
been given to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which
is investigating the accident, and to Korean Airlines.

American men swimmers beaten by Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with more evening events. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ U.S. men have never lost a 400-meter
freestyle relay in the Olympics. At the Goodwill Games, it was the
scene of a German win for a narrow dual-meet victory over the
Americans.
	   The United States led by three points going into the final race.
But the relays are worth seven points for the winner and none for
the loser, and the Germans' time of 3 minutes, 21.48 seconds _ 1.25
ahead of the Americans _ decided a 63-59 victory.
	   Aimo Heilmann had a body-length lead over Josh Davis, a triple
gold medalist in the 1996 Olympics, after the first leg, and the
other three U.S. swimmers couldn't catch up.
	   Davis, of Austin, Texas, also finished last in the 100 freestyle
and second in the 200 Wednesday night.
	   The Americans led most of the meet thanks to breaststroke
specialist Kurt Grote.
	   Grote, of Palo Alto, California, won both the 100- and 200-meter
breaststroke and the breaststroke leg on the winning U.S. medley
relay.
	   But even those desperately needed 17 points were not enough as
the Germans kept it close all night.
	   Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles got the U.S. team off to a good
start in the medley relay with a games record on the backstroke
leg, but the world champion was upset in the individual 100
backstroke as Stev Theloke of lowered Krayzelburg's record set only
a few minutes before.
	   Then Grote set a games record in the 100 breaststroke and
captured the 200 by more than three seconds.
	   The race that turned the meet was the 200. Davis won an Olympic
gold medal by .23 seconds in the event, but this time he lost to
Michael Kiedel, who also swam anchor on the Germans' winning
freestyle relay.
	   A U.S. highlight was the victory in the 200 individual medley by
Ron Karnaugh, a 32-year-old doctor from Maplewood, New Jersey.
Karnaugh set a games record of 2:02.18.
	   On Tuesday night, the U.S. women won their first of three dual
meets, thrashing China 88-34. Both the men and women have two more
dual meets remaining.
	   Central Park was back in Goodwill action as women's beach
volleyball opened, and defending champions Karolyn Kirby and Liz
Masakayan of San Diego lost to Australia's Pauline Manser and Kerri
Pottharst. 15-10.
	   The Americans trailed 6-0 and 10-2 before running off six points
in a row to get within 10-8, and trailed 12-10 before Manser hit
three straight kills.
	   The Australians also got the benefit of two calls against Kirby
and Masakayan, including a reversal of a point that would have
pulled them within 10-9.
	   ``That was pretty crucial,'' Masakayan said.
	   The world's top-ranked women's team, Adriana Behar and Shelda
Bede, beat Canada's Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont 15-1. Lisa
Arce and Holly McPeak of Manhattan Beach, California, beat Laura
Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy 15-4. Maike Friedrichsen
and Danja Musch of German opened the tournament with a 15-4 victory
over Eva Celbova and Sona Dosoudilova of the Czech Republic.

	   Prior to her return, the military regime told diplomats in
Yangon that she had no health problems, and that the democracy
leader's trip outside the Myanmar capital had been stopped to avert
possible disturbances, diplomatic sources said.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two

	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner refused to return to Yangon,
and the military would not let her proceed. This was her third
attempt this month to travel to the provinces.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday
in her car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, said she was showing signs of dehydration.
	   A press release Wednesday from her political party said her
health was ``failing.''
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, said
she was trying to foment unrest.
	   After the briefing in Yangon, one diplomat quoted senior
military officer Lt. Col. Hla Min as saying: ``There is no health
problem with Aung San Suu Kyi. Necessary measures are being taken
in cooperation with the NLD leaders in Yangon to look after her
health.''
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hla Min
did not respond to questions by some ambassadors on whether they
would be allowed to visit her.

 &UR; YANGON: visit her.

<TEXT>
	   Suu Kyi's doctors asked that they be allowed to monitor her
condition twice a day and that she be provided with facilities to
wash, the NLD statement said.
	   The military said the doctors could visit Wednesday, and it has
provided her with drinking water.
	   ``It is the hope of the government that (Suu Kyi) will realize
the folly of her uncompromising and belligerent stand,'' a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week the United
States will hold Myanmar's military directly responsible for Suu
Kyi's health and welfare.
	   And at the Manila meeting this week, foreign ministers from
Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Union pressured Myanmar to end human rights abuses and let Suu Kyi
proceed.

	   It gave no details of what occurred but said the country's
pro-democracy leader returned to her home at 11 p.m. (1530 GMT)
Wednesday night. A government press conference was scheduled for
later Thursday.
	   Prior to her return, the military regime told diplomats in
Yangon that she had no health problems, and that the democracy
leader's trip outside the Myanmar capital had been stopped to avert
possible disturbances, diplomatic sources said.
	   Government officials stopped Suu Kyi, an associate and two
drivers Friday morning as the group headed toward Bassein, 160
kilometers (100 miles) away to meet members of her party, the
National League for Democracy.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner refused to return to Yangon,
and the military would not let her proceed. This was her third
attempt this month to travel to the provinces.
	   Two of Suu Kyi's personal physicians, who examined her Tuesday
in her car, parked on a narrow bridge 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, said she was showing signs of dehydration.
	   A press release Wednesday from her political party said her
health was ``failing.''
	   The military government, which has stopped her every time, said
she was trying to foment unrest.
	   After the briefing in Yangon, one diplomat quoted senior
military officer Lt. Col. Hla Min as saying: ``There is no health
problem with Aung San Suu Kyi. Necessary measures are being taken
in cooperation with the NLD leaders in Yangon to look after her
health.''
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hla Min
did not respond to questions by some ambassadors on whether they
would be allowed to visit her.
	   Suu Kyi's doctors asked that they be allowed to monitor her
condition twice a day and that she be provided with facilities to
wash, the NLD statement said.
	   The military said the doctors could visit Wednesday, and it has
provided her with drinking water.
	   ``It is the hope of the government that (Suu Kyi) will realize
the folly of her uncompromising and belligerent stand,'' a military
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The government refused a request by seven Western nations that
U.S. and Japanese diplomats in Myanmar be allowed to see Suu Kyi.
	   ``At this juncture, the meeting is not urgently needed,''
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw said at a meeting in Manila of Southeast
Asia's regional grouping.
	   The military has allowed her to travel outside Yangon only once
since her release from six years of house arrest in July 1995. She
visited a Buddhist monk that year in the eastern city of Pa-an.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's Yangon home, refusing journalists entry
and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Democracy activists say harassment of her followers has
increased in recent months. Many of her party members are in
prison.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week the United
States will hold Myanmar's military directly responsible for Suu
Kyi's health and welfare.
	   And at the Manila meeting this week, foreign ministers from
Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Union pressured Myanmar to end human rights abuses and let Suu Kyi
proceed.

Eldredge, Russian couples lead Goodwill skating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Former world champion Todd Eldredge
put on a brilliant show of spins and jumps Wednesday night to lead
the men's short program at the Goodwill Games.
	   Two world-championship couples from Russia moved in front in ice
dancing and pairs.
	   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze led after the short
program in pairs, edging ahead of Olympic gold medalists Oksana
Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev, and Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov were in front following the compulsory dance.
	   Eldredge, a five-time U.S. champion who was fourth in the
Olympics and second in the world championships this year, got a
standing ovation from the Nassau Coliseum crowd of 4,009 _ about a
quarter of capacity _ as he finished his program with a dazzling
combination spin in the middle of the ice. Skating to music from
the Broadway show ``Les Miserables,'' he was spectacular from start
to finish.
	   All seven judges awarded him marks of 5.8 for the eight required
elements. He also received 5.9s for presentation from the judges
from France, England and the United States.
	   Trailing Eldredge were two Russian skaters, Alexei Urmanov and
Evgeni Plushenko. Americans Michael Weiss and Timothy Goebel were
fifth and sixth.
	   The short program counts for one-third of the total mark, with
the remaining two-thirds coming from Friday's freestyle skate.
	   Skimming over the blue ice at the Coliseum, Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze were flawless, running through the eight required
elements and smiling broadly when they were done. They skated to
``Scenes From Swan Lake'' and received no mark below 5.7 from the
panel of judges.
	   Kazakova and Dmitriev, who withdrew from the world championships
because of food poisoning after winning the Olympics, were second,
followed by the Chinese pair of Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo.
	   Kazakova was satisfied with what the Olympic champions had done.
	   ``We were pleased with our performance because we had been on
tour and are very tired,'' she said.
	   The American pair _ 16-year-old Johnnie Stiegler and his
14-year-old sister, Tiffany _ received all 5.1s or lower, and their
scores were booed by the crowd. They stood last.
	   ``We did a good job for our ages,'' Johnnie Stiegler said. ``We
just need to get older and be patient.''
	   The short program counts for one-third of the final mark in
pairs, with Friday's freestyle completing the competition.
	   In the compulsory dance competition, Krylova and Ovsiannikov
took the lead. Skating to the Golden Waltz, the Olympic silver
medalists received two 5.9s for timing-expression, the highest
marks awarded to any of the four couples.
	   ``I'm very happy because it's 3 1/2 months after the world
championships and we've only had a week to prepare for the
compulsories,'' Ovsiannikov said.''
	   Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia, silver medalists in
the 1994 Goodwill Games, were second, followed by Elena Grushina
and Rusian Goncharov of Ukraine, and Jessica Joseph and Charles
Butler of the United States.
	   The American teen-agers, world junior champions, received four
marks below 5.0, prompting boos from the crowd.
	   ``We're a new team,'' Butler said. ``This is our first year. We
just moved up from the junior tour. We don't have a lot of
experience.''
	   The compulsory dance counts for 20 percent of the final score
with Thursday's original dance counting for 30 percent and the free
dance on Saturday making up the remainintg 50 percent.

Dollar, stocks higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained higher against the yen at
midday Thursday on continuing uncertainty over the fate of
financial reforms under Japan's new government. Tokyo stocks
advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 142.09 yen, up 1 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 142.35 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency, however, slipped from highs earlier Thursday,
dragged down on profit-taking by overseas players and Japanese
exporters, said to have already factored in news on the new
government and its selection of finance minister.
	   Japan's Parliament will elect a new prime minister later in the
day as incumbent Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Cabinet resigned
Thursday morning. Hashimoto quit to take responsibility for a
devastating loss in July 12 elections for the Parliament's upper
house.
	   Keizo Obuchi, foreign minister under Hashimoto, is virtually
certain to be selected as his ruling Liberal Democratic Party
controls the powerful lower house.
	   The yen was sold after news Wednesday that former prime minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, will serve as the new finance minister.
	   Miyazawa, the key figure in the government's plan to bail out
its banking system, is seen by some, however, as being part of a
conservative old guard that is reluctant to carry out bold reforms
to solve Japan's economic woes.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices moved higher, as
investors welcomed the Miyazawa appointment on hopes that the
incoming government will take new measures to boost the economy.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 148.80 points, or 0.92
percent, ending the morning session at 16,306.89 points. On
Wednesday, the average gained 43.55 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 11.98 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,252.68
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.52 points, or 0.12 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.245 percent, down from Wednesday's
finish of 1.275 percent, driving up its price to 111.49 yen from
111.27 yen.

United, Fusion and MetroStars post wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Carey Talley scored the deciding shootout goal
and D.C. United, which blew a two-goal lead, came back for a 3-2
victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny in Major League Soccer on
Wednesday night.
	   D.C. United got two goals from Marco Etcheverry but failed to
clinch a playoff spot with two months left in the regular season
when Mutiny midfielder Mauricio Ramos tied the game in the 88th
minute.
	   United (19-5), which outscored the Mutiny 4-3 in the shootout,
has won six straight games.
	   Tampa Bay (6-17) led the shootout 3-2 when D.C.'s John Harkes
tied the score and it remained tied when United keeper Scott
Garlick stopped Paul Dougherty's attempt.
 &UR; Fusion 3, Crew 2
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Marcelo Herrera scored two goals
and Brazilian forward Paulinho added two assists as the Miami
Fusion beat the Columbus Crew 3-2 on Wednesday night, its fourth
consecutive victory.
	   The victory was the Fusion's second straight without all-star
midfielder Carlos Valderrama, who was benched after skipping two
recent practices under new coach Ivo Wortmann.
	   Valderrama, who was fined dlrs 10,000 by Major League Soccer on
Tuesday, is expected to rejoin the Fusion after Sunday's all-star
game at Orlando.
	   Miami (10-11) is in fourth place in the MLS Eastern Conference.
The Fusion was last in the six-team conference before Wortmann took
over when Cacho Cordoba was fired last Friday.
 &UR; MetroStars 3, Wizards 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Tab Ramos and Giovanni Savarese
scored shootout goals and goalkeeper Tony Meola made two big saves
late in regulation and two more in the shootout Wednesday night as
New York-New Jersey beat the Kansas City Wizards 3-2.
	   The MetroStars (12-9) won their third straight game and are
three games over .500 for the first time in franchise history.
	   Meola sent the game to a shootout by making a kick save on Matt
McKeon in the 80th minute and then coming quickly off his line in
the 86th minute to force Mark Chung to shoot wide after the Wizards
striker had broken through the defense.
	   In the shootout, Meola allowed a goal by Precki but saved shots
by Brian Tinsley and Paul Rideout while forcing Chung and Digital
Takawira to shoot wide.

Braves rout Reds; Expos pound Giants

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves rallied after starter John
Smoltz and manager Bobby Cox were ejected Wednesday night, batting
around in the next two innings and hitting three homers for an 11-5
victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   The NL East leaders the ejections the turning point by piling up
four runs with two outs in the fifth off Steve Parris (3-0). They
then pulled away with three homers: Tony Graffanino's three-run
shot and two-run homers by Andruw Jones and Javy Lopez.
	   Rudy Seanez (3-0) took over after Smoltz's ejection, threw a
pitchout on his first delivery to get Bret Boone breaking from
third on a squeeze attempt, and allowed only one hit over 1 2-3
innings to get the win.
	   The Reds wound up with their 11th loss in 13 games. The Braves
are 6-2 on a road trip that wraps up Thursday against the Reds.
 &UR; Expos 6, Giants 0
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero hit his 24th homer and scored
three times, and Dustin Hermanson and Mike Maddux combined on a
five-hitter as Montreal beat San Francisco.
	   Brad Fullmer drove in three runs for the Expos, who snapped a
three-game losing streak.
	   Guerrero hit a two-run shot off Danny Darwin (6-9) in the first,
his 10th homer of the month. He also scored on Fullmer's single in
the fourth and Fullmer's two-run triple in the fifth.
	   Hermanson (8-9) allowed five hits, struck out six and walked one
over seven innings. Maddux finished with two perfect innings to
give Montreal just its second shutout of the season and second win
in its last 13 games.
 &UR; Phillies 8, Dodgers 3
	   In Philadelphia, Doug Glanville and Gregg Jefferies had three
hits apiece and Philadelphia dealt Dave Mlicki his first loss since
being traded to the Dodgers.
	   Glanville scored three runs and had two RBIs, and Rico Brogna
also drove in two runs as Philadelphia piled up 13 hits to win for
the fourth time in six games.
	   Mlicki (5-5), who went to Los Angeles on June 4 in the trade
with New York for Hideo Nomo, allowed seven hits and four earned
runs in his first loss since June 1 _ a span of 10 starts.
	   Phillies rookie Carlton Loewer (5-3) pitched 6 2-3 innings,
surrendering three runs and striking out two with no walks for his
first win since July 12.
 &UR; Astros 10, Marlins 6
	   In Houston, Moises Alou hit his fourth homer in as many games
and Craig Biggio and Derek Bell had three hits apiece to lead
Houston over Florida.
	   The Astros, beating the Marlins for the fifth time in as many
meetings this season, sent Florida to its 14th loss in 16 games.
	   Bell drove in two runs and Biggio one in Houston's 14-hit
attack.
	   The Astros overcame a four-RBI performance by Derrek Lee, who
had a three-run double and solo homer to extend his hit streak to a
career-high nine games.
	   Pete Schourek (7-6) got the victory and Andy Larkin (2-6) took
the loss.
 &UR; Mets 7, Padres 6
	   In New York, Luis Lopez drove into two runs, including a
tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, as New York beat
San Diego to win for the eighth time in 10 games.
	   Mel Rojas (4-2) got the win despite failing to hold a three-run
lead. John Franco pitched 1 1-3 innings for his 21st save.
	   Lopez, making just his 10th start of the season as a replacement
for injured Rey Ordonez, hit a sacrifice fly of Donne Wall (4-3) in
the seventh to score Carlos Baerga and break a 6-6 tie.
	   Mike Piazza homered for New York and Wally Joyner hit one for
the Padres.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Cardinals 1
	   In St. Louis, Steve Woodard struck out a season-high 11 batters

Louis.
	   The Cardinals scored their only run without the assistance of
Mark McGwire, who was 1-for-4 with a strikeout and a single.
	   Woodard (8-5) struck out the first five batters he faced and
didn't allow a hit until pitcher Bobby Witt (1-2) singled with one
out in the third. Woodard gave up six hits with no walks in 6 1-3
innings. He has allowed only one walk in his last 27 1-3 innings.
	   Bob Wickman worked the ninth for his 17th save, retiring Royce
Clayton on a groundout with the bases loaded to end the game.

Tyson, in bid to get back his career, fails to control temper
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Unable to control the temper that got
him banned from boxing, an angry Mike Tyson swore in front of
regulators who will decide whether he can return to the ring.
	   Appearing before the New Jersey Athletic Control Board on
Wednesday to get a boxing license to resume his career, Tyson first
choked back tears as he apologized for biting Evander Holyfield's
ears in their title fight last year.
	   At the end of his 35-minute appearance, however, his mood seemed
to sour after being continually questioned about biting Holyfield.
His lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., said Tyson would read a closing
statement, but the fighter suddenly shook his head.
	   ``I don't want to say it now, because I'm angry,'' he said.
	   When his lawyer, Anthony Fusco Jr., tried to calm him, Tyson
then used an expletive.
	   ``You know what I mean, man? Why do I got to go through this ...
all the time?''
	   ``Relax, relax,'' Fusco said, putting his hand on Tyson
shoulder.
	   Whether Tyson's temper will cost him the thing he needs most _ a
license to resume his career _ is up to the three members of the
board, which has 45 days to decide.
	   It will meet Aug. 6 to consider Tyson's application, but won't
rule then, according to Roger Shatkzin, a spokesman for state
Attorney General Peter Verniero.
	   Tyson bit both of Holyfield's ears _ taking a chunk out of the
right one _ in their June 28, 1997, title fight in Las Vegas. That
prompted Nevada regulators to revoke Tyson's license and fine him
dlrs 3 million, leaving him eligible to apply for reinstatement
after one year.
	   But he reapplied for a license in New Jersey instead, hoping for
a return to the ring in Atlantic City. Fusco and others say the
32-year-old fighter has paid his penalty, but some boxing insiders
believe he should have returned to Nevada to get his license back.
	   On Wednesday, he was cheered by office workers as he arrived for
the hearing, wearing a charcoal gray pinstriped suit and holding
the hand of his pediatrician wife, Monica. There also were some
boos from members of the New Jersey chapter of the National
Organization for Women, who protested his appearance.
	   In the hearing, he got more bouquets from friends, family
members and fighters.
	   His spiritual adviser, Muhamed Siddeeq, said Tyson was deeply
repentant and that he deserved a second chance. His new manager,
Shelly Finkel, compared the bite to Roberto Duran's famous 1981
refusal to continue fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, when he said Duran
just snapped.
	   ``He wants redemption. He wants to have the opportunity to go
back in the ring. I believe he's entitled to it,'' Finkel said.
	   Tyson had offers to fight _ each worth dlrs 10 million _ during
the one-year hiatus from Russia, Germany, Scandinavia and the
Middle East, but turned them down because he wanted to honor the
spirit of the Nevada ban, Finkel said.
	   Psychologist Bert Rotman, who examined Tyson earlier this month
for an hour, said he believed Tyson was trying to turn his life
around.
	   ``He looks back and realizes he's made some serious mistakes,''
Rotman said.
	   When it was his turn, Tyson responded in one-word answers to
questions from Assistant Attorney General Michael Haas, most of
them having to do with his 1992 rape conviction in Indiana and his
application for a New Jersey boxing license.
	   He told Haas he'd broken off his relationship with longtime
promoter Don King and that he is no longer under contract with any
promoter. But he got more animated when Haas asked what happened in
the third round of the Holyfield fight.
	   ``I don't even know why I bit Mr. Holyfield. I don't even know
how I did it,'' he said.
	   He said Holyfield had head-butted him in their first fight and
that he was doing so again in the rematch. The blows left him
disoriented, and he went ``berserk,'' he said.
	   ``I was in a rage. I just snapped. Nothing mattered anymore at
that particular moment,'' he said.
	   Then, pausing to hold back tears, he said: ``I'm sorry for what
I did. I wish it never happened. It will haunt me for the rest of
my life.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Indonesian official saying quake had a magnitude

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A powerful earthquake shook part of
eastern Indonesia early Thursday, 200 miles (320 kilometers) from
an earthquake that caused a devastating tsunami a week ago.
	   There were no reports of damage or casualties in the tremor in
the remote jungles of the province of Irian Jaya, said Fauzi of the
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta.
	   Fauzi said the quake had a magnitude of 6.0. However, the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. said the magnitude was 6.6.
There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   The epicenter of the quake was in a sparsely populated area, 125
miles (200 kilometers) west of the provincial capital of Jayapura.
It struck about 3 a.m. local time, or 1800 GMT.
	   The quake was 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of a magnitude 7.1
earthquake on July 17, which generated a tsunami in Sissano, Papua
New Guinea, that killed at least 1,600 people and caused extensive
damage.
	   Indonesia and Papua New Guinea share New Guinea Island. Irian
Jaya province comprises the western part.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Chris Hoiles hit a pair of two-run homers and
drove in six runs, and Cal Ripken Jr. hit his first triple in
almost two years Wednesday night as the Baltimore Orioles routed
the Detroit Tigers 14-2.
	   Brady Anderson homered and scored three runs and B.J. Surhoff
had three RBIs for the Orioles, who are 16-3 since the All-Star
break.
	   Hoiles homered in the fifth and sixth innings and just missed a
grand slam in the seventh when he hit a bases-loaded ground-rule
double. It was the third time he's had six RBIs in a game.
	   Mike Mussina (9-5) got his third straight win, allowing a run on
six hits in six innings. Doug Johns pitched the last three innings
for his first save.
 &UR; Rangers 9, Blue Jays 6 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Ivan Rodriguez drove in three runs and Darren Oliver
avenged two early-season losses to Toronto as the Texas Rangers
snapped a four-game losing streak.
	   Rodriguez went 2-for-4 with a double, triple and walk. His
bases-loaded double in the third off Toronto starter Chris
Carpenter (6-5) gave the Rangers a 4-3 lead, putting them ahead for
good.
	   Texas slugger Juan Gonzalez, leading the majors with 116 RBIs,
missed his second straight game with tightness in his right
hamstring. Rangers manager Johnny Oates expects him to miss three
to five more games.
	   Oliver (6-7) gave up two earned runs on six hits and four walks
with two strikeouts. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 28th
save.
 &UR; Twins 5, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Eric Milton took a no-hitter into the
sixth inning as the Minnesota Twins won their fifth straight.
	   Milton (6-7) had a no-hitter until Terry Pendleton singled with
one out in the sixth. Mike Sweeney then hit a three-run homer to
chase Milton, who had walked Dean Palmer to lead off the inning.
	   Sweeney's homer broke a 19-inning scoreless streak for Kansas
City, which lost its third straight game.
	   Milton struck out three, walked five and had three batters reach
on errors. Rick Aguilera pitched a perfect ninth for his 26th
save.

and Evgeni Plushenko. Americans Michael Weiss and Timothy Goebel
were fifth and sixth. Two world-championship couples from Russia
moved in front in ice dancing and pairs. Elena Berezhnaya and Anton

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One day after the United States gained three
victories over Cuba, Waldemar Font turned the tide back in his
country's favor.
	   Font, the 23-year-old world championship silver medalist, easily
outpointed American Antonio Rodriguez, 21-5, Wednesday night in the
bantamweight semifinals of the Goodwill Games.
	   ``I stood with him,'' Rodriguez said. ``He didn't hurt me, he
just outpointed me.''
	   Jose Santa Cruz, a 17-year-old, also lost in his bantamweight
semifinal 7-4 to Uzbekistan's Timur Tulyakov at the Theater at
Madison Square Garden, before fellow American Miguel Espino was
shutout in his welterweight semifinal, 17-0, by Russia's Andrei
Mishin.
	   The United States defeated Cuba in all but one match during
Tuesday's quarterfinals _ and won 10 bouts overall _ but Rodriguez
was not able to capitalize on any of that momentum.
	   ``We're getting a lot tougher as we go by,'' Rodriguez said.
``Our team is a lot younger than Cuba and the other European
teams.''
	   Rodriguez, 19, who won both the U.S. Championships and the U.S.
Challenge, was a surprise to even reach the semifinals. He defeated
Turkey's Soner Karaaoz, the bronze medalist from the world
championships, in Monday's quarterfinal bout.
	   ``He's a lot better than me,'' Rodriguez said of Font. ``I just
gave it all. It's a good learning experience for me.''
