<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Economy Grows: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A M S Kibria Tuesday said the country's economy is on its way up
as the inflation rate, a major indicator of a sound economy,
continued to decrease over the last five months.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the inflation rate is 3.42 percent which came down
from 7.03 percent in July 1999 and a healthy economic situation is
prevailing in the country," he said while addressing a press
conference on the economy here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "We tried to contain the inflation rate by
taking macroeconomic policies and we have made a great stride to
this end."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the country's export situation, the minister said the
country achieved a 7-percent export growth in the July-November
period of 1999 over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
About the remittance growth, he said expatriate Bangladeshis
sent home 732.19 million U.S. dollars from July to November in
1999, against 662.19 million dollars in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve is 1.646 billion dollars, which is
a very comfortable level, Kibria said.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar Tuesday
charged that India was building "artificial tension" through
accusing Pakistan of involvement in the case of hijacking an
Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
While talking to reporters here, Sattar said India's accusation
is aimed at isolating Pakistan in the international community but
the "frustrated move" is bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will remain in the mainstream of the international
community and India will fail to implicate Pakistan in the
hijacking," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Monday claimed that
the hijacking in December is "an integral part of Pakistan-backed
terrorist activities" and asked the world to declare Pakistan a "
terrorist state."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government, Sattar said, has not a shred of evidence
to prove that any Pakistani national was aboard the hijacked plane.

MOSCOW -- Russia strongly urged Lebanon to prevent a repetition
of Monday's Beirut incident and requested a security guarantee for
its citizens in the Middle East country, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old pro-Chechen Palestinian, Ahmed Abou Kharoub,
opened fire and launched grenades at the Russian embassy in Beirut
from a nearby residential building early Monday, killing a
Lebanese policeman and wounding several others. No one on the
staff inside the embassy was injured.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security forces stormed the building and shot Kharoub
dead, seizing hand grenades, Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow proceeds from the assumption that a repetition of
criminal acts, which might be detrimental to traditionally
friendly relations between Russia and Lebanon, will be ruled out,"
said the Russian Foreign Ministry statement. (Russia-Lebanon)

<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist Michelle
Kwan of the United States beat Russian world champion Maria
Butyrskaya, winning her third straight title at the International
Open Figure Skating competition on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition at the one-day tourney, two-time
defending world champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia adopted the same
tactic to edge out American champion Todd Eldredge.
</P>
<P>
Yagudin and Kwan each took a 40,000 U.S. dollars winner's
prize.
</P>
<P>
No skaters tried quadruple jumps since the pro-am event put
greater emphasis on their interpretation of the music and artistry
than on technical difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The pairs title went to Olympic gold medalists Oksana Kazakova
and Artur Dmitriev of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair of Maya Usova and Evgeny Platov, also Olympic
gold medalists, won the ice dancing event.
</P>
<P>
Kwan won the world championships in 1996 and again in 1998
before placing second to Butyrskaya last year.
</P>
<P>
The world championships are scheduled for March 27 through
April 2 in Nice, France.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Host More International Swimming Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese city Shanghai will
host more international swimming meets in the further schedules,
according to officials from the Chinese sports authority and FINA
during the current World Cup short-course event Tuesday.
Shanghai, the fourth leg in World Cup Series in 1999-2000 season,
is the first international spot FINA set in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have more friends from aboard and to hold more
international events in Shanghai," said Li Furong, vice-director
of the Chinese Sports Administration.
</P>
<P>
Gunner Werner, FINA honorary secretary in general, echoed Li's
opinion, saying: "Maybe someday Shanghai will be the host of the
world championships."
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai will be written in the FINA's historic book by
hosting the first meet in the year 2000," Werner added.
</P>
<P>
Werner, together with FINA vice-president Hironoshin Fnrnhashi
and bureau member Pipat, was pleased to see the efforts against
doping made by the Chinese authority.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that China has strengthen the strike against
doping," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China conducted 700 doping tests on its swimmers but
found no one positive. A total of 3503 tests were conducted in
19999 on Chinese athletes in all sports, and 19 were caught for
positive.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 124.72 at 11,122.65.
The blue chip index suffered a heavy loss of 359.58 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;

Nasdaq composite index fell 24.15 at 3,877.54.

The Dow index rose because investors shifted into cyclical
stocks which were seen as a safer bet when interest rates are
rising. But IBM, a computer maker, was the Dow's strongest
performers today.
</P>
<P>
Worries about higher interest rates prompted investors to take
profits from strong rallies around technology stocks in the final
days of 1999, dragging the Nasdaq index lower. The index fell 229.
46 points Tuesday, the biggest drop ever in the history.

<HEADLINE> Consumables Market Takes Larger Share of E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Total online retail sales in
1999 in the United States are expected to reach 66 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a research report released Wednesday, and
the buying of consumable products will lead the way into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The report from ActivMedia, a U.S. company conducting Web
marketer studies, found that 40 percent of the U.S. buyers who
purchase consumable products online account for 56 percent of
online purchasing power and account for 3.8 billion dollars in
online revenue.
</P>
<P>
Health and beauty products are leading the way among consumable
products, according to the report. The grocery market has been
inhibited by real-world delivery systems and has only begun to see
its potential, the report found.
</P>
<P>
Two in five online buyers shop for consumables on the Web. They
represent a select group of mature online shoppers who purchase
much more than books, music or gifts online. In the past year, the
report said, they purchased health and beauty (cosmetics, vitamins
and toiletries), healthcare and pharmaceuticals, groceries and
household supplies, gourmet items and pet supplies online.
</P>
<P>
In terms of dollars spent, consumables buyers spend 56 percent
of online purchase dollars. This group is more likely than average
to shop for a variety of personal and business items from several
sectors, including clothing, home and garden, sporting goods,
jewelry, office supplies, and manufacturing supplies.

TEHRAN -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi has strongly denied allegations
that the hijackers of an Indian airline plane have
entered Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the sources rumoring the presence of
the hijackers in Iran are only trying to deceive
the public, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local daily Tehran Times on
Wednesday quoted a foreign ministry official as
saying that the hijackers were involved in a
terrorist act and Iran will never allow them to
enter its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Indian news agency PTI said that it was
told by informed sources that the hijackers had
fled into Iran via Heart, Afghanistan, in order to
distract the public opinion and reduce
international anxiety.

ANKARA -- Turkish intellectuals of Kurdish
origin have started initiatives to form new
political parties in the country, Turkish Daily
News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after they were relieved of the
oppression from the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), which has been seeking an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey through
violent means, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK military actions in the country have
weakened since the capture of its leader Abdullah
Ocalan and many of its radical members have left
Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Some former Kurdish members of leftist Turkish
parties have planned a new leftist party while
some others have initiated a right-wing party.

JERUSALEM -- Israel on Wednesday released 22
Palestinians jailed for criminal offenses as a

<P>
The Israeli Prisons Authority said 20 of the
released were convicted of illegal entry into
Israel and were sentenced to up to one year in
prison. The other two were convicted of homicide.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the release was not
connected with the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
held no official ceremony to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 33 Palestinian political prisoners
jailed for anti-Israel activities last month in
the third and last batch of release under the
Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in September.
Israel had freed 350 political prisoners in the

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Calls for Arab Consensus on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said an Iraqi apology to Kuwait for its 1990 invasion
of the country might help clear up the atmosphere between the two
countries and lead to a major inter-Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the Kuwaiti prisoners of war (pows) and finding those
missing in action may contribute to ending frequent violations on
the Iraqi sovereignty, Meguid was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fallouts incurred from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on ties between
the two neighbors still serve as a major stumbling block on the way
of restoring Arab solidarity, said Meguid on Tuesday while
addressing a meeting of the Cairo-based Union of Arab Journalists.
</P>
<P>
Courageous initiatives and Iraqi concessions are needed for a
comprehensive solution to the Iraqi problem. And such a solution
may
help restore mutual confidence between the two countries which cut
off their ties since 1990, said the Arab League chief.
</P>
<P>
He also called for convening an Arab summit which ''is a
legitimate and vital demand to deal with the challenges facing
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League is hopeful that Arab leaders would agree on
holding a summit, either an expanded or limited one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining that he prefers an expanded summit, Meguid
admitted that there are difficulties to be overcome on the way of
holding such a summit.
</P>
<P>
''Perhaps there are foreign forces opposing convocation of the
Arab summit. But we have to be keen on holding it because it is a
demand of all Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he criticized the Arab fast-track movement toward
making peace with Israel without inter-Arab consultation or
coordination.
</P>
<P>
''The Arab League is supportive of comprehensive peace, but it
is against adopting a fast-track attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mauritania's establishing of full diplomatic
ties with Israel contravened the decisions made at the 1996 Arab
summit.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Mauritania, a Arab League member, needs financial
and economic support does not justify such a move, he added.

<HEADLINE> IRA Says It Remains Committed to N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army said on
Wednesday it remained committed to seeking a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the IRA will continue to play a positive
role in a genuine effort to realize a just and lasting peace," the
IRA said in a statement to be published in An Phoblacht, the
newspaper of its political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But the guerrilla group warned that the British government
should play its part in demilitarizing the province. It said any
failure by the British government to rapidly implement a programme
of demilitarization "can only have a negative impact on the
potential for political progress".
</P>
<P>
The group condemned the Ulster Unionist Party's threat that it
might pull out of the newly-formed Northern Ireland executive if
the guerrillas failed to hand over arms by February.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA said it still planned to hold further meetings with
the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, the
body headed by retired Canadian army general John de Chastelain,
appointed to oversee the handover of guerrilla weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Force Commander Arranges Battalion Deployment in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
Wednesday that "The battalion was blocked Tuesday by combatants
loyal to Revolutionary United Front Party leader Foday Sankoh at a
bridge approximately 18 kilometers from Makeni."
</P>
<P>
Jetley had returned to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, on
Wednesday night, Eckhard said, announcing that "the problems over
the deployment of the battalion had been resolved. The Kenya
Battalion is on its way to Makeni."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Wednesday indicated a
willingness to consider rapidly increasing the size and strength
of UNMSIL in order to help make up for the pending departure of
the Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council in October last year authorized the
deployment of 6,000 U.N. peacekeepers to monitor the cease-fire
and disarm former rebel fighters while ECOMOG remained in charge
of security in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
But in late December last year, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan told the 15-nation Security Council that Nigeria decided to
withdraw its troops because it couldn't accept having two forces
under separate commands in the same country.
</P>
<P>
The other ECOMOG contributors, Ghana and Guinea, were also
preparing to pull their soldiers out of Sierra Leone, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria said it wanted to withdraw its troops by February, but
indicated it wouldn't pull out entirely without replacement forces
on their way.

Clinton revealed the plan at a meeting with House and Senate
Democratic leaders about budget priorities for the next fiscal

</P>
<P>
The proposal will include a new program of federal grants for
school construction, plus a revival of Clinton's effort in recent
years to use tax breaks to help communities upgrade existing

</P>
<P>
The plan will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget Clinton

In the past two years, the Republican-controlled Congress has
been cool to Clinton's education spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly proposed using federal money for school
construction in recent years, only to see the idea repeatedly
ignored or shot down by Congress. Many Republicans have objected
that the plan would impose federal strictures on education
decisions that should be made by state and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Advancement of Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Wednesday urged Israel and the Palestinians to move forward
more quickly in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is a process of coming together but it should move
faster," Yeltsin said after arrival in Jeursalem to attend the
celebrations of the first Orthodox Christmas of the new millennium,
which will begin Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin shocked the world last Friday by announcing his
resignation from the presidency he held since 1991. He appointed
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit in the Holy Land, which was planned
before his resignation, Yeltsin will attend Orthodox Christmas
celebrations in Jerusalem and in the Palestinian self-rule city of
Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
He will meet President Ezer Weizman and acting Prime Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
This is his first visit abroad since his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office has ruled out the
possibility that Barak might return from the United States, where
he is holding talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara,
briefly to meet Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transfers 3 Military Bases to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to the transfer, the DIF had evacuated two army camps in
Eirit and Jita' which are on the road between Jenin and Java, and
the Fahmeh camp on the road between Jenin and Naplus.
</P>
<P>
More land was due to be transferred to the PNA on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Fahmeh base used to be controlled by the Jordanian army
before the 1967 Middle East war. During the Palestinian "Intifada"
(uprising) which erupted in 1987 against Israeli rule, the site
turned to be a military barrack and training center for the Israeli
commandoes.

<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed by Israel and the
Palestinians last September, the PNA can not use the sites for
military purposes.

The PNA is expected to receive three other bases as part of the
second phase redeployment whose implementation started Wednesday
morning and will be completed Thursday evening under a compromise
agreement reached between the two sides on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Syrians, Israelis Get Down to Business over Outstanding Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Israel
are finally starting their committee discussions over key issues
after settling their dispute over which should be dealt with first
in their second round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries, as well as those from the United
States would form four committees, dealing with such major issues
as the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
sharing of water resources, the security arrangement for Israel
and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the committees
would meet over the next couple of days to tackle those
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"They have a work plan and an organizational structure," he
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations began on Monday with a shaky
start with the cancellation of a scheduled three-way meeting among
Syria, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syrian negotiators insisted that discussions on the Israeli
withdrawal from the Strategic Golan Heights should come first
while Israelis preferred to security. The procedural dispute was,
however, smoothed over on Tuesday and President Bill Clinton
returned to the small historic town of Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders talked for about an hour and, according to
reliable sources, made some arrangement for the setting up of
several committees to handle all the outstanding issues that have
led to wars between Syria and Israel over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian source, the committees will meet
simultaneously, thus overcoming the procedural hurdle.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Syrian delegation said the committees on
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights started work on Tuesday
evening. Committees handling security arrangements and
normalization met early on Wednesday and the team dealing with
water issues convened two hours later. He said the convening of
the working groups was a sign of progress in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Jim Fallin said Clinton would
make a decision on Thursday what steps he might take next in the
attempt to mediate between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright sent messages to Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
expressing hope for revival of peace talks between Lebanon and
Israel following the resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> ECB Projects Strong Euro in Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
Wednesday expected a strong euro in year 2000, saying Europe's
single currency would show its capacity in coming prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After the first session of the ECB's executive council in the
new millennium, Wim Duisenberg, president of the ECB, said, "The
euro has a great potential as we have always said."
</P>
<P>
And this potential will take effect in the new year when the 11
eurozone nations catch up pace with the booming U.S. economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The executive council left its three key interest rates
unchanged at the meeting as the market has speculated before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB's main refinancing rate is 2.0 percent, with its
marginal lending facility rate at 4.0 percent and the deposit
facility rate at 2.0 percent. These rates had not been changed
since last November.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said the executive council had deliberately kept the
low interest rates to accelerate the growth of eurozone economy,
and the strong recovery of Asian and emerging market economies
will also help Europe, said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
The ECB president warned that the eurozone countries would face
further pressure of inflation due to higher oil prices and an end
of the food prices' drop.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices will be subject to further pressure, said
Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the immediate upward movement does not
translate into general inflationary pressure and does not trigger
second round effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg told reporters the ECB would stick to its policy
aimed to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The stability-oriented behavior is urgently required, and we
remain confident and vigilant," he said.

The decision was announced by Doris Meissner, commissioner of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The boy, Elian
Gonzalez, should leave Miami and return to Cuba by January 14.
</P>
<P>
"Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both
American immigration law and U.S. practice," Meissner said. "This
little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.
"
</P>
<P>
"The father made it very clear that he wants Elian returned to
him as soon as possible," Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the INS was ready to work with Elian's family in
Miami and others to secure his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian was found clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother and nine others died when their boat sank during their
effort to leave Cuba for Florida during last Thanks-Giving
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Elian in Florida demanded him stay in the U.S.
while the boy's father asked him to be returned to Cuba.

Cuban President Fidel Castro joined Elian's father in demanding
the boy's return and sponsored massive demonstrations on the boy's
behalf.

ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- In the year 2000, Turkey's tourism
sector is expected to pick up from a 1999 recession, the Turkish
Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's hotels have received a record number of applications
for reservations from Europe, especially from Germany. And five of
the world's biggest tourism companies have decided to invest in
Turkey, said the report.

The tourism group of Italy's Fiat has proposed to open a hotel
chain jointly with Turkey's Oger Tur. Spain's Sol Melia group is
looking for suitable spots to build hotels in Turkey. The German
Dorint chain has contacted the Park Oteller group of Turkey for

<P>
Also the Marriot Hotel chain is looking for a Turkish partner.
The French Accor group has shown interest in renting hotels in
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Tui, a German company, is planning to
buy holiday villages along the southern coast of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has drawn up an ambitious long-term plan
to
revitalize the country's tourism sector, which has suffered a major
setback in 1999 due to devastating earthquakes and economic woes.
</P>
<P>
"In the tourism sector, this year's target figure is up to 10
billion (U.S.) dollars," said Huseyin Baraner, secretary general of
the Turkish Tour Operators' Association.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel, Palestine to Speed up Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday called on Israel and the Palestinians to implement
agreements already signed to achieve a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah made the appeal when meeting with an Israeli
delegation headed by Chairman of the Arab Democratic Party in
Israel Abdul Wahab Darawsheh and Israeli Knesset (parliament)
member Talab Sane, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Jordan's support for all peace efforts in the
region when discussions touched upon the latest developments in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel began on Wednesday the long-delayed second stage pullout
from the West Bank, which was part of the September interim peace
deal and was originally scheduled for November 15. Thus, another 5
percent of the West Bank territories will be transferred to the
Palestinian control, with 3 percent to civil Palestinian
administration and 2 percent to full Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah stressed the importance of achieving a rapid
progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track by implementing the
already signed agreements within the agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
The king also expressed satisfaction regarding the progress made
on the Syrian-Israeli track as a complementary and supportive
factor to the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has maintained that the Palestinian issue is the corner
stone to the peace process in the region, and King Abdullah has
used all possible occasions to voice his support for the rights of
the Palestinians, including the establishment of an independent
state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Darawsheh thanked Abdullah for his efforts to
support peace, stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Darawsheh and Sane are among some 300 Arab Israelis, including
Knesset members, political party leaders and journalists, who
arrived in Jordan en route to perform Haj (pilgrimage) to Mecca.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Iraq's Latest Oil Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The office said that of the 82 contracts, 55 had been approved
so far, and the total volume of oil approved was 184.7 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraq exported 18.6 million barrels of oil with an
estimated value of 419 million U.S. dollars, bringing the revenue
for Phase VII of the oil-for-food program to 742 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. Secretariat Wednesday
had received Iraq's full text of Distribution Plan VII including
the annexes.
</P>
<P>
The Distribution Plan was being studied carefully and must be
approved by the U.N. secretary-general before Iraq could begin
purchasing humanitarian supplies with Phase VII funds, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
which is aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by
the stringent U.N. sanctions. The sanctions have been in place
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council to Discuss Congolese War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council will meet later this month to discuss the deteriorating
situation in the war- torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
a U.N. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Guy Pickett, head of the U.N. mission in DRC, told journalists
in the DRC capital Kinshasa that the world body was working hard
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and every country
involved in the Congolese conflict to bring peace to the third
largest African country, according to the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We are also building up confidence to let the Congo people
resolve their crisis themselves," he said. "Peace has to be found
in one way or the other."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia have soldiers fighting alongside DRC
 President Laurent Kabila's army to crush the rebels supported by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Accord aiming to end the more than a year-old
war was signed by all parties to the conflict in last July and
August. However, violation of the cease-fire agreement by both
sides have been taking place since then.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila pledged in his new year message to the
Congolese that he would drive all the rebels out of the DRC.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Urge Tanzania to Press Kabila for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The head of a major rebel
group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has called for
Tanzania to increase its pressure on the Kinshasa government for
the latter to honor the Lusaka peace accord and speed up the
democratization in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government sources quoted Wamba Dia Wamba, head of
the divided Congolese Rally for Democracy, as saying Tuesday in
Dar es Salaam that Tanzania has a key role to play in solving the
16-month civil war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Wamba called on the Tanzanian government to take the Congolese
crisis more seriously than in the past because a troubled and
unstable Congo will go on pumping refugees into the neighboring
Tanzania and thus affecting its economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, from January
to November last year, some 79,000 Congolese refugees fled into
Tanzanian western region of Kigoma to escape the civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese war has threatened development and security in
central Africa, continuing the chaos that started when Laurent
Kabila unseated former President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, when
the country was still known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has persisted in Congo despite a five-month peace
accord signed by Congolese government and its allies Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia and by three rebel factions and their backers,
Uganda and Rwanda.

KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Forces are continuing
to pursue rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the
western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Defense Ministry late Wednesday

NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) team will arrive in Kenya on January 24 for preliminary
talks on the possible resumption of a suspended loan, Kenyan
Finance Minister Chris Okemo said Wednesday.

JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibian defense forces
clashed with and killed some Angolan UNITA rebels near the Angolan
border on Wednesday, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred at the town of Kongola, some 400 kilometers
east of the border town of Rundu, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said Namibian army chief of staff Major-General
Martin Shalli had confirmed the fighting, saying Namibian forces
were determined to fight until all members of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were out of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Shalli has blamed UNITA for an attack on Monday at the town of
Bagani, in which three French children were killed and their
parents and two aid workers wounded.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the rebels killed were involved in the
attack on the French nationals.

Bagani is about about 200 kilometers east of Rundu, the same
distance west of Kongola, and more than 900 kilometers north of

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs More Investment in Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs an investment of some
8,000 billion rials (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) to boost its
power sector in the coming Iranian calendar year to start on March
21, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister in Charge of Electricity Mohammad
Mallaki told the agency Tuesday that 4,000 billion rials (about 1.
33 billion dollars) need to be invested for power generation, some
2,300 billion rials (about 0.77 billion dollars) for transmission
and over 1,700 billion rials (about 0.57 billion dollars) for
distribution in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Mallaki said that by next summer, an extra 725 megawatts of
electricity will be generated by new power stations and connected
to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the current electricity output in the
country. However, the official said last April that the country's
electricity output reached 102 billion kilowatts-hour last Iranian
year and would increase to 108 billion kilowatts-hour this Iranian
year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's power generating capacity was reported at 25,000
megawatts, ranking the 21st in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mallaki also said that the subscribers of power industry in the
country will reach 15 million by the end of the current Iranian
year, adding that Iran annually exports 200 megawatts of
electricity worth 20 million dollars to Turkey, Azerbaijan and
Armenia .
</P>
<P>
"We are now studying export of electricity to some of the
Persian Gulf littoral states, mainly Saudi Arabia," he said, adding
the country's annual electricity exports will reach 400 megawatts
in the course of the third development plan (2000-2005).

combat rising crime.
</P>
<P>
Some 1250 policemen will be soon released from other duties and
begin foot patrols in eastern Athens suburbs and eastern Attica

<HEADLINE> Russia Refuses Chechen Side's Appeal for Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry on
Wednesday turned down a three-day cease-fire proposed by Chechen
leader Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's proposal is nothing but an attempt to gain more
time for regrouping, said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov issued a statement early Wednesday calling on Moscow
to announce a truce from June 8 to 11.
</P>
<P>
The statement, circulated in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, was
sent to OSCE (the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe) chairman Knut Vollebaek by Chechen envoy to Georgia Khizri
Aldamov.
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi-based Chechen representatives told reporters that "the
demand to announce a moratorium was caused by facts concerning the
use of chemical weapons in Grozny by Russian troops."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov invited Russian and foreign experts to get informed "
on material evidence of the Russian side using chemical weapons in
Chechnya's capital."
</P>
<P>
However, Russia quickly refused Maskhadov's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that radicals themselves prepared vessels with
chemicals" to stop the federal offensive against Grozny, the
Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military has repeatedly denied guerrillas'
allegations on the use of chemical weapons by Russians in Grozny,
accusing Chechen rebels of setting off several containers full of
ammonia and chorine to stop the federal units.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, the head of the Georgian Foreign Ministry
public relations department, Avtandil Napetvaridze, said that "
Tbilisi has not recognized and will not recognize Chechnya as an
independent state." Thus, Aldamov who poses as Chechen envoy to
Georgia does not have "any diplomatic status," said Napetvaridze.

JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of South
Africa's disabled citizens has been decreased significantly, the
Health Department announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christelle Kotzenberg, the department's director of chronic
diseases, disabilities and geriatrics, said in Pretoria that the
latest study conducted by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry
(Care) showed that the percentage of the disabled among South

The Care study, the first thorough investigation on disabled
people in South Africa, was conducted among 10,000 households
countrywide, which covered people of four race groups in rural,
urban and metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
It found that the Eastern Cape Province had the highest number
of disabled people at 8.9 percent, with the North West at the
bottom with 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the study have assisted the government to
identify gaps that need to be filled in the provision of

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Presidential Candidates Supports China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) Major Democrat and Republican
presidential contenders in the United States have expressed
support for China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and for giving the country permanent Normal Trade Relations(NTR),
according to a regular survey of the candidates on campaign issues
by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, one of the two leading presidential
candidates in the Democratic Party, said that the agreement
reached with China on its accession to WTO includes measures that
would strengthen U.S. ability to assure fair trade and to defend
its agricultural and manufacturing base from import surges, unfair
pricing and abusive investment practices.
</P>
<P>
Gore also voiced his backing for granting China permanent NTR
through accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to grant China permanent normal trade relations will
put American farmers and factories at a vast disadvantage with
respect to Europe and Japan and hurt our ability to enforce China'
s commitments in the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Bradley, another Democrat hopeful, echoed Gore's call for
enhanced trade status with China.
</P>
<P>
"It is in America's interest to grant China normal trade status
on a permanent rather than annual basis because it would make
China a more reliable trading partner and provide greater access
to the Chinese market for American companies. This will create new
and better jobs for America's workers and farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said he
supports permanent NTR for China as part of China's admission to
the WTO, since it will provide American businesses and farmers
access to China's growing market and narrow U.S. trade deficit
with China.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to work hard to ensure that American exporters get
the full benefit of China's market-opening commitments.
</P>
<P>
John McCain, another Republican heavy-weight candidate,
stressed that maintaining economic and diplomatic relations with
China serves the U.S. national interests, and shutting China off
from the world economy would have the negative effect of turning
China inward.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of its participation in the WTO, China will have
to abide by the organization's standards governing international
trade, and there will be enforcement mechanisms available to
ensure that China does so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate Orrin Hatch said he backs up NTR for China
and China's admission to the WTO under appropriate terms. "America
's farmers and manufacturers would greatly benefit from increased
trade relations with China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reform Party leader Pat Buchanan and Republican
candidates Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes said they are
opposed to giving China Permanent NTR, linking the trade status
with such issues as human rights and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press conducts a regular campaign survey by
asking the major presidential candidates one question each time,
three days a week, on issues concerned by the nation, and the
current question is related to whether China should be granted
permanent normal trade status with the United States.

<HEADLINE> 6 S. African Schools Accused of Barring Black Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Civic Organization Wednesday accused the schools in Meyerton,
south of Johannesburg, of barring black children, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the organization Stanley Tyelentombi said that
only one of the seven schools in Meyerton agreed to admit black
children. However, the school had increased education fees.
</P>
<P>
"The schools are infringing on the children's right to get
education, and they have to give the black children first
preference during admission selection," Tyelentombi stressed.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the black pupils were mostly laborers, farmers
and domestic workers who could not afford to send their children
to schools outside the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyerton was an exclusively white area in the apartheid era,
but black people have moved to the area in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department of Gauteng Province said it was aware
of the problem in Meyerton.
</P>
<P>
The department expressed its hope that the problem could be
solved as soon as possible and all the children in the Meyerton
could be ensured to be admitted to schools near their homes.

<HEADLINE> S. African Association Warns Against Shark Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Lifesavers Association of
South Africa Wednesday issued a warning to bathers on the north
coast of KwaZulu- Natal Province, asking them to be cautious of
shark attacks.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the association Mike Raubenheimer said that the
increasing shark activity on the province's north coast has
resulted from muddy flood water and the carcasses of drowned
livestock washed into the sea at river mouths.
</P>
<P>
Lifesavers have seen a number of tiger sharks feeding on a dead
whale at the mouth of the Tongaat River.
</P>
<P>
Although no attacks on bathers had been recorded, the spokesman
noted that it is his association's responsibility of appealing to
people to stay strictly within shark nets.
</P>
<P>
Bathers should also avoid swimming when lifesavers are not on

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's New Parliament to Open in Mid January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican deputies are to take
their seats in the newly-elected Assembly of the Republic, the
country's parliament, on January 14, the National Elections
Commission announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the announcement after the Supreme Court
validated the results of the December 3-5 general elections
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambican National Resistance
(Renamo), has rejected the court's ruling by renewing his demand
for a recount of the election results.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that if his demand was not heeded "there will be
problems in this country," the Mozambique New Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since there are veiled threats that deputies of the Renamo
might boycott the opening of the new parliament, it might only be
graced by the presence of deputies of the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo).
</P>
<P>
Frelimo has already announced that if Renamo boycotts the
parliament it will go ahead and take its seats, since it can form
a quorum on its own. The quorum is 126 (50 percent of the
members plus one).
</P>
<P>
The parliament has 250 seats, which are shared by Frelimo with
133 seats and Renamo with 117.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the electoral commission has still to set a date for
the swearing-in of incumbent President Joaquim Chissano, for a
further five- year term of office. This should take place within
eight days of the parliamentary investiture.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Surprised at Parliamentary Vote Date Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition parties
Wednesday reacted with surprise at announcement of different dates
for parliamentary elections, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of different poll dates indicated confusion
because there was no collective action within the Cabinet and
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF),
representatives of the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe announced Tuesday that the elections
would still be held in March. Justice, Legal and Parliamentary
Affairs Minister Emmerson Munangagwa had announced that the polls
had been deferred to June to pave way for the constitutional
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Movement for Democratic Change Morgan
Tsvangirai said: "It is almost impossible to have voter education,
campaigns and update the voter's roll before March."
</P>
<P>
He noted that such issues as the voter's roll, the referendum
on the new constitution, the establishment of an independent
electoral commission and voter education are supposed to be looked
into.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition leader said that "we are geared for the
 elections even if they are held in March."
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats Margaret Dongo
also said the ZANU-PF leadership wanted to test if the opposition
parties would welcome the change of dates and back tracked after
the opposition expressed satisfaction.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An emergency team used tear gas
Wednesday morning to force an end to a prison revolt in the
Atlantic Canada province of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the Atlantic Institution in Renous was brought
under control around 6 a.m. after "a fair amount of tear gas" was
put to use, according to an announcement by Corrections Canada.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of inmates set up blockades after lunch Tuesday with a
refrigerator, chesterfield, chairs and a washer and dryer in
protest against, perhaps, a lack of over-the-counter painkillers
during the holiday, indicated Correction staff.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements were brought in from other federal prisons in
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia after Correctional staff failed to
force a lift of the blockade, during which they heard inmates also
smashing furniture.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise 1.2 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that the November increase in factory orders
followed no gain in October and a 1 percent decline in September.
Orders had risen by 1.3 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that factory orders for November rose by 4.5
billion dollars, pushing the total for the month to a seasonally
adjusted 365.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the strength came from a 3 billion dollars gain in
orders being placed with manufacturers of electronic equipment,
reflecting strong demand for components, including semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
The 8.4 percent advance for electronic manufacturing companies
was the fifth increase in the last six months and the biggest
since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Orders for fabricated metals such as steels picked up 2.6
percent to 20.6 billion dollars. This sector is struggling to
recover from a flood of cheap imported steel that forced the
layoff of thousands of U.S. steelworkers and led the industry to
successfully petition for penalty tariffs to stem the tide of
foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
Orders for cars, planes and other transportation equipment
actually fell by 3.5 percent in November to 45.1 billion dollars,
reflecting in large part a drop in demand for aircraft and parts.
</P>
<P>
Not counting the volatile transportation category, orders would
have been up by 1.9 percent in November, the biggest advance since
a 2.6 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
In November, orders for durable goods rose by 0.9 percent. This
represented a downward revision from an advance report two weeks
ago that estimated durable-goods orders had risen 1.2 percent in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods were also up 1.6 percent in
November, following a 1.1 percent October increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the rebound in manufacturing was the latest
evidence that the U.S. economy was still growing at a robust rate
as the year ended.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is moving to her new house in New York to make
herself eligible to run for the U.S. Senate in New York State.
</P>
<P>
The moving-in process began Tuesday when two moving vans,
filled with boxes, rolled up rugs, kitchen chairs and other items,
pulled up at a 1.7 million dollars home the Clintons have
purchased in Chappaqua in Westchester County of the state.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and the first lady are set to begin unpacking
Wednesday and spend their first night in their first home the
Clintons have to call their own since they moved into the Arkansas
governor's mansion in 1983.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that
Clinton decided late last night to join Mrs. Clinton after
determining he wouldn't be needed today at the Mideast peace talks
in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Two old friends were on hand to direct things when the moving
vans arrived Tuesday, said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for the
first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Hillary is very excited about this," Finney said. Mrs. Clinton
hopes to be "fully moved in" by the end of next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hillary said she plans to cut back on first lady duties and
spend most of her time in New York this year.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to compete with New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani from the Republican Party for the Senate seat being
vacated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Leaves for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who resigned six months earlier than law-scheduled term
last Friday, flew with his wife Naina Yeltsin to Israel by the
presidential plane late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He will attend in Jerusalem the celebrations of the 2000th
Christmas, which the Orthodox Church marks on January 7.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will meet Israeli President Ezer Weizmann in Jerusalem
and Palestinian Authority leader Yassir Arafat in the holy city of
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov while traveling aboard the Rossia Il-96 presidential plane.
</P>
<P>
Before Yeltsin's departure from Moscow, acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin met him at the airport door.
</P>
<P>
In saying hello to Putin and shaking hands with him, the ex-
president told other senior figures who were present: "Take note
of this: I'm saying hello to the president."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian security chief Sergei
Ivanov, border guard chief Konstantin Totsky, foreign
intelligence director Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Kremlin staff chief
Alexander Voloshin came to see Yeltsin off.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin answered a few questions by reporters. Asked how he
saw his current status, he said: "I see myself as the first
president of Russia."
</P>
<P>
The ex-president told reporters that he had done a lot of work
over the New Year's holiday. "I was mainly sorting out all the
papers that had accumulated by that time and needed my signature.
There were also important meetings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus ambassador handed Yeltsin a letter from Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko. Yeltsin asked the diplomat to give
his regards to Lukashenko and said: "I respect him."
</P>
<P>
Kremlin deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhodko said Lukashenko'
s letter had been a follow-up to a telephone call between the
Belarussian president and the retired Russian leader. In the
letter, Lukashenko thanks Yeltsin for his cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Warn of Spring Geomagnetic Storms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists are warning
of geomagnetic storms to come as early as in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "another Y2K problem", the storms could cause mass power
blackouts, disruptions in communications and satellite failures in
Canada and other northern countries, Canadian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Montreal-based the Gazette newspaper Wednesday quoted David
Boetler of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) as saying spring
and fall is when the Earth's magnetic field is most in line to be
affected by the sun-eruption-induced storm.
</P>
<P>
The frequency and intensity of these storms correspond with the
sun's 11 year cycle of activity, causing charged particles from
the sun to collide with the Earth's magnetic field. The collision
results in fluctuations in the planet's electrical currents.
</P>
<P>
Quebec is Canada's most susceptible province to a blackout in
the face of geomagnetic storms because of the long transmission
lines from the hydro-electric power station at James Bay in
southeastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
The last great geomagnetic storm caused the collapse of the
Hydro-quebec power system in the winter of 1989, leaving about 6
million people without power for up to 18 hours, said Boetler.
</P>
<P>
"The whole province was out with on traffic lights, no power in
homes or industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
GSC has been working with Hydro-Quebec to develop new systems
to deflect an upcoming possible hit. New filters have been placed
in relays to block the flow of storm currents into the system, the
GSC research scientist added.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-Quebec has invested 1.3 billion Canadian dollars (about
893 million U.S. dollars) since 1989, according to the North
America power giant.
</P>
<P>
Other regions likely to be affected include northern Russia,
Scandinavia and Alaska, Boetler said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Refutes Rebel Attack Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma has refuted a media report that rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) had attacked the Kasese town in
western Uganda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that Kasese town was struck by ADF yesterday
morning as alleged in some sections of the press," the minister
said in a press release issued here on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision, a leading daily in Uganda, reported Wednesday
that the ADF rebels attacked the Kasese district government
headquarters and dropped letters at the offices of the District
Chairman Yokasi Bihande.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted both police and military sources as
confirming the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Information available confirms that a long-standing business
wrangle between business rivals resulted into one of the rivals
burning a kiosk at Lukoki in Kasese town," the state minister
said. "There were no gunshots as alleged."
</P>
<P>
He described the situation in the town as calm and appealed to
the press to desist from irresponsible and alarmist reporting
which causes unnecessary anxiety among the population.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels have attacked soft targets more than half a dozen
times over the past few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Negligence Causes Big Losses in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Lagos State government
has accused Multi-Links Nigeria Limited of disrupting the
government's operations and causing losses amounting to billions
of naira (one U.S. dollar equals some 100 naira) as a result of
Y2K break-out.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Lagos-based private telecom firm Tuesday,
Lagos State Attorney-General Fola Arthur-Worrey, said that the
collapse of the company' s computers last week had caused "serious
disruptions in the official business of the Lagos State
government."
</P>
<P>
The disruption "caused financial losses in emergency services
like hospitals, ambulance and fire, security services, waste
disposal, traffic control and monitoring," the Guardian newspaper
Wednesday quoted the law officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arthur-Worrey said that the Consumption Protection Unit of the
Justice Ministry had been inundated with complaints about the
failure of Multi- Links' systems.
</P>
<P>
Multi-Links, one of the pioneer private telecommunications
companies, had its lines disconnected from NITEL's network last
week allegedly for non- compliance with Y2K standards.
</P>
<P>
The disconnection followed Federal Government's order to
disconnect operators who failed to be Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
This move, according to NITEL, "was to protect the integrity of
the national network and avoid disruption of services."
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 subscribers of the company suffered disruption of
their services as a result of the disconnection.
</P>
<P>
But the firm said it had since Monday been reconnected to
NITEL, following its compliance to the standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuito Oil Field, the first deep
water oil field (over 1,500 meters below the sea level) in Angola,
has been put into production, an official source said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Angola's monopolist oil company Sonangol, the
Kuito Oil Field is located in Block 14, some 60 kilometers off the
coast of the Cabinda Province, with the U.S. Cabinda Gulf Oil
Company Limited as its operator.
</P>
<P>
At present, the daily oil production of the Kuito Oil Field is
announced at 50,000 barrels of high-quality and low-sulphur
petroleum, said Sonangol.
</P>
<P>
The official source predicted that in the following several
years, Kuito Oil Field will have an average daily output of 75,000
barrels, with its highest daily production estimated at 100,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
The start of production is two years later than the discovery
of the Kuito Oil Field in May, 1997, in the Block 14 with an
approximate area of 4, 000 square kilometers, said an official of
the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company Limited.
</P>
<P>
With the daily oil output of 750,000 barrels, Angola is the
second largest oil-producing country in the African continent.
The Angolan government divided the offshore waters into several
exploring blocks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil companies have to bid against each other for the
authority of exploration in certain block.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Israel
are finally starting their committee discussions over key issues
after settling their dispute over which should be dealt with first
in their second round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries, as well as those from the United
States would form four committees, dealing with such major issues
as the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
sharing of water resources, the security arrangement for Israel
and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the committees
would meet over the next couple of days to tackle those
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"They have a work plan and an organizational structure," he
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations began on Monday with a shaky
start with the cancellation of a scheduled three-way meeting among
Syria, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syrian negotiators insisted that discussions on the Israeli
withdrawal from the Strategic Golan Heights should come first
while Israelis preferred to security. The procedural dispute was,
however, smoothed over on Tuesday and President Bill Clinton
returned to the small historic town of Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders talked for about an hour and, according to
reliable sources, made some arrangement for the setting up of
several committees to handle all the outstanding issues that have
led to wars between Syria and Israel over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian source, the committees will meet
simultaneously, thus overcoming the procedural hurdle.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Export Up in 3 Successive Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's annual rice export has
been on the rise for three years in succession.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's official news agency VNA, Vietnam
exported 3.7 million tons of rice in 1997, 3.8 million tons in
1998 and 4.55 million tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is a remarkable improvement over the years between 1989 to
1996 when the country exported only a combined 14.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons behind this achievement, including a
rapid and stable growth of food output (5.3 percent a year), a
favorable foreign exchange rate and the efforts made by the
country's rice export businesses themselves, VNA quoted Vietnam's
Trade Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to export some 4.3 million tons of rice this year,
of which Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta provinces are to
contribute 2.9 million tons. Corporations and companies under the
central government's management and foreign-invested businesses
will export a combined 1.2 million tons and businesses in other
economic sectors will export 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has developed projects to zone off 1 million hectares
in the Mekong Delta and 300,000 hectares in the Red River delta to
produce high-quality rice for export.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Secretary Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu on Wednesday submitted his irrevocable
resignation to President Joseph Estrada with immediate effect,
Filipino ABS-CBN news channel said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was quoted by the ABS-CBN as saying in his resignation
letter to the president that his decision was made after a careful
and lengthy discussion with his family.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu added that he would be able to help the government
better in his private capacity.
</P>
<P>
This is the first resignation made by members of the Estrada
cabinet in the new year. It came days ahead of a proposed cabinet
revamp, which is reportedly set to be carried out in less than 10
days' time.
</P>
<P>
ABS-CBN said President Estrada has accepted the resignation
from Espiritu, who served the government for one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said President Estrada had confirmed that he
will dismiss Espiritu from the cabinet in the upcoming cabinet
revamp.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada himself said in a radio interview Wednesday
that he was having a hard time in finding replacements for the
posts that would be vacated as a result.
</P>
<P>
A decision may be made "within 10 days" on who will be replaced
and who will replace them, Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Leader Rejects Supreme Court's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the
Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), has rejected the Supreme
Court's ruling that validates the results of the general elections
held from December 3 to 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Supreme Court read out a lengthy ruling
that rejected Renamo's 23-point appeal against the poll results.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama renewed his demand for a recount of the election
results and threatened that if his demand was not heeded "there
will be problems in this country," the Mozambique New Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear what Renamo will do, in particular,
whether its elected deputies will take their seats for the first
sitting of the new parliament due to be held within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) has made
it clear that the opening session will go ahead with or without
Renamo. The parliamentary quorum is 126 (50 percent plus one) and
Frelimo alone holds 133 seats.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader claimed that the court was just a
creature of the Frelimo.
</P>
<P>
"We think there's no distance between Frelimo and the Supreme
Court, and so we're not accepting (the ruling) and we propose a
recount," Dhlakama was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The National Elections Committee on December 22 announced that
Frelimo won 48.54 percent of the votes while incumbent President
Joaquim Chissano beat his sole rival Dhlakama by winning 52.29
percent of the votes in the second multi-party elections since
1994.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Gold Output Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's 99 gold mining
entities extracted 10,902.3 kilograms of gold in 1999 and set a
new gold production record.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with previous years, the gold output was
increased by 33.9 percent or 2,763.6 kilograms, the Mongolian news
agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's gold output is growing every year. The rise in
gold production is attributed to an improved mining plan of the
government and the introduction of advanced foreign technology and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The increase in gold extraction affected Mongolia's foreign
reserves positively. By the end of 1999, the country's foreign
reserves reached 116.9 million U.S. dollars, 46 percent higher
than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Canada Records Second Strongest Year of Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada saw its second strongest
year of auto sales in 1999, with an 8 percent increase over the
previous year to just over 1.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper said Wednesday that only 1988 was
a stronger year for vehicle sales, when Canadians bought a record
1.52 million light vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Of the big three auto makers, sales for General Motors of
Canada Ltd. grew 11.3 percent last year, while sales were up 4
percent at Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Only DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. reported a decline of 1.6
percent to 264,817 cars compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among other auto makers, BMW Canada Inc. reported its ninth
consecutive year of record breaking sales, selling 9,011 units, a
17 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto manufacturer Subaru Canada Inc. claimed a gain of
111.6 percent in its market share, bringing its total to 13,018
cars sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most industry observers believe the year 2000 will be stronger
for vehicle sales in Canada, forecasting vehicle sales as high as
1.54 million,according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The average Canadian vehicle was estimated at about 8.5 years
old last year, in contrast with an average age of seven years in
1990.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Canadians in a position to catch up with the
expected "huge incentives offered by manufacturers" for a stronger
year of sales up to 1.54 million in 2000, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Knew of Yeltsin's Plan to Resign: Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President
Vladimir Putin said he knew of Boris Yeltsin's plan to resign and
hand Russia's presidency to him 10 days before Yeltsin made his
shocking New Year's eve public announcement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian ORT television station late
Tuesday, Putin said Yeltsin told him the resignation plan during a
regular meeting on December 22, soon after the recent
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
During the December 19 parliament polls, right-central parties,
including the Kremlin-backed Unity movement, scored a surprise
triumph. The vote results proved to be a strong endorsement for
Putin.
</P>
<P>
"I came to him about 10 days before the New Year to deliver a
report on economic problems and the situation in the North
Caucasus. Soon after I started speaking, I realized that Boris
Nikolayevich was thinking about something else," Putin said in an
interview on the eve of a session of Russia's Federation Council,
the upper house of parliament, to set a date for the early
election.
</P>
<P>
"He interrupted me and said 'I have been thinking for a long
time about the situation in the country and have made the decision
to resign'," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the parliamentary election, Yeltsin told him: "I
made this decision because something I consider very important has
happened: People trust you."
</P>
<P>
Putin said Yeltsin's decision entirely surprised him and he
would have been willing to go on working as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin's move was clearly motivated by the desire to
boost Putin's chances of being elected president.
</P>
<P>
"He wanted the presidential campaign to develop according to
his wishes, he was helping me," Putin said, "To put it flatly, he
gave me a head start in the current presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
The acting president also urged Russians to honor Yeltsin,
making no reference to corruption allegations surrounding Yeltsin
and his family or his decision to give Yeltsin immunity from
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a very kind and humane attitude to the first
president of Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Yeltsin's emotions while leaving the Kremlin,
Putin said Yeltsin gave a few parting words.
</P>
<P>
"He looked around sadly, and said it was sad to leave because
so much was connected with these walls, these premises and the
people who worked here," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
It was "sad" for Russia's first president to leave the Kremlin,
Putin stressed, but Yeltsin was "courageous" and made his own
decision.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing extraordinary about the words Yeltsin said
before departing the Kremlin, "Putin said, "They were said with
some pathos, but at the same time in a very kind and human way.
Addressing me in the end, he said very simple words: Take care of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult experience for him and for all of us,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, named prime minister by Yeltsin last August, met
leaders of the parties to be represented in the new State Duma
Wednesday, the lower chamber of parliament, following December's
elections.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leaders are likely to be his rivals in the
presidential elections, such as Communist Party chief Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the vote must be held within
three months after the previous president resigns.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Council on Wednesday scheduled the poll
for March 26.
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Russian
Central Electoral Commission, the country's presidential election
campaign will kick off Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russian media says initiative groups are being formed to
campaign for Putin, led by activists of the pro-government Unity (
Yedinstvo) party, which finished an impressive second in the
December 19 elections, close behind the Communists.

SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympian Jiang Chengji
made a great comeback as he won the 50 meters freestyle, beating
German Alexander Luederits and Italian De Felice Piergiorgio,
Wednesday, the last day of the FINA World Cup short-course
swimming Shanghai leg.
</P>
<P>
Jiang led all the way from the start to clinch the title with a
time of 22.36 seconds. Luederits was second in 22.42 and
Piergiorgio came to third in 22.45.

"It's my first competition since I returned to the pool for
only two months. I am happy that I regain my confidence though the
results today is not my personal-best," said Jiang, who rested for

<P>
However, placing the elderly in retirement homes has its fair
share of critics. Many consider such a move eroding the time-
honored tradition of respecting the elder generation.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest population of old people in the world.
120 million are aged over 60 and 9 million are over 80. This
figure is expected to increase to 130 million this year. By the
middle of this century the figure is expected to be 400 million.
</P>
<P>
China's elderly poses all kinds of problems in the new
millennium, but the large number in Tianjin has created employment
for some 1,000 people who work with retirement homes. Those aged
over sixty account for ten percent of the total population in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Li Lanqing has called on government officials to
pay particular attention to the elderly. Liu Yazhi, vice-minister
of Labor and Social Security, said that improving the life of
China's elderly is a top priority for the government this year. A
multi-level pension system will be set up and more retirement
homes and special colleges for the elderly will be built.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists say that these changes will allow China's elderly
to gradually choose a new way of life.
</P>
<P>
Lou Mingcheng, a 75-year-old retiree, said that he had been
reluctant to go to the Tianjin Retirement Home fearing that people
would think that his children no longer wanted him. But he soon
changed his mind after visiting the Home. "Here I can chat with
the people of my age and make new friends."
</P>
<P>
As retirement homes become increasingly conspicuous, the
Tianjin government is making every effort to ensure that the
elderly will be well taken care of.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Elderly Chinese have
traditionally lived with their sons and grandsons under the same
roof. However, this is now changing. Many are moving into
retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight years old Liu Chunsheng is one such person who
decided to move out of his big family where he had lived with his
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
"It was the whole family's decision," he told Xinhua in his
bedroom at the Tianjin Retirement Home.
</P>
<P>
"Nurses here handle all household chores which my children had
no time to do. I now feel a sense of tranquillity," said the old
man.
</P>
<P>
In his new home, Liu practices morning exercises everyday,
listens to news, tends to his flowers and reads. Sometimes he
takes part in social activities organized by the retirement home.
</P>
<P>
He meets his sons, daughters and grandsons only at weekends. "
It took me a while at first to get use to this new arrangement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, the number of retirement homes has
increased in Tianjin in recent years. The city now has over 100
such homes which can accommodate around 4,000 people, supported by
private enterprises, or public hospitals. There are now over 1,000
retirement homes across China.
</P>
<P>
"We're very busy with work and don't have much spare time to
look after my mother," said Wen Qiming, a government official. "We
decided to put her in a retirement home. We visit her either after
work or on holidays."

<HEADLINE> Israel Starts Second Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Force (IDF)
began to move their offices and other military equipments out of
six bases in the West Bank Wednesday afternoon, launching the long-
delayed second Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the West Bank said the evacuation from the six army
bases in Bethlehem, Nablus and Jenin could be completed within
hours and the status of the camps will be changed from total
Israeli control to Palestinian civil rule.
</P>
<P>
In all, 5 percent of the West Bank territory will be transferred
to the Palestinian control in the second stage, with 3 percent to
civil Palestinian administration and 2 percent to full Palestinian
rule.
</P>
<P>
All the targeted areas would be marked by Friday after joint
patrols view them on Thursday, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops redeployment, seven weeks overdue, came one
day after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached a compromise
agreement over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The compromise agreement envisages that the second stage will be
carried out as originally planned by Israel while Israel will be
open to Palestinian requests in sketching the maps for the third
withdrawal on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under a September interim peace deal, Israel should quit 18.1
percent more of the West Bank land in three stages ending January
20, with the second phase scheduled for November 15.
</P>
<P>
But differences between the two sides over which lands to be
transferred hindered the handover. The Palestinians demanded for
more densely-populated areas and territories connected to the lands
already under Palestinian rule. They had also insisted that the map
of targeted lands not be decided unilaterally by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are working to negotiate a
framework agreement by mid-February and a permanent peace deal by
September. But little progress has been made so far on the
thorniest issues of the negotiations such as the fate of Jerusalem,
the future of Jewish settlements, borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
This week's handover coincides with a second round of peace
talks in the U.S. between Israel and Syria, which resumed on
December 15 after a 45-month break.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to seal peace
deals with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians by the end of the
year, which prompted speculations that the three Arab parties will
compete for Israel's attention
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials denied that their agreement with Israel on
the land transfer grew out of fear that Syria would overtake them
and first reach peace with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Proposes to Ban Finished Goods Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may impose ban on
importation of finished goods for which local industries have
capacity, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A substantial cutback on raw materials import duties may also
be in the offing; while a safety valve is to be put in place
against goods dumping through proper monitoring of the customs and
inspection agents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Goods likely to be affected by an importation ban include
textiles, edible oil, cement, refrigerators, certain brands of
vehicles, air conditioners, soap and detergents, personal as well
as other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The new policy drive, an apparent reversal of the policy of
import liberalization hitherto pursued, is coming on the heels of
a clamor for Nigeria to review its embrace of World Trade
Organization (WTO) treaties.
</P>
<P>
The treaties stress dismantling of trade barriers among nations
in the spirit of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Presidency sources confirmed that the government could no
longer ignore the unfair competition between imported and the
locally made goods.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, President Olusegun Obasanjo was said to have
expresf 28.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president, according to sources, is convinced that only
protective measures for local producers can boost the sector's
employment profile in line with the official poverty alleviation
drive.
</P>
<P>
To effect the proposed import ban policy, Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar, himself a former Customs officer, is expected to be
directly involved in monitoring of the department's activities.
</P>
<P>
Besides, import inspection agents are to come under closer
scrutiny, to ensure that banned goods do not find their way into
the local market.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Cable TV Market Surges in Recent Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania has become one of the
largest cable TV markets in Europe, with more than 40 percent of
all households connected to the network at the end of 1999, the
local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since cable TV first entered the Romanian
market, the number of cable TV companies and subscribers has
soared, with the most significant increase occurring after 1996
when hundreds of thousands were registered per year.
</P>
<P>
Cable TV accounts for 70 percent of the TV market, and the
country has become the 6th largest consumer in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian cable TV companies, at the start of their
operation, focused only on broadcasting TV programs received
through satellite links.
</P>
<P>
The boom on the Internet started in Romania three years ago and
prompted cable TV operators to offer optional connections to the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian cable TV operators, having a high-performance
infrastructure based on such advanced equipment as fibre-optic
cables, looks set to soon become an important competitor to the
Romtelecom national telephone company, which will also result in
better telephone services.
</P>
<P>
The cable TV companies' turnover has grown constantly. Experts
estimating that a firm with 10,000 subscribers has practically a
monthly turnover of 30,000 U.S. dollars and its net profit is 7,
500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Big firms, such as the Astral TV group or the RCS, have
hundreds of thousands of subscribers and turnover millions of
dollars monthly.

<HEADLINE> Medical Exam to Determine if Pinochet Fit for Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet is receiving a medical examination in a London hospital
to determine his fitness for extradition to Spain to stand trial
for alleged crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The examination is being conducted at the Northwick Park
Hospital in Harrow, north London, at the request of the Chilean
authorities, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, is said to have suffered a number of small
strokes since he was placed under house arrest in London more than
a year ago. The retired general is thought to be suffering from
heart disease, diabetes and depression.
</P>
<P>
The medical tests are expected to take all day and no immediate
result is expected.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokeswoman said the team of doctors would be led
by two specialists, one in diseases of old age and the other in
neurology, adding that every member of the team is an expert in
his field.
</P>
<P>
The official said the doctors' report would not be published
and would be seen only by Home Secretary Jack Straw, government
legal advisers and Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Straw has the last word on Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 while recovering from a
minor back operation in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused him of being responsible for the deaths
and disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule in
Chile, which ended in 1991, and wants him extradited to Spain to
answer the charges.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goals for Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Agriculture
Chen Yaobang said today that restructuring the country's
agriculture and rural economy while helping raise the incomes of
farmers will be a priority this year.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate reform by developing rural enterprises
and strengthening agricultural infrastructure. At a National Work
Conference on Agriculture which opened in Beijing today, Chen said
that China will also accelerate the innovation and popularization
of agricultural technology and improve its poverty relief work.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has set a target of 490 million tons of grain, 3.2
million tons of cotton, 60 million tons of meat, and over 40
million tons of aquatic products for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen has also set a target of over 14 percent growth in rural
enterprises, a 4 percent net increase of farmers' incomes and
bringing more than 10 million people out of poverty in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's agriculture and rural economy maintained a
steady growth despite a slump in the farm produce market at home
and abroad as well as severe floods and droughts that hit most
parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chen particularly stressed restructuring the agriculture sector
and the rural economy which are important in keeping up with the
global economy and liberalization of trade. Rural businesses and
towns need to develop further and more jobs are needed for a
growing number of surplus farmers.
</P>
<P>
The production of farm products should meet the demand of the
market, said Chen, adding that traditional farming methods which
focus only on quantity should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
"Cereal production in eonomically-developed regions can be
reduced according to market demand, but cultivated land should be
protected."
</P>
<P>
Chen called for reduction in the acreage of cotton and sugar
crops as the price of these crops dropped dramatically last year.
Chen said that poor quality indica rice (polished long-grained
nonglutinous rice) varieties in the south, winter wheat grown
south of the Yangtze River and spring wheat in northeastern areas
should be eliminated, while more quality grains and grains for
special purposes should be grown.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should also be taken to promote the
industrialization of animal husbandry, the improvement of farm
machinery and aquatic breeding, said Chen, adding that the "zero
growth" plan for marine fishing will continue to be implemented
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Conference will end on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Deputy PM Visits China on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz left here on Wednesday for Beijing on a several-day visit to
China, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said Aziz, who will also visit Malaysia after his China
trip, will hold talks with officials of the two countries over ways
of enhancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Malaysia abstained from voting on a United
Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq last December, which
was supported by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, a new arms inspection body called the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) will
be established to replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year trade sanctions on Iraq will be suspended should
Baghdad fully cooperation with the new U.N. arms inspection body
and fulfill key disarmament tasks to be defined by weapons
inspectors, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused that the new weapons inspection regime is a tool
aimed at keeping the embargo in place, and has repeatedly declared
its rejection to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and France, three permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council favor the lifting of the crippling embargo imposed
on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Unemployment Rate to Reach 15.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Iran will
reach 15.3 percent by the end of the next Iranian calendar year
ending March 20, 2001, local newspaper Iran Daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed population will reach 2.8 million by that time,
the daily quoted a report from the Plan and Budget Organization
(PBO) as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the current Iranian year, the work force supply will
reach 17.7 million while the demand is expected to be at 15
million, bringing the unemployment rate to 15.25 percent. Iran
reported a 9.08 percent unemployment rate for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 1.9 million educated people will enter the
labor market during the current Iranian year while there are only
1.5 million vacancies for them, indicating an unemployment rate of
around 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PBO also predicted that the unemployment rate for educated
work force in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005) will
hit 15.9 percent as the number of work force will reach 2.94
million while the demand will be at 2.47 million.

<HEADLINE> Kharrazi Reiterates Iran's Policy on Palestinian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has reiterated Iran's policy on the Palestinian issue,
saying that Tehran is still determined to restore rights of the
Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to diplomatic representatives of Islamic countries and
organizations in Tehran on Tuesday evening, Kharrazi said that the
Palestinian issue will always remain as an integral part of Iran's
foreign policy, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
and President Mohammad Khatami pay due attention to the issue of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The massive participation of Iranian people in the International
Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Day rallies on Friday was a clear-cut
indication
of solidarity between the Iranian nation and the oppressed nation
of Palestine, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Iranians from all walks of life turned out on
Friday, voicing their support for the Palestinian struggles and
condemning any compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in
1980
announced the last Friday of the Islamic holy fasting month of
Ramadan as the International Al-Qods Day, calling for international

support for the Palestinians to "liberate" Jerusalem from the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the tragic story of Palestine with a large
number of homeless Muslims and the situation in the holy Al-Qods is

one of the most deplorable issues of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The expansionist policies of the Israeli regime along with
support of the big powers, particularly the U.S., have led
to violation of the rights of the Palestinian nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize Israel and opposed the Middle East
peace process. It called on Muslims to fight to liberate Jerusalem
and occupied territories and root out the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also underlined the need of unity
among Muslims and termed it as an important factor for their
development.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret that the Islamic world has not yet achieved
the needed unity, he said that the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), under the chairmanship of President Khatami, has
made great efforts to establish unity among world Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Faces Difficulty in Choosing Cabinet Replacements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada admitted Wednesday that he has difficulty in finding the
right replacements for the proposed cabinet revamp.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the president said he could not simply
announce who among his cabinet members will be replaced since he
has not yet found the right officials to take over the posts that
will be vacated.
</P>
<P>
He said he still has to check the background of every official
that will be named to his cabinet, so that he can be certain of
their integrity and competence.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the reason he is having difficulty in finding
the right persons to name to his cabinet is the low pay offered in
government service, adding that those who are qualified for the
job receive five times the salary being offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, he explained, private individuals look at a
government appointment as a thankless job because of the
criticisms they have to face as they join government service.
</P>
<P>
He said that in finding the replacements for his cabinet, he
will have to appoint people who would be willing to make
sacrifices in serving the government and risk facing all these
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio program, the president said he may make an
announcement sooner than the 10-day time frame he had earlier set,
but he would not say exactly when.
</P>
<P>
"Most likely, it may not take 10 days for me to announce it,"
he said when asked to elaborate on his earlier statements before
the media as to when his final judgment will be made public.
</P>
<P>
"There will be new faces in the cabinet. Other cabinet members
will simply be moved to another department," he said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 13 in Sri Lanka's Suicide Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a suicide
bombing outside the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's Office here
Wednesday rose to 13, the state radio said.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, six were killed on the spot, the radio said,
adding that seven others succumbed to their injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the explosion happened when the woman
suicide bomber was stopped and questioned by security personnel in
front of the Prime Minister's Office on Colombo's Flower Road.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Prime Minister's Security Division and a
woman translator who was helping the police question the bomber as
well as the bomber were killed on the spot, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, mother of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was not in the office at the time
of explosion, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
suspicion fell on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who have been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the island country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed a similar suicide bombing last month
against President Kumaratunga on the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who lost her right eye in the bombing, has been on
the top of the LTTE's hit list due to her vow to pressure the
rebel group by military means back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Deports Asian Businessman With British Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Tuesday deported an Asian
 businessman with a British citizenship for his campaigning
against Zambia's unity, according to Zambian Minister of Home
Affairs Peter Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
Majid Ticklay has been deported to Britain where he is a
citizen, Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ticklay has of late been abusing the privileges Zambians have
accorded him during his long stay in the country by campaigning
against the nation's unity, strength and peace, Machungwa said in
Lusaka on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday Ticklay wrote a letter to the Asian community,
urging the Asians in the southern African country to join hands
with the rest of Zambians to elect the next government.
</P>
<P>
In the letter he said that although Asians have been loyal
citizens, they have been sidelined by the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Asian community in Zambia is now to identify
which political party among the ruling and opposition parties it
can support, said Ticklay, who had been in Zambia for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Machungwa noted that the government and people of
Zambia cherish and believe in the concept of "One Zambia One
Nation" and that all Zambians, despite tribe, color, creed or race
should live and strive together in peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Government will therefore not tolerate those bent on sowing
messages designed to promote ethnic divisions, hatred, racial
discrimination and anarchy among the people of this country," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that while appreciating freedom of speech,
the interest of each individual and Zambians as a whole must be
protected.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council, the
upper house of parliament, Wednesday set March 26 as the date for
the country's early presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The motion was passed by 145 votes against one.
</P>
<P>
The winner in election will replace Boris Yeltsin, who
resigned last Friday, six months before the scheduled term expires.
The constitution stipulates an election must be held within three
months following the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kremlin sources said Russian Acting President and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin takes the view that elections must
be held strictly in accordance with the Russian Constitution on
March 26, the last Sunday of the third month after early
resignation of previous president.
</P>
<P>
In the Kremlin's opinion, this is the best date as all
presidential candidates should enjoy equal conditions for running
their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Russian Central
Electoral Commission (CEC) said that the country's presidential
election campaign will kick off Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Passes Arbitration (Amendment) Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Wednesday passed the
Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 1999 to implement the arrangement on
the reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards between the mainland
and the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 1999 defines clearly the type
of mainland awards that can be enforced in Hong Kong and sets out
relevant procedures and grounds for refusal of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that only the mainland awards made by
recognized arbitral authorities would be enforced in the Hong Kong
SAR and the list of recognized arbitral authorities will be
published from time to time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill adapts the Arbitration Ordinance to bring
it into conformity with the Basic Law and Hong Kong's status as a
special administrative region of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the return of Hong Kong to China, the recognition and
enforcement in Hong Kong of arbitral awards made in other
jurisdictions, including the mainland, were governed by the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards done at New York, also known as the New York Convention.
</P>
<P>
The New York Convention continues to apply in the Hong Kong SAR
after its return. However, since the convention is an
international agreement, it is no longer applicable to the
enforcement of arbitral awards between the mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government reached consensus with the
mainland in this aspect. The new arrangement was made in
accordance with the spirit of the New York Convention and will
allow awards made by more than 100 mainland arbitral authorities
with relevant experience to be enforced in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 22 Palestinian Criminal Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel released Wednesday 22
Palestinians jailed for criminal offenses as a goodwill gesture to
mark the end this week of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prisons Authority said 20 of the released were
convicted of illegal entry into Israel and were sentenced to up to
one year in prison. The other two were convicted of homicide.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the release was not connected with
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) held no official ceremony to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 33 Palestinian political prisoners jailed for anti-
Israel activities last month in the third and last batch of release
under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in September. Israel had
freed 350 political prisoners in the first two batches.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the two sides would meet after
Ramadan to discuss the release of more political prisoners. The PNA
said more than 1,600 political prisoners were still jailed in
Israeli prisons.

<HEADLINE> Israel Starts Second Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel Defense Force (IDF)
started Wednesday a long-delayed troop redeployment in the West
Bank, a day after reaching a compromise agreement with the
Palestinians over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The IDF began moving their office and other military equipment
out of a military base near the West Bank city of Nablus Wednesday
morning as part of the second troop redeployment, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
Under a September interim peace deal, the second troops pullout
should have been carried out on November 15, but it ran aground due
to differences between the two sides over which lands should be
transferred.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand for more densely populated areas and
insisted that the map of targeted land not be decided unilaterally
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The compromise agreement envisages that the second stage will be
carried out as originally planned by Israel while Israel will be
open to Palestinian requests in sketching the maps for the third
withdrawal on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the Tuesday agreement, the IDF will evacuate from seven
military bases, six in the northern areas of the West Bank and a
seventh near Bethlehem in the stage.
</P>
<P>
Besides, IDF will transfer 2 percent of the West Bank land from
Area B, in which Israel controls security and Palestinians exercise
civil administration, to total Palestinian-controlled Area A, and 3
percent from full Israel-controlled Area C to Area B, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
All the targeted areas would be marked by Friday after joint
patrols view them on Thursday, the IDF said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Beefs up Efforts to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Executive
Council, the country's top federal executive body, has approved 10
billion naira (100 million U.S. dollars) fund for poverty
alleviation programs in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The appropriation is still to be ratified by the country's top
legislature, the National Assembly, Daily Time newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in capital Abuja Tuesday, the Federal
Executive Council also decided to scrap three agencies in a bid to
rationalize the country's poverty alleviation regime.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies to be scrapped are the Family Economic
Advancement Program, the Nigeria Agricultural Land Development
Authority and Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has resolved to set up a Poverty
Alleviation Council chaired by President Olusegun Obasanjo to
speed up its poverty alleviation drive in the most populous
African country.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the action is part of the
restructuring of the 16 poverty alleviation agencies to
materialize Obasanjo's new year pledge to wage war against poverty
in this country.
</P>
<P>
"The government is aware of the various effects of poverty in
the land and is looking at the ways and means of improving the lot
of the people," said Minister of Cooperation and Integration in
Africa Jerry Gana.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources would be restructured with a view to enhancing services
like tractor hiring, land clearing and development, fertilizer
distribution, and the provision of seeds.
</P>
<P>
The council has also set specific targets for different
ministries directly involved in the poverty alleviation program,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education would increase the adult literacy
rate in the country from the current level of 51 percent to 70
percent while health care delivery would shoot up from the present
level of 40 percent to 70 percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The immunization for children would be increased from 40
percent to 100 percent, and rural water supply, from 30 percent to
60 percent, rural electrification from 30 percent to 60 percent
before 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other poverty alleviation programs include a vastly improved
micro credit scheme, the improvement of rural feeder roads across
the country and the development of simple processes, agricultural
machines and small-scale industries.

<HEADLINE> Serious Flu Hits Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A serious flu epidemic is
sweeping through Albania as the country enters the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The flu has so far killed at least 13 people across the country,
including four in the capital of Tirana, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
During the New Year holiday, the situation got worse as most
pharmacies were closed and many patients could not get the
medicines needed.
</P>
<P>
In Tirana, the number of patients is growing too large for the
local hospitals to handle, said the Albanian Minister of Health
and Environment Leonard Solis. Hospitals elsewhere are also
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry would meet on Thursday to
discuss measures to fight the disease, which some doctors call the
"Australian flu," while others say it may have originated in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The flu patients easily run fevers as high as 38 or 39 degrees
Celsius, and must be kept in bed for several days to a week. For
children, the flu can easily develop into bronchial pneumonia.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Goods Flooding Into South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese commodities have been
flooding into South Korea since a ban was lifted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two Japanese goods, including camcorders, electric rice
cookers, mobile phones, VCRs and kitchen appliances, which were
freed from the list of import source diversification goods,
registered substantial sales rise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months last year, the 32 Japanese imports
amounted to 207 million U.S. dollars, up 121.7 percent from the
same period in 1998, according to the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The imports of Japanese consumer goods skyrocketed 999 percent
in that period while those of raw materials and capital goods
surged 62.9 percent and 98.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In return for a bailout loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after
South Korea was gripped by a financial crisis in late 1997, the
nation agreed with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate
the import source diversification policy, which banned the import
of a number of Japanese goods to avoid a large trade deficit with
Japan.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's GDP Expected to Grow 6.3 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic
product (GDP) will rise 6.3 percent this year compared with the 10.
1 percent estimated last year, the Korea Institute of Finance said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP will grow 7.3 percent in the first quarter, 6.5 percent
in the second, 5.9 percent in the third and 5.7 percent in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The exports will rise 9.8 percent and imports 18.1 percent to
narrow the current-account surplus to 11.3 billion U.S. dollars,
less than the government's target of 13 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inflation will reach 3.5 percent. The South
Korean government recently lowered its inflation target to three
percent or lower.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will be hard to maintain below four percent since
corporate restructuring will continue through this year, said the
institute.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are expected to edge up in tandem with an
expected rise in the United States. Consequently, the corporate
bond yield will reach 10.5 percent in the first half and 10.7
percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
The is also different from that of the government which expects
the rates to remain in single digit figures.
</P>
<P>
If measures to deal with the Daewoo Group's liquidity problem
and the financial health of investment-trust companies go awry,
interest rates could soar to 13 percent and cause stock prices to
tumble.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors would then pull their money out of the
country, thereby leading to destabilization of the economy, the
institute warned.

TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new autos in Japan
registered their third consecutive yearly decline in 1999, falling

</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1984 that the country's domestic

<HEADLINE> 7 New NPC Deputies from Macao SAR to Be Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Seven deputies from the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), in addition to the current five NPC deputies, are
expected to be chosen at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
An electoral conference, which is composed of 203 Macao
residents with Chinese citizenship, held the first plenary meeting
on Wednesday. Another four plenary meetings will be held in the
month until the seven deputies are selected.
</P>
<P>
The entire process of choosing new NPC deputies from the Macao
SAR will go on "fairly, justly and openly," He Chunlin, secretary-
general of the NPC Standing Committee, said at the plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NPC deputies are members of the country's supreme
power organ, and the deputies from the Macao SAR will take part in
exercising power in accordance with the country's Constitution and
other laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the system of the people's congress will not be
applied in the Macao SAR and the NPC deputies of the region will
not intervene in concrete local affairs, He Chunlin stressed.
</P>
<P>
Out of the electoral conference members, the first plenary
meeting chose nine persons to form a presidium, with Macao SAR
Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah acting as its executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
The presidium is in charge of putting forward a draft specific

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Cabinet Reshuffle Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A major reshuffle to the Jordanian
cabinet is becoming imminent, with five ministers expected to be
replaced, reliable sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, key portfolios pertaining to economy, foreign affairs
and information will not be touched upon in the upcoming reshuffle
to the 23-member cabinet, added the sources, who asked to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi resigned last month over
policy differences with Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi was the second minister to resign in the 10-month-old
Rawabdeh government after Minister of Youth and Sports Mohammad
Kheir Mamser resigned last July for similar reasons. Mamser's post
was later given to Saeed Shuqum, a former professional basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
After Lawzi's resignation, his portfolio was given temporarily
to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Jamal Sarayreh.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarayreh and four other ministers are expected to leave
the cabinet during the reshuffle, including Health Minister Ishak
Maraka, Minister of Culture Faisal al-Rafua, Minister of Industry,
Trade and Supply Mohammed Asfur and Justice Minister Hamzeh Haddad.
</P>
<P>
There are no clear indications for the moment as to who will
fill the vacancies, and the coming one or two weeks will see
intensive consultations and lobbyings for the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rawabdeh had also been rumored to loose his job,
but the speculations came to a halt late last December after King
Abdullah Bin Hussein renewed his confidence and asked Rawabdeh to
carry on his duties.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch has the constitutional rights of
dissolving or appointing governments.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh apparently secured his job as the Jordanian economy is
emerging from a decade-old stagnation after the 1990 Gulf Crisis,
in which the kingdom found itself isolated by other Arab nations
for sympathizing with Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is expected to achieve a 2 percent economic growth
in 1999 though official figures have not been released.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming reshuffle was aimed at garnering support for
various social, economic and administrative reforms carried out by
Rawabdeh after he took office in March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A series of steps by the government have drawn attacks from the
public and opposition parties, including its drive to privatize key
public enterprises, its crackdown on dissident Muslims and its
decision to levy a 10-percent tax on consumption.

<HEADLINE> Five Businessmen Authorized to Sell Arms in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- At least five private
businessmen in Tanzania have been licensed to sell firearms and
explosives for civilian use, the Guardian newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Police Force spokesman and Senior Assistant
Commissioner of Police (SACP) Aden Mwamunyange, the businessmen
were given the permission after the police had carefully
investigated their personality, their ability to conduct the
business and their background.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the private businessmen, who were from
Dar es Salaam and the north region of Kilimanjaro, were given the
permission at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, firearms and explosives "will not be sold like
peanuts", he said, noting that although there are some private
businessmen selling firearms, individuals who want to own them
would still have to get a license from the Police Force.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the government issued a statement to businessmen
 interested in starting dealership of weapons and explosives and
announced a list of regulations and qualifications for them to
meet before being authorized.

The win was Belgium's first of the tournament and gives it an
outside chance of making Saturday's final, while the U.S. team of
Alexandra Stevenson and James Blake is now out of contention after
successive losses.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost, who has lost both her singles matches this week,
said it was a relief to be on the winner's list at last in the
mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that we won the doubles, because I was feeling
very bad after losing my singles match for the second time," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give everything that I could in the doubles and I
did that and I won, so I'm very glad," she added.
</P>
<P>
The tie was clearly the longest of the tournament thus far,
with every match going the distance.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Allegations Over Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unidentified Foreign Ministry officials made the denial in an
interview with the Turkish Daily News that published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the ministry would like to say it has made no
further demands of Syria since an agreement was signed by the two
sides in Turkish southern city of Adana in October, 1998, neither
die it has asked the U.S. to keep Syria in the list.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria are long-standing rival in the Middle East,
with the two accusing each other of supporting one another's anti-
government groups.
</P>
<P>
The two countries last year came to the brink of a war Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the PKK who had once taken shelter in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The clarification was seen as a gesture for the support of the
ongoing Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is closely following the Israeli-Syrian peace
negotiations with concern over the issue of water, which was raised
by Syria in talks in 1996 before the break.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has reiterated that it fully backs the peace process, but
will not accept bargaining over its water.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in possible final accord between Israel and
Syria, Israel might maintain the control of the water sources in
the Golan Heights and would ask Turkey to offer more water from the
Euphrates River to Syria as a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been reluctant to provide more water to Syria and
Iraq, which sit on the lower reaches of the Euphrates River.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli diplomats in Ankara has told Turkish Daily News that
Israeli government has assured Ankara that they would not accept
any deal over Turkish water.

<HEADLINE> No Dialog With Iraq Before War Prisoners' Release: Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
said that his country refuses any dialog with Iraq before Baghdad
releases Kuwaiti and other nationals held as prisoners of war
(POWs) after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait rejects any direct meeting with (Iraqi) officials until
the release of all our prisoners, or even part of them," Deputy
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah has said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ought to "first show good intention in the detainees issue
and then we will talk about direct encounter," said Salem, also
chairman of the National Committee for POWs and Missing Affairs,
the Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salem was reacting to a call made at the end of last year by
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Kuwait to start direct talks
with Iraq. Yemen sided with Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that Iraq is still holding more than 600 Kuwaiti
and third country nationals detained by Iraqi troops in their
occupation of Kuwait, a charge rejected by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official accused Iraq of showing "no good intention"
in this respect and "continuing to use the detainees as a
bargaining chip."
</P>
<P>
The POWs matter remains the major block to a direct Kuwaiti-
Iraqi contact, which might lead to a breakthrough in the relations
between the two Arab foes.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Under an order by King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Saudi Arabia has established a nine-member supreme
council to chart the policies on oil, gas and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The council, chaired by the king, will adopt gas and oil

<HEADLINE> New Kurdish Parties on Horizon in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish intellectuals of Kurdish
origin have started initiatives to form new political parties in
the country, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after they were relieved of the oppression from
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been seeking
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey through violent
means, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK military actions in the country have weakened since the
capture of its leader Abdullah Ocalan and many of its radical
members have left Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Some former Kurdish members of leftist Turkish parties have
planned a new leftist party while some others have initiated a
right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
Serafettin Elci, a lawyer of Kurdish origin and former Turkish
minister of public works and housing, is planning to form a liberal
and more independent party.
</P>
<P>
He said "we would not call ourselves a Kurdish party," adding,
however, that "if we were referred to as one (Kurdish party), it
would not bother us. If the current laws in Turkey permitted us to
form a Kurdish party, we would have founded one."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the political party his people are organizing
will "have respect for the territorial integrity of the Turkish
Republic and refrain from all forms of violation."
</P>
<P>
The party, he said, will "place a special emphasis on three
basic rights, which are language, culture and education."
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that "we request that every ethnic group has the
right to set up its own educational progress and want regional
administrations to replace the centralized structure. We are not
against the official language but a second language should be
authorized in regional administrations."
</P>
<P>
"Although we support liberal national economy, we believe state
intervention could eliminate inequality between regions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Syria-Israel Peace Deal to Bring Trade Boom: Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid the resumption of Israeli-
Syrian peace talks, Israel's business circle is already
anticipating a peace payoff in trade and investment ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli exports to Syria in the event of a peace treaty would
amount to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars a year, a report prepared by
Israel Manufacturers Association estimated.
</P>
<P>
The report, published Wednesday, said the Israeli exports to
Syria would consist largely of agricultural goods, communication
equipment and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Israel's exports of machinery and equipment, such as heating and
cooling systems, to Syria could reap some 600 million dollars a
year, and the exports of chemicals could also collect about 385
million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Other Israeli companies are also following the development of
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks and examining market opportunities
for Israeli firms in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Another potential for bilateral trade between Israel and Syria
lies in Syrian exports of natural gas to Israel, Amit Consulting
and Enterprising, a consulting group on energy and environment, has
said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 20-dollar-per-barrel oil price, Syrian revenues
from natural gas exports to Israel could reach 200 million dollars
each year.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Block 35 Agricultural Contracts: Iraq </HEADLINE>

<P>
BGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of blocking 35 of its agricultural and
veterinary contracts signed in phase six of the oil-for-food deal
with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Agriculture Minister Abdul Ella Hameed held the U.S. and
British envoys at the committee responsible for stymying the deal
signed mainly with companies from France, Spain, Italy, Turkey,
Egypt and China, the Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contracts were for the purchases of generators,
insecticides, pumps, prerequisites for poultry and irrigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the sufferings of
the Iraqi people, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in Iraq in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately hindering the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oregon State Sells Surplus Property On Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Oregon has become the first
U.S. state that is selling some of its surplus property -- from
street signs to traffic lights -- on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The items being sold were declared surplus by the state or
confiscated by police, according to some local officials, who said
80 percent of the profit goes back to the contributing agency; the
balance is paid for salaries and administrative costs of the
surplus property program.
</P>
<P>
The state still conducts six traditional auctions a year and
has a "general store" open at other times to get rid of surplus
goods.
</P>
<P>
Lighter and more-expensive items are sold over the Internet,
while larger, more-bulky items are sold on traditional auctions,
said Nole Bullock, who works with the surplus property program.
</P>
<P>
Profits from the online sales have been twice those of
traditional, oral auctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bullock said Oregon plans to launch a Web site that will
allow consumers to buy goods over the Internet and pick it up
locally. That will enable the state to sell larger, bulkier items
such as desks and chairs without having to pay shipping costs,
Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
The state has put some "wacky stuff" like a wrong-way street
sign on the Internet and has found buyers around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Scotland, England, Guam, Australia, Korea. ...The power of the
Web is immense," Bullock said, adding that "it has been phenomenal.
"
</P>
<P>
Skip Morton, manager of the state's property distribution
center, says he believes Oregon is the first state to use the
Internet to get rid of surplus goods.
</P>
<P>
Officials from other states are asking how to launch their own
online sales program.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of states really get interested in this,"
Bullock said. "Everyone is getting on board with this and wanting
to know how we did it."

<HEADLINE> East China Province Reduces Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all major manufacturers
which had been causing serious air pollution in east China's
Jiangsu Province have now stopped emitting soot and dust.
</P>
<P>
This means that the emission of soot, dust, and sulphur dioxide
in the province will be reduced annually by 102,000 tons, 124,000
tons and 56,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has been
suffering from moderate air pollution over the past decades as the
local economy surges forward.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government launched a massive pollution-control
campaign several years ago focused on stopping its 1,129 major
manufacturers from polluting the air.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 700 million yuan has been spent for various
pollution-control facilities at these enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Foreigners Arrested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen foreigners were detained
Tuesday in Cyprus' southern coastal town of Limassol in an
operation against illegal immigrants, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ten Iranians, five Syrians and three Jordanians were rounded up
in the Immigration Department operation against foreigners living
and working in Cyprus without permits.
</P>
<P>
The sweep was part of an ongoing nation-wide campaign against
foreigners staying the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
"The foreigners were transferred to the central prison, and the
procedure for their deportation had already began," a senior
Immigration Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against illegal immigrants will continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cyprus police is looking into an alleged
shipwreck case, in which 17 foreigners were rescued off Cyprus'
southeastern coast on New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the survivors may not be telling the truth
about the incident because an extensive coast guard search failed
to locate any trace of the 4,700-ton vessel that was said to have
sunk.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Forecast to Have Higher Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth for 1999 will reach 5.2 percent as forecast
by stockbroking house TA Securities Bhd (TA).
</P>
<P>
The stockbroking firm is estimating the growth rate for the
fourth quarter of 1999 to be 9.9 percent, yielding a tentative 5.2
percent GDP growth for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The growth forecast was based on the 23.1 percent surge in
November's Industrial Production Index (IPI) which exceeded the
earlier expectation of 13.2 percent, on the back of strong export-
led growth in the electronic sector, TA said in its economic focus
released in a statement here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IPI for November 1999 surged to another record high on the
back of strong performance of the manufacturing sector which has a
32.6 percent increase in the output, accounting for 70.4 percent
in the IPI, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayban Securities, another stockbroking firm, has
forecast Malaysia's GDP to grow by 5.2 percent in 2000 against a
growth of 4.2 percent estimated for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the country's economic outlook in a statement here
Wednesday, Mayban Securities said the bright economic outlook was
supported by stronger exports, estimated to grow at 5.8 percent
year-on-year, and revival of private consumption at 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We foresee the 2000 budget deficit (13 billion ringgit or
about 3.421 billion U.S. dollars, or 4.4 percent of Gross National
Product) and high economic development expenditure (23.7 billion
ringgit or about 6.236 billion U.S. dollars) as positive,
providing the needed boost to domestic activities," the company
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the overall growth in 2000 will be broader-based
with construction projected to post 1.4 percent growth although
mining will remain negative.
</P>
<P>
Mayban Securities said that manufacturing, despite its higher
base, would continue to lead the economy while the current account
would remain sturdy at 17.2 percent of nominal GNP versus 16.9
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has forecast a 4.3 percent GDP growth for 1999
and a 5.0 percent growth for 2000.

No one was reported hurt in the fire that gutted a paint

Seven fire trucks from the city and neighboring towns rushed to

According to fire authorities, the fire started inside the
warehouse, filled with stocks of paint and paint materials, at
about noon.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Three African Countries Hit by Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cholera had been reported
over the festive season in three African holiday destinations, the
British Airways Travel Clinics announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cases of the outbreak had been reported in Malawi, Zimbabwe and
the Comoros, Andrew Jamieson, the spokesman for the clinics, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cholera had been reported in Malawi's two largest cities of
Lilongwe and Blantyre as well as outlying areas. At least 17 cases
had reported in the past two weeks and doctors were recording
several new cases everyday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe reported at least 17 deaths from cholera in the
northern parts of the country in the past fortnight. Moreover, 300
cases had been reported in Mashonaland West and the official count
was expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan Island has been seen as the center of the cholera
outbreak in the Comoros with 103 cases and 14 deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
The rise in cholera cases has been blamed on advent of the
annual rainy season, coupled with inadequate sanitation
facilities, which caused faecal contamination of water and food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is now firmly established in many parts of Africa.
With the onset of this heavy rainy season, we can expect cholera
to be reported from many destinations in the region," Jamieson
said.
</P>
<P>
He advised travellers visiting these destinations to exercise
extreme caution with the water they drank and the food they ate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Look for More Land for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
might be forced to look for more land to accommodate refugees as
the on-going massive influx of Burundian refugees threatens to
congest the existing camps.
</P>
<P>
The government may have to ask local authorities in the western
regions of Kigoma and Kagera to allocate more land for new camps
if the refugees continue to increase, the Guardian newspaper
Wednesday quoted Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir
Mohamed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in the wake of fresh influx of
Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13,000 new Burundian refugees were settled in Kigoma
camps last month, compared with just over 5,000 in the previous
month, according to statistics by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Apart from looking for more land to settle the exploding
refugee population, the government would also have to tighten
security at the camps, Ameir said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs Six Million U.S. Dollars for Train Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola needs some six million
U.S. dollars for an emergency program of rehabilitating the train
circulation from Luanda to the town of Lucala in the Kwanza-norte
Province, official source said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Director-General of the Luanda Railroad Enterprise
Manuel Rodrigues, his company hopes to get one million U.S.
dollars for building a new bridge over the river Luinha, 185
kilometers from Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The old Luinha Bridge was destroyed in 1992 by rebels during
the civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The other five million U.S. dollars will be used to buy
railroad cars, tracks and communication equipment, Rodrigues said,
adding that his company will also reconstruct train stations and
residences for the maintenance staff.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is aimed to extend the railroad to Lucala, a
 strategic town considered as the doorway to the north and
northeast Angola, will facilitate the return of displaced people
to their hometowns, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
he said that circulation of trains between Luanda and the city
of Dondo in Kwanza-norte Province, suspended for security reason
for nine months, is also scheduled to be resumed this week.

<HEADLINE> 42nd Grammy Nominees Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Santana, a 52-year-
old guitarist, received 10 Grammy nominations Tuesday for his
commercial comeback album "Supernatural", leading all nominees for
the 42nd annual Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
"Supernatural," Santana's best-selling collaboration with such
stars as Eric Clapton and Lauryn Hill, was nominated for best
album and rock album of the year.
</P>
<P>
Santana was also nominated for record of the year for "Smooth,"
which and another Santana's hit, "Love of My Life" accounted for
two of the five nominees for pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
In pop music categories, the group TLC was the second with six
nominations for the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
Besides album of the year, TLC's nominations included best
rhythm and blues album, record of the year for "No Scrubs," and
pop vocal performance by a duo or group for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations.
Other multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five,
and the Backstreet Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Hill and
Whitney Houston, all with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
The best new artist nominees were Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray,
Kid Rock, Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
Santana's group has put out 29 albums over 30 years, but it has
been many years since he has had a major commercial success. He
said that the nominations Tuesday were gratifying and he had never
felt slighted.
</P>
<P>
Music industry sources say Santana's Grammy recognition is the
latest chapter in one of rock's greatest comeback stories. Since
forming in 1967 and enjoying hits such as "Black Magic Woman" and
"Oye Como Va," Santana's band has received just one Grammy
nomination in 1972, while Santana himself has one win, in 1988,
for his solo work.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Santana's band had focused more on touring
than on recording. But last June, it released "Supernatural,"
featuring collaborations with some of today's hottest artists, and
it went on to become its first chart-topping album in 28 years. U.
S. sales to date stand at 4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The 42nd annual Grammy Awards will be announced on February 23
at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The voters honor works for
their artistic merit, but commercial success plays an inevitable
role in their decisions.
</P>
<P>
For example, all but one of the five nominees for album of the
year topped the U.S. pop charts last year, led by the biggest
album of 1999, Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" with sales of 9.3
million copies. Also competing are the Dixie Chicks' "Fly,"
Canadian jazz singer Diana Krall's "When I Look in Your Eyes," and
TLC's "FanMail." Krall's album peaked at No. 68.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Seek Inter-Korean Talks Without Preconditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will seek inter-Korean
dialogue without preconditions instead of vice-ministerial level
talks as in the past years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea proposed that the governments of Seoul and
Pyongyang meet first without any agenda as precondition, said
Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu Wednesday after the first
meeting of the National Security Council chaired by President Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
"The South and North can meet without any conditions attached
to discuss issues of bilateral cooperation toward the new
millennium," said Park, who was appointed as Unification Minister
last month.
</P>
<P>
He said South Korea will not seek the kind of vice-ministerial
level talks as in the past years as they were "fruitless."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also disclosed that the South Korean
government is ready to supply more assistance than last year's 40
million U.S. dollars worth of humanitarian aid to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
In his new year's message, President Kim Dae-jung proposed the
establishment of an inter-Korean economic community.
</P>
<P>
Kim's proposal is seen as a continuation of his "sunshine
policy" which pursues inter-Korean reconciliation, exchange and
cooperation based on separating business from politics.

<HEADLINE> Exhibitions: New Economic Spur In Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Activities such as fairs and
exhibitions are thriving in Shanghai as part of the efforts to
create a profitable and pollution-free sector as a new spur to
economic growth in this China's leading industrial and commercial
center.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the nation's reform and opening-up policy
introduced in 1979, showcase events are seeing unprecedented
development in Shanghai. The number of such activities held
locally has been growing annually by 20 percent since 1990, and
exceeded 150 in 1999, an average of two a week.
</P>
<P>
These events have become ever more popular in Shanghai as a way
of obtaining information, promoting market presence, and
increasing economic exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The city has hosted a number of international and commercial
exhibitions involving automobiles, electronics, computers,
telecommunications, household appliances, medicine, garments, and
foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai expects that these events can serve as a catalyst for
boosting the development of the overall local economy in the areas
of communications, telecommunications, tourism, hotels, catering,
and entertainment and advertising.

XIAMEN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors pledged to
invest 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in the coastal city of Xiamen in
east China's Fujian Province in 1999, according to the latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the investment came from the United States and
Britain. One local source said that the city approved 209 foreign-
funded projects last year.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of large-scale joint ventures and solely foreign-
funded enterprises in Xiamen have been on the increase, as
business people from 35 countries and regions have invested in the
city. Twenty-one of the world's top 500 companies have so far
invested a combined 1.45 billion U.S. dollars in the port city in
sectors including electronics, electrical appliances, machinery,
and fine chemicals.

<P>
TAIYUAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China will build a new airport
in the city of Datong in the northern province of Shanxi,
popularly known as the "coal capital."
</P>
<P>
Landlocked Datong is also famous for its many tourist
attractions including the world-famous Yungang Grottoes.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the airport, involving an estimated investment
of 290 million yuan (about 34.9 million U.S. dollars), is aimed at
promoting the city's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The airport will have a 2,400-meter-long and 45-meter-wide
runway able to accommodate Boeing-737s.
</P>
<P>
The State Council recently approved the project which will be
launched in June this year and completed by the end of 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
There are now five large exhibition centers available in
Shanghai offering a total of more than 100,000 sq m of floor space
for displays, barely meeting the demand of over a hundred fairs
and exhibitions held in the city annually. The number of employees
in the city involved in the exposition business is now over 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Some renowned overseas exhibition companies are keen to invest
in Shanghai, which is proving to be a hot spot due to its
favorable location, good foundation in education and science and
technology, and economic influence in China.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-German-funded exposition center is now being built in
the Pudong New Areas at a cost of nearly 100 million US dollar,
jointly invested in by three well-known German exhibition
companies based in Hanover, Dusseldorf, and Munich.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the center, designed by U.S. architects, will
eventually reach an impressive 200,000 square meters, greatly
expanding the exhibition area in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Germany say that this new exposition center marks
the first joint investment made by all three major German
exhibition companies in the international market.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shenzhen,
and Ningbo, are also resorting to exhibitions to attract
businesses and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Though the Internet is becoming ever more popular as a way of
doing business, many take the view that these fairs and similar
activities are able to get twice the results with half the effort
through face-to-face dealings, and this means growing business
opportunities.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi has strongly
denied allegations that the hijackers of an Indian
airline plane had entered Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the sources rumoring the
presence of the hijackers in Iran are only trying
to deceive the public, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local daily Tehran Times on
Wednesday quoted a foreign ministry official as
saying that the hijackers were involved in a
terrorist act and Iran would never allow them to
enter its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Indian news agency PTI had said that it was
told by informed sources that the hijackers had
fled into Iran via Heart, Afghanistan, in order to
distract the public opinion and reduce
international anxiety.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers fled the scene after they
released more than 150 passengers and crew members
aboard the abducted plane, which they seized on a
flight from Kathmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi and
held for eight days in southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The ordeal ended only after Indian government
released three jailed Kashmiri Islamic militants.

COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people, including
the suicide bomber, were killed and 20 others were injured
Wednesday morning when a huge bomb explosion ripped through Sri
Lanka's capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, six were killed on the spot, said the state
television broadcast, adding that five others succumbed to their
injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the explosion happened when the woman
suicide bomber tried to break into the Prime Minister's Office in
Colombo's Flower Road.
</P>
<P>
Four police personnel and one civilian as well as the bomber
were killed on the spot, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mrs. Bandaranaike, mother of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, was not in the office at the time of explosion,said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
suspicion fell on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who have been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the island country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed a similar suicide bombing last month
against President Kumaratunga on the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga who lost her right eye in the bombing has been on
the top of the LTTE's hit list due to her vow to pressure the
rebel group by military means back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Curb Illegal Flights to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police Tuesday mounted a
12-hour operation to crack down illegal flights to Somalia, local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of officers from the Special Crime Prevention Unit
sealed off Wilson Airport in the Kenyan capital Nairobi at 4:00
a.m. local time and prevented flights bound for Somalia from
taking off.
</P>
<P>
The police raided the hangars and inspected passengers'
documents to ascertain the authenticity of the cargo and
passengers flying out. Two planes concerned were detained.
</P>
<P>
The operation followed the tip that some aviation companies had
resumed flights to Somalia despite a government ban, police
officer Peter Kavila said.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi banned all
flights between Kenya and Somalia on security grounds.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, the government ban is still in
force," Kavila said.
</P>
<P>
The only flights allowed to take off were those transporting
personnel and relief supplies involved in humanitarian activities
such as those belonging to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
and the World Food Program, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Inspect Kenyan Fish Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of European Union
officials are set to visit Kenya to assess the quality of the
country's fish products, the East African Standard newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mission is expected to evaluate the progress made in
improving hygiene and quality standards of the products, Kenyan
officials in the fisheries sector said.
</P>
<P>
The EU slapped a ban on Kenya fish exports two years ago
following concern over the use of chemicals in fishing.
</P>
<P>
The newly released fisheries report said that the ban had
thrown Kenya's fisheries industry into a crisis with the fish
prices at beaches dropped by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kenya's annual export of fish products to
the EU reach 300 million shillings (about 4.3 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A EU team visited the country last August and expressed
dissatisfaction with the manner in which fish was being handled at
the beaches.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's fisheries industry has made great
efforts to improve the fish handling and quality testing
facilities to meet the export standards.

NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Four employees of Kenya
Airfreight Limited have been charged with stealing 9.2 kilograms
of gold worth 5.1 million shillings (about 70,000 U.S. dollars)
for export to Germany.

The four suspects, accused of jointly stealing the gold, denied
the charges and were released on a bond of 500,000 shillings
(about 7,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The case was set for further hearing on February 24 this year.

LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Border Traders
Association (CBTA) has intervened in the case involving 215
Zambian and Tanzanian traders who were on the verge of being
expelled from Zimbabwe for trading illegally, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the traders were operating illegally
at Carter House in Harare, Zimbabwe.

CBTA Chairman Greenwell Shimukonka, who travelled to Zimbabwe
to intervene in the case, confirmed the development in an
interview in Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the 215 traders escaped expulsion
by registering with CBTA.
</P>
<P>
The traders had earlier set up a market on their own without
representation from any recognized association, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Zimbabwean government threatened to expel more
than 200 traders from Zambia and Tanzania for operating illegally
in that country, giving them up to December 31, 1999 to register
with recognized traders' association, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate continues
to rise with the underlying month-on-month inflation reaching 7.6
percent in December from 7.3 percent in November, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted Chief
Economist Maurice Kanga of the Central Bank of Kenya as saying the
average annual inflation in the country remained unchanged at the
November level of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank is confident that with the
continuation of prudent macro-economic policies pursued by the
bank, the inflation should be contained within a single digit
range, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's weekly update, Kenya's interest rates
remained high during the week to December 30,1999, with the
average interbank borrowing rate standing at 14.26 percent
compared with 14.38 percent recorded in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said the average interest rate on the 91-day treasury
bill rose to 20.94 percent in the auction on January 3 from 20.47
percent in the previous auction, while the average base lending
rate for commercial banks reached 23.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate was 72.88 shillings per U.S. dollar
during the week to January 4 compared with 72.99 shillings traded
in the previous week, he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Launches Higher Speed Celeron Processor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chip, available Tuesday at a price of 167 dollars each in 1,
000-unit quantities, offers PC users additional performance at
little extra cost, Intel said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the fastest Celeron processor was the 500 megahertz
version. Intel said it plans to remain aggressive in the low-cost
segment of the PC market, where it has regained share from rival
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
"Last year our goal was to regain our position in the value PC
segment," said Pat Gelsinger, vice president of Intel's desktop
products group. "This year we have that position and we want to
clearly commit our intent to keep it."
</P>
<P>
Since the first Celeron was launched in 1998 the line has
become the second best-selling processor in the world, behind
Intel's leading Pentium family.
</P>
<P>
The Celeron 533 megahertz is the first of many new-value PC
desktop and mobile products to come from Intel in 2000, Gelsinger
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Intel plans to launch Celerons at frequencies of
566 and 600 megahertz sometime in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
With the new manufacturing process, Intel will "have a lot of
headroom" to upgrade products to higher frequencies, Gelsinger
said, adding that Intel just introduced an 800 megahertz version
of the Pentium III.

<HEADLINE> Compaq to Enhance Direct Sales System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's biggest personal computer maker, said Tuesday that it will
buy the ordering system and other assets of computer distributor
Inacom Corp. in a move to boost its sales directly to customers as
arch-rival Dell Computer Corp. now does.
</P>
<P>
"With this significant step, we are advancing Compaq's ability
to deliver the leading portfolio of Internet access and
infrastructure products, services, and solutions directly to
customers with a single point of accountability," said Michael
Capellas, president and chief executive officer of Compaq company.
</P>
<P>
"This purchase makes great strategic sense for Compaq because
it gives us the right capabilities quickly and cost-effectively,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said it will pay 370 million U.S. dollars in cash for
the assets that will help it configure computers for its customers
and manage the entire ordering process faster and more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Compaq is seeking to transform itself by taking and filling
customer computer orders directly in hopes of capturing
efficiencies realized by No.2 PC-maker Dell, which makes computers
only after they are ordered by customers.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the purchase of Inacom assets will forward its goal
of increasing to 40 percent the percentage of computers it sells
directly to customers, up from its current level of about 25
percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the asset acquisition, Compaq said it is acquiring the
ability to track the entire order process and to customize the
configuration of computers for customers.
</P>
<P>
Included in the deal are assets such as hardware and software
image certification to make sure computers are made according to
customer's specifications. It also includes the ability to tag
assets to enable clients to manage their inventory, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
"Compaq is advancing on a clear strategic path," said Capellas.
"We said we would re-engineer the channel delivery model and this
transaction, together with other initiatives already underway,
takes us a long way toward meeting that goal."
</P>
<P>
The agreement is binding on both parties and does not require
shareholder approval. It is expected to be completed in mid-
February, subject to regulatory approvals, Compaq said.

<HEADLINE> "Good-Neighborly Ties" Key to China's Military Diplomacy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's military diplomacy
continued its active momentum throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 33 senior-level delegations from the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) visited nearly 50 foreign countries,
while 89 groups of foreign army leaders were received in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army has also been active in international events,
attending some 15 multi-lateral and regional forums on security
cooperation, and accomplishing joint research on nearly 30 topics
including defense policy, army building, and regional security.
</P>
<P>
A review of China's military diplomacy for 1999 reveals that
exchanges with neighboring countries constituted a significant
element of overall military diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The past year witnessed many conflicts, new developments in
hegemonism and power politics, and increasingly complicated
conflicts in international relations.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1998 when the promotion of stable relations with
the world's major powers was a distinctive feature of China's
military diplomacy, 1999 saw an emphasis on the further
consolidation and development of army relations with neighboring
countries and an improvement of regional security.
</P>
<P>
Active military diplomacy contributed a lot to China's overall
diplomacy in 1999, analysts say.

The strong momentum of China's friendly exchanges with
neighboring countries began when both Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian and Chief of the PLA General Staff Fu Quanyou chose
bordering countries as destination for their first annual visits.
This trend continued throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
Among those visiting China were defense ministers from Cambodia,
Thailand, Laos, Australia, and the Republic of Korea (ROK), and
army chiefs from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Mongolia, and Nepal, not to
mention numerous other lower-level groups. The number of military
delegations from neighboring countries not only exceed that of the
previous years, but surpass those from other regions as well.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here point out that China's military diplomacy has
made positive contributions to eliminating the so-called "China
threat"theory, while establishing good-neighborly partnerships of
mutual trust with neighboring countries.

China's relations with Russia and northeastern Asian countries
aroused particular interest.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, China and its largest neighbor Russia
played important roles in the world's multi-polarization process,
and maintained frequent senior-level exchanges and military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of China's Central Military Commission Zhang
Wannian visited Russia in June, yet another important visit by a
Chinese army leader to Russia. Following that, several PLA
delegations visited Russia. It could well be said that the Sino-
Russian strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century has
realized substantial development through military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China's military ties with northeastern Asian countries also
scored a breakthrough as China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a high-level military meeting, and
the ROK defense minister visited China for the first time since
the establishment of bilateral ties seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China maintained vice-ministerial level
security consultations with Japan, another country vital to the
peace and stability of the region.

While China developed close military exchanges with neighboring
regions, it also further promoted ties with African and Latin
American countries, and opened up new fields for military exchange.
</P>
<P>
It should be mentioned that China's military diplomacy has
successfully gained the initiative by adjusting its policy in
accordance with the changing international situation.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, military diplomacy in 1999 found China fully
implementing the thinking of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and
a series of important remarks on national defense by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
By adhering to the peaceful foreign policy of independence,
China's military exchanges have played a supportive diplomatic
role while adamantly safeguarding the interests of the nation.

<HEADLINE> 64 Zimbabweans Drown in Past Three Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four Zimbabwean people were
drowned during the past three weeks, bringing the rainy season's
death toll so far to 105, the daily Herald reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season started from middle of November last year.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena Tuesday
described the high death toll as shocking. It was disappointing
that people continued to ignore safety precautions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on people to avoid attempting to swim across rivers
when they could use bridges or crossing points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on motorists to avoid driving through
flooded rivers, saying no matter how important the journey might
be, nothing was worth risking one's life for.
</P>
<P>
He urged parents and guardians, especially those living near
rivers, dams and wells, to look after their children.
</P>
<P>
"Life is precious. Venturing into flooded rivers can end up in
tragedy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sports Yearender: Chinese Men Cagers Regain Firing Powers in Continent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shan Lei
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men cagers regained
their firing powers by conquering the continent in an impressive
style when their national squad outwitted South Korea to triumph
in the 20th ABC Championship in Fukuoka, Japan, in September.
</P>
<P>
With seven straight wins, China savored the final victory and
took revenge of South Korea, who usurped the title after a semi-
final upset of China in 1997. China missed only two titles in the
past 12 outings in the biennial meet.
</P>
<P>
The surprising defeat years ago cost China a tour to the World
Championship in 1998, and this time China secured the only berth
allotted to Asia for the new millennium Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
It could not be better for the Asian giants to overwrite their
record of history in the world basketball arena as the current
Chinese men's national team is hailed as one of the most talented
and united squad to go for an Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, a 2.14-meter pivot, who was selected by the Dallas
Mavericks this summer, is tagged as the promising first Asian to
play in NBA and he is surely ready to make his statement in the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"All I'm concerned now is to go out for the Sydney Olympics,"
said the 22-year-old center after China shadowed South Korea 63-45
in the final of the ABC Championship on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Jiang Xingquan, who awarded China its best eighth
place in the 1994 World Championship, said, "This team is better
than the 1994 Worlds where I led the team to the eighth place."
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta Olympics, China also finished eighth in the men'
s basketball tournament, the highest placing for the Chinese team,
then coached by Gong Luming.
</P>
<P>
However, their women counterparts have yet to get rid of a
plummeting movement which has been trapping them for more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
The women's national team suffered a string of defeats to South
Korea and Japan and even the Chinese Taipei to finish fourth in
the Asian championship last May, the worst for the team in the
tournament as they once won the Olympic silvers in 1994 and
finished second in the World Championship in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And surely, it could not be any more optimistic as the Chinese
junior men's team finished a disappointing 15th place in the World
Junior Championship in July wherein only sixteen squads had
competed.

XI'AN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Work on expansion of the Xianyang
International Airport outside the major tourist destination of Xi'
an began recently after five years of preparation.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost nearly 1.3 billion yuan, and

total area of 52,000 square meters, a parking lot, and other new
facilities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils 10-year Plan to Beef up SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 5 Xinhua) -- Singapore has launched a ten-
year national plan to build up the capabilities of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME) and enhance their economic
contribution in the new knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo announced
the SME 21 plan at the opening of a one-day national SME
conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, worked out by the Singapore Productivity and
Standards Board (PSB) and its partners which include both the
public and private sectors and trade unions, aims to help the
development of successful SMEs and to facilitate a process of SME
adjustment to enable them to face the challenge of globalization
</P>
<P>
PSB statistics show that there are more than 100,000 SMEs in
Singapore and they play a dynamic role in the country's economy,
representing over 90 percent of the total establishments,
employing half of the workforce and but only generating 34 percent
of the total value-added.
</P>
<P>
With the SME 21, Singapore hopes to double the productivity of
the retail sector from 28,000 Singapore dollars (about 16,280 U.S.
dollars) per worker to 56,000 Singapore dollars (32,550 U.S.
dollars) in 10 years' time, treble the number of SMEs with annual
sales turnover of 10 million Singapore dollars (about 5.8 million
U.S. dollars) or more from 2,000 now to 6,000 in 2010 and
quadruple the number of SME transacting on e-commerce from about 8,
000 now to 32,000 before the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that multi-national companies (MNC) play an
important role in the city-state, SME 21 underlines the needs to
make Singapore MNC's command and control base for the entire
region and to establish more local entrepreneruship in all sectors,
not just in traditional areas like trading, real estate and
banking, but also in new areas like high-tech manufacturing,
creative services, Internet and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
As part of SME 21, PSB will encourage students in the
polytechnics and universities to be interested in business.
</P>
<P>
Describing the SME sector as his country's "nursery" to produce
world-class local entrepreneurs for the 21st century, George Yeo
in his opening speech encourages individuals to take the
challenges of globalization and engage in SMEs.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air Force Orders 18 Jets from United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Thai Air Force has
ordered 18 used F-16 A/B jets from the United States at a cost of
5 billion baht (135 million U.S. dollars), a source from the air
force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source confirmed a report by Wednesday's Bangkok Post that
the deal would be funded by selling F/A-18 spares worth 35 million
dollars to the U.S., a sum deposited with the Federal Reserve of
the United States under the Foreign Military Sales program and
part of the air force's fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
The air force is now waiting for the approval from the U.S.
Congress, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangkok Post, the United States favored the deal
since the Thai air force has two F-16 squadrons while some
neighboring countries have F/A-18s and MiG-29s.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s are designed to be equipped with advanced medium-
range air-to-air missiles.

<HEADLINE> 1990s Australia's Warmest Decade on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AAP quoted the Bureau of Meteorology of Australia as saying
the country's annual mean temperature last decade was 21.14
degrees Celsius, 0.33 degrees higher than the average between 1961
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
1998, the hottest year on record, scored an average temperature
of 22.54.
</P>
<P>
Bureau spokesman Dean Collins said that this made the 1990s the
warmest decade since at least the 1910s when records of national
averages were consistently maintained,
</P>
<P>
"There had been a gradual rise in temperatures in Australia
since 1910, which was consistent with global trends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists overseas have said the rise is too unusual to be
natural and the green house effect could have had an impact on it.
"
</P>
<P>
Bureau director John Zillman said a statement released by the
World Meteorological Organization on December 1999 showed the
1990s also had the highest global mean temperatures since
instrumental records began in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preliminary data showed Australia's mean temperature
for 1999 was 21.92, making it the 23rd warmest on record.
</P>
<P>
Australia's next warmest decade was the 1980s when temperatures
averaged 0.22 degrees above average, Zillman said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- There were 17 road fatalities
in New Zealand in the Christmas-New Year holiday period, which
ended at Wednesday morning, one of the lowest totals for the
period over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
There were 17 deaths in 1993, but that holiday period was two
days shorter than this year because of the day on which Christmas
fell,according to a media release from the Road Safety New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four people were killed on the roads during the 1998-99
Christmas-New Year period, and 26 the year before.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Neil Gyde, police national road safety manager,
said speed and alcohol remained the major contributing factors to
road crashes over the holiday period.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Taxi Drivers Demand for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 taxi drivers in
Toronto protested in front of the city's police office Tuesday,
demanding safety for the 12,000 cabbies in the country, said the
media reports here.
</P>
<P>
The protest was staged after a series of attacks were reported
on taxi cabbies in the past few weeks, including the killings of
two drivers in Toronto a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
A funeral was held Monday in Toronto for cabbie Mohammadullah
Saighani, whose son-in-law Javid Wali told hundreds of taxi
drivers attending the funeral that "we must stop people from
killing the innocent."
</P>
<P>
Another killing was reported at nearby Brampton, where a driver
was stabbed to death in robbery.
</P>
<P>
Assaults on a cab driver were also reported in Calgary,
Manitoba. In one case, Larry Corbett, who drives for Red Top cabs,
received a gash to his hand Monday night in the fifth assault in a
month.
</P>
<P>
"I got stabbed. I've gotta get stitches," he said as he sat
waiting inside the emergency room of a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police have aggravated assault charges against a Calgary man in
connection with a recent attack. Two other men have been arrested
for the killing of the cabbie in Brampton.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet IPOs Set Record in Market Capitalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- New public Web companies in
the United States rewrote the financial record books in 1999 by
creating 702 billion U.S. dollars in equity value, more than half
of the sector's total market capitalization at the end of the 20th
century, said a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from Paul Kagan Associates Inc., an independent U.S.
business research firm, said that the growth was "powered by
investors' insatiable appetite for Internet stocks and a
stampeding bull market," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kagan's study, the supernova of Web-related
initial public offering (IPO) activity in 1999 -- a total of 309
new issues -- generated 53 percent of the Web sector's combined
stock market value on the eve of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The study shows the average 1999 Web IPO gained 253 percent,
with the highest performer up almost 2,900 percent. At the same
time, 57 of the IPOs traded below their offering prices at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Since the Internet services company American Online went public
in 1992, Kagan tracked 409 Web-related IPOs worth a collective 222
billion dollars at their respective offering prices. At the end of
1999, the group had a combined stock market equity capitalization
of 1.32 trillion dollars, rocketing an average of 497 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another notable phenomenon in 1999 was skyrocketing valuations
of the "dotcoms" going public, which benefited not only from the
rapid run-up in stock prices for incumbent players but from the
record-setting 80 percent leap in the NASDAQ average. The average
1999 dotcom debut had a market capitalization at offer of 644
million dollars, more than doubling the average Internet IPO in
each of the prior four years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Lower Fares in Anticipation of Post-holiday Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. airlines on
Tuesday announced their plans to lower air fares for winter and
spring travel as the carriers looked to fill seats in anticipation
of a post-holiday lull.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines, the world's biggest airline, Tuesday reduced
its fares by up to 30 percent while Continental Airlines, No.5,
and US Airways, No.6, quickly made similar announcements.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of airline discounts was triggered by
Southwest Airlines, the No.4 carrier which last month announced a
coast-to-coast fare of 198 dollars. Trans World Airlines (TWA),
the 8th largest U.S. airline, followed up on Monday when it
announced a 50 percent reduction on the round trip cost on its
Boston-Los Angeles route. TWA also reduced the prices on other
domestic routes and on several of its international routes.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for American Airlines, the No. 2 world airline, Delta
Air Lines Inc., the No.3 U.S. carrier, and U.S. No.4 Northwest
Airlines all said they were matching fare cuts to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The airlines lowered fares for travels from roughly mid-January
to mid-May, requiring booking by January 14 and at least 14 days
ahead of the departure date.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines also added an incentive for customers to book
tickets on its Web site, offering up to 5 percent off and 1,000
bonus miles. First-time online customers will receive an
additional 3,000 bonus miles.
</P>
<P>
US Airways also offered 5 percent off its own domestic and
international sale prices for buyers using its Web site.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Identifies President's Attempted Assassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The female suicide bomber and
attempted assassin against Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has been identified as Leela Lakshmi from the eastern
town of Batticaloa, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old bomber alias Nandini joined the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) about 10 years ago, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) investigators
visited Lakshmi's home at Batticaloa over the weekend and brought
her mother and younger sister to Colombo for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Her younger sister identified Lakshmi when the bomber's head
which was found at the venue of the bombing was shown to her at
the police mortuary in Colombo, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The female bomber had blasted herself in an attempt to
assassinate Kumaratunga at the final presidential election rally
in central Colombo on December 18.
</P>
<P>
At least 24 people were killed and over 100 injured including
President Kumaratunga who has lost her right eye in the suicide
bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the assassination attempt on the LTTE
which has been fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The CID has been questioning police personnel who had been on
duty at the venue. Already 80 of them have been questioned with
about another 100 still to be investigated, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of experts from the United States is
reportedly due in Sri Lanka to help with the investigation into
the suicide bombing.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drug to be Tested in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia plans to test a new
AIDS drug on mothers to combat the transfer of HIV from mother to
child, the Cambodia Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A two-year research program starting next month, will be funded
by the French government and conducted by the French National
Agency for Research on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program, at a cost of around 350,000 U.S.
dollars, is to seek treatment suitable for Southeast Asian HIV
patients.
</P>
<P>
The program includes two studies, one is to use new drug,
Nevirapine, which is so far has only been run in trials in Uganda,
along with AZT, a well-established AIDS drug, on pregnant mothers
and their new-born babies to see if it can halt the spread of the
disease from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
The other study will focus on rare cases of immunity to the HIV
virus among Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian mothers have one of the highest incidences of AIDS/
HIV infections in the region, higher than Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, most mothers do not seek treatment until the final
weeks of their pregnancy, when it is too late for them to take the
anti-viral AZT treatment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Jobless Level Expected to Rise this year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's jobless level this
year will soar to 7.4 percent against last year's 4.09 percent,
Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A committee studying the unemployment situation made this
prediction based on an assumption of the three percent economic
growth this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee studying the joblessness problem is composed of
representatives of the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, the
Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board, the
National Statistical Office, the Bank of Thailand, the Thailand
Development Research Institute and the Office of the National
Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a total workforce of 33.85 million out of a
population of 62.4 million. The number of jobless workers will
rise to about 2.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the surge of unemployment would be mainly
attributed to slow economic recovery and insufficient public and
private investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Thai government allocated 119.3 billion bath (
about 3.14 billion U.S. dollars) to ease the unemployment problem.
The expenditure created 615,000 new jobs as of November last year,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation in 1999 Seen at 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has seen an inflation
rate of 0.3 percent for the whole year of 1999, lower than the
earlier forecast of 0.5 percent to one percent, the Bangkok Post
said Wednesday, citing the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Inflation this year, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
is expected to be between 2.2 percent and 2.5 percent, the
ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The monthly index in December 1999 rose 0.3 percent over a
month earlier, and 0.7 percent from the same month in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, food prices declined 0.9 percent while the non-food
sector rose one percent.
</P>
<P>
Rising costs for utilities and transport would push up the non-
food index this year, while food was expected to be less affected,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation had helped to ease economic problems, keeping
production costs in check and increasing the competitiveness of
export, the Commerce Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, it also reflected the fact that manufacturing plants
were still running at limited capacity due to sluggish demand and
high unemployment, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A government committee forecast that 2.5 million people, or 7.
44 percent, may be jobless in 2000 if measures are not improved to
tackle the problem.

MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The average annual inflation rate
in the Philippines for 1999 slowed down to 6.6 percent from 9.8
percent for 1998, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation rate in December also went down to 4.
3 percent from 10.4 percent a year ago, the National Statistics
Office said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The last time that inflation was also lower than 4.3 percent
was that of 4 percent registered in June 1987, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the year-on-year inflation rate in
December of 1999 increased by 0.4 percentage point from 3.9
percent in November of the same year.
</P>
<P>
The rates for services increased to 12.7 percent in December
from 12.3 percent in November; food, beverages and tobacco, 0.6
percent from 0.1 percent; clothing, 4.9 percent from 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
For food alone, the inflation rate went up to 0.2 in December
from-0.1 percent in November due to higher rates in the prices of
rice and miscellaneous foods.
</P>
<P>
For housing and repairs and fuel, light and water, inflation
remained at their corresponding November rates of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the country's month-on-month inflation

<HEADLINE> Internet Giant to Buy Controlling Interest of Mavericks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- BoradCast.com cofounder Mark
Cuban reached a preliminary agreement to buy a controlling
interest in the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
Association for a reported 280 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the team, the Hillwood Development
Corporation in the United States, will retain a minority share of
the Mavericks following completion of the proposed transaction.
</P>
<P>
A definitive acquisition agreement has not yet been reached and
any sale is subject to the approval of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal also includes the sale of a portion of
Hillwood's interest in the American Airlines Center, which is
expected to open in the fall of 2001. Hillwood will continue to
lead the development and construction of the facility.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Tuesday's Dallas Morning News, the
sale of the Mavericks "will not affect" the development around the
arena, consisting of office buildings, retailing, residential
units and an entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
Perot's broad-based ownership group purchased 55 percent of the
Mavericks in May 1, 1996 for 125 million U.S. dollars. During his
term as owner, the team has traded superstar Jason Kidd and hired
Don Nelson as general manager.
</P>
<P>
The Mavs have not had a winning season since 1989-90, going 218-
529 since.They are 12th in the Western Conference this season at 9-
21.
</P>
<P>
Despite being one of the league's worst teams, the newspaper
said the team's value has gone from 125 million U.S. dollars to
280 million U.S. dollars in four years. The New Jersey Nets were
sold for an NBA-record 227 million U.S. dollars in 1998.

nine months of last year," he said, elaborating that during that
period, the state received 622,264 visitors from Brunei, followed
by 189,975 from Indonesia and 26,975 from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1998 Sarawak also recorded the highest number
of visitors from the BIMP-EAGA which accounted for 80.1 percent of
the 1.38 million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Given that the tourism industry is one of the key growth
sectors, the official said Sarawak is now expected to play a
bigger role to ensure that tourism products and services are of
sufficient standards to meet the expectations of visitors to the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is working closely with its partners in
the BIMP-EAGA, especially to coordinate efforts to sell tourism
products.
</P>
<P>
The ministry through the Sarawak Tourism Board works very
closely with Sabah (East Malaysia) and Brunei and has come up with
a special package to sell Borneo, the world's third largest island,
as a single destination for Culture, Adventure and Nature, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a project being jointly implemented by the Sabah state
and Indonesian governments at Singalaki in East Kalimantan to
promote diving activities served as a test case for regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway for similar ventures in other BIMP-EAGA sub-
regions like Irian Jaya and Sulawesi in Indonesia and Mindanao and
Palawan in the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the working group on tourism development was scheduled
to meet in Brunei this April for the Strategic Tourism Planning
Workshop to discuss various matters on tourism in the BIMP-EAGA
area.
</P>
<P>
With rich tourism resources in the region, the official
expressed his optimism of the region's great tourism prospects,
Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia to Sue NATO for Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
brought on Tuesday another accusation to the International Court
of Justice in the Hague against the U.S.-led NATO for its crime of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry asked the court to declare that
the air strikes against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO last
spring violate the norms of international law, and the NATO member
countries must bear the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
It said that after the end of the bombing, the countries
continue to support the ethnic Albanians to kill other ethnic
citizens in Kosovo. Their actions violate the 1244 resolution of
the U.N. Security Council and the international convention banning
racial cleansing.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade asks the court to order NATO to compensate all the
resulting damages that Yugoslavia suffered, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had brought a charge with the International Court
against NATO on April 29, 1999 for its air strikes against it,
appealing to stop and investigate NATO's crime of invasion.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Mynamar Marriages Increase in Border City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, there are now 500 Sino-
Myanmar couples in Ruili which is famous for its Naxi Dongba
Culture and pictographic characters.
</P>
<P>
The increase in cross-border marriage is attributed to the
country's opening-up policies and the frequent business contacts
between the two neighboring countries, local social analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, many Myanmar people have been
coming to Ruili for shopping, sightseeing, and doing business for
the past 10 years, providing good opportunities for young people
from both sides to nurture love.
</P>
<P>
Shuai Enhuang, a farmer from a village in Ruili, said he was
extremely happy to see his youngest son marry a pretty Myanmar
girl, as did his three elder brothers.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Shuai used to live a very poor life, but became
well-off after contracting a farm and planting winter fruits and
vegetables. He then replaced his shabby bamboo hut with a well-
furnished home, attracting four Myanmar girls to marry his four
sons.

Deputy Prime Minister Trairong Suwankhiri was quoted as saying
at the National Y2K Command Center on Tuesday that the center had
not received a single report of a serious Y2K situation.
</P>
<P>
The state and private sector organizations started the first

</P>
<P>
"Most phone calls received mainly inquired about problems that
could possible result from the millennium bug or problems
irrelevant to Y2K such as power blackouts, tap water shortage and
disconnected phone lines," said Trairong, the vice chairman of the
government's Y2K solution committee.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the center received 1,693 phone calls between
December 31 and January 4.
</P>
<P>
Some callers misunderstood that their problems were Y2K-related
as some bank clients had found they could not withdraw money from
ATMs just because their ATM cards had expired.
</P>
<P>
The National Y2K Command Center will continue to receive
reports from the public, the deputy prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Venture Capital Funding in U.S. Record High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The money pouring into U.S.
venture capital funds in 1999 surged 87 percent to 36 billion U.S.
dollars, rocketing past the previous year's record of 19 billion
dollars, said a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These figures represent the amount of money that venture
capitalists themselves have raised in order to finance start-up
companies, said the report from Asset Alternatives, a U.S. leading
information services provider for the private equity industry.
</P>
<P>
"Wealthy families and institutional investors, such as pension
funds and university endowments, are stepping up their investments
in venture capital because of the high returns such investments
have generated in recent years," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the report added, Internet-related investments
have been extremely lucrative, often generating annual returns for
their investors in excess of 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalists in California, home of Silicon Valley, led
the states in the amount of money they raised for new investments
with 18.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new capital pouring into these funds means that
entrepreneurs and young companies will continue to be well-funded
in the new year, the report said. The record setting year in
venture capital also helped nudge the entire private equity
industry into a record-setting year. A record 96 billion dollars
in funding was raised in 1999, besting 1998's record by 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, venture capital is the main source of
equity invested in rapidly growing companies with high growth
potential. The capital invested in start-ups originates from
private and public pension funds, endowment funds, foundations,
corporations, wealthy individuals, foreign investors and the
venture capitalists themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to VentureOne, a leading provider of information and
analysis for the U.S. venture capital industry, a total of 21
billion dollars of venture capital were invested in the first
three quarters of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Campaign Launched in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden, the forerunner in the
world in helping smokers quit the unhealthy habit, has launched a
fresh anti-smoking campaign nationwide since the start of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Cancer Foundation, the Health Institute and the Non-
Smoking Network Committee are the driving forces of the campaign,
which was designed to create a friendly environment to assist
those smokers intending to get rid of their long-time habit.
</P>
<P>
The organizers quoted an official survey made at the end of
last year as revealing that 400,000 smokers in the country are
planning to stop smoking in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more smokers quitted smoking in
Sweden, where about 8,000 people die of smoking-related diseases
every year.
</P>
<P>
The number of inhalers dived below 20 percent of the country's
adult population in 1998, two years ahead of the World Health
Organization's goal that in 2000 smokers should be 20 percent
below the adult population of each country.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the first country to reach the WHO goal.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis is to defend his
first undisputed heavyweight title against Michael Grant in
Madison Square Garden in April, according to a spokesman for Lewis
's U.S. promoter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They're talking as we speak and hopefully they can wrap the
deal up as soon as possible," said Main Events spokesman Donald
Tremblay. "Both sides are eager for the fight to be made."
</P>
<P>
Tremblay said Main Events and Lewis's British-based promoter
Panix Promotions are negotiating with HBO's pay-per-view arm TVKO
for the April 29 fight.
</P>
<P>
One source close to the talks said the American would receive 3-
4 million U.S. dollars and Lewis would get 10 million U.S.
dollars for his first fight since becoming undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
The Briton took his current title by beating Evander Holyfield
on a unanimous decision last November.
</P>
<P>
Lewis (35-1-1) would return to Madison Square Garden after his
controversial draw there with Holyfield on March 13, a bout
clearly dominated by the only British fighter to hold the
undisputed heavyweight title in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
At 1.98 meters (6.6 feet) Lewis will be shorter than the 2.01
meters (6.7 feet) Grant, who is 31-0.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Vice President Sees Economic Growth Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Gloria
Arroyo has predicted a positive economic outlook for the country
with growth rates zooming to unprecedented levels, the nation's
leading newspaper Manila Bulletin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Tuesdy, she said, "We will
grow. It will be a positive growth rate but how much is still the
debate between government officials ad the business sector."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the country's economic managers are
seeing a four percent growth rate within the year.
</P>
<P>
"That's the goal we must all strive for and so it's very
important that we undertake the appropriate policies that will let
us have that and one of the most important is to be able to bridge
the gap of the budget deficit," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She added that when this is done, any further increase in
interest rates will be clipped.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said one of the accomplishments of the previous year was
the lowering of interest rates and underscored the need to keep
these down.
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep them down in order to be able to reach four
percent. But you cannot keep it down artificially. You have to
bring it down by market forces and a big budget deficit
contradicts that market force," she added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Three asset management companies
(AMCs), Huarong, Cinda and Orient, have recently signed a
framework agreement on debt-to-equity with Capital Iron and Steel
Company (CISC), one of China's largest steel and iron producer.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, worth 3.55 billion yuan (428 million U.S.
dollars), is aimed at reducing CISC's debts, accelerating its
technical renovation, and increasing the competitiveness of its
products.
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the development of the steel giant has been
troubled by heavy debts, employee redundancy, and bloated size.
The multinational company also manages mining, mechanics,
electronics, construction, and navigation industries and engages
in international trade.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement, signed in Beijing on December 30,
1999, will help CISC minimize financial risk, according to
economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
The three AMCs will soon evaluate CISC's assets and accounting,
and consult on the restructuring of the company's assets,
management system, and equity transfer. Following that, they will
deliver a report to relevant higher authorities before the
agreement is implemented.

But there are few enterprises taking advantage of these

Experts have appealed to relevant departments to fully tap
these resources, as high-grade, pollution-free mineral water is

<P>
URUMQI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A company based in northwest China
's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been able to manufacture
600-kilowatt wind-power generating units which incorporate the
country's highest technology level.
</P>
<P>
China's wind power has developed vigorously in recent years,
and by the end of 1998 the installed capacity of wind power had
risen to 230,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, most of China's wind-power generating units
were imported, a factor hindering the expansion of wind power,
since foreign equipment and after-sales maintenance were costly.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Wind Energy Company started researching the
production of large wind-power generating units in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a group of scientists entrusted by the Ministry of
Science and Technology evaluated the generating units designed by
the company and expressed satisfaction with the equipment's
performance.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the units are equal to imported ones and
should be widely introduced throughout China.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Hospitalized with High Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer
great Diego Maradona was hospitalized Tuesday following
complications from high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat in
Punta Del Este, a South American beach resort in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Correa, director of the Cantegril Hospital, said
Maradona was placed in intensive care Tuesday afternoon, but he
was showing of signs of improvement that should not require a
prolonged hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
"He is progressing favorably and if no complications arise, we
anticipate only a brief stay," Correa said at a packed hospital
news conference. Nonetheless, doctors declined to give specifics
of what had triggered Maradona's emergency care.
</P>
<P>
Maradona has had a history of drug problems, but Correa refused
to answer a barrage of questions from local reporters as to
whether other factors might have prompted his hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, the soccer star's manager, Guillermo Coppola,
emphatically said drugs had played no part in the hospitalization.
"Drugs had nothing to do with this," said Coppola, quoted by
Diarios y Noticias, an Argentine news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said Maradona drove himself to the clinic.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former star, who single-handedly carried
Argentina to the World Cup championship in Mexico in 1996, was
vacationing in Punta del Este, a popular summer vacation haunt for
South American stars, models, and actors.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Torres, who treated Maradona, declined to give
specifics of what had caused the hypertension and other problems.
But none of the doctors revealed the specifics of Maradona's
treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Port of Qingdao in east
China's Shandong Province handled more than 1.5 million TEUs (
twenty-feet equivalent unit) of containers in 1999, making it the
largest container transfer port on China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The port's container handling capacity has been increasing at
an annual rate of about 30 percent in the past few years, with the
capacity standing at only 80,000 TEUs a decade ago, port
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The increase is attributed to the upgrading of berths and the
use of advanced loading and unloading facilities. Now the port's
deep-water berth can accommodate 5,250-TEU container vessels.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Port of Qingdao has more than 30 international
navigation routes, and all of the world's top ten container
shipping companies are doing business with the port.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Has Lowest Drownings in 1999: NZPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of drownings in
New Zealand last year was the lowest since records began in 1980,
New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 116 people drowned, 80 percent of them male, NZPA
quoted Water Safety New Zealand as saying.
</P>
<P>
The previous low was 130 in 1992, and the highest toll 214 in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Water Safety NZ Executive Director Alan Muir was quoted as
saying the deduction could be attributed to water safety education
and community promotions during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
"This result is excellent, but there is definitely room for
improvement when we consider that New Zealand still has one of the
highest drowning tolls in the Western world," he said.

LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Total online retail sales in
1999 in the United States are expected to reach 66 billion U.S.
dollars, according to a research report released Wednesday, and
the buying of consumable products will lead the way into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The report from ActivMedia, a U.S. company conducting Web
marketer studies, found that 40 percent of the U.S. buyers who
purchase consumable products online account for 56 percent of
online purchasing power and account for 3.8 billion dollars in
online revenue.
</P>
<P>
Health and beauty products are leading the way among consumable
products, according to the report. The grocery market has been
inhibited by real-world delivery systems and has only begun to see
its potential, the report found.
</P>
<P>
Two in five online buyers shop for consumables on the Web. They
represent a select group of mature online shoppers who purchase
much more than books, music or gifts online. In the past year, the
report said, they purchased health and beauty (cosmetics, vitamins
and toiletries), healthcare and pharmaceuticals, groceries and
household supplies, gourmet items and pet supplies online.
</P>
<P>
In terms of dollars spent, consumables buyers spend 56 percent
of online purchase dollars. This group is more likely than average
to shop for a variety of personal and business items from several
sectors, including clothing, home and garden, sporting goods,
jewelry, office supplies, and manufacturing supplies.

CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said an Iraqi apology to Kuwait for its 1990 invasion
of the country might help clear up the atmosphere between the two
countries and lead to a major inter-Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the Kuwaiti prisoners of war (pows) and finding those

Fallouts incurred from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on ties between
the two neighbors still serve as a major stumbling block on the way
of restoring Arab solidarity, said Meguid on Tuesday while
addressing a meeting of the Cairo-based Union of Arab Journalists.
</P>
<P>
Courageous initiatives and Iraqi concessions are needed for a
comprehensive solution to the Iraqi problem. And such a solution
may
help restore mutual confidence between the two countries which cut
off their ties since 1990, said the Arab League chief.
</P>
<P>
He also called for convening an Arab summit which ''is a
legitimate and vital demand to deal with the challenges facing
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League is hopeful that Arab leaders would agree on
holding a summit, either an expanded or limited one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining that he prefers an expanded summit, Meguid
admitted that there are difficulties to be overcome on the way of
holding such a summit.
</P>
<P>
''Perhaps there are foreign forces opposing convocation of the
Arab summit. But we have to be keen on holding it because it is a
demand of all Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he criticized the Arab fast-track movement toward
making peace with Israel without inter-Arab consultation or
coordination.
</P>
<P>
''The Arab League is supportive of comprehensive peace, but it
is against adopting a fast-track attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mauritania's establishing of full diplomatic
ties with Israel contravened the decisions made at the 1996 Arab
summit.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Mauritania, a Arab League member, needs financial
and economic support does not justify such a move, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's federal labor office
based in Nuremberg Wednesday said the fall of the unemployment
rate indicated that the country's economy was recovering.
</P>
<P>
In the monthly labor market survey, the office said that the
German jobless figure last December was just over 4 million, 68,
000 lower than in November and 200,000 lower than in the same
month a year before.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the office showed that the jobless figure had
dropped by 40,000 in western Germany and 28,000 in eastern states.
The jobless rate was 10 percent, 0.8 percent lower than
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the office, depicted it as "a
mild start to the German winter." Normally, the German jobless
rate reaches its peak in mid-winter since many seasonal jobs are
lost.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment showed no sweeping improvement during 1999, but
at the end of the year the development was positively downward,"
said Jagoda on releasing the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army said on
Wednesday it remained committed to seeking a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the IRA will continue to play a positive
role in a genuine effort to realize a just and lasting peace," the
IRA said in a statement to be published in An Phoblacht, the
newspaper of its political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But the guerrilla group warned that the British government
should play its part in demilitarizing the province. It said any
failure by the British government to rapidly implement a programme
of demilitarization "can only have a negative impact on the
potential for political progress".
</P>
<P>
The group condemned the Ulster Unionist Party's threat that it
might pull out of the newly-formed Northern Ireland executive if
the guerrillas failed to hand over arms by February.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA said it still planned to hold further meetings with
the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, the
body headed by retired Canadian army general John de Chastelain,
appointed to oversee the handover of guerrilla weapons.

<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
Wednesday that "The battalion was blocked Tuesday by combatants
loyal to Revolutionary United Front Party leader Foday Sankoh at a
bridge approximately 18 kilometers from Makeni."
</P>
<P>
Jetley had returned to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, on
Wednesday night, Eckhard said, announcing that "the problems over
the deployment of the battalion had been resolved. The Kenya
Battalion is on its way to Makeni."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Wednesday indicated a
willingness to consider rapidly increasing the size and strength
of UNMSIL in order to help make up for the pending departure of
the Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council in October last year authorized the
deployment of 6,000 U.N. peacekeepers to monitor the cease-fire
and disarm former rebel fighters while ECOMOG remained in charge
of security in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
But in late December last year, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan told the 15-nation Security Council that Nigeria decided to
withdraw its troops because it couldn't accept having two forces
under separate commands in the same country.
</P>
<P>
The other ECOMOG contributors, Ghana and Guinea, were also
preparing to pull their soldiers out of Sierra Leone, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria said it wanted to withdraw its troops by February, but
indicated it wouldn't pull out entirely without replacement forces
on their way.

Clinton revealed the plan at a meeting with House and Senate
Democratic leaders about budget priorities for the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will include a new program of federal grants for
school construction, plus a revival of Clinton's effort in recent
years to use tax breaks to help communities upgrade existing
schools.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget Clinton
will send to Congress on February 7.

<P>
In the past two years, the Republican-controlled Congress has
been cool to Clinton's education spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly proposed using federal money for school
construction in recent years, only to see the idea repeatedly
ignored or shot down by Congress. Many Republicans have objected
that the plan would impose federal strictures on education
decisions that should be made by state and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Advancement of Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Wednesday urged Israel and the Palestinians to move forward
more quickly in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is a process of coming together but it should move
faster," Yeltsin said after arrival in Jeursalem to attend the
celebrations of the first Orthodox Christmas of the new millennium,
which will begin Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin shocked the world last Friday by announcing his
resignation from the presidency he held since 1991. He appointed
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit in the Holy Land, which was planned
before his resignation, Yeltsin will attend Orthodox Christmas
celebrations in Jerusalem and in the Palestinian self-rule city of
Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
He will meet President Ezer Weizman and acting Prime Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
This is his first visit abroad since his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office has ruled out the
possibility that Barak might return from the United States, where
he is holding talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara,
briefly to meet Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Israel Transfers 3 Military Bases to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to the transfer, the DIF had evacuated two army camps in
Eirit and Jita' which are on the road between Jenin and Java, and
the Fahmeh camp on the road between Jenin and Naplus.
</P>
<P>
More land was due to be transferred to the PNA on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Fahmeh base used to be controlled by the Jordanian army
before the 1967 Middle East war. During the Palestinian "Intifada"
(uprising) which erupted in 1987 against Israeli rule, the site
turned to be a military barrack and training center for the Israeli
commandoes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed by Israel and the
Palestinians last September, the PNA can not use the sites for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is expected to receive three other bases as part of the
second phase redeployment whose implementation started Wednesday
morning and will be completed Thursday evening under a compromise
agreement reached between the two sides on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Syrians, Israelis Get Down to Business over Outstanding Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Israel
are finally starting their committee discussions over key issues
after settling their dispute over which should be dealt with first
in their second round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries, as well as those from the United
States would form four committees, dealing with such major issues
as the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
sharing of water resources, the security arrangement for Israel
and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the committees
would meet over the next couple of days to tackle those
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"They have a work plan and an organizational structure," he
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations began on Monday with a shaky
start with the cancellation of a scheduled three-way meeting among
Syria, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syrian negotiators insisted that discussions on the Israeli
withdrawal from the Strategic Golan Heights should come first
while Israelis preferred to security. The procedural dispute was,
however, smoothed over on Tuesday and President Bill Clinton
returned to the small historic town of Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders talked for about an hour and, according to
reliable sources, made some arrangement for the setting up of
several committees to handle all the outstanding issues that have
led to wars between Syria and Israel over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian source, the committees will meet
simultaneously, thus overcoming the procedural hurdle.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Syrian delegation said the committees on
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights started work on Tuesday
evening. Committees handling security arrangements and
normalization met early on Wednesday and the team dealing with
water issues convened two hours later. He said the convening of
the working groups was a sign of progress in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Jim Fallin said Clinton would
make a decision on Thursday what steps he might take next in the
attempt to mediate between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright sent messages to Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
expressing hope for revival of peace talks between Lebanon and
Israel following the resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> ECB Projects Strong Euro in Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
Wednesday expected a strong euro in year 2000, saying Europe's
single currency would show its capacity in coming prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After the first session of the ECB's executive council in the
new millennium, Wim Duisenberg, president of the ECB, said, "The
euro has a great potential as we have always said."
</P>
<P>
And this potential will take effect in the new year when the 11
eurozone nations catch up pace with the booming U.S. economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The executive council left its three key interest rates
unchanged at the meeting as the market has speculated before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB's main refinancing rate is 2.0 percent, with its
marginal lending facility rate at 4.0 percent and the deposit
facility rate at 2.0 percent. These rates had not been changed
since last November.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said the executive council had deliberately kept the
low interest rates to accelerate the growth of eurozone economy,
and the strong recovery of Asian and emerging market economies
will also help Europe, said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
The ECB president warned that the eurozone countries would face
further pressure of inflation due to higher oil prices and an end
of the food prices' drop.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices will be subject to further pressure, said
Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the immediate upward movement does not
translate into general inflationary pressure and does not trigger
second round effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg told reporters the ECB would stick to its policy
aimed to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The stability-oriented behavior is urgently required, and we
remain confident and vigilant," he said.

The decision was announced by Doris Meissner, commissioner of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The boy, Elian
Gonzalez, should leave Miami and return to Cuba by January 14.
</P>
<P>
"Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both
American immigration law and U.S. practice," Meissner said. "This
little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.
"
</P>
<P>
"The father made it very clear that he wants Elian returned to
him as soon as possible," Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the INS was ready to work with Elian's family in
Miami and others to secure his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian was found clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother and nine others died when their boat sank during their
effort to leave Cuba for Florida during last Thanks-Giving
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Elian in Florida demanded him stay in the U.S.
while the boy's father asked him to be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuban President Fidel Castro joined Elian's father in demanding
the boy's return and sponsored massive demonstrations on the boy's
behalf.

Experts from Syria, Israel and the United States formed four

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her military aide,
Army Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, attended the security committee, and

Under a Memorandum of Understanding it signed in Accra on

<HEADLINE> Turkish Tourism to Pick up in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- In the year 2000, Turkey's tourism
sector is expected to pick up from a 1999 recession, the Turkish
Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's hotels have received a record number of applications

The Turkish government has drawn up an ambitious long-term plan
to
revitalize the country's tourism sector, which has suffered a major

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel, Palestine to Speed up Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday called on Israel and the Palestinians to implement
agreements already signed to achieve a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah made the appeal when meeting with an Israeli
delegation headed by Chairman of the Arab Democratic Party in
Israel Abdul Wahab Darawsheh and Israeli Knesset (parliament)
member Talab Sane, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Jordan's support for all peace efforts in the
region when discussions touched upon the latest developments in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel began on Wednesday the long-delayed second stage pullout
from the West Bank, which was part of the September interim peace
deal and was originally scheduled for November 15. Thus, another 5
percent of the West Bank territories will be transferred to the
Palestinian control, with 3 percent to civil Palestinian
administration and 2 percent to full Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah stressed the importance of achieving a rapid
progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track by implementing the
already signed agreements within the agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
The king also expressed satisfaction regarding the progress made
on the Syrian-Israeli track as a complementary and supportive
factor to the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has maintained that the Palestinian issue is the corner
stone to the peace process in the region, and King Abdullah has
used all possible occasions to voice his support for the rights of
the Palestinians, including the establishment of an independent
state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Darawsheh thanked Abdullah for his efforts to
support peace, stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Darawsheh and Sane are among some 300 Arab Israelis, including
Knesset members, political party leaders and journalists, who
arrived in Jordan en route to perform Haj (pilgrimage) to Mecca.

<HEADLINE> Libraries in China, France Designated U.N. Depository Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Five Libraries, located
in China and France, have been designated United Nations
depository libraries, the U.N. Department of Public Information
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They are the Law Department of Peking University (Beijing,
China), the Law School of Wuhan university(Wuhan, China), the
International Law Department of the East China University of
Politics and Law (Shanghai, China), the law Department of
Zhongshan(Guangzhou, China), and the Nantes University Library(
Nantes, France).
</P>
<P>
They become part of an international network of 378 libraries
in 142 countries and territories that bring the U.N. documents and
publications to users around the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, the Dag Hammarskjold Library at United Nations
Headquarters in New York, which is part of the Department of
Public Information, has arranged for the distribution of United
Nations documents and publications to users around the world
through its depository library system.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 378 United Nations depository libraries:
55 are located in Africa, 104 in Asia and the Pacific, 32 in
Eastern Europe, 84 in Western Europe, 49 in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and 54 in North America.
</P>
<P>
These libraries receive United Nations materials, with the
understanding that their collections will be maintained in good
working order and be available to the public free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The designation of depositories is carried out by the United
Nations Publication Board. The degree of development of the
requesting libraries and the overall geographic distribution of
depository libraries in the countries concerned are among the
criteria used.

<TEXT>
<P>
The office said that of the 82 contracts, 55 had been approved
so far, and the total volume of oil approved was 184.7 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraq exported 18.6 million barrels of oil with an
estimated value of 419 million U.S. dollars, bringing the revenue
for Phase VII of the oil-for-food program to 742 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. Secretariat Wednesday
had received Iraq's full text of Distribution Plan VII including
the annexes.
</P>
<P>
The Distribution Plan was being studied carefully and must be
approved by the U.N. secretary-general before Iraq could begin
purchasing humanitarian supplies with Phase VII funds, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
which is aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by
the stringent U.N. sanctions. The sanctions have been in place
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council will meet later this month to discuss the deteriorating
situation in the war- torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
a U.N. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Guy Pickett, head of the U.N. mission in DRC, told journalists
in the DRC capital Kinshasa that the world body was working hard
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and every country
involved in the Congolese conflict to bring peace to the third
largest African country, according to the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We are also building up confidence to let the Congo people
resolve their crisis themselves," he said. "Peace has to be found
in one way or the other."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia have soldiers fighting alongside DRC
 President Laurent Kabila's army to crush the rebels supported by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Accord aiming to end the more than a year-old
war was signed by all parties to the conflict in last July and
August. However, violation of the cease-fire agreement by both
sides have been taking place since then.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila pledged in his new year message to the
Congolese that he would drive all the rebels out of the DRC.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Urge Tanzania to Press Kabila for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The head of a major rebel
group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has called for
Tanzania to increase its pressure on the Kinshasa government for
the latter to honor the Lusaka peace accord and speed up the
democratization in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government sources quoted Wamba Dia Wamba, head of
the divided Congolese Rally for Democracy, as saying Tuesday in
Dar es Salaam that Tanzania has a key role to play in solving the
16-month civil war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Wamba called on the Tanzanian government to take the Congolese
crisis more seriously than in the past because a troubled and
unstable Congo will go on pumping refugees into the neighboring
Tanzania and thus affecting its economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, from January
to November last year, some 79,000 Congolese refugees fled into
Tanzanian western region of Kigoma to escape the civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese war has threatened development and security in
central Africa, continuing the chaos that started when Laurent
Kabila unseated former President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, when
the country was still known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has persisted in Congo despite a five-month peace
accord signed by Congolese government and its allies Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia and by three rebel factions and their backers,
Uganda and Rwanda.

TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs an investment of some
8,000 billion rials (about 2.67 billion U.S. dollars) to boost its
power sector in the coming Iranian calendar year to start on March

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry on
Wednesday turned down a three-day cease-fire proposed by Chechen
leader Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's proposal is nothing but an attempt to gain more
time for regrouping, said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov issued a statement early Wednesday calling on Moscow
to announce a truce from June 8 to 11.
</P>
<P>
The statement, circulated in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, was
sent to OSCE (the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe) chairman Knut Vollebaek by Chechen envoy to Georgia Khizri
Aldamov.
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi-based Chechen representatives told reporters that "the
demand to announce a moratorium was caused by facts concerning the
use of chemical weapons in Grozny by Russian troops."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov invited Russian and foreign experts to get informed "
on material evidence of the Russian side using chemical weapons in
Chechnya's capital."
</P>
<P>
However, Russia quickly refused Maskhadov's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that radicals themselves prepared vessels with
chemicals" to stop the federal offensive against Grozny, the
Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military has repeatedly denied guerrillas'
allegations on the use of chemical weapons by Russians in Grozny,
accusing Chechen rebels of setting off several containers full of
ammonia and chorine to stop the federal units.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, the head of the Georgian Foreign Ministry
public relations department, Avtandil Napetvaridze, said that "
Tbilisi has not recognized and will not recognize Chechnya as an
independent state." Thus, Aldamov who poses as Chechen envoy to
Georgia does not have "any diplomatic status," said Napetvaridze.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Presidential Candidates Supports China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) Major Democrat and Republican
presidential contenders in the United States have expressed
support for China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and for giving the country permanent Normal Trade Relations(NTR),
according to a regular survey of the candidates on campaign issues
by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, one of the two leading presidential
candidates in the Democratic Party, said that the agreement
reached with China on its accession to WTO includes measures that
would strengthen U.S. ability to assure fair trade and to defend
its agricultural and manufacturing base from import surges, unfair
pricing and abusive investment practices.
</P>
<P>
Gore also voiced his backing for granting China permanent NTR
through accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to grant China permanent normal trade relations will
put American farmers and factories at a vast disadvantage with
respect to Europe and Japan and hurt our ability to enforce China'
s commitments in the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Bradley, another Democrat hopeful, echoed Gore's call for
enhanced trade status with China.
</P>
<P>
"It is in America's interest to grant China normal trade status
on a permanent rather than annual basis because it would make
China a more reliable trading partner and provide greater access
to the Chinese market for American companies. This will create new
and better jobs for America's workers and farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said he
supports permanent NTR for China as part of China's admission to
the WTO, since it will provide American businesses and farmers
access to China's growing market and narrow U.S. trade deficit
with China.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to work hard to ensure that American exporters get
the full benefit of China's market-opening commitments.
</P>
<P>
John McCain, another Republican heavy-weight candidate,
stressed that maintaining economic and diplomatic relations with
China serves the U.S. national interests, and shutting China off
from the world economy would have the negative effect of turning
China inward.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of its participation in the WTO, China will have
to abide by the organization's standards governing international
trade, and there will be enforcement mechanisms available to
ensure that China does so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate Orrin Hatch said he backs up NTR for China
and China's admission to the WTO under appropriate terms. "America
's farmers and manufacturers would greatly benefit from increased
trade relations with China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reform Party leader Pat Buchanan and Republican
candidates Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes said they are
opposed to giving China Permanent NTR, linking the trade status
with such issues as human rights and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press conducts a regular campaign survey by
asking the major presidential candidates one question each time,
three days a week, on issues concerned by the nation, and the
current question is related to whether China should be granted
permanent normal trade status with the United States.

<HEADLINE> 6 S. African Schools Accused of Barring Black Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Civic Organization Wednesday accused the schools in Meyerton,
south of Johannesburg, of barring black children, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the organization Stanley Tyelentombi said that
only one of the seven schools in Meyerton agreed to admit black
children. However, the school had increased education fees.
</P>
<P>
"The schools are infringing on the children's right to get
education, and they have to give the black children first
preference during admission selection," Tyelentombi stressed.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the black pupils were mostly laborers, farmers
and domestic workers who could not afford to send their children
to schools outside the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meyerton was an exclusively white area in the apartheid era,
but black people have moved to the area in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department of Gauteng Province said it was aware
of the problem in Meyerton.
</P>
<P>
The department expressed its hope that the problem could be
solved as soon as possible and all the children in the Meyerton
could be ensured to be admitted to schools near their homes.

<HEADLINE> S. African Association Warns Against Shark Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Lifesavers Association of
South Africa Wednesday issued a warning to bathers on the north
coast of KwaZulu- Natal Province, asking them to be cautious of
shark attacks.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the association Mike Raubenheimer said that the
increasing shark activity on the province's north coast has
resulted from muddy flood water and the carcasses of drowned
livestock washed into the sea at river mouths.
</P>
<P>
Lifesavers have seen a number of tiger sharks feeding on a dead
whale at the mouth of the Tongaat River.
</P>
<P>
Although no attacks on bathers had been recorded, the spokesman
noted that it is his association's responsibility of appealing to
people to stay strictly within shark nets.
</P>
<P>
Bathers should also avoid swimming when lifesavers are not on
duty, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's New Parliament to Open in Mid January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican deputies are to take
their seats in the newly-elected Assembly of the Republic, the
country's parliament, on January 14, the National Elections
Commission announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the announcement after the Supreme Court
validated the results of the December 3-5 general elections
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambican National Resistance
(Renamo), has rejected the court's ruling by renewing his demand
for a recount of the election results.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that if his demand was not heeded "there will be
problems in this country," the Mozambique New Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since there are veiled threats that deputies of the Renamo
might boycott the opening of the new parliament, it might only be
graced by the presence of deputies of the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo).
</P>
<P>
Frelimo has already announced that if Renamo boycotts the
parliament it will go ahead and take its seats, since it can form
a quorum on its own. The quorum is 126 (50 percent of the
members plus one).
</P>
<P>
The parliament has 250 seats, which are shared by Frelimo with
133 seats and Renamo with 117.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the electoral commission has still to set a date for
the swearing-in of incumbent President Joaquim Chissano, for a
further five- year term of office. This should take place within
eight days of the parliamentary investiture.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Surprised at Parliamentary Vote Date Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition parties
Wednesday reacted with surprise at announcement of different dates
for parliamentary elections, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of different poll dates indicated confusion
because there was no collective action within the Cabinet and
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF),
representatives of the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe announced Tuesday that the elections
would still be held in March. Justice, Legal and Parliamentary
Affairs Minister Emmerson Munangagwa had announced that the polls
had been deferred to June to pave way for the constitutional
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Movement for Democratic Change Morgan
Tsvangirai said: "It is almost impossible to have voter education,
campaigns and update the voter's roll before March."
</P>
<P>
He noted that such issues as the voter's roll, the referendum
on the new constitution, the establishment of an independent
electoral commission and voter education are supposed to be looked
into.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition leader said that "we are geared for the
 elections even if they are held in March."
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Union of Democrats Margaret Dongo
also said the ZANU-PF leadership wanted to test if the opposition
parties would welcome the change of dates and back tracked after
the opposition expressed satisfaction.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An emergency team used tear gas
Wednesday morning to force an end to a prison revolt in the
Atlantic Canada province of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the Atlantic Institution in Renous was brought
under control around 6 a.m. after "a fair amount of tear gas" was
put to use, according to an announcement by Corrections Canada.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of inmates set up blockades after lunch Tuesday with a
refrigerator, chesterfield, chairs and a washer and dryer in
protest against, perhaps, a lack of over-the-counter painkillers
during the holiday, indicated Correction staff.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements were brought in from other federal prisons in
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia after Correctional staff failed to
force a lift of the blockade, during which they heard inmates also
smashing furniture.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise 1.2 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that the November increase in factory orders
followed no gain in October and a 1 percent decline in September.
Orders had risen by 1.3 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that factory orders for November rose by 4.5
billion dollars, pushing the total for the month to a seasonally
adjusted 365.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the strength came from a 3 billion dollars gain in
orders being placed with manufacturers of electronic equipment,
reflecting strong demand for components, including semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
The 8.4 percent advance for electronic manufacturing companies
was the fifth increase in the last six months and the biggest
since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Orders for fabricated metals such as steels picked up 2.6
percent to 20.6 billion dollars. This sector is struggling to
recover from a flood of cheap imported steel that forced the
layoff of thousands of U.S. steelworkers and led the industry to
successfully petition for penalty tariffs to stem the tide of
foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
Orders for cars, planes and other transportation equipment
actually fell by 3.5 percent in November to 45.1 billion dollars,
reflecting in large part a drop in demand for aircraft and parts.
</P>
<P>
Not counting the volatile transportation category, orders would
have been up by 1.9 percent in November, the biggest advance since
a 2.6 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
In November, orders for durable goods rose by 0.9 percent. This
represented a downward revision from an advance report two weeks
ago that estimated durable-goods orders had risen 1.2 percent in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods were also up 1.6 percent in
November, following a 1.1 percent October increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the rebound in manufacturing was the latest
evidence that the U.S. economy was still growing at a robust rate
as the year ended.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is moving to her new house in New York to make
herself eligible to run for the U.S. Senate in New York State.
</P>
<P>
The moving-in process began Tuesday when two moving vans,
filled with boxes, rolled up rugs, kitchen chairs and other items,
pulled up at a 1.7 million dollars home the Clintons have
purchased in Chappaqua in Westchester County of the state.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and the first lady are set to begin unpacking
Wednesday and spend their first night in their first home the
Clintons have to call their own since they moved into the Arkansas
governor's mansion in 1983.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that
Clinton decided late last night to join Mrs. Clinton after
determining he wouldn't be needed today at the Mideast peace talks
in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Two old friends were on hand to direct things when the moving
vans arrived Tuesday, said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for the
first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Hillary is very excited about this," Finney said. Mrs. Clinton
hopes to be "fully moved in" by the end of next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hillary said she plans to cut back on first lady duties and
spend most of her time in New York this year.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to compete with New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani from the Republican Party for the Senate seat being
vacated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who resigned six months earlier than law-scheduled term
last Friday, flew with his wife Naina Yeltsin to Israel by the
presidential plane late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He will attend in Jerusalem the celebrations of the 2000th
Christmas, which the Orthodox Church marks on January 7.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will meet Israeli President Ezer Weizmann in Jerusalem
and Palestinian Authority leader Yassir Arafat in the holy city of
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov while traveling aboard the Rossia Il-96 presidential plane.
</P>
<P>
Before Yeltsin's departure from Moscow, acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin met him at the airport door.
</P>
<P>
In saying hello to Putin and shaking hands with him, the ex-
president told other senior figures who were present: "Take note
of this: I'm saying hello to the president."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian security chief Sergei
Ivanov, border guard chief Konstantin Totsky, foreign
intelligence director Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Kremlin staff chief
Alexander Voloshin came to see Yeltsin off.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin answered a few questions by reporters. Asked how he
saw his current status, he said: "I see myself as the first
president of Russia."
</P>
<P>
The ex-president told reporters that he had done a lot of work
over the New Year's holiday. "I was mainly sorting out all the
papers that had accumulated by that time and needed my signature.
There were also important meetings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus ambassador handed Yeltsin a letter from Belarussian
President Alexander Lukashenko. Yeltsin asked the diplomat to give
his regards to Lukashenko and said: "I respect him."
</P>
<P>
Kremlin deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhodko said Lukashenko'
s letter had been a follow-up to a telephone call between the
Belarussian president and the retired Russian leader. In the
letter, Lukashenko thanks Yeltsin for his cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Warn of Spring Geomagnetic Storms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists are warning
of geomagnetic storms to come as early as in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "another Y2K problem", the storms could cause mass power
blackouts, disruptions in communications and satellite failures in
Canada and other northern countries, Canadian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Montreal-based the Gazette newspaper Wednesday quoted David
Boetler of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) as saying spring
and fall is when the Earth's magnetic field is most in line to be
affected by the sun-eruption-induced storm.
</P>
<P>
The frequency and intensity of these storms correspond with the
sun's 11 year cycle of activity, causing charged particles from
the sun to collide with the Earth's magnetic field. The collision
results in fluctuations in the planet's electrical currents.
</P>
<P>
Quebec is Canada's most susceptible province to a blackout in
the face of geomagnetic storms because of the long transmission
lines from the hydro-electric power station at James Bay in
southeastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
The last great geomagnetic storm caused the collapse of the
Hydro-quebec power system in the winter of 1989, leaving about 6
million people without power for up to 18 hours, said Boetler.
</P>
<P>
"The whole province was out with on traffic lights, no power in
homes or industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
GSC has been working with Hydro-Quebec to develop new systems
to deflect an upcoming possible hit. New filters have been placed
in relays to block the flow of storm currents into the system, the
GSC research scientist added.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-Quebec has invested 1.3 billion Canadian dollars (about
893 million U.S. dollars) since 1989, according to the North
America power giant.
</P>
<P>
Other regions likely to be affected include northern Russia,
Scandinavia and Alaska, Boetler said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma has refuted a media report that rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) had attacked the Kasese town in
western Uganda Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that Kasese town was struck by ADF yesterday
morning as alleged in some sections of the press," the minister
said in a press release issued here on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision, a leading daily in Uganda, reported Wednesday
that the ADF rebels attacked the Kasese district government
headquarters and dropped letters at the offices of the District
Chairman Yokasi Bihande.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted both police and military sources as
confirming the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Information available confirms that a long-standing business
wrangle between business rivals resulted into one of the rivals
burning a kiosk at Lukoki in Kasese town," the state minister
said. "There were no gunshots as alleged."
</P>
<P>
He described the situation in the town as calm and appealed to
the press to desist from irresponsible and alarmist reporting
which causes unnecessary anxiety among the population.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels have attacked soft targets more than half a dozen
times over the past few weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Lagos State government
has accused Multi-Links Nigeria Limited of disrupting the
government's operations and causing losses amounting to billions
of naira (one U.S. dollar equals some 100 naira) as a result of
Y2K break-out.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Lagos-based private telecom firm Tuesday,
Lagos State Attorney-General Fola Arthur-Worrey, said that the
collapse of the company' s computers last week had caused "serious
disruptions in the official business of the Lagos State
government."
</P>
<P>
The disruption "caused financial losses in emergency services
like hospitals, ambulance and fire, security services, waste
disposal, traffic control and monitoring," the Guardian newspaper
Wednesday quoted the law officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arthur-Worrey said that the Consumption Protection Unit of the
Justice Ministry had been inundated with complaints about the
failure of Multi- Links' systems.
</P>
<P>
Multi-Links, one of the pioneer private telecommunications
companies, had its lines disconnected from NITEL's network last
week allegedly for non- compliance with Y2K standards.
</P>
<P>
The disconnection followed Federal Government's order to
disconnect operators who failed to be Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
This move, according to NITEL, "was to protect the integrity of
the national network and avoid disruption of services."
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 subscribers of the company suffered disruption of
their services as a result of the disconnection.
</P>
<P>
But the firm said it had since Monday been reconnected to
NITEL, following its compliance to the standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuito Oil Field, the first deep
water oil field (over 1,500 meters below the sea level) in Angola,
has been put into production, an official source said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Angola's monopolist oil company Sonangol, the
Kuito Oil Field is located in Block 14, some 60 kilometers off the
coast of the Cabinda Province, with the U.S. Cabinda Gulf Oil
Company Limited as its operator.
</P>
<P>
At present, the daily oil production of the Kuito Oil Field is
announced at 50,000 barrels of high-quality and low-sulphur
petroleum, said Sonangol.
</P>
<P>
The official source predicted that in the following several
years, Kuito Oil Field will have an average daily output of 75,000
barrels, with its highest daily production estimated at 100,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
The start of production is two years later than the discovery
of the Kuito Oil Field in May, 1997, in the Block 14 with an
approximate area of 4, 000 square kilometers, said an official of
the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company Limited.
</P>
<P>
With the daily oil output of 750,000 barrels, Angola is the
second largest oil-producing country in the African continent.
The Angolan government divided the offshore waters into several
exploring blocks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil companies have to bid against each other for the
authority of exploration in certain block.

KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The central banks of Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will link their ATM (Automatic
Teller Machines) systems on Thursday, Kuwait's Central Bank
Governor Sheikh Salem Abdulaziz Al-Sabah said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ATM card holders in the two countries will be able to use their
own cards to withdraw money on the ATMs in either Kuwait or the UAE
after Kuwait's K-Net system and the UAE's UAESwitch system are

He said the step was taken within the framework of the efforts
to link the ATM systems in all the six Gulf Cooperation Council

and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's K-Net was linked to Qatar's NAPS Network in 1997 and to
Bahrain's Benefit Network last October.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Syrian-Israeli Committees Start Working on Outstanding Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Israel
are finally starting their committee discussions over key issues
after settling their dispute over which should be dealt with first
in their second round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both countries, as well as those from the United
States would form four committees, dealing with such major issues
as the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
sharing of water resources, the security arrangement for Israel
and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the committees
would meet over the next couple of days to tackle those
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"They have a work plan and an organizational structure," he
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli negotiations began on Monday with a shaky
start with the cancellation of a scheduled three-way meeting among
Syria, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syrian negotiators insisted that discussions on the Israeli
withdrawal from the Strategic Golan Heights should come first
while Israelis preferred to security. The procedural dispute was,
however, smoothed over on Tuesday and President Bill Clinton
returned to the small historic town of Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders talked for about an hour and, according to
reliable sources, made some arrangement for the setting up of
several committees to handle all the outstanding issues that have
led to wars between Syria and Israel over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian source, the committees will meet
simultaneously, thus overcoming the procedural hurdle.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rice Export Up in 3 Successive Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's annual rice export has
been on the rise for three years in succession.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's official news agency VNA, Vietnam
exported 3.7 million tons of rice in 1997, 3.8 million tons in
1998 and 4.55 million tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is a remarkable improvement over the years between 1989 to
1996 when the country exported only a combined 14.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons behind this achievement, including a
rapid and stable growth of food output (5.3 percent a year), a
favorable foreign exchange rate and the efforts made by the
country's rice export businesses themselves, VNA quoted Vietnam's
Trade Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to export some 4.3 million tons of rice this year,
of which Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta provinces are to
contribute 2.9 million tons. Corporations and companies under the
central government's management and foreign-invested businesses
will export a combined 1.2 million tons and businesses in other
economic sectors will export 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has developed projects to zone off 1 million hectares
in the Mekong Delta and 300,000 hectares in the Red River delta to
produce high-quality rice for export.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Secretary Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu on Wednesday submitted his irrevocable
resignation to President Joseph Estrada with immediate effect,
Filipino ABS-CBN news channel said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was quoted by the ABS-CBN as saying in his resignation
letter to the president that his decision was made after a careful
and lengthy discussion with his family.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu added that he would be able to help the government
better in his private capacity.
</P>
<P>
This is the first resignation made by members of the Estrada
cabinet in the new year. It came days ahead of a proposed cabinet
revamp, which is reportedly set to be carried out in less than 10
days' time.
</P>
<P>
ABS-CBN said President Estrada has accepted the resignation
from Espiritu, who served the government for one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said President Estrada had confirmed that he
will dismiss Espiritu from the cabinet in the upcoming cabinet
revamp.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada himself said in a radio interview Wednesday
that he was having a hard time in finding replacements for the
posts that would be vacated as a result.
</P>
<P>
A decision may be made "within 10 days" on who will be replaced
and who will replace them, Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Leader Rejects Supreme Court's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the
Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), has rejected the Supreme
Court's ruling that validates the results of the general elections
held from December 3 to 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Supreme Court read out a lengthy ruling
that rejected Renamo's 23-point appeal against the poll results.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama renewed his demand for a recount of the election
results and threatened that if his demand was not heeded "there
will be problems in this country," the Mozambique New Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear what Renamo will do, in particular,
whether its elected deputies will take their seats for the first
sitting of the new parliament due to be held within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) has made
it clear that the opening session will go ahead with or without
Renamo. The parliamentary quorum is 126 (50 percent plus one) and
Frelimo alone holds 133 seats.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader claimed that the court was just a
creature of the Frelimo.
</P>
<P>
"We think there's no distance between Frelimo and the Supreme
Court, and so we're not accepting (the ruling) and we propose a
recount," Dhlakama was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The National Elections Committee on December 22 announced that
Frelimo won 48.54 percent of the votes while incumbent President
Joaquim Chissano beat his sole rival Dhlakama by winning 52.29
percent of the votes in the second multi-party elections since
1994.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Gold Output Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's 99 gold mining
entities extracted 10,902.3 kilograms of gold in 1999 and set a
new gold production record.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with previous years, the gold output was
increased by 33.9 percent or 2,763.6 kilograms, the Mongolian news
agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's gold output is growing every year. The rise in
gold production is attributed to an improved mining plan of the
government and the introduction of advanced foreign technology and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The increase in gold extraction affected Mongolia's foreign
reserves positively. By the end of 1999, the country's foreign
reserves reached 116.9 million U.S. dollars, 46 percent higher
than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Canada Records Second Strongest Year of Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada saw its second strongest
year of auto sales in 1999, with an 8 percent increase over the
previous year to just over 1.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper said Wednesday that only 1988 was
a stronger year for vehicle sales, when Canadians bought a record
1.52 million light vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Of the big three auto makers, sales for General Motors of
Canada Ltd. grew 11.3 percent last year, while sales were up 4
percent at Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Only DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. reported a decline of 1.6
percent to 264,817 cars compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among other auto makers, BMW Canada Inc. reported its ninth
consecutive year of record breaking sales, selling 9,011 units, a
17 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto manufacturer Subaru Canada Inc. claimed a gain of
111.6 percent in its market share, bringing its total to 13,018
cars sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most industry observers believe the year 2000 will be stronger
for vehicle sales in Canada, forecasting vehicle sales as high as
1.54 million,according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The average Canadian vehicle was estimated at about 8.5 years
old last year, in contrast with an average age of seven years in
1990.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Canadians in a position to catch up with the
expected "huge incentives offered by manufacturers" for a stronger
year of sales up to 1.54 million in 2000, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Knew of Yeltsin's Plan to Resign: Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President
Vladimir Putin said he knew of Boris Yeltsin's plan to resign and
hand Russia's presidency to him 10 days before Yeltsin made his
shocking New Year's eve public announcement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian ORT television station late
Tuesday, Putin said Yeltsin told him the resignation plan during a
regular meeting on December 22, soon after the recent
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
During the December 19 parliament polls, right-central parties,
including the Kremlin-backed Unity movement, scored a surprise
triumph. The vote results proved to be a strong endorsement for
Putin.
</P>
<P>
"I came to him about 10 days before the New Year to deliver a
report on economic problems and the situation in the North
Caucasus. Soon after I started speaking, I realized that Boris
Nikolayevich was thinking about something else," Putin said in an
interview on the eve of a session of Russia's Federation Council,
the upper house of parliament, to set a date for the early
election.
</P>
<P>
"He interrupted me and said 'I have been thinking for a long
time about the situation in the country and have made the decision
to resign'," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the parliamentary election, Yeltsin told him: "I
made this decision because something I consider very important has
happened: People trust you."
</P>
<P>
Putin said Yeltsin's decision entirely surprised him and he
would have been willing to go on working as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin's move was clearly motivated by the desire to
boost Putin's chances of being elected president.
</P>
<P>
"He wanted the presidential campaign to develop according to
his wishes, he was helping me," Putin said, "To put it flatly, he
gave me a head start in the current presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
The acting president also urged Russians to honor Yeltsin,
making no reference to corruption allegations surrounding Yeltsin
and his family or his decision to give Yeltsin immunity from
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a very kind and humane attitude to the first
president of Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Yeltsin's emotions while leaving the Kremlin,
Putin said Yeltsin gave a few parting words.
</P>
<P>
"He looked around sadly, and said it was sad to leave because
so much was connected with these walls, these premises and the
people who worked here," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
It was "sad" for Russia's first president to leave the Kremlin,
Putin stressed, but Yeltsin was "courageous" and made his own
decision.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing extraordinary about the words Yeltsin said
before departing the Kremlin, "Putin said, "They were said with
some pathos, but at the same time in a very kind and human way.
Addressing me in the end, he said very simple words: Take care of
Russia."
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult experience for him and for all of us,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, named prime minister by Yeltsin last August, met
leaders of the parties to be represented in the new State Duma
Wednesday, the lower chamber of parliament, following December's
elections.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leaders are likely to be his rivals in the
presidential elections, such as Communist Party chief Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the vote must be held within
three months after the previous president resigns.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Council on Wednesday scheduled the poll
for March 26.
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Russian
Central Electoral Commission, the country's presidential election
campaign will kick off Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russian media says initiative groups are being formed to
campaign for Putin, led by activists of the pro-government Unity (
Yedinstvo) party, which finished an impressive second in the
December 19 elections, close behind the Communists.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympian Jiang Comes Back at FINA World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympian Jiang Chengji
made a great comeback as he won the 50 meters freestyle, beating
German Alexander Luederits and Italian De Felice Piergiorgio,
Wednesday, the last day of the FINA World Cup short-course
swimming Shanghai leg.
</P>
<P>
Jiang led all the way from the start to clinch the title with a
time of 22.36 seconds. Luederits was second in 22.42 and
Piergiorgio came to third in 22.45.
</P>
<P>
"It's my first competition since I returned to the pool for
only two months. I am happy that I regain my confidence though the
results today is not my personal-best," said Jiang, who rested for
one year for a hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, the first Chinese men's swimmer who entered the Olympic
finals since 1984 and finished fourth in the men's 50m freestyle
and 100m butterfly at Atlanta in 1996, plans to compete in more
international events to rebuild his form.
</P>
<P>
"I will be in Australia, Britain and Germany for the World Cup
series," Jiang said.  Bela Szbdos of Hungary, who
snapped American veteran Chad Carvin's dream of completing all
three titles he competed here, won his second gold medal here in
the men's 200m freestyle in one minute 46.63 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian also won the 100m freestyle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

freestyle in 15:07.42 after taking the 400m freestyle last night.
</P>
<P>
China added 15 more golds Wednesday to 13 it won Tuesday,
gathering a total of 28 out of 34 goal medals in the two-day meet.

<P>
However, placing the elderly in retirement homes has its fair
share of critics. Many consider such a move eroding the time-
honored tradition of respecting the elder generation.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest population of old people in the world.
120 million are aged over 60 and 9 million are over 80. This
figure is expected to increase to 130 million this year. By the
middle of this century the figure is expected to be 400 million.
</P>
<P>
China's elderly poses all kinds of problems in the new
millennium, but the large number in Tianjin has created employment
for some 1,000 people who work with retirement homes. Those aged
over sixty account for ten percent of the total population in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Vice premier Li Lanqing has called on government officials to
pay particular attention to the elderly. Liu Yazhi, vice-minister
of Labor and Social Security, said that improving the life of
China's elderly is a top priority for the government this year. A
multi-level pension system will be set up and more retirement
homes and special colleges for the elderly will be built.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists say that these changes will allow China's elderly
to gradually choose a new way of life.
</P>
<P>
Lou Mingcheng, a 75-year-old retiree, said that he had been
reluctant to go to the Tianjin Retirement Home fearing that people
would think that his children no longer wanted him. But he soon
changed his mind after visiting the Home. "Here I can chat with
the people of my age and make new friends."
</P>
<P>
As retirement homes become increasingly conspicuous, the
Tianjin government is making every effort to ensure that the
elderly will be well taken care of.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Elderly Chinese have
traditionally lived with their sons and grandsons under the same
roof. However, this is now changing. Many are moving into
retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight years old Liu Chunsheng is one such person who
decided to move out of his big family where he had lived with his
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
"It was the whole family's decision," he told Xinhua in his
bedroom at the Tianjin Retirement Home.
</P>
<P>
"Nurses here handle all household chores which my children had
no time to do. I now feel a sense of tranquillity," said the old
man.
</P>
<P>
In his new home, Liu practices morning exercises everyday,
listens to news, tends to his flowers and reads. Sometimes he
takes part in social activities organized by the retirement home.
</P>
<P>
He meets his sons, daughters and grandsons only at weekends. "
It took me a while at first to get use to this new arrangement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, the number of retirement homes has
increased in Tianjin in recent years. The city now has over 100
such homes which can accommodate around 4,000 people, supported by
private enterprises, or public hospitals. There are now over 1,000
retirement homes across China.
</P>
<P>
"We're very busy with work and don't have much spare time to
look after my mother," said Wen Qiming, a government official. "We
decided to put her in a retirement home. We visit her either after
work or on holidays."

<HEADLINE> Israel Starts Second Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Force (IDF)
began to move their offices and other military equipments out of
six bases in the West Bank Wednesday afternoon, launching the long-
delayed second Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the West Bank said the evacuation from the six army
bases in Bethlehem, Nablus and Jenin could be completed within
hours and the status of the camps will be changed from total
Israeli control to Palestinian civil rule.
</P>
<P>
In all, 5 percent of the West Bank territory will be transferred
to the Palestinian control in the second stage, with 3 percent to
civil Palestinian administration and 2 percent to full Palestinian
rule.
</P>
<P>
All the targeted areas would be marked by Friday after joint
patrols view them on Thursday, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops redeployment, seven weeks overdue, came one
day after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached a compromise
agreement over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The compromise agreement envisages that the second stage will be
carried out as originally planned by Israel while Israel will be
open to Palestinian requests in sketching the maps for the third
withdrawal on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under a September interim peace deal, Israel should quit 18.1
percent more of the West Bank land in three stages ending January
20, with the second phase scheduled for November 15.
</P>
<P>
But differences between the two sides over which lands to be
transferred hindered the handover. The Palestinians demanded for
more densely-populated areas and territories connected to the lands
already under Palestinian rule. They had also insisted that the map
of targeted lands not be decided unilaterally by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are working to negotiate a
framework agreement by mid-February and a permanent peace deal by
September. But little progress has been made so far on the
thorniest issues of the negotiations such as the fate of Jerusalem,
the future of Jewish settlements, borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
This week's handover coincides with a second round of peace
talks in the U.S. between Israel and Syria, which resumed on
December 15 after a 45-month break.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to seal peace
deals with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians by the end of the
year, which prompted speculations that the three Arab parties will
compete for Israel's attention
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials denied that their agreement with Israel on
the land transfer grew out of fear that Syria would overtake them
and first reach peace with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Proposes to Ban Finished Goods Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may impose ban on
importation of finished goods for which local industries have
capacity, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A substantial cutback on raw materials import duties may also
be in the offing; while a safety valve is to be put in place
against goods dumping through proper monitoring of the customs and
inspection agents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Goods likely to be affected by an importation ban include
textiles, edible oil, cement, refrigerators, certain brands of
vehicles, air conditioners, soap and detergents, personal as well
as other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The new policy drive, an apparent reversal of the policy of
import liberalization hitherto pursued, is coming on the heels of
a clamor for Nigeria to review its embrace of World Trade
Organization (WTO) treaties.
</P>
<P>
The treaties stress dismantling of trade barriers among nations
in the spirit of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Presidency sources confirmed that the government could no
longer ignore the unfair competition between imported and the
locally made goods.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, President Olusegun Obasanjo was said to have
expresf 28.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president, according to sources, is convinced that only
protective measures for local producers can boost the sector's
employment profile in line with the official poverty alleviation
drive.
</P>
<P>
To effect the proposed import ban policy, Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar, himself a former Customs officer, is expected to be
directly involved in monitoring of the department's activities.
</P>
<P>
Besides, import inspection agents are to come under closer
scrutiny, to ensure that banned goods do not find their way into
the local market.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Cable TV Market Surges in Recent Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania has become one of the
largest cable TV markets in Europe, with more than 40 percent of
all households connected to the network at the end of 1999, the
local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since cable TV first entered the Romanian
market, the number of cable TV companies and subscribers has
soared, with the most significant increase occurring after 1996
when hundreds of thousands were registered per year.
</P>
<P>
Cable TV accounts for 70 percent of the TV market, and the
country has become the 6th largest consumer in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian cable TV companies, at the start of their
operation, focused only on broadcasting TV programs received
through satellite links.
</P>
<P>
The boom on the Internet started in Romania three years ago and
prompted cable TV operators to offer optional connections to the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian cable TV operators, having a high-performance
infrastructure based on such advanced equipment as fibre-optic
cables, looks set to soon become an important competitor to the
Romtelecom national telephone company, which will also result in
better telephone services.
</P>
<P>
The cable TV companies' turnover has grown constantly. Experts
estimating that a firm with 10,000 subscribers has practically a
monthly turnover of 30,000 U.S. dollars and its net profit is 7,
500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Big firms, such as the Astral TV group or the RCS, have
hundreds of thousands of subscribers and turnover millions of
dollars monthly.

<HEADLINE> Medical Exam to Determine if Pinochet Fit for Extradition </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet is receiving a medical examination in a London hospital
to determine his fitness for extradition to Spain to stand trial
for alleged crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The examination is being conducted at the Northwick Park
Hospital in Harrow, north London, at the request of the Chilean
authorities, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, is said to have suffered a number of small
strokes since he was placed under house arrest in London more than

heart disease, diabetes and depression.
</P>
<P>
The medical tests are expected to take all day and no immediate
result is expected.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokeswoman said the team of doctors would be led
by two specialists, one in diseases of old age and the other in
neurology, adding that every member of the team is an expert in
his field.
</P>
<P>
The official said the doctors' report would not be published
and would be seen only by Home Secretary Jack Straw, government
legal advisers and Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Straw has the last word on Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 while recovering from a
minor back operation in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused him of being responsible for the deaths
and disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule in
Chile, which ended in 1991, and wants him extradited to Spain to
answer the charges.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goals for Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Agriculture
Chen Yaobang said today that restructuring the country's
agriculture and rural economy while helping raise the incomes of
farmers will be a priority this year.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate reform by developing rural enterprises
and strengthening agricultural infrastructure. At a National Work
Conference on Agriculture which opened in Beijing today, Chen said
that China will also accelerate the innovation and popularization
of agricultural technology and improve its poverty relief work.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has set a target of 490 million tons of grain, 3.2
million tons of cotton, 60 million tons of meat, and over 40
million tons of aquatic products for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen has also set a target of over 14 percent growth in rural
enterprises, a 4 percent net increase of farmers' incomes and
bringing more than 10 million people out of poverty in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's agriculture and rural economy maintained a
steady growth despite a slump in the farm produce market at home
and abroad as well as severe floods and droughts that hit most
parts of the country.

<P>
Chen particularly stressed restructuring the agriculture sector
and the rural economy which are important in keeping up with the
global economy and liberalization of trade. Rural businesses and
towns need to develop further and more jobs are needed for a
growing number of surplus farmers.
</P>
<P>
The production of farm products should meet the demand of the
market, said Chen, adding that traditional farming methods which
focus only on quantity should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
"Cereal production in eonomically-developed regions can be
reduced according to market demand, but cultivated land should be
protected."
</P>
<P>
Chen called for reduction in the acreage of cotton and sugar
crops as the price of these crops dropped dramatically last year.
Chen said that poor quality indica rice (polished long-grained
nonglutinous rice) varieties in the south, winter wheat grown
south of the Yangtze River and spring wheat in northeastern areas
should be eliminated, while more quality grains and grains for
special purposes should be grown.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should also be taken to promote the
industrialization of animal husbandry, the improvement of farm
machinery and aquatic breeding, said Chen, adding that the "zero
growth" plan for marine fishing will continue to be implemented
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Conference will end on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Deputy PM Visits China on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz left here on Wednesday for Beijing on a several-day visit to
China, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said Aziz, who will also visit Malaysia after his China
trip, will hold talks with officials of the two countries over ways
of enhancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Malaysia abstained from voting on a United
Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq last December, which
was supported by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, a new arms inspection body called the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) will
be established to replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year trade sanctions on Iraq will be suspended should
Baghdad fully cooperation with the new U.N. arms inspection body
and fulfill key disarmament tasks to be defined by weapons
inspectors, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused that the new weapons inspection regime is a tool
aimed at keeping the embargo in place, and has repeatedly declared
its rejection to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and France, three permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council favor the lifting of the crippling embargo imposed
on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Iran will
reach 15.3 percent by the end of the next Iranian calendar year
ending March 20, 2001, local newspaper Iran Daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed population will reach 2.8 million by that time,
the daily quoted a report from the Plan and Budget Organization
(PBO) as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the current Iranian year, the work force supply will
reach 17.7 million while the demand is expected to be at 15
million, bringing the unemployment rate to 15.25 percent. Iran
reported a 9.08 percent unemployment rate for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 1.9 million educated people will enter the
labor market during the current Iranian year while there are only
1.5 million vacancies for them, indicating an unemployment rate of
around 21 percent.

<P>
The PBO also predicted that the unemployment rate for educated
work force in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005) will

<HEADLINE> Kharrazi Reiterates Iran's Policy on Palestinian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has reiterated Iran's policy on the Palestinian issue,
saying that Tehran is still determined to restore rights of the
Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to diplomatic representatives of Islamic countries and
organizations in Tehran on Tuesday evening, Kharrazi said that the
Palestinian issue will always remain as an integral part of Iran's
foreign policy, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
and President Mohammad Khatami pay due attention to the issue of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The massive participation of Iranian people in the International
Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Day rallies on Friday was a clear-cut
indication
of solidarity between the Iranian nation and the oppressed nation
of Palestine, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Iranians from all walks of life turned out on
Friday, voicing their support for the Palestinian struggles and
condemning any compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in
1980
announced the last Friday of the Islamic holy fasting month of
Ramadan as the International Al-Qods Day, calling for international

support for the Palestinians to "liberate" Jerusalem from the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the tragic story of Palestine with a large
number of homeless Muslims and the situation in the holy Al-Qods is

one of the most deplorable issues of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The expansionist policies of the Israeli regime along with
support of the big powers, particularly the U.S., have led
to violation of the rights of the Palestinian nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize Israel and opposed the Middle East
peace process. It called on Muslims to fight to liberate Jerusalem
and occupied territories and root out the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also underlined the need of unity
among Muslims and termed it as an important factor for their
development.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret that the Islamic world has not yet achieved
the needed unity, he said that the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), under the chairmanship of President Khatami, has
made great efforts to establish unity among world Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Faces Difficulty in Choosing Cabinet Replacements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada admitted Wednesday that he has difficulty in finding the
right replacements for the proposed cabinet revamp.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the president said he could not simply
announce who among his cabinet members will be replaced since he
has not yet found the right officials to take over the posts that
will be vacated.
</P>
<P>
He said he still has to check the background of every official
that will be named to his cabinet, so that he can be certain of
their integrity and competence.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the reason he is having difficulty in finding
the right persons to name to his cabinet is the low pay offered in
government service, adding that those who are qualified for the
job receive five times the salary being offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, he explained, private individuals look at a
government appointment as a thankless job because of the
criticisms they have to face as they join government service.
</P>
<P>
He said that in finding the replacements for his cabinet, he
will have to appoint people who would be willing to make
sacrifices in serving the government and risk facing all these
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio program, the president said he may make an
announcement sooner than the 10-day time frame he had earlier set,
but he would not say exactly when.
</P>
<P>
"Most likely, it may not take 10 days for me to announce it,"
he said when asked to elaborate on his earlier statements before
the media as to when his final judgment will be made public.
</P>
<P>
"There will be new faces in the cabinet. Other cabinet members
will simply be moved to another department," he said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 13 in Sri Lanka's Suicide Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a suicide
bombing outside the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's Office here
Wednesday rose to 13, the state radio said.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, six were killed on the spot, the radio said,
adding that seven others succumbed to their injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the explosion happened when the woman
suicide bomber was stopped and questioned by security personnel in
front of the Prime Minister's Office on Colombo's Flower Road.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Prime Minister's Security Division and a
woman translator who was helping the police question the bomber as
well as the bomber were killed on the spot, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, mother of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was not in the office at the time
of explosion, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
suspicion fell on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who have been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the island country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed a similar suicide bombing last month
against President Kumaratunga on the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who lost her right eye in the bombing, has been on
the top of the LTTE's hit list due to her vow to pressure the
rebel group by military means back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Deports Asian Businessman With British Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Tuesday deported an Asian
 businessman with a British citizenship for his campaigning
against Zambia's unity, according to Zambian Minister of Home
Affairs Peter Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
Majid Ticklay has been deported to Britain where he is a
citizen, Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ticklay has of late been abusing the privileges Zambians have
accorded him during his long stay in the country by campaigning
against the nation's unity, strength and peace, Machungwa said in
Lusaka on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday Ticklay wrote a letter to the Asian community,
urging the Asians in the southern African country to join hands
with the rest of Zambians to elect the next government.
</P>
<P>
In the letter he said that although Asians have been loyal
citizens, they have been sidelined by the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Asian community in Zambia is now to identify
which political party among the ruling and opposition parties it
can support, said Ticklay, who had been in Zambia for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Machungwa noted that the government and people of
Zambia cherish and believe in the concept of "One Zambia One
Nation" and that all Zambians, despite tribe, color, creed or race
should live and strive together in peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Government will therefore not tolerate those bent on sowing
messages designed to promote ethnic divisions, hatred, racial
discrimination and anarchy among the people of this country," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that while appreciating freedom of speech,
the interest of each individual and Zambians as a whole must be
protected.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Passes Arbitration (Amendment) Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Wednesday passed the
Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 1999 to implement the arrangement on
the reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards between the mainland
and the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 1999 defines clearly the type
of mainland awards that can be enforced in Hong Kong and sets out
relevant procedures and grounds for refusal of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that only the mainland awards made by
recognized arbitral authorities would be enforced in the Hong Kong
SAR and the list of recognized arbitral authorities will be
published from time to time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill adapts the Arbitration Ordinance to bring
it into conformity with the Basic Law and Hong Kong's status as a
special administrative region of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the return of Hong Kong to China, the recognition and
enforcement in Hong Kong of arbitral awards made in other
jurisdictions, including the mainland, were governed by the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards done at New York, also known as the New York Convention.
</P>
<P>
The New York Convention continues to apply in the Hong Kong SAR
after its return. However, since the convention is an
international agreement, it is no longer applicable to the
enforcement of arbitral awards between the mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government reached consensus with the
mainland in this aspect. The new arrangement was made in
accordance with the spirit of the New York Convention and will
allow awards made by more than 100 mainland arbitral authorities
with relevant experience to be enforced in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 22 Palestinian Criminal Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel released Wednesday 22
Palestinians jailed for criminal offenses as a goodwill gesture to
mark the end this week of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prisons Authority said 20 of the released were
convicted of illegal entry into Israel and were sentenced to up to
one year in prison. The other two were convicted of homicide.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the release was not connected with
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) held no official ceremony to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 33 Palestinian political prisoners jailed for anti-
Israel activities last month in the third and last batch of release
under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in September. Israel had
freed 350 political prisoners in the first two batches.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said the two sides would meet after
Ramadan to discuss the release of more political prisoners. The PNA
said more than 1,600 political prisoners were still jailed in
Israeli prisons.

<HEADLINE> Israel Starts Second Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel Defense Force (IDF)
started Wednesday a long-delayed troop redeployment in the West
Bank, a day after reaching a compromise agreement with the
Palestinians over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The IDF began moving their office and other military equipment
out of a military base near the West Bank city of Nablus Wednesday
morning as part of the second troop redeployment, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
Under a September interim peace deal, the second troops pullout
should have been carried out on November 15, but it ran aground due
to differences between the two sides over which lands should be
transferred.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand for more densely populated areas and
insisted that the map of targeted land not be decided unilaterally
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The compromise agreement envisages that the second stage will be
carried out as originally planned by Israel while Israel will be
open to Palestinian requests in sketching the maps for the third
withdrawal on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the Tuesday agreement, the IDF will evacuate from seven
military bases, six in the northern areas of the West Bank and a
seventh near Bethlehem in the stage.
</P>
<P>
Besides, IDF will transfer 2 percent of the West Bank land from
Area B, in which Israel controls security and Palestinians exercise
civil administration, to total Palestinian-controlled Area A, and 3
percent from full Israel-controlled Area C to Area B, the IDF said.
</P>
<P>
All the targeted areas would be marked by Friday after joint
patrols view them on Thursday, the IDF said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Beefs up Efforts to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Executive
Council, the country's top federal executive body, has approved 10
billion naira (100 million U.S. dollars) fund for poverty
alleviation programs in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The appropriation is still to be ratified by the country's top
legislature, the National Assembly, Daily Time newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in capital Abuja Tuesday, the Federal
Executive Council also decided to scrap three agencies in a bid to
rationalize the country's poverty alleviation regime.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies to be scrapped are the Family Economic
Advancement Program, the Nigeria Agricultural Land Development
Authority and Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has resolved to set up a Poverty
Alleviation Council chaired by President Olusegun Obasanjo to
speed up its poverty alleviation drive in the most populous
African country.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the action is part of the
restructuring of the 16 poverty alleviation agencies to
materialize Obasanjo's new year pledge to wage war against poverty
in this country.
</P>
<P>
"The government is aware of the various effects of poverty in
the land and is looking at the ways and means of improving the lot
of the people," said Minister of Cooperation and Integration in
Africa Jerry Gana.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources would be restructured with a view to enhancing services
like tractor hiring, land clearing and development, fertilizer
distribution, and the provision of seeds.
</P>
<P>
The council has also set specific targets for different
ministries directly involved in the poverty alleviation program,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education would increase the adult literacy
rate in the country from the current level of 51 percent to 70
percent while health care delivery would shoot up from the present
level of 40 percent to 70 percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The immunization for children would be increased from 40
percent to 100 percent, and rural water supply, from 30 percent to
60 percent, rural electrification from 30 percent to 60 percent
before 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other poverty alleviation programs include a vastly improved
micro credit scheme, the improvement of rural feeder roads across
the country and the development of simple processes, agricultural
machines and small-scale industries.

<HEADLINE> Serious Flu Hits Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A serious flu epidemic is
sweeping through Albania as the country enters the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The flu has so far killed at least 13 people across the country,
including four in the capital of Tirana, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
During the New Year holiday, the situation got worse as most
pharmacies were closed and many patients could not get the
medicines needed.
</P>
<P>
In Tirana, the number of patients is growing too large for the
local hospitals to handle, said the Albanian Minister of Health
and Environment Leonard Solis. Hospitals elsewhere are also
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry would meet on Thursday to
discuss measures to fight the disease, which some doctors call the
"Australian flu," while others say it may have originated in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The flu patients easily run fevers as high as 38 or 39 degrees
Celsius, and must be kept in bed for several days to a week. For
children, the flu can easily develop into bronchial pneumonia.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Goods Flooding Into South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese commodities have been
flooding into South Korea since a ban was lifted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two Japanese goods, including camcorders, electric rice
cookers, mobile phones, VCRs and kitchen appliances, which were
freed from the list of import source diversification goods,
registered substantial sales rise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months last year, the 32 Japanese imports
amounted to 207 million U.S. dollars, up 121.7 percent from the
same period in 1998, according to the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The imports of Japanese consumer goods skyrocketed 999 percent
in that period while those of raw materials and capital goods
surged 62.9 percent and 98.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In return for a bailout loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after
South Korea was gripped by a financial crisis in late 1997, the
nation agreed with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate
the import source diversification policy, which banned the import
of a number of Japanese goods to avoid a large trade deficit with
Japan.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's GDP Expected to Grow 6.3 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic
product (GDP) will rise 6.3 percent this year compared with the 10.
1 percent estimated last year, the Korea Institute of Finance said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP will grow 7.3 percent in the first quarter, 6.5 percent
in the second, 5.9 percent in the third and 5.7 percent in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The exports will rise 9.8 percent and imports 18.1 percent to
narrow the current-account surplus to 11.3 billion U.S. dollars,
less than the government's target of 13 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inflation will reach 3.5 percent. The South
Korean government recently lowered its inflation target to three
percent or lower.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will be hard to maintain below four percent since
corporate restructuring will continue through this year, said the
institute.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are expected to edge up in tandem with an
expected rise in the United States. Consequently, the corporate
bond yield will reach 10.5 percent in the first half and 10.7
percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
The is also different from that of the government which expects
the rates to remain in single digit figures.
</P>
<P>
If measures to deal with the Daewoo Group's liquidity problem
and the financial health of investment-trust companies go awry,
interest rates could soar to 13 percent and cause stock prices to
tumble.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors would then pull their money out of the
country, thereby leading to destabilization of the economy, the
institute warned.

<HEADLINE> 7 New NPC Deputies from Macao SAR to Be Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Seven deputies from the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), in addition to the current five NPC deputies, are
expected to be chosen at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
An electoral conference, which is composed of 203 Macao
residents with Chinese citizenship, held the first plenary meeting
on Wednesday. Another four plenary meetings will be held in the
month until the seven deputies are selected.
</P>
<P>
The entire process of choosing new NPC deputies from the Macao
SAR will go on "fairly, justly and openly," He Chunlin, secretary-
general of the NPC Standing Committee, said at the plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NPC deputies are members of the country's supreme
power organ, and the deputies from the Macao SAR will take part in
exercising power in accordance with the country's Constitution and
other laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the system of the people's congress will not be
applied in the Macao SAR and the NPC deputies of the region will
not intervene in concrete local affairs, He Chunlin stressed.
</P>
<P>
Out of the electoral conference members, the first plenary
meeting chose nine persons to form a presidium, with Macao SAR
Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah acting as its executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
The presidium is in charge of putting forward a draft specific
method for choosing the new deputies and a draft regulation
restraining the behavior of the members of the electoral
conference.
</P>
<P>
The two drafts will be circulated among the members of the
electoral conference for discussions on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies from Macao have been part of the delegation of
Guangdong Province during annual NPC sessions. Beginning from this
year, a total of 12 NPC deputies from the Macao SAR will form a
delegation to attend NPC sessions.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Cabinet Reshuffle Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A major reshuffle to the Jordanian
cabinet is becoming imminent, with five ministers expected to be
replaced, reliable sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, key portfolios pertaining to economy, foreign affairs
and information will not be touched upon in the upcoming reshuffle
to the 23-member cabinet, added the sources, who asked to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi resigned last month over
policy differences with Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi was the second minister to resign in the 10-month-old
Rawabdeh government after Minister of Youth and Sports Mohammad
Kheir Mamser resigned last July for similar reasons. Mamser's post
was later given to Saeed Shuqum, a former professional basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
After Lawzi's resignation, his portfolio was given temporarily
to Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Jamal Sarayreh.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarayreh and four other ministers are expected to leave
the cabinet during the reshuffle, including Health Minister Ishak
Maraka, Minister of Culture Faisal al-Rafua, Minister of Industry,
Trade and Supply Mohammed Asfur and Justice Minister Hamzeh Haddad.
</P>
<P>
There are no clear indications for the moment as to who will
fill the vacancies, and the coming one or two weeks will see
intensive consultations and lobbyings for the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rawabdeh had also been rumored to loose his job,
but the speculations came to a halt late last December after King
Abdullah Bin Hussein renewed his confidence and asked Rawabdeh to
carry on his duties.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch has the constitutional rights of
dissolving or appointing governments.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh apparently secured his job as the Jordanian economy is
emerging from a decade-old stagnation after the 1990 Gulf Crisis,
in which the kingdom found itself isolated by other Arab nations
for sympathizing with Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is expected to achieve a 2 percent economic growth
in 1999 though official figures have not been released.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming reshuffle was aimed at garnering support for
various social, economic and administrative reforms carried out by
Rawabdeh after he took office in March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A series of steps by the government have drawn attacks from the
public and opposition parties, including its drive to privatize key
public enterprises, its crackdown on dissident Muslims and its
decision to levy a 10-percent tax on consumption.

<HEADLINE> Five Businessmen Authorized to Sell Arms in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- At least five private
businessmen in Tanzania have been licensed to sell firearms and
explosives for civilian use, the Guardian newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Police Force spokesman and Senior Assistant
Commissioner of Police (SACP) Aden Mwamunyange, the businessmen
were given the permission after the police had carefully
investigated their personality, their ability to conduct the
business and their background.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the private businessmen, who were from
Dar es Salaam and the north region of Kilimanjaro, were given the
permission at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, firearms and explosives "will not be sold like
peanuts", he said, noting that although there are some private
businessmen selling firearms, individuals who want to own them
would still have to get a license from the Police Force.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the government issued a statement to businessmen
 interested in starting dealership of weapons and explosives and
announced a list of regulations and qualifications for them to
meet before being authorized.

CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Belgium kept its Hopman Cup
hopes alive with a hard-earned win over the United States in a
marathon round-robin clash at the Burswood Dome in Perth on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the singles matches were split, the Belgian team of

in the deciding mixed doubles rubber, winning in three sets 6-4, 3-
6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The win was Belgium's first of the tournament and gives it an
outside chance of making Saturday's final, while the U.S. team of
Alexandra Stevenson and James Blake is now out of contention after
successive losses.

<P>
Van Roost, who has lost both her singles matches this week,
said it was a relief to be on the winner's list at last in the
mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that we won the doubles, because I was feeling
very bad after losing my singles match for the second time," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give everything that I could in the doubles and I
did that and I won, so I'm very glad," she added.

Unidentified Foreign Ministry officials made the denial in an
interview with the Turkish Daily News that published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the ministry would like to say it has made no
further demands of Syria since an agreement was signed by the two
sides in Turkish southern city of Adana in October, 1998, neither
die it has asked the U.S. to keep Syria in the list.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria are long-standing rival in the Middle East,
with the two accusing each other of supporting one another's anti-
government groups.
</P>
<P>
The two countries last year came to the brink of a war Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the PKK who had once taken shelter in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The clarification was seen as a gesture for the support of the

Turkey is closely following the Israeli-Syrian peace
negotiations with concern over the issue of water, which was raised

<P>
Ankara has reiterated that it fully backs the peace process, but
will not accept bargaining over its water.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in possible final accord between Israel and
Syria, Israel might maintain the control of the water sources in

Turkey has been reluctant to provide more water to Syria and
Iraq, which sit on the lower reaches of the Euphrates River.

<HEADLINE> No Dialog With Iraq Before War Prisoners' Release: Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
said that his country refuses any dialog with Iraq before Baghdad
releases Kuwaiti and other nationals held as prisoners of war
(POWs) after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait rejects any direct meeting with (Iraqi) officials until
the release of all our prisoners, or even part of them," Deputy
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah has said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ought to "first show good intention in the detainees issue
and then we will talk about direct encounter," said Salem, also
chairman of the National Committee for POWs and Missing Affairs,
the Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salem was reacting to a call made at the end of last year by
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Kuwait to start direct talks
with Iraq. Yemen sided with Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that Iraq is still holding more than 600 Kuwaiti
and third country nationals detained by Iraqi troops in their
occupation of Kuwait, a charge rejected by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official accused Iraq of showing "no good intention"
in this respect and "continuing to use the detainees as a
bargaining chip."
</P>
<P>
The POWs matter remains the major block to a direct Kuwaiti-
Iraqi contact, which might lead to a breakthrough in the relations
between the two Arab foes.

<HEADLINE> New Kurdish Parties on Horizon in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish intellectuals of Kurdish
origin have started initiatives to form new political parties in
the country, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after they were relieved of the oppression from
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been seeking
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey through violent
means, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK military actions in the country have weakened since the
capture of its leader Abdullah Ocalan and many of its radical
members have left Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Some former Kurdish members of leftist Turkish parties have
planned a new leftist party while some others have initiated a
right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
Serafettin Elci, a lawyer of Kurdish origin and former Turkish
minister of public works and housing, is planning to form a liberal
and more independent party.
</P>
<P>
He said "we would not call ourselves a Kurdish party," adding,
however, that "if we were referred to as one (Kurdish party), it
would not bother us. If the current laws in Turkey permitted us to
form a Kurdish party, we would have founded one."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the political party his people are organizing
will "have respect for the territorial integrity of the Turkish
Republic and refrain from all forms of violation."
</P>
<P>
The party, he said, will "place a special emphasis on three
basic rights, which are language, culture and education."
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that "we request that every ethnic group has the
right to set up its own educational progress and want regional
administrations to replace the centralized structure. We are not
against the official language but a second language should be
authorized in regional administrations."
</P>
<P>
"Although we support liberal national economy, we believe state
intervention could eliminate inequality between regions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Syria-Israel Peace Deal to Bring Trade Boom: Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid the resumption of Israeli-
Syrian peace talks, Israel's business circle is already
anticipating a peace payoff in trade and investment ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli exports to Syria in the event of a peace treaty would
amount to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars a year, a report prepared by
Israel Manufacturers Association estimated.
</P>
<P>
The report, published Wednesday, said the Israeli exports to
Syria would consist largely of agricultural goods, communication
equipment and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Israel's exports of machinery and equipment, such as heating and
cooling systems, to Syria could reap some 600 million dollars a
year, and the exports of chemicals could also collect about 385
million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Other Israeli companies are also following the development of
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks and examining market opportunities
for Israeli firms in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Another potential for bilateral trade between Israel and Syria
lies in Syrian exports of natural gas to Israel, Amit Consulting
and Enterprising, a consulting group on energy and environment, has
said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 20-dollar-per-barrel oil price, Syrian revenues
from natural gas exports to Israel could reach 200 million dollars
each year.

<P>
BGHDAD, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of blocking 35 of its agricultural and
veterinary contracts signed in phase six of the oil-for-food deal
with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Agriculture Minister Abdul Ella Hameed held the U.S. and
British envoys at the committee responsible for stymying the deal
signed mainly with companies from France, Spain, Italy, Turkey,
Egypt and China, the Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contracts were for the purchases of generators,
insecticides, pumps, prerequisites for poultry and irrigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the sufferings of
the Iraqi people, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in Iraq in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately hindering the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Tumble in Tokyo on Wall Street Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Wednesday, with information and technology issues facing selling
after Tuesday's plunge on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 460.31 points, or 2.42
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 18,542.55.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 65.63 points or 3.82 percent to 1,
651.84.
</P>
<P>
After opening, the Nikkei index, which closed above 19,000 for
the first time in more than 28 months, followed a falling path and
plunged to as low as 18,211.82 just before the morning session was
over.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to 563.09 million shares,
with Toshiba becoming the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
High-tech issues faced selling after the technology-heavy
NASDAQ composite index in New York marked the largest one-day
decline Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in New York fell sharply Tuesday on concern that the U.S.
economy may be overheated and the growing view that a sharp rate
hike is inevitable and imminent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, issues that had faced selling recently in Tokyo
rebounded, with the steel industry, the construction sector and
the chemical industry moving up.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 661 to 554 despite the falls in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with
119 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oregon State Sells Surplus Property On Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Oregon has become the first
U.S. state that is selling some of its surplus property -- from
street signs to traffic lights -- on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The items being sold were declared surplus by the state or
confiscated by police, according to some local officials, who said
80 percent of the profit goes back to the contributing agency; the
balance is paid for salaries and administrative costs of the
surplus property program.
</P>
<P>
The state still conducts six traditional auctions a year and
has a "general store" open at other times to get rid of surplus
goods.
</P>
<P>
Lighter and more-expensive items are sold over the Internet,
while larger, more-bulky items are sold on traditional auctions,
said Nole Bullock, who works with the surplus property program.
</P>
<P>
Profits from the online sales have been twice those of
traditional, oral auctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bullock said Oregon plans to launch a Web site that will
allow consumers to buy goods over the Internet and pick it up
locally. That will enable the state to sell larger, bulkier items
such as desks and chairs without having to pay shipping costs,
Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
The state has put some "wacky stuff" like a wrong-way street
sign on the Internet and has found buyers around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Scotland, England, Guam, Australia, Korea. ...The power of the
Web is immense," Bullock said, adding that "it has been phenomenal.
"
</P>
<P>
Skip Morton, manager of the state's property distribution
center, says he believes Oregon is the first state to use the
Internet to get rid of surplus goods.
</P>
<P>
Officials from other states are asking how to launch their own
online sales program.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of states really get interested in this,"
Bullock said. "Everyone is getting on board with this and wanting
to know how we did it."

<HEADLINE> East China Province Reduces Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all major manufacturers
which had been causing serious air pollution in east China's
Jiangsu Province have now stopped emitting soot and dust.
</P>
<P>
This means that the emission of soot, dust, and sulphur dioxide
in the province will be reduced annually by 102,000 tons, 124,000
tons and 56,000 tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has been
suffering from moderate air pollution over the past decades as the
local economy surges forward.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government launched a massive pollution-control
campaign several years ago focused on stopping its 1,129 major
manufacturers from polluting the air.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 700 million yuan has been spent for various
pollution-control facilities at these enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Heavy morning snow in Beijing
caused the closing of a number of the city's major expressways and
highways.
</P>
<P>
According to local transportation authorities, the number of
flights landing at the capital airport was reduced, and
expressways linking the city with Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and the
Badaling section of the Great Wall were closed.
</P>
<P>
The slippery roads also affected pedestrians and caused traffic
jams, and local hospitals received hundreds of emergency fracture
patients who had fallen on the icy streets. Over 1,600 minor
traffic accidents were reported, none involving personal injury.
</P>
<P>
The snow will end today, according to the city's weather bureau,

<HEADLINE> Illegal Foreigners Arrested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen foreigners were detained
Tuesday in Cyprus' southern coastal town of Limassol in an
operation against illegal immigrants, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ten Iranians, five Syrians and three Jordanians were rounded up
in the Immigration Department operation against foreigners living
and working in Cyprus without permits.
</P>
<P>
The sweep was part of an ongoing nation-wide campaign against
foreigners staying the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
"The foreigners were transferred to the central prison, and the
procedure for their deportation had already began," a senior
Immigration Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against illegal immigrants will continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cyprus police is looking into an alleged
shipwreck case, in which 17 foreigners were rescued off Cyprus'
southeastern coast on New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the survivors may not be telling the truth
about the incident because an extensive coast guard search failed
to locate any trace of the 4,700-ton vessel that was said to have
sunk.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Forecast to Have Higher Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth for 1999 will reach 5.2 percent as forecast
by stockbroking house TA Securities Bhd (TA).
</P>
<P>
The stockbroking firm is estimating the growth rate for the
fourth quarter of 1999 to be 9.9 percent, yielding a tentative 5.2
percent GDP growth for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The growth forecast was based on the 23.1 percent surge in
November's Industrial Production Index (IPI) which exceeded the
earlier expectation of 13.2 percent, on the back of strong export-
led growth in the electronic sector, TA said in its economic focus
released in a statement here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IPI for November 1999 surged to another record high on the
back of strong performance of the manufacturing sector which has a
32.6 percent increase in the output, accounting for 70.4 percent
in the IPI, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayban Securities, another stockbroking firm, has
forecast Malaysia's GDP to grow by 5.2 percent in 2000 against a
growth of 4.2 percent estimated for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the country's economic outlook in a statement here
Wednesday, Mayban Securities said the bright economic outlook was
supported by stronger exports, estimated to grow at 5.8 percent
year-on-year, and revival of private consumption at 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We foresee the 2000 budget deficit (13 billion ringgit or
about 3.421 billion U.S. dollars, or 4.4 percent of Gross National
Product) and high economic development expenditure (23.7 billion
ringgit or about 6.236 billion U.S. dollars) as positive,
providing the needed boost to domestic activities," the company
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the overall growth in 2000 will be broader-based
with construction projected to post 1.4 percent growth although
mining will remain negative.
</P>
<P>
Mayban Securities said that manufacturing, despite its higher
base, would continue to lead the economy while the current account
would remain sturdy at 17.2 percent of nominal GNP versus 16.9
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has forecast a 4.3 percent GDP growth for 1999
and a 5.0 percent growth for 2000.

MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters battled Wednesday
afternoon a blaze of still undetermined origin in the central
Philippines, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
No one was reported hurt in the fire that gutted a paint
warehouse and lasted for over five hours in Legazpi, capital city
of Albay on the southern tip of Luzon Island.
</P>
<P>
Seven fire trucks from the city and neighboring towns rushed to
the scene, but traffic and blocked alleys prevented them from
penetrating the area and immediately controlling the conflagration.
</P>
<P>
According to fire authorities, the fire started inside the
warehouse, filled with stocks of paint and paint materials, at
about noon.
</P>
<P>
The Albay Electric Cooperative immediately shut off power in
the area and private firefighters rushed to the scene.

<HEADLINE> Three African Countries Hit by Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cholera had been reported
over the festive season in three African holiday destinations, the
British Airways Travel Clinics announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cases of the outbreak had been reported in Malawi, Zimbabwe and
the Comoros, Andrew Jamieson, the spokesman for the clinics, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cholera had been reported in Malawi's two largest cities of
Lilongwe and Blantyre as well as outlying areas. At least 17 cases
had reported in the past two weeks and doctors were recording
several new cases everyday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe reported at least 17 deaths from cholera in the
northern parts of the country in the past fortnight. Moreover, 300
cases had been reported in Mashonaland West and the official count
was expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan Island has been seen as the center of the cholera
outbreak in the Comoros with 103 cases and 14 deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
The rise in cholera cases has been blamed on advent of the
annual rainy season, coupled with inadequate sanitation
facilities, which caused faecal contamination of water and food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is now firmly established in many parts of Africa.
With the onset of this heavy rainy season, we can expect cholera
to be reported from many destinations in the region," Jamieson
said.
</P>
<P>
He advised travellers visiting these destinations to exercise
extreme caution with the water they drank and the food they ate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Look for More Land for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
might be forced to look for more land to accommodate refugees as
the on-going massive influx of Burundian refugees threatens to
congest the existing camps.
</P>
<P>
The government may have to ask local authorities in the western
regions of Kigoma and Kagera to allocate more land for new camps
if the refugees continue to increase, the Guardian newspaper
Wednesday quoted Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir
Mohamed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in the wake of fresh influx of
Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13,000 new Burundian refugees were settled in Kigoma
camps last month, compared with just over 5,000 in the previous
month, according to statistics by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Apart from looking for more land to settle the exploding
refugee population, the government would also have to tighten
security at the camps, Ameir said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs Six Million U.S. Dollars for Train Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Angola needs some six million
U.S. dollars for an emergency program of rehabilitating the train
circulation from Luanda to the town of Lucala in the Kwanza-norte
Province, official source said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Director-General of the Luanda Railroad Enterprise
Manuel Rodrigues, his company hopes to get one million U.S.
dollars for building a new bridge over the river Luinha, 185
kilometers from Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The old Luinha Bridge was destroyed in 1992 by rebels during
the civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The other five million U.S. dollars will be used to buy
railroad cars, tracks and communication equipment, Rodrigues said,
adding that his company will also reconstruct train stations and
residences for the maintenance staff.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is aimed to extend the railroad to Lucala, a
 strategic town considered as the doorway to the north and
northeast Angola, will facilitate the return of displaced people
to their hometowns, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
he said that circulation of trains between Luanda and the city
of Dondo in Kwanza-norte Province, suspended for security reason
for nine months, is also scheduled to be resumed this week.

<HEADLINE> 42nd Grammy Nominees Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Santana, a 52-year-
old guitarist, received 10 Grammy nominations Tuesday for his
commercial comeback album "Supernatural", leading all nominees for
the 42nd annual Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
"Supernatural," Santana's best-selling collaboration with such
stars as Eric Clapton and Lauryn Hill, was nominated for best
album and rock album of the year.
</P>
<P>
Santana was also nominated for record of the year for "Smooth,"
which and another Santana's hit, "Love of My Life" accounted for
two of the five nominees for pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
In pop music categories, the group TLC was the second with six
nominations for the album "FanMail."
</P>
<P>
Besides album of the year, TLC's nominations included best
rhythm and blues album, record of the year for "No Scrubs," and
pop vocal performance by a duo or group for "Unpretty."
</P>
<P>
Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations.
Other multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five,
and the Backstreet Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Hill and
Whitney Houston, all with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
The best new artist nominees were Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray,
Kid Rock, Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
Santana's group has put out 29 albums over 30 years, but it has
been many years since he has had a major commercial success. He
said that the nominations Tuesday were gratifying and he had never
felt slighted.
</P>
<P>
Music industry sources say Santana's Grammy recognition is the
latest chapter in one of rock's greatest comeback stories. Since
forming in 1967 and enjoying hits such as "Black Magic Woman" and
"Oye Como Va," Santana's band has received just one Grammy
nomination in 1972, while Santana himself has one win, in 1988,
for his solo work.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Santana's band had focused more on touring
than on recording. But last June, it released "Supernatural,"
featuring collaborations with some of today's hottest artists, and
it went on to become its first chart-topping album in 28 years. U.
S. sales to date stand at 4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The 42nd annual Grammy Awards will be announced on February 23
at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The voters honor works for
their artistic merit, but commercial success plays an inevitable
role in their decisions.
</P>
<P>
For example, all but one of the five nominees for album of the
year topped the U.S. pop charts last year, led by the biggest
album of 1999, Backstreet Boys' "Millennium" with sales of 9.3
million copies. Also competing are the Dixie Chicks' "Fly,"
Canadian jazz singer Diana Krall's "When I Look in Your Eyes," and
TLC's "FanMail." Krall's album peaked at No. 68.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will seek inter-Korean
dialogue without preconditions instead of vice-ministerial level
talks as in the past years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea proposed that the governments of Seoul and
Pyongyang meet first without any agenda as precondition, said
Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu Wednesday after the first
meeting of the National Security Council chaired by President Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
"The South and North can meet without any conditions attached
to discuss issues of bilateral cooperation toward the new
millennium," said Park, who was appointed as Unification Minister
last month.
</P>
<P>
He said South Korea will not seek the kind of vice-ministerial
level talks as in the past years as they were "fruitless."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also disclosed that the South Korean
government is ready to supply more assistance than last year's 40
million U.S. dollars worth of humanitarian aid to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
In his new year's message, President Kim Dae-jung proposed the
establishment of an inter-Korean economic community.
</P>
<P>
Kim's proposal is seen as a continuation of his "sunshine
policy" which pursues inter-Korean reconciliation, exchange and
cooperation based on separating business from politics.

<P>
There are now five large exhibition centers available in
Shanghai offering a total of more than 100,000 sq m of floor space
for displays, barely meeting the demand of over a hundred fairs
and exhibitions held in the city annually. The number of employees
in the city involved in the exposition business is now over 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Some renowned overseas exhibition companies are keen to invest
in Shanghai, which is proving to be a hot spot due to its
favorable location, good foundation in education and science and
technology, and economic influence in China.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-German-funded exposition center is now being built in
the Pudong New Areas at a cost of nearly 100 million US dollar,
jointly invested in by three well-known German exhibition
companies based in Hanover, Dusseldorf, and Munich.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the center, designed by U.S. architects, will
eventually reach an impressive 200,000 square meters, greatly
expanding the exhibition area in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Germany say that this new exposition center marks
the first joint investment made by all three major German
exhibition companies in the international market.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shenzhen,
and Ningbo, are also resorting to exhibitions to attract
businesses and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Though the Internet is becoming ever more popular as a way of
doing business, many take the view that these fairs and similar
activities are able to get twice the results with half the effort
through face-to-face dealings, and this means growing business
opportunities.

TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi has strongly
denied allegations that the hijackers of an Indian
airline plane had entered Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the sources rumoring the
presence of the hijackers in Iran are only trying
to deceive the public, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local daily Tehran Times on
Wednesday quoted a foreign ministry official as
saying that the hijackers were involved in a
terrorist act and Iran would never allow them to
enter its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Indian news agency PTI had said that it was
told by informed sources that the hijackers had
fled into Iran via Heart, Afghanistan, in order to
distract the public opinion and reduce
international anxiety.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers fled the scene after they
released more than 150 passengers and crew members
aboard the abducted plane, which they seized on a
flight from Kathmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi and
held for eight days in southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The ordeal ended only after Indian government

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Mounts to 11 in Colombo's Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people, including
the suicide bomber, were killed and 20 others were injured
Wednesday morning when a huge bomb explosion ripped through Sri
Lanka's capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, six were killed on the spot, said the state
television broadcast, adding that five others succumbed to their
injuries in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the explosion happened when the woman
suicide bomber tried to break into the Prime Minister's Office in
Colombo's Flower Road.
</P>
<P>
Four police personnel and one civilian as well as the bomber
were killed on the spot, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mrs. Bandaranaike, mother of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, was not in the office at the time of explosion,said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
suspicion fell on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels who have been fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the island country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed a similar suicide bombing last month
against President Kumaratunga on the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga who lost her right eye in the bombing has been on
the top of the LTTE's hit list due to her vow to pressure the
rebel group by military means back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Hold Parliamentary Elections in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe confirmed Tuesday night that the country's parliamentary
elections will be held in March rather than in June this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the elections would be held within the required period
as stated in the country's constitution, local media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Elections will be held in March. We have not as the government
made a decision to postpone elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
A referendum on the country's draft constitution is also going
to be held before the elections. A bill paving the way for the
holding of a referendum was passed by the parliament last week
and is now awaiting gazetting before becoming law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said those involved in the preparations for the
elections would have to work extra hours to meet the deadline,
stressing that the government has never postponed any elections
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
But he added that should the elections fail to be held in
March, they would be held during the first week of April.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Curb Illegal Flights to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police Tuesday mounted a
12-hour operation to crack down illegal flights to Somalia, local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of officers from the Special Crime Prevention Unit
sealed off Wilson Airport in the Kenyan capital Nairobi at 4:00
a.m. local time and prevented flights bound for Somalia from
taking off.
</P>
<P>
The police raided the hangars and inspected passengers'
documents to ascertain the authenticity of the cargo and
passengers flying out. Two planes concerned were detained.
</P>
<P>
The operation followed the tip that some aviation companies had
resumed flights to Somalia despite a government ban, police
officer Peter Kavila said.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi banned all
flights between Kenya and Somalia on security grounds.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, the government ban is still in
force," Kavila said.
</P>
<P>
The only flights allowed to take off were those transporting
personnel and relief supplies involved in humanitarian activities
such as those belonging to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
and the World Food Program, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Inspect Kenyan Fish Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A team of European Union
officials are set to visit Kenya to assess the quality of the
country's fish products, the East African Standard newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mission is expected to evaluate the progress made in
improving hygiene and quality standards of the products, Kenyan
officials in the fisheries sector said.
</P>
<P>
The EU slapped a ban on Kenya fish exports two years ago
following concern over the use of chemicals in fishing.
</P>
<P>
The newly released fisheries report said that the ban had
thrown Kenya's fisheries industry into a crisis with the fish
prices at beaches dropped by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kenya's annual export of fish products to
the EU reach 300 million shillings (about 4.3 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A EU team visited the country last August and expressed
dissatisfaction with the manner in which fish was being handled at
the beaches.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's fisheries industry has made great
efforts to improve the fish handling and quality testing
facilities to meet the export standards.

NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Four employees of Kenya
Airfreight Limited have been charged with stealing 9.2 kilograms
of gold worth 5.1 million shillings (about 70,000 U.S. dollars)
for export to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The court heard Tuesday that when the plane carrying the gold
stopped over in Amsterdam on December 15 last year, it was
discovered that the consignment was missing, Kenya Times reported
Wednesday.

The four suspects, accused of jointly stealing the gold, denied
the charges and were released on a bond of 500,000 shillings
(about 7,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The case was set for further hearing on February 24 this year.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Border Traders
Association (CBTA) has intervened in the case involving 215
Zambian and Tanzanian traders who were on the verge of being
expelled from Zimbabwe for trading illegally, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the traders were operating illegally
at Carter House in Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
CBTA Chairman Greenwell Shimukonka, who travelled to Zimbabwe
to intervene in the case, confirmed the development in an
interview in Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the 215 traders escaped expulsion
by registering with CBTA.
</P>
<P>
The traders had earlier set up a market on their own without
representation from any recognized association, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Zimbabwean government threatened to expel more
than 200 traders from Zambia and Tanzania for operating illegally
in that country, giving them up to December 31, 1999 to register
with recognized traders' association, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate continues
to rise with the underlying month-on-month inflation reaching 7.6
percent in December from 7.3 percent in November, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted Chief
Economist Maurice Kanga of the Central Bank of Kenya as saying the
average annual inflation in the country remained unchanged at the
November level of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank is confident that with the
continuation of prudent macro-economic policies pursued by the
bank, the inflation should be contained within a single digit
range, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's weekly update, Kenya's interest rates
remained high during the week to December 30,1999, with the
average interbank borrowing rate standing at 14.26 percent
compared with 14.38 percent recorded in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said the average interest rate on the 91-day treasury
bill rose to 20.94 percent in the auction on January 3 from 20.47
percent in the previous auction, while the average base lending
rate for commercial banks reached 23.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate was 72.88 shillings per U.S. dollar
during the week to January 4 compared with 72.99 shillings traded
in the previous week, he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Launches Higher Speed Celeron Processor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chip, available Tuesday at a price of 167 dollars each in 1,
000-unit quantities, offers PC users additional performance at
little extra cost, Intel said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the fastest Celeron processor was the 500 megahertz
version. Intel said it plans to remain aggressive in the low-cost
segment of the PC market, where it has regained share from rival
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
"Last year our goal was to regain our position in the value PC
segment," said Pat Gelsinger, vice president of Intel's desktop
products group. "This year we have that position and we want to
clearly commit our intent to keep it."
</P>
<P>
Since the first Celeron was launched in 1998 the line has
become the second best-selling processor in the world, behind
Intel's leading Pentium family.
</P>
<P>
The Celeron 533 megahertz is the first of many new-value PC
desktop and mobile products to come from Intel in 2000, Gelsinger
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Intel plans to launch Celerons at frequencies of
566 and 600 megahertz sometime in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
With the new manufacturing process, Intel will "have a lot of
headroom" to upgrade products to higher frequencies, Gelsinger
said, adding that Intel just introduced an 800 megahertz version
of the Pentium III.

<HEADLINE> Compaq to Enhance Direct Sales System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's biggest personal computer maker, said Tuesday that it will
buy the ordering system and other assets of computer distributor
Inacom Corp. in a move to boost its sales directly to customers as
arch-rival Dell Computer Corp. now does.
</P>
<P>
"With this significant step, we are advancing Compaq's ability
to deliver the leading portfolio of Internet access and
infrastructure products, services, and solutions directly to
customers with a single point of accountability," said Michael
Capellas, president and chief executive officer of Compaq company.
</P>
<P>
"This purchase makes great strategic sense for Compaq because
it gives us the right capabilities quickly and cost-effectively,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said it will pay 370 million U.S. dollars in cash for
the assets that will help it configure computers for its customers
and manage the entire ordering process faster and more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Compaq is seeking to transform itself by taking and filling
customer computer orders directly in hopes of capturing
efficiencies realized by No.2 PC-maker Dell, which makes computers
only after they are ordered by customers.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the purchase of Inacom assets will forward its goal
of increasing to 40 percent the percentage of computers it sells
directly to customers, up from its current level of about 25
percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
With the asset acquisition, Compaq said it is acquiring the
ability to track the entire order process and to customize the
configuration of computers for customers.
</P>
<P>
Included in the deal are assets such as hardware and software
image certification to make sure computers are made according to
customer's specifications. It also includes the ability to tag
assets to enable clients to manage their inventory, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
"Compaq is advancing on a clear strategic path," said Capellas.
"We said we would re-engineer the channel delivery model and this
transaction, together with other initiatives already underway,
takes us a long way toward meeting that goal."
</P>
<P>
The agreement is binding on both parties and does not require
shareholder approval. It is expected to be completed in mid-
February, subject to regulatory approvals, Compaq said.

Commanding officers at the airport in Shenyang, capital of

<P>
The airport, a major traffic hub in northeast China, is trying

</P>
<P>
This winter, snow had forced the airport to close six times due

<HEADLINE> "Good-Neighborly Ties" Key to China's Military Diplomacy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's military diplomacy
continued its active momentum throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 33 senior-level delegations from the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) visited nearly 50 foreign countries,
while 89 groups of foreign army leaders were received in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army has also been active in international events,
attending some 15 multi-lateral and regional forums on security
cooperation, and accomplishing joint research on nearly 30 topics
including defense policy, army building, and regional security.
</P>
<P>
A review of China's military diplomacy for 1999 reveals that
exchanges with neighboring countries constituted a significant
element of overall military diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The past year witnessed many conflicts, new developments in
hegemonism and power politics, and increasingly complicated
conflicts in international relations.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1998 when the promotion of stable relations with
the world's major powers was a distinctive feature of China's
military diplomacy, 1999 saw an emphasis on the further
consolidation and development of army relations with neighboring
countries and an improvement of regional security.
</P>
<P>
Active military diplomacy contributed a lot to China's overall
diplomacy in 1999, analysts say.

<P>
The strong momentum of China's friendly exchanges with
neighboring countries began when both Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian and Chief of the PLA General Staff Fu Quanyou chose
bordering countries as destination for their first annual visits.
This trend continued throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
Among those visiting China were defense ministers from Cambodia,
Thailand, Laos, Australia, and the Republic of Korea (ROK), and
army chiefs from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Mongolia, and Nepal, not to
mention numerous other lower-level groups. The number of military
delegations from neighboring countries not only exceed that of the
previous years, but surpass those from other regions as well.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here point out that China's military diplomacy has
made positive contributions to eliminating the so-called "China
threat"theory, while establishing good-neighborly partnerships of
mutual trust with neighboring countries.

<P>
China's relations with Russia and northeastern Asian countries
aroused particular interest.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, China and its largest neighbor Russia
played important roles in the world's multi-polarization process,
and maintained frequent senior-level exchanges and military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of China's Central Military Commission Zhang
Wannian visited Russia in June, yet another important visit by a
Chinese army leader to Russia. Following that, several PLA
delegations visited Russia. It could well be said that the Sino-
Russian strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century has
realized substantial development through military exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China's military ties with northeastern Asian countries also
scored a breakthrough as China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a high-level military meeting, and
the ROK defense minister visited China for the first time since
the establishment of bilateral ties seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China maintained vice-ministerial level
security consultations with Japan, another country vital to the
peace and stability of the region.

<P>
While China developed close military exchanges with neighboring
regions, it also further promoted ties with African and Latin
American countries, and opened up new fields for military exchange.
</P>
<P>
It should be mentioned that China's military diplomacy has
successfully gained the initiative by adjusting its policy in
accordance with the changing international situation.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, military diplomacy in 1999 found China fully
implementing the thinking of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and
a series of important remarks on national defense by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
By adhering to the peaceful foreign policy of independence,
China's military exchanges have played a supportive diplomatic
role while adamantly safeguarding the interests of the nation.

<HEADLINE> 64 Zimbabweans Drown in Past Three Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four Zimbabwean people were
drowned during the past three weeks, bringing the rainy season's
death toll so far to 105, the daily Herald reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rainy season started from middle of November last year.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena Tuesday
described the high death toll as shocking. It was disappointing
that people continued to ignore safety precautions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on people to avoid attempting to swim across rivers
when they could use bridges or crossing points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on motorists to avoid driving through
flooded rivers, saying no matter how important the journey might
be, nothing was worth risking one's life for.
</P>
<P>
He urged parents and guardians, especially those living near
rivers, dams and wells, to look after their children.
</P>
<P>
"Life is precious. Venturing into flooded rivers can end up in
tragedy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sports Yearender: Chinese Men Cagers Regain Firing Powers in Continent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shan Lei
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men cagers regained
their firing powers by conquering the continent in an impressive
style when their national squad outwitted South Korea to triumph
in the 20th ABC Championship in Fukuoka, Japan, in September.
</P>
<P>
With seven straight wins, China savored the final victory and
took revenge of South Korea, who usurped the title after a semi-
final upset of China in 1997. China missed only two titles in the
past 12 outings in the biennial meet.
</P>
<P>
The surprising defeat years ago cost China a tour to the World
Championship in 1998, and this time China secured the only berth
allotted to Asia for the new millennium Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
It could not be better for the Asian giants to overwrite their
record of history in the world basketball arena as the current
Chinese men's national team is hailed as one of the most talented
and united squad to go for an Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, a 2.14-meter pivot, who was selected by the Dallas
Mavericks this summer, is tagged as the promising first Asian to
play in NBA and he is surely ready to make his statement in the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"All I'm concerned now is to go out for the Sydney Olympics,"
said the 22-year-old center after China shadowed South Korea 63-45
in the final of the ABC Championship on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Jiang Xingquan, who awarded China its best eighth
place in the 1994 World Championship, said, "This team is better
than the 1994 Worlds where I led the team to the eighth place."
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta Olympics, China also finished eighth in the men'
s basketball tournament, the highest placing for the Chinese team,
then coached by Gong Luming.
</P>
<P>
However, their women counterparts have yet to get rid of a
plummeting movement which has been trapping them for more than
three years.
</P>
<P>
The women's national team suffered a string of defeats to South
Korea and Japan and even the Chinese Taipei to finish fourth in
the Asian championship last May, the worst for the team in the
tournament as they once won the Olympic silvers in 1994 and
finished second in the World Championship in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And surely, it could not be any more optimistic as the Chinese
junior men's team finished a disappointing 15th place in the World
Junior Championship in July wherein only sixteen squads had
competed.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Work on expansion of the Xianyang
International Airport outside the major tourist destination of Xi'
an began recently after five years of preparation.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost nearly 1.3 billion yuan, and
will include the construction of a new terminal building with a
total area of 52,000 square meters, a parking lot, and other new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion in 2002, the handling capacity of the airport
will be raised to 7.5 million passengers a year and 130,000 tons
of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Xianyang Airport opened in 1991 with a designed annual capacity
of 2 million passengers. Owing to rapid economic growth in central
and western China in recent years, the airport has now out-grown
its capacity.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the volume of passengers passing through the facility
is expected to increase at an annual rate of between 9-15 percent
over the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils 10-year Plan to Beef up SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 5 Xinhua) -- Singapore has launched a ten-
year national plan to build up the capabilities of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME) and enhance their economic
contribution in the new knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo announced
the SME 21 plan at the opening of a one-day national SME
conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, worked out by the Singapore Productivity and
Standards Board (PSB) and its partners which include both the
public and private sectors and trade unions, aims to help the
development of successful SMEs and to facilitate a process of SME
adjustment to enable them to face the challenge of globalization
</P>
<P>
PSB statistics show that there are more than 100,000 SMEs in
Singapore and they play a dynamic role in the country's economy,
representing over 90 percent of the total establishments,
employing half of the workforce and but only generating 34 percent
of the total value-added.
</P>
<P>
With the SME 21, Singapore hopes to double the productivity of
the retail sector from 28,000 Singapore dollars (about 16,280 U.S.
dollars) per worker to 56,000 Singapore dollars (32,550 U.S.
dollars) in 10 years' time, treble the number of SMEs with annual
sales turnover of 10 million Singapore dollars (about 5.8 million
U.S. dollars) or more from 2,000 now to 6,000 in 2010 and
quadruple the number of SME transacting on e-commerce from about 8,
000 now to 32,000 before the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that multi-national companies (MNC) play an
important role in the city-state, SME 21 underlines the needs to
make Singapore MNC's command and control base for the entire
region and to establish more local entrepreneruship in all sectors,
not just in traditional areas like trading, real estate and
banking, but also in new areas like high-tech manufacturing,
creative services, Internet and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
As part of SME 21, PSB will encourage students in the
polytechnics and universities to be interested in business.
</P>
<P>
Describing the SME sector as his country's "nursery" to produce
world-class local entrepreneurs for the 21st century, George Yeo
in his opening speech encourages individuals to take the
challenges of globalization and engage in SMEs.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air Force Orders 18 Jets from United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Thai Air Force has
ordered 18 used F-16 A/B jets from the United States at a cost of
5 billion baht (135 million U.S. dollars), a source from the air
force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source confirmed a report by Wednesday's Bangkok Post that
the deal would be funded by selling F/A-18 spares worth 35 million
dollars to the U.S., a sum deposited with the Federal Reserve of
the United States under the Foreign Military Sales program and
part of the air force's fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
The air force is now waiting for the approval from the U.S.
Congress, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangkok Post, the United States favored the deal
since the Thai air force has two F-16 squadrons while some
neighboring countries have F/A-18s and MiG-29s.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s are designed to be equipped with advanced medium-
range air-to-air missiles.

<HEADLINE> 1990s Australia's Warmest Decade on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AAP quoted the Bureau of Meteorology of Australia as saying
the country's annual mean temperature last decade was 21.14
degrees Celsius, 0.33 degrees higher than the average between 1961
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
1998, the hottest year on record, scored an average temperature
of 22.54.
</P>
<P>
Bureau spokesman Dean Collins said that this made the 1990s the
warmest decade since at least the 1910s when records of national
averages were consistently maintained,
</P>
<P>
"There had been a gradual rise in temperatures in Australia
since 1910, which was consistent with global trends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists overseas have said the rise is too unusual to be
natural and the green house effect could have had an impact on it.
"
</P>
<P>
Bureau director John Zillman said a statement released by the
World Meteorological Organization on December 1999 showed the
1990s also had the highest global mean temperatures since
instrumental records began in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preliminary data showed Australia's mean temperature
for 1999 was 21.92, making it the 23rd warmest on record.
</P>
<P>
Australia's next warmest decade was the 1980s when temperatures
averaged 0.22 degrees above average, Zillman said.

WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- There were 17 road fatalities
in New Zealand in the Christmas-New Year holiday period, which
ended at Wednesday morning, one of the lowest totals for the
period over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
There were 17 deaths in 1993, but that holiday period was two
days shorter than this year because of the day on which Christmas
fell,according to a media release from the Road Safety New Zealand.

Twenty-four people were killed on the roads during the 1998-99
Christmas-New Year period, and 26 the year before.

Superintendent Neil Gyde, police national road safety manager,
said speed and alcohol remained the major contributing factors to

<HEADLINE> Canada's Taxi Drivers Demand for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 taxi drivers in
Toronto protested in front of the city's police office Tuesday,
demanding safety for the 12,000 cabbies in the country, said the
media reports here.
</P>
<P>
The protest was staged after a series of attacks were reported
on taxi cabbies in the past few weeks, including the killings of
two drivers in Toronto a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
A funeral was held Monday in Toronto for cabbie Mohammadullah
Saighani, whose son-in-law Javid Wali told hundreds of taxi
drivers attending the funeral that "we must stop people from
killing the innocent."
</P>
<P>
Another killing was reported at nearby Brampton, where a driver
was stabbed to death in robbery.
</P>
<P>
Assaults on a cab driver were also reported in Calgary,
Manitoba. In one case, Larry Corbett, who drives for Red Top cabs,
received a gash to his hand Monday night in the fifth assault in a
month.
</P>
<P>
"I got stabbed. I've gotta get stitches," he said as he sat
waiting inside the emergency room of a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police have aggravated assault charges against a Calgary man in
connection with a recent attack. Two other men have been arrested
for the killing of the cabbie in Brampton.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet IPOs Set Record in Market Capitalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- New public Web companies in
the United States rewrote the financial record books in 1999 by
creating 702 billion U.S. dollars in equity value, more than half
of the sector's total market capitalization at the end of the 20th
century, said a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from Paul Kagan Associates Inc., an independent U.S.
business research firm, said that the growth was "powered by
investors' insatiable appetite for Internet stocks and a
stampeding bull market," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kagan's study, the supernova of Web-related
initial public offering (IPO) activity in 1999 -- a total of 309
new issues -- generated 53 percent of the Web sector's combined
stock market value on the eve of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The study shows the average 1999 Web IPO gained 253 percent,
with the highest performer up almost 2,900 percent. At the same
time, 57 of the IPOs traded below their offering prices at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Since the Internet services company American Online went public
in 1992, Kagan tracked 409 Web-related IPOs worth a collective 222
billion dollars at their respective offering prices. At the end of
1999, the group had a combined stock market equity capitalization
of 1.32 trillion dollars, rocketing an average of 497 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another notable phenomenon in 1999 was skyrocketing valuations
of the "dotcoms" going public, which benefited not only from the
rapid run-up in stock prices for incumbent players but from the
record-setting 80 percent leap in the NASDAQ average. The average
1999 dotcom debut had a market capitalization at offer of 644
million dollars, more than doubling the average Internet IPO in
each of the prior four years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Lower Fares in Anticipation of Post-holiday Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. airlines on
Tuesday announced their plans to lower air fares for winter and
spring travel as the carriers looked to fill seats in anticipation
of a post-holiday lull.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines, the world's biggest airline, Tuesday reduced
its fares by up to 30 percent while Continental Airlines, No.5,
and US Airways, No.6, quickly made similar announcements.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of airline discounts was triggered by
Southwest Airlines, the No.4 carrier which last month announced a
coast-to-coast fare of 198 dollars. Trans World Airlines (TWA),
the 8th largest U.S. airline, followed up on Monday when it
announced a 50 percent reduction on the round trip cost on its
Boston-Los Angeles route. TWA also reduced the prices on other
domestic routes and on several of its international routes.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for American Airlines, the No. 2 world airline, Delta
Air Lines Inc., the No.3 U.S. carrier, and U.S. No.4 Northwest
Airlines all said they were matching fare cuts to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The airlines lowered fares for travels from roughly mid-January
to mid-May, requiring booking by January 14 and at least 14 days
ahead of the departure date.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines also added an incentive for customers to book
tickets on its Web site, offering up to 5 percent off and 1,000
bonus miles. First-time online customers will receive an
additional 3,000 bonus miles.
</P>
<P>
US Airways also offered 5 percent off its own domestic and
international sale prices for buyers using its Web site.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Identifies President's Attempted Assassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The female suicide bomber and
attempted assassin against Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has been identified as Leela Lakshmi from the eastern
town of Batticaloa, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old bomber alias Nandini joined the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) about 10 years ago, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) investigators
visited Lakshmi's home at Batticaloa over the weekend and brought
her mother and younger sister to Colombo for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Her younger sister identified Lakshmi when the bomber's head
which was found at the venue of the bombing was shown to her at
the police mortuary in Colombo, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The female bomber had blasted herself in an attempt to
assassinate Kumaratunga at the final presidential election rally
in central Colombo on December 18.
</P>
<P>
At least 24 people were killed and over 100 injured including
President Kumaratunga who has lost her right eye in the suicide
bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the assassination attempt on the LTTE
which has been fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The CID has been questioning police personnel who had been on
duty at the venue. Already 80 of them have been questioned with
about another 100 still to be investigated, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of experts from the United States is
reportedly due in Sri Lanka to help with the investigation into
the suicide bombing.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drug to be Tested in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia plans to test a new
AIDS drug on mothers to combat the transfer of HIV from mother to
child, the Cambodia Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A two-year research program starting next month, will be funded
by the French government and conducted by the French National
Agency for Research on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program, at a cost of around 350,000 U.S.
dollars, is to seek treatment suitable for Southeast Asian HIV
patients.
</P>
<P>
The program includes two studies, one is to use new drug,
Nevirapine, which is so far has only been run in trials in Uganda,
along with AZT, a well-established AIDS drug, on pregnant mothers
and their new-born babies to see if it can halt the spread of the
disease from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
The other study will focus on rare cases of immunity to the HIV
virus among Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian mothers have one of the highest incidences of AIDS/
HIV infections in the region, higher than Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, most mothers do not seek treatment until the final
weeks of their pregnancy, when it is too late for them to take the
anti-viral AZT treatment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Jobless Level Expected to Rise this year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's jobless level this
year will soar to 7.4 percent against last year's 4.09 percent,
Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A committee studying the unemployment situation made this
prediction based on an assumption of the three percent economic
growth this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee studying the joblessness problem is composed of
representatives of the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, the
Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board, the
National Statistical Office, the Bank of Thailand, the Thailand
Development Research Institute and the Office of the National
Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a total workforce of 33.85 million out of a
population of 62.4 million. The number of jobless workers will
rise to about 2.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the surge of unemployment would be mainly
attributed to slow economic recovery and insufficient public and
private investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Thai government allocated 119.3 billion bath (
about 3.14 billion U.S. dollars) to ease the unemployment problem.
The expenditure created 615,000 new jobs as of November last year,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation in 1999 Seen at 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has seen an inflation
rate of 0.3 percent for the whole year of 1999, lower than the
earlier forecast of 0.5 percent to one percent, the Bangkok Post
said Wednesday, citing the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Inflation this year, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
is expected to be between 2.2 percent and 2.5 percent, the
ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The monthly index in December 1999 rose 0.3 percent over a
month earlier, and 0.7 percent from the same month in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, food prices declined 0.9 percent while the non-food
sector rose one percent.
</P>
<P>
Rising costs for utilities and transport would push up the non-
food index this year, while food was expected to be less affected,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation had helped to ease economic problems, keeping
production costs in check and increasing the competitiveness of
export, the Commerce Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, it also reflected the fact that manufacturing plants
were still running at limited capacity due to sluggish demand and
high unemployment, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A government committee forecast that 2.5 million people, or 7.
44 percent, may be jobless in 2000 if measures are not improved to
tackle the problem.

<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The average annual inflation rate
in the Philippines for 1999 slowed down to 6.6 percent from 9.8
percent for 1998, the government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation rate in December also went down to 4.
3 percent from 10.4 percent a year ago, the National Statistics
Office said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The last time that inflation was also lower than 4.3 percent
was that of 4 percent registered in June 1987, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the year-on-year inflation rate in
December of 1999 increased by 0.4 percentage point from 3.9
percent in November of the same year.
</P>
<P>
The rates for services increased to 12.7 percent in December
from 12.3 percent in November; food, beverages and tobacco, 0.6
percent from 0.1 percent; clothing, 4.9 percent from 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
For food alone, the inflation rate went up to 0.2 in December
from-0.1 percent in November due to higher rates in the prices of
rice and miscellaneous foods.
</P>
<P>
For housing and repairs and fuel, light and water, inflation
remained at their corresponding November rates of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the country's month-on-month inflation
rate in December remained at the same rate of 0.1 percent as the
revised record for November.

<HEADLINE> Internet Giant to Buy Controlling Interest of Mavericks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- BoradCast.com cofounder Mark
Cuban reached a preliminary agreement to buy a controlling
interest in the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
Association for a reported 280 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the team, the Hillwood Development
Corporation in the United States, will retain a minority share of
the Mavericks following completion of the proposed transaction.
</P>
<P>
A definitive acquisition agreement has not yet been reached and
any sale is subject to the approval of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal also includes the sale of a portion of
Hillwood's interest in the American Airlines Center, which is
expected to open in the fall of 2001. Hillwood will continue to
lead the development and construction of the facility.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Tuesday's Dallas Morning News, the
sale of the Mavericks "will not affect" the development around the
arena, consisting of office buildings, retailing, residential
units and an entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
Perot's broad-based ownership group purchased 55 percent of the
Mavericks in May 1, 1996 for 125 million U.S. dollars. During his
term as owner, the team has traded superstar Jason Kidd and hired
Don Nelson as general manager.
</P>
<P>
The Mavs have not had a winning season since 1989-90, going 218-
529 since.They are 12th in the Western Conference this season at 9-
21.
</P>
<P>
Despite being one of the league's worst teams, the newspaper
said the team's value has gone from 125 million U.S. dollars to
280 million U.S. dollars in four years. The New Jersey Nets were
sold for an NBA-record 227 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A native of Pittsburgh, Cuban became one of the country's
richest people last year when Yahoo, a California Internet company,
bought the 4-year-old BroadCast.com for about six billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> East ASEAN Growth Area to Be Promoted as Tourist  Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sarawak state
will spearhead efforts to promote the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) as a popular
regional tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Plans to gazette the region for the "Visit BIMP-EAGA 2001"
program is one of the strategies to boost cooperation among the
four member countries, the State's Tourism Ministry Assistant
Secretary Indit Bangai said Wednesday in an interview with Bernama
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The four countries started regional cooperation in 1996
following the setting up of the BIMP-EAGA joint working group on
tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The official said that visitors from the BIMP-EAGA region
continued to contribute substantially to the tourism industry in
Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
"In short the BIMP-EAGA is important to Sarawak, contributing
79.7 percent of the 1.05 million foreign arrivals in the first
nine months of last year," he said, elaborating that during that
period, the state received 622,264 visitors from Brunei, followed
by 189,975 from Indonesia and 26,975 from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1998 Sarawak also recorded the highest number
of visitors from the BIMP-EAGA which accounted for 80.1 percent of
the 1.38 million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Given that the tourism industry is one of the key growth
sectors, the official said Sarawak is now expected to play a
bigger role to ensure that tourism products and services are of
sufficient standards to meet the expectations of visitors to the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is working closely with its partners in
the BIMP-EAGA, especially to coordinate efforts to sell tourism
products.
</P>
<P>
The ministry through the Sarawak Tourism Board works very
closely with Sabah (East Malaysia) and Brunei and has come up with
a special package to sell Borneo, the world's third largest island,
as a single destination for Culture, Adventure and Nature, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a project being jointly implemented by the Sabah state
and Indonesian governments at Singalaki in East Kalimantan to
promote diving activities served as a test case for regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway for similar ventures in other BIMP-EAGA sub-
regions like Irian Jaya and Sulawesi in Indonesia and Mindanao and
Palawan in the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the working group on tourism development was scheduled
to meet in Brunei this April for the Strategic Tourism Planning
Workshop to discuss various matters on tourism in the BIMP-EAGA
area.
</P>
<P>
With rich tourism resources in the region, the official
expressed his optimism of the region's great tourism prospects,
Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia to Sue NATO for Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
brought on Tuesday another accusation to the International Court
of Justice in the Hague against the U.S.-led NATO for its crime of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry asked the court to declare that
the air strikes against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO last
spring violate the norms of international law, and the NATO member
countries must bear the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
It said that after the end of the bombing, the countries
continue to support the ethnic Albanians to kill other ethnic
citizens in Kosovo. Their actions violate the 1244 resolution of
the U.N. Security Council and the international convention banning
racial cleansing.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade asks the court to order NATO to compensate all the
resulting damages that Yugoslavia suffered, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had brought a charge with the International Court
against NATO on April 29, 1999 for its air strikes against it,
appealing to stop and investigate NATO's crime of invasion.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, there are now 500 Sino-
Myanmar couples in Ruili which is famous for its Naxi Dongba
Culture and pictographic characters.
</P>
<P>
The increase in cross-border marriage is attributed to the
country's opening-up policies and the frequent business contacts
between the two neighboring countries, local social analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, many Myanmar people have been
coming to Ruili for shopping, sightseeing, and doing business for
the past 10 years, providing good opportunities for young people
from both sides to nurture love.
</P>
<P>
Shuai Enhuang, a farmer from a village in Ruili, said he was
extremely happy to see his youngest son marry a pretty Myanmar
girl, as did his three elder brothers.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Shuai used to live a very poor life, but became
well-off after contracting a farm and planting winter fruits and
vegetables. He then replaced his shabby bamboo hut with a well-
furnished home, attracting four Myanmar girls to marry his four
sons.

The state and private sector organizations started the first

According to him, the center received 1,693 phone calls between

Some callers misunderstood that their problems were Y2K-related
as some bank clients had found they could not withdraw money from

<HEADLINE> Venture Capital Funding in U.S. Record High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The money pouring into U.S.
venture capital funds in 1999 surged 87 percent to 36 billion U.S.
dollars, rocketing past the previous year's record of 19 billion
dollars, said a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These figures represent the amount of money that venture
capitalists themselves have raised in order to finance start-up
companies, said the report from Asset Alternatives, a U.S. leading
information services provider for the private equity industry.
</P>
<P>
"Wealthy families and institutional investors, such as pension
funds and university endowments, are stepping up their investments
in venture capital because of the high returns such investments
have generated in recent years," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the report added, Internet-related investments
have been extremely lucrative, often generating annual returns for
their investors in excess of 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalists in California, home of Silicon Valley, led
the states in the amount of money they raised for new investments
with 18.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new capital pouring into these funds means that
entrepreneurs and young companies will continue to be well-funded
in the new year, the report said. The record setting year in
venture capital also helped nudge the entire private equity
industry into a record-setting year. A record 96 billion dollars
in funding was raised in 1999, besting 1998's record by 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, venture capital is the main source of
equity invested in rapidly growing companies with high growth
potential. The capital invested in start-ups originates from
private and public pension funds, endowment funds, foundations,
corporations, wealthy individuals, foreign investors and the
venture capitalists themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to VentureOne, a leading provider of information and
analysis for the U.S. venture capital industry, a total of 21
billion dollars of venture capital were invested in the first
three quarters of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Campaign Launched in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden, the forerunner in the
world in helping smokers quit the unhealthy habit, has launched a
fresh anti-smoking campaign nationwide since the start of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Cancer Foundation, the Health Institute and the Non-
Smoking Network Committee are the driving forces of the campaign,
which was designed to create a friendly environment to assist
those smokers intending to get rid of their long-time habit.
</P>
<P>
The organizers quoted an official survey made at the end of
last year as revealing that 400,000 smokers in the country are
planning to stop smoking in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more smokers quitted smoking in
Sweden, where about 8,000 people die of smoking-related diseases
every year.
</P>
<P>
The number of inhalers dived below 20 percent of the country's
adult population in 1998, two years ahead of the World Health
Organization's goal that in 2000 smokers should be 20 percent
below the adult population of each country.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the first country to reach the WHO goal.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis is to defend his
first undisputed heavyweight title against Michael Grant in
Madison Square Garden in April, according to a spokesman for Lewis
's U.S. promoter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They're talking as we speak and hopefully they can wrap the
deal up as soon as possible," said Main Events spokesman Donald
Tremblay. "Both sides are eager for the fight to be made."
</P>
<P>
Tremblay said Main Events and Lewis's British-based promoter
Panix Promotions are negotiating with HBO's pay-per-view arm TVKO
for the April 29 fight.
</P>
<P>
One source close to the talks said the American would receive 3-
4 million U.S. dollars and Lewis would get 10 million U.S.
dollars for his first fight since becoming undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
The Briton took his current title by beating Evander Holyfield
on a unanimous decision last November.
</P>
<P>
Lewis (35-1-1) would return to Madison Square Garden after his
controversial draw there with Holyfield on March 13, a bout

At 1.98 meters (6.6 feet) Lewis will be shorter than the 2.01
meters (6.7 feet) Grant, who is 31-0.

MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Gloria
Arroyo has predicted a positive economic outlook for the country
with growth rates zooming to unprecedented levels, the nation's
leading newspaper Manila Bulletin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Tuesdy, she said, "We will
grow. It will be a positive growth rate but how much is still the
debate between government officials ad the business sector."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the country's economic managers are
seeing a four percent growth rate within the year.
</P>
<P>
"That's the goal we must all strive for and so it's very
important that we undertake the appropriate policies that will let
us have that and one of the most important is to be able to bridge
the gap of the budget deficit," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She added that when this is done, any further increase in
interest rates will be clipped.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said one of the accomplishments of the previous year was
the lowering of interest rates and underscored the need to keep
these down.
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep them down in order to be able to reach four
percent. But you cannot keep it down artificially. You have to
bring it down by market forces and a big budget deficit
contradicts that market force," she added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Three asset management companies
(AMCs), Huarong, Cinda and Orient, have recently signed a
framework agreement on debt-to-equity with Capital Iron and Steel
Company (CISC), one of China's largest steel and iron producer.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, worth 3.55 billion yuan (428 million U.S.
dollars), is aimed at reducing CISC's debts, accelerating its
technical renovation, and increasing the competitiveness of its
products.
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the development of the steel giant has been
troubled by heavy debts, employee redundancy, and bloated size.
The multinational company also manages mining, mechanics,
electronics, construction, and navigation industries and engages
in international trade.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement, signed in Beijing on December 30,
1999, will help CISC minimize financial risk, according to
economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
The three AMCs will soon evaluate CISC's assets and accounting,
and consult on the restructuring of the company's assets,
management system, and equity transfer. Following that, they will
deliver a report to relevant higher authorities before the
agreement is implemented.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Make 600-kw Wind-Power Generating Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
URUMQI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A company based in northwest China
's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been able to manufacture
600-kilowatt wind-power generating units which incorporate the
country's highest technology level.
</P>
<P>
China's wind power has developed vigorously in recent years,
and by the end of 1998 the installed capacity of wind power had
risen to 230,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, most of China's wind-power generating units
were imported, a factor hindering the expansion of wind power,
since foreign equipment and after-sales maintenance were costly.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Wind Energy Company started researching the
production of large wind-power generating units in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a group of scientists entrusted by the Ministry of
Science and Technology evaluated the generating units designed by
the company and expressed satisfaction with the equipment's
performance.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the units are equal to imported ones and
should be widely introduced throughout China.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Hospitalized with High Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer
great Diego Maradona was hospitalized Tuesday following
complications from high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat in
Punta Del Este, a South American beach resort in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Correa, director of the Cantegril Hospital, said
Maradona was placed in intensive care Tuesday afternoon, but he
was showing of signs of improvement that should not require a
prolonged hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
"He is progressing favorably and if no complications arise, we
anticipate only a brief stay," Correa said at a packed hospital
news conference. Nonetheless, doctors declined to give specifics
of what had triggered Maradona's emergency care.
</P>
<P>
Maradona has had a history of drug problems, but Correa refused
to answer a barrage of questions from local reporters as to
whether other factors might have prompted his hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
In Buenos Aires, the soccer star's manager, Guillermo Coppola,
emphatically said drugs had played no part in the hospitalization.
"Drugs had nothing to do with this," said Coppola, quoted by
Diarios y Noticias, an Argentine news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said Maradona drove himself to the clinic.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former star, who single-handedly carried
Argentina to the World Cup championship in Mexico in 1996, was
vacationing in Punta del Este, a popular summer vacation haunt for
South American stars, models, and actors.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Torres, who treated Maradona, declined to give
specifics of what had caused the hypertension and other problems.
But none of the doctors revealed the specifics of Maradona's
treatment.

QINGDAO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Port of Qingdao in east
China's Shandong Province handled more than 1.5 million TEUs (
twenty-feet equivalent unit) of containers in 1999, making it the
largest container transfer port on China's mainland.
</P>

an annual rate of about 30 percent in the past few years, with the
capacity standing at only 80,000 TEUs a decade ago, port
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The increase is attributed to the upgrading of berths and the
use of advanced loading and unloading facilities. Now the port's
deep-water berth can accommodate 5,250-TEU container vessels.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Port of Qingdao has more than 30 international

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of drownings in
New Zealand last year was the lowest since records began in 1980,
New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 116 people drowned, 80 percent of them male, NZPA
quoted Water Safety New Zealand as saying.
</P>
<P>
The previous low was 130 in 1992, and the highest toll 214 in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Water Safety NZ Executive Director Alan Muir was quoted as
saying the deduction could be attributed to water safety education
and community promotions during the last few years.
</P>
<P>
"This result is excellent, but there is definitely room for
improvement when we consider that New Zealand still has one of the
highest drowning tolls in the Western world," he said.
