<HEADLINE> Indonesia Disapproves of U.N. Plan to Send Mission to Atambua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Tuesday expressed disapproval of a United Nations Security Council
plan to send a mission to Atambua in West Timor to investigate the
killing of three U.N. relief workers in a riot last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said here the U.N. decision was
to be regretted as it was made while the Indonesian government was
trying to respond positively to a council resolution calling for
the disarming and disbanding of East Timorese militias in West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press following a limited cabinet meeting,
Susilo said in the Indonesian government's view, sending a U.N.
mission to Atambua was "incorrect".
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope we can be trusted to conduct our own
investigation and to handle the problems related to the refugees
or militias in East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would still make some diplomatic
representations regarding the matter (sending of a U.N. mission to
Atambua) with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government was taking measures not only to
settle matters arising from last Wednesday's mob attack on the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
representative office in Atambua, including the slaying of three U.
N. staffers, but also the East Timorese refugee and militia
problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Mahfud M.D. said the cabinet will
refuse to meet a planned U.N. Security Council delegation over
last week's murder of U.N. staffers in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the cabinet will reject the mission from the U.
N. because we will settle (the incident) internally first," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have measures. We are a sovereign country, which cannot
accept intervention like that, including from the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Mahfud said he would still meet U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who is expected to raise the killings when he visits
Jakarta next week.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the U.N. mission is set to arrive in Jakarta next
week.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Belgium to Soar This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's federal planning
office Tuesday predicted that the country's annual inflation will
increase to 2.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
This increment will be much higher than the European Union's (
EU) maximum level of 2 percent for healthy indicator in the 11-
nation euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The so-called economic health indexes, which is used to
calculate wage, benefit and rent rises, was originally set at 1.8
percent, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The pressure of high oil prices and the weak euro caused
inflation to rise to nearly 2.9 percent in August, the highest
level in the last nine years, said the federal planning office.
</P>
<P>
Big increases in fuel prices have greatly affected the
development of business and industries across Europe. The main
reason for the soaring prices is the hiking of the world price of
crude oil from about 24 U.S. dollars per barrel at the beginning
of this year to 32 dollars today.
</P>
<P>
Now, the price has surged to a 10-year high at the level of 35
dollars a barrel, while the euro, EU's single currency, hit the
record low to the level of 0.85 dollars.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister's Office denied on Tuesday
the reports that Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to compromise
over the sovereignty on Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Ha'aretz reported on Tuesday that Israel is not
ruling out the possibility of acceding to a proposal by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to place sovereignty over the Temple Mount in
the hands of an international joint body.
</P>
<P>
The joint body will consist of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council and the Jerusalem Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference. (Israel-Barak-Denial)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli public opinion on Jerusalem has changed

The survey conducted by the Smith Institute, a long-established
polling company in Israel, last week among 501 adult Jewish

polled, understands that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian

Barak, who was just back from his one-week trip to the United

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Outlines New Coalition Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak unveiled his plans for rebuilding his coalition in a meeting
with his ruling One Israel cabinet ministers and Knesset
(parliament) members on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was just back from his one-week trip to the United
Nations, said he would try to forge a minority government which
controls 60 seats in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new government could include the 25-seat One Israel, the 10-
seat left-wing Meretz Party, the six-seat Center Party, the six-
seat pro-secular Shinui Party, Bronfman's two-man faction and the
one-seat One Nation Party, with the support of 10 Arab members of
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Barak could then decide whether to invite the right-wing
opposition Likud and former Interior Minister Natan Sharansky's
immigrant party, Yisrael Ba'aliya, to join the government, based on
the outcome of the peace talks with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
If there is a deal, Barak will apparently go for a referendum or
an early election.
</P>
<P>
The shaky prime minister told his party colleagues he had few
differences with Shinui, Meretz, the Likud and Yisrael Ba'aliya on
social issues he would like to focus on in case the peace talks
with Palestinians reach an dead end.
</P>
<P>
He called these parties "natural ruling partners."
</P>
<P>
However, Barak had earlier said that as long as the peace talks
are going on, he would not approach the Likud for the formation of
a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
If it turns out that a peace agreement is out of the question,
Barak would then turn to the "natural coalition partners" so as to
implement his "social agenda," which would allow civil marriages,
national service for all and bus services in certain areas on
Sabbath to cater to the needs of carless poor secular population.
</P>
<P>
Barak refrained from saying how long he would wait for the peace
talks to run their course, although he had noted that time was
clearly limited to the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Likud leader Ariel Sharon again rejected Barak's
idea of forming a unity government, saying that the only thing he
wanted to talk with Barak was the date for an early election.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been weighing options since Camp David summit to
reshuffle his collapsing government which was reduced to only 40
seats in the parliament due to defections of former ruling partners
protesting his peace polices.
</P>
<P>
He will not make a final decision until the peace talks with
Palestinians, stalled since Camp David summit mainly over the issue
of Jerusalem, take a clear direction, either toward a peace deal or
toward an dead end.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Palestinians pledged to exhaust the possibility
of reaching a deal in the next four to five weeks, after the
Palestinians decided to delay declaration of statehood originally
set for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Calls for Opportunity, Employment, Security for Poor People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has called on
the governments of developing countries, donors and international
agencies to provide poor people with opportunity, employment and
security, according to a news release available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest World Development Report 2000/2001, the World
Bank called to expand economic opportunity for the poor by
stimulating economic growth, making markets work better for them
and working for their inclusion, particularly by building up their
assets, such as land and education.
</P>
<P>
It also called to strengthen the ability of poor people to
shape decision that affect their lives and remove discrimination
based on gender, race, ethnicity and social status.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to reduce poor people's vulnerability to
sickness, economic shocks, crop failure, unemployment, natural
disasters and violence and help them cope when such misfortunes
occur, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at a time of unprecedented wealth for
many countries, 2.8 billion people -- almost half of the world's
population-- live on less than two U.S. dollars a day, and of
these, 1.2 billion live on less than one dollar.
</P>
<P>
In high-income countries, fewer than one child of 100 dies
before reaching the age of five; while in the poorest countries
the number is five times higher, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that in well-off countries, fewer than 5 percent of
children under the age of five are malnourished while in poorer
countries as many as 50 percent of the children suffer from eating
too little food.
</P>
<P>
The average income in the richest 20 countries is 37 times the
average in the poorest 20 countries--a gap that has doubled in the
past 40 years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On global initiatives to reduce poverty, the report said action
at national and local levels will often not be enough for rapid
poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
There are many areas that require international action,
especially by high-income countries to improve the prospects for
poor countries and their people, the report said, stressing that
an increased focus on debt relief and making development aid more
effective are part of the story.

<HEADLINE> S. African Tripartite Alliance Reaffirms Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
tripartite alliance Tuesday said they had strengthened their
united front after emerging from a "mini-summit" to patch up their
differences over economic and social policies.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting was aimed to make the leadership of the ruling
African National Congress (ANC), South African Communist Party and
the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) "interact more
dynamically", said ANC secretary general Kgalema Motlanthe at a
news briefing in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Cosatu secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi said
the gap over the issue between the ANC-led government and Cosatu
has been narrowed and "I feel very good about the progress we
achieved."
</P>
<P>
A task team has been formed following the meeting to examine
differences on proposed labor law amendments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the disagreement on HIV/AIDS policies would be
discussed by the parties at a later stage, an ANC spokesman said
they would discuss the issue in more details in October.

JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of
South Africa Tuesday adopted an Adult Basic Education Bill to
provide for the establishment of public learning centers around
the country, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the measure, South African Deputy Education
Minister Smangaliso Mkhatshwa said "the low skills profile of our
people stifles economic progress, since successful economies
require citizens with high education skills."
</P>
<P>
He said the level of illiteracy in the country has resulted
from the "inhumane and oppressive" system of the previous
government and the government is trying to uplift the lives of
millions.
</P>
<P>
At the function, South African education portfolio committee
chairman Shepherd Mayatula said as a product of night schools
himself, he supports the bill as being in line with every
individual's constitutional right to education.
</P>
<P>
Pan Africanist Congress leader Stanley Mogoba suggested that
the government should spend more money on the program by offering
attractive subsidies to encourage participation of private
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Agrees to OPEC Oil Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has agreed to the oil
output hike decision made by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to "keep the integrity" of the oil
cartel, a senior Iraqi oil official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the evening, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid said Iraq wants "integrity of OPEC, stable oil
prices and stable revenues."
</P>
<P>
This marked a major shift of position by the Iraqi government,
which had always opposed any oil output increase by OPEC of which
Iraq is a member.
</P>
<P>
However, Rashid said Iraq does not think that there is a
shortage of oil supply in the world oil market, and the current oil
supply exceeds demand by some 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's argument was echoed by several other OPEC members, Rashid
said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC oil ministerial meeting held in Vienna last Sunday
decided to raise output by 800,000 barrels to a total of 26.2
million barrels a day to push down the surging oil prices. This
excludes the oil output of Iraq, which is under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Rashid blamed the current record-high oil prices on the heavy
taxes on fuel levied by the United States and other Western
governments.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked the U.S. and British members at the United
Nations Sanctions Committee for having been "intentionally" put on
hold oil contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries, which he
said is the cause that Iraq has so far been unable to achieve the
target of producing 3.4 million barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has to wait until next March to reach the production level,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq now
produces around 3 million barrels of oil a day, of which 2.3
million barrels for exports, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord allows it to sell oil
in return for food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies under
strict U.N. control.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Resume Civil Flights to Iraq Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to resume
regular civil flights between Moscow and Baghdad next month, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bafel Briadko, regional director of Russian Airways, told INA
that Russian President Vladimir Putin made the decision after his
meeting with visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in
July.
</P>
<P>
Russia decided to resume civil flights to and from Iraq because
there is no explicit United Nations resolutions banning such
flights, Briadko said.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi delegation is expected to visit Moscow later this month
to make the final preparations for this purpose, and Russian
Airways will soon open an office in the Iraqi capital, Briadko
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia is making contacts with relevant countries
to grant permission to Russian planes to fly to Iraq through their
airspaces.
</P>
<P>
A Russian plane arrived at the newly-reopened Saddam
International Airport on August 19 on a humanitarian mission to the
sanctions-stricken country. This was the first direct flight from
Moscow to Baghdad since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Russian Deputy Minister of Civil Defense and
Emergency Situations Ruslan Tsalikov told reporters that his
country did not ask for permission from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee, but just "notified" it.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a key ally of Iraq, has been calling for an early
lifting of the U.N. sanctions which was imposed on Iraq for its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
There has been disagreement over how the U.N. sanctions apply to
passenger flights. Until recently, the practice has been that all
those wishing to fly to Iraq must inform the U.N. Sanctions
Committee in advance.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, disagreement over whether the authorization
is actually necessary. The U.S. and Britain say that it is, while
Russia and France say it is not.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Iraq rejects any interpretation of the U.N.
sanctions as implying an air embargo.

Jerusalem, which both the Palestinians and Israel claim as their
capital, was the deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
Under international pressure and appeals to proceed with the
peace process, Palestinian leadership agreed Sunday to delay
statehood declaration that had been scheduled for September 13, and
have negotiations with Israel for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian negotiating committee is meeting in
the West Bank town of Ramallah to prepare for the coming talks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel Radio reported that the talks
will be held in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Peace Supporters Mark 7th Anniversary of Oslo Accords in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 pro-peace
Israelis took to the street in Jerusalem Wednesday evening to mark
the seventh anniversary of the Oslo peace accords and express their
support for a peaceful settlement of the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Organized by Israel's peace group Peace Now, the people marched
for about one hour along the Green Line in the city, and then
gathered at the Jaffa Gate of the Old City to call on Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to speed up negotiations with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to settle the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem, seized by Israel
in 1967, as the capital of their future state while Israel insists
the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided" capital. The
future of Jerusalem aborted the Camp David peace talks in July.
</P>
<P>
"The Green Line was the ceasefire line of the 1967 Middle East
War and the reason for us to march along this line is to show the
whole world that we support two capitals for two states," one
organizer told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Many demonstrators were seen holding posters and placards,
reading "In Jerusalem, the conflict shall come to an end," "Two
capitals in one city."
</P>
<P>
"This evening, we shall march towards the end of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict by calling on Barak and Arafat that it is
possible to reach an agreement on Jerusalem and we must not give up
peace," Peace Now said in a message to the marchers.
</P>
<P>
At the Jaffa Gate, one organizer read out a statement issued by
former Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, who called on Barak and Arafat
to show compromise while negotiating the settlement of the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
"Israelis and Palestinians can eventually live side by side in
Jerusalem and it is time for both Barak and Arafat to complete the
peace talks and reach an agreement on the Jerusalem issue for the
sake of the future generations," Kollek said.
</P>
<P>
On September 13, 1993, Israel and the Palestinians signed their
first peace agreement, the Oslo Accord, in Washington, which called
on both sides to settle settle such key issues as the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and
water, during a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Despite some progress, no final peace agreement has been
concluded as a handful of deadlines had been missed.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official announced Wednesday the peace
talks with Israel will resume Thursday in New York after a hiatus
of over six weeks. The talks were initially decided to continue for
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Technically I do not know how to divide the sovereignty of
Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians, but it will be
dangerous if the whole city is put under Israeli control," John
Katz from Tel Aviv University told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"One city, two capitals, are the best solution to the Jerusalem
issue and Israel can solve it with the Palestinians through
negotiations," he added. Jerusalem contains holy sites to Jews,
Christians and Muslims.

ADDIS ABABA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Traffic authorities in
Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa Wednesday vowed to take stricter

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers
of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council Wednesday pledged to improve the peacekeeping capacity of
the United Nations, including its financing.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the foreign ministers met with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are: Tang Jiaxuan, minister for foreign
affairs of China; Hubert Vedrine, minister for foreign affairs of
France; Igor Ivanon, minister for foreign affairs of Russia; Robin
Cook, secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs of
Britain; and Madeleine Albright, secretary of state of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In a communique to the press, they said the Millennium Summit,
which was held here on September 6-8, was an important milestone
in the history of the United Nations, and helped increase the
awareness of the new challenges confronting the world today and
identify ways to strengthen the role and the ability of the United
Nations to meet them.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers recalled the determination expressed by
the heads of state and government during their meeting on
September 7, 2000 to reinforce the cooperation among the five
permanent members.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to ensure a concrete follow-up to the attached
declaration which was adopted at the level of heads of state and
government as a guide to ensuring an effective role for the
Security Council in fulfilling its primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the report by a U.N. panel on peacekeeping and
expressed the intention to work closely with all U.N. member
states, in particular in the Security Council, to ensure that the
recommendations made by this panel were thoroughly considered and
implemented as appropriate.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Encourage Dialogues on Human Rights, China Says EDS-Rpt with correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign
minister, took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which kicked off here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"In providing humanitarian assistance, the U.N. should give
equal priority to the prevention of conflicts and the protection
of human rights on the one hand and the reduction and elimination
of poverty and the promotion of human development on the other
hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the U.N. should work in close coordination
and cooperation with the governments concerned, instead of
bypassing them, and ensure human rights to the majority of the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, such operations would trigger a humanitarian
disaster of a greater scale," he said. "Only when the above-
mentioned principles are abided by, can the U.N. play a useful
role in protecting human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Human rights improvement is an endless process," he said. "The
human rights conditions of a country are up to the people of that
country to assess and improve."
</P>
<P>
"All people live in a specific environment," he said. "The form
in which human rights are embodied changes with time and
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, how to protect and promote human rights depends on
the actual conditions and specific needs of a country," he said. "
To arbitrarily impose a fixed set of human rights rules regardless
of the differences in the specific environment and reality will
not serve the interests of the people of any country."
</P>
<P>
"To interfere in other countries' internal affairs in the name
of protecting human rights in order to advance one's own political
agenda is simply a blasphemy and betrayal of the human rights
cause," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Australian Decision for Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)'s Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy said Wednesday that Australia's recent
decision on lifting of curbs over media coverage in Sydney Olympic
Games is fair.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fair decision by the Australian authorities, which
opens up access to media coverage of the Olympic Games on a non-
discriminatory basis," Lamy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australia's Olympic authorities lifted their planned
curbs on Olympic Games media coverage. As a result, foreign
television news agencies, including Reuters and the Associated
Press, will be entitled to permanent passes that would not have
been issued under Sydney's original plans, said the European
Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Olympic Games in Sydney had originally
planned to ban access for foreign media that had not bought
exclusive rights to transmit the events.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Lamy made representations to the Australian
authorities to warn them that the plan threatened to cause a
dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO), given that
Australia did not appear to be in line with its commitments under
the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).
</P>
<P>
The United States also lodged a similar complaint with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise struck last week, the Olympic Coordination
Authority (OCA) issued official guidelines, under which a number
of passes will be granted to non-rights holders.
</P>
<P>
Now, international non-rights holders will be granted passes in
a daily ballot. While permanent passes will be granted to Reuters,
the Associated Press and CNN International, all of which act as
television agencies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Thompson Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on
Wednesday rejected an amendment attaching weapons proliferation
sanctions to a bill normalizing trade with China, clearing the way
for final passage of the bill to grant permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 65-32 to reject the amendment, proposed by
Republican Senator Fred Thompson and Democratic Senator Robert
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
The amendment demanded the U.S. government to impose sanctions
on foreign companies and nations that are involved in weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Senate also rejected three other amendments
trying to link PNTR bill with prison labor, human rights and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Thompson amendment, considered to be the major and final
hurdle to the passage of the PNTR bill in the Senate, met strong
opposition from most Senators, the Clinton administration and the
Business community eager to do business with China.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said the amendment's defeat puts the PNTR bill on
fast-track to final approval later this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
"This clears the deck. It was the last hurdle," said Democratic
Senator Max Baucus of Montana.
</P>
<P>
"It would hurt America more than it would punish China," said
Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware described the
Thompson amendment as a "serious foreign policy mistake."

<HEADLINE> British PM Says Won't Give in to Fuel Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Wednesday that he would not give in to protests
against high fuel prices even though they were posing "real danger
" to the nation's health services.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that a picket at a refinery gate can determine
whether hospitals or ambulance services or public transport
qualify as essential services or not is an affront," Blair told a
news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would not be "intimidated or give in to
blackmail," adding that over 500 tankers had left oil depots and
terminals around the country after having blocked for several days.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the country was still a "considerable
distance" from returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
Truckers and farmers in Britain have been picketing oil
refineries and depots for six days, causing widespread disruption
at schools, hospitals and other public services, in an attempt to
force the government to cut down the fuel prices, almost the
highest in Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
The authorization, granted several days late, restricted the
movement of the Cuban legislators to a radius of no more than 40
kilometers, taking as the point of reference the White House.
</P>
<P>
The visas were delivered Wednesday at midday, local time, to
the six Cuban deputies, so they miss two whole sessions of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The visas exclude the main Cuban guest, National Assembly (
parliament) President Ricardo Alarcon, who is in New York after
taking part in the U.N. Millennium Summit on September 6-8.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said on Tuesday that the United States violated the
principle of sovereign equality between the U.N. member states
when it denied the visas for the travel to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said he had foreseen to analyze with the black U.S.
legislators the implementation of an education cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
The target was to give continuity to the proposal of granting
scholarships to poor young U.S. citizens to study medicine in Cuba,
at the request of the black legislators who visited the island two
months ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Cuba is capable of receiving 250 Afro-
American young people to study medicine free of charge, as well as
a similar number of Latin Americans and other minorities living in
the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Trade Tax Breaks Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives, in a bid to avert a trade war with the European
Union (EU), approved Wednesday legislation that would enact new
tax breaks for U.S. companies to replace a system ruled as illegal
export subsidy by the World Trade Organization (WTO) earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 315 to 109, the House sent the bill to the Senate,
which is expected to follow suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the Clinton administration, U.S. Congress intends to
pass the bill before an October 1 deadline set by the WTO, which
invalidated the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation tax rules after
they were challenged by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The WTO set the deadline to give the United States time to
enact a replacement law without retaliatory tariffs from the EU.
European officials contend that this new system is also illegal,
but U.S. officials said they would press ahead to prevent tariffs
or sanctions on up to 40 billion U.S. dollars in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstadt said the bill
represents "the only way in which we can avoid the potential for
an immediate conflict with the EU, with the possibility of
significant retaliation on their part."
</P>
<P>
Created to offset an EU tax rebate for its exporters, the
Foreign Sales Corporation program permits U.S. companies to reduce
income taxes by 15 percent through export subsidiaries set up in
offshore tax havens such as Barbados and the Virgin Islands.
Microsoft, Boeing and General Motors are only a few of the 6,000
companies, with 4.8 million workers, that get the 4.1-billion-
dollar annual tax break.
</P>
<P>
The replacement legislation, costing the government roughly the
same amount each year, would set up new tax breaks that apply
equally to exports by U.S. companies and the products they make
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruling against the previous rules centered on their
nature as special exceptions in tax law. Efforts to reach a
diplomatic solution failed.

NICOSIA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government Wednesday
formally sold the state-run Cyprus Tourism Development Company Ltd.
(CTDC), the island's largest tourism organization, to the private
Louis Tourist Agency Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The state holds 81.33 percent of shares in the CTDC, which owns
and operates the Cyprus Hilton hotel, located in Nicosia, since the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Minister of Finance Takis Clerides and Louis Tourist
Agency Ltd. Executive Chairman Costakis Loizou signed here
Wednesday the documents on transferring CTDC's 2.44 million shares
valued at 22.7 million Cyprus pounds (36.3 million U.S. dollars) to
Louis.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said after signing the documents that the sell-off is
part of the government's effort to focus on those services
promoting the social role of the state.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis, who
was also present at the signing ceremony, said "the business role
of the state has been concluded."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Loizou reassured that the new owners of the hotel
will make utmost efforts to improve its profitability, noting they
have already prepared their plans.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the CTDC was de-listed from the Cyprus
Stock Exchange (CSE) earlier this year, because it failed to meet
CSE criteria governing ownership by the public set at a minimum 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hilton hotel is one of the three biggest hotels in Cyprus
capital Nicosia.

CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- An EgyptAir plane was forced to
return to Cairo International Airport on Wednesday shortly after
take-off because of malfunction in the undercarriage gear.
</P>

The pilot of the Airbus 320, bound for the Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria and then Kuwait, spotted a snag in the landing
gear 20 minutes after take-off, the state-run Middle East News

<HEADLINE> Oman Donates 11 Million U.S. Dollars to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) - Oman donated 11 million U.S.
dollars to south Lebanon for its reconstruction after Israel ended
its 22-year occupation and withdrew in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Omani Finance Minister Ahmed Macki told Lebanese Trade and
Economy Minister Nasser Saidi about the donation at their meeting
Wednesday in Damascus on the sidelines of the conference of Arab
Economic and Social Committee, the National News Agency (NNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Saidi expressed his country's thanks to Macki for "this
fraternal and generous offer." "We know that our Omani brothers
always stand with us, especially when we were suffered Israel's
occupation. Your country has given us much help in political and
economical fields," Saidi said.
</P>
<P>
Saidi stressed the importance of the donation for south
Lebanon's reconstruction. "It is a big step in the reconstruction
work," he said. The minister also urged Arab community to help
Lebanon realize the aim.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed bilateral economical and
commercial cooperation and some issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has implored 260 million dollars from Arab countries and
international community for the social and economic work in south
Lebanon by holding a "donator conference" in late October.
</P>
<P>
But many potential European donators hinted that they prefer to
give money to a new government, which will be formed in late
November.
</P>
<P>
Ex-premier Rafik Hariri and his allies made a strong comeback
early this month, winning a resounding victory in the parliamentary
elections. Hariri, the construction tycoon, will be most likely to
be named the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
So far, Lebanon has received some 400 million dollars in grant
for its reconstructing work in the south, most from Gulf states.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges OPEC Members to Observe Output Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday urged members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to observe
their output quotas following their agreement to raising the
cartel's output ceiling.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members, especially the major producers, must observe their
oil production quotas as set by their collective agreement, Iranian
Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh Zanganeh said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers agreed at their Vienna meeting on Sunday to
raise their daily oil output by 800,000 barrels. The current
ceiling yield is 25.4 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this year that the oil cartel had decided
to raise output to tame the runaway oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh pointed out that certain OPEC members had in August
produced more oil than their quotas, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Violation of the decisions reached by all members will neither
be to the benefit of the offending country nor the other members,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in case of continued hike in oil prices, OPEC will
produce as much oil as it can, in line with its strategies, so as
to bring the prices to the level it favors.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OPEC members are to meet again on November 12
to assess the oil market and increase output if necessary.
</P>
<P>
As to the effect of higher oil prices on Iran's foreign exchange
revenues, the minister said that high prices have led to high oil
revenues. Iran earned an extra of 4 billion U.S. dollars in the
first half of the current Iranian year starting March 20 and the
figure is expected to reach 10 billion dollars by March 2001, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the upward trend in oil prices would slow down
from 2001 following the U.S. presidential elections and the drop
oil consumption as spring sets in.

<HEADLINE> Food Policy be Directed to Disadvantaged: WFP Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Food production in Bangladesh
has increased but there are still about 30 million people without
adequate access to food, observed Werner Kiene, country director
of World Food Program (WFP) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The policy focus for improving food access in Bangladesh must
be directed to these 30 million people," he told a seminar
organized by Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad (Bangladesh Development
Committee), a local think tank.
</P>
<P>
Presenting detail data on food production, poverty and food
access at the seminar, the WFP official stressed the need for a
comprehensive policy framework of poverty alleviation and
development to ensure access to food for all.
</P>
<P>
He said the WFP has been active in helping Bangladesh in the
food sector, aiming to increase both availability and access since
her independence. It is now focusing more on a development-
oriented strategy while helping the poor to have access to food,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The WFP will give Bangladesh 200 million U.S. dollars as food
aid in five years for different programs from 2001, Wemer said,
noting that the U.N. agency would redirect its food aid to promote
human development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the development committee Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad
pointed out while food production has increased significantly over
the past years, it is now important that more efforts should be
made to improve the access of the poor to food.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for development strategy to ensure
equitable access to food.

<HEADLINE> Creditor Countries Cancel Uganda's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Club of creditor
countries has canceled 145 million U.S. dollars of Uganda's debt
under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
Permanent Secretary Office of Ugandan Finance Ministry confirmed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This brings Uganda's total debt relief from the lender
countries so far to 656 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC initiative launched in September 1996, urges creditor
countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank to cancel debts on condition that the money saved is used in
poverty alleviation in borrower countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest HIPC-released funds would be channeled into the
provision of safe water, sanitation and better education to the
poor, according to Permanent Secretary Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda has also received 1.3 billion dollars debt
relief pledges from the IMF and World Bank over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club is a forum where creditor and the heavily-
indebted countries discuss debt. It halted final discussions on
Uganda's debt relief in May this year after it clashed with Rwanda
in Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Three Burundian Tutsi Parties Agree to Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Tutsi parties
which last month refused to sign a peace accord aimed at ending
the civil war in Burundi agreed to sign the accord on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Nelson Mandela, former South African
President and chief mediator in the Burundi peace process
Wednesday after his meeting with the three Tutsi parties, his
spokeswoman Zelda La Grange said.
</P>
<P>
The three parties present at the meeting in South Africa were
the Independent Party of Workers (PIT), the Union for Democracy
and Economic and Social Development (RADDES) and the National
Alliance for Law and Economic Development (ANADDE), she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Grange, the three parties are concerned over the
issue that the agreement does not provide for a ceasefire, so that
the fighting is still ongoing, which has claimed some 200,000
lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace accord was signed by 13 -- including the
Tutsi-led government -- out of a total of 19 parties on August 28
in Arusha, Tanzania, after two years of tough negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Two leading Hutu rebel groups, the Forces for the Defense of
Democracy (FDD) and the National Liberation Forces (FNL), had
boycotted the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The FDD has accused the Tutsi-led army of killing more than 850
Hutu civilians in the past month despite intensified efforts to
end the war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has invited regional heads of state and leaders of the
two rebel groups to a meeting in Nairobi on September 20 with a
view to reaching a ceasefire agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Offers Ethiopia Loan to Curb HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
approved a 59.7 million U.S. dollar soft loan under a Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa, a press release issued
by the bank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will finance the Ethiopian government's 2000-2004
strategic plan, which, among others, aims at expanding and
accelerating existing prevention and mitigation programs.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy is falling and the epidemic is systematically
undermining the country's efforts to reduce poverty, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate impact of the MAP will be to avert millions of
HIV infections, alleviate suffering for tens of millions, and help
preserve the development prospects of entire nations", World Bank
President James Wolfensohn was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Kenya are the first two countries to benefit from
the program, and the projects were approved Tuesday as part of the
MAP. Kenya got a 50 million U.S. dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
The loan to Ethiopia and Kenya is part of an initial 500
million U.S. dollars in flexible and rapid funding over the next
three years, which will consist of several projects to fight the
epidemic in sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
Any country that seeks to draw from the fund should meet simple
eligibility criteria, including satisfactory evidence of a
strategic approach to HIV/AIDS, developed in a participatory way,
and the establishment of a high level HIV/AIDS coordinating body.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy, and has
established a national body for HIV/AIDS prevention and control,
headed by its President Negasso Gidada.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls for Regional Cooperation on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of State
for National Security Nicholas Goche Wednesday urged southern
African countries to cooperate on issues threatening regional
security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at the 14th Zimbabwe Defence Forces
Joint Command and Staff Course, he stressed that national security
could only be achieved through inter-state cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The region as a whole should formulate policies which
protect us from serious threats that are either of a regional or
international nature."
</P>
<P>
"Security threats as we move into the new millennium, like drug
trafficking, money laundering and car smuggling demand inter-state
cooperation to preserve our national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The joint command and staff course, which is expected to finish
at the end of the year, is being attended by security forces
members from Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa,
Zambia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Goche noted that the situation in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) was of great concern to the region with regard to
national security.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have military forces fighting in
the two-year long DRC civil war to protect DRC President Laurent
Kabila from rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He said the DRC civil war involving four southern African
countries, the civil war in Angola and the secessionist moves in
the Caprivi Strip in Namibia were complicating regional security.
</P>
<P>
Managing relations between South Africa and its neighbors would
be a major pre-occupation in national security policy formulation
since South Africa was the dominant military and economic power in
the region, he said.

HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of infectious and

It is not an easy task to maintain good health standards due to
the overpopulation of prisoners, he said, explaining that the

under which some inmates could serve their terms at their home and
assigned working places, to ease the overcrowding.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
president Nelson Mandela has initiated a far-sighted plan to
rebuild Burundi's shattered economy, the South African Press
Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Wednesday to reporters at his Johannesburg home
after meeting leaders of three Burundian parties, Mandela said he
has asked French President Jacques Chirac to call an international
conference and invite donors to help transform Burundi's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he has also requested countries like Belgium, France
and Germany to train large numbers of young Burundians on how to
run the economy of their country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who succeeded late former Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere as mediator in the Burundi peace negotiations last October,
managed to broker a comprehensive political agreement late August
which lays the foundation for the signing of a cease-fire
agreement in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
So far 16 negotiating parties have signed the Arusha Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement aimed to end the country's seven-year
civil war and another three parties agreed on Wednesday to sign
the political accord on September 20 in Nairobi, Kenya without
reservations.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Mandela, leaders of the three Burundian parties,
Joseph Nzeyimana of the Union for Democracy and Economic Social
Development, Patrice Nsababaganwa of the National Alliance of Law
and Economic Development, and Nicephore Ndimurukundo of the
Independent Workers' Party said they are committed to ending the
civil war in their country.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, the three parties did not sign the Arusha
agreement on August 28 because there were outstanding matters to
be discussed among themselves.

<HEADLINE> French Court Authorizes Extradition of Basque Militant Leader to Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A French court Wednesday
authorized the government to extradite to Spain a former leader of
the Basque independence movement ETA for his suspected role in an
assassination plot against Spanish King Juan Carlos in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Accusation of the Court of Appeal of Paris gave
the green light to a possible extradition of Javier Arizcuren-Ruiz,
39, who is also called "Kantauri" and was former chief of the
military wing of ETA.
</P>
<P>
He was suspected to be the mastermind behind a plot against
King Carlos in Palma de Majorque, a Spanish island in the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish authorities issued in February 1996 an
international arrest warrant against Arizcuren, who is also
suspected to have orchestrated at least three other terrorist
attacks in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Madrid has so far made 21 requests after the French government
for his extradition, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
It is now up to French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to decide
whether to sign a decree of extradition of Arizcuren toward Spain.
</P>
<P>
Arizcuren was arrested in March 9, 1999, in Paris and was
sentenced to eight years in jail in February this year by a Paris
court for "association with wrong-doers connected with a terrorist
organization."

<HEADLINE> China Calls on U.N. to Promote Common Prosperity in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal came as Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign minister,
took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General Assembly
session, which began here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent poverty from swallowing up achievements of
development and to prevent social injustice from shaking the basis
of global stability, the U.N. must play its due role in narrowing
the gap between the rich and the poor and bringing about common
prosperity to the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unshirkable major responsibility of the U.N. in the
new century to promote the establishment of a new international
economic order based on cooperation on an equal footing and aimed
at common development, and ensure economic globalization to
benefit everybody in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should give top priority to the issue of development,
make efforts to change the current situation in which global
economic affairs are dominated by only a few countries and ensure
developing countries their right to equal participation in
economic decision-making," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In making or revising global economic rule of the game,
consideration should first be given to the need of developing
countries in order to facilitate their development and reduce the
risks they might run when participating in globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should also mobilize all the resources available and
encourage the international community to narrow the 'digital
divide' and help developing countries to seize, as far as they can,
the opportunities brought about by the scientific and
technological advancement driven by the information revolution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. also has the responsibility for introducing new rules
to the world to make science and technology truly serve all
mankind and the lofty cause of peace and development in the world,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the world body to respond to globalization
and realize common development of mankind, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The 20th century has seen both unprecedented economic
prosperity and the greatest polarization," he said. "In the last
decade of the century, economic globalization has advanced at the
fastest speed while the gap between the North and the South has
continued to widen."
</P>
<P>
"The 'New Economy' is so far only prospering in rich countries,
" he said. "Most developing countries are still information have-
nots. Should such a situation be allowed to continue, many
developing countries would, for a long time, be deprived of the
opportunity of being part of technological progress and economic
growth and they would be further polarized."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin told Chinese top legislator Li Peng Wednesday that Moscow
would not change its policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in the Kremlin with Li, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress,
Putin said both sides are now working energetically on a pact of
good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation, an important

<P>
Li, who arrived here Monday on a nine-day official visit, said
China has always been positive on developing its relations with
Russia and the signing of such a document would lay a solid legal
foundation for bilateral collaboration of mutual benefit for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Putin recalled his recent meeting with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the Millennium Summit in New York.

<P>
At Jiang's initiative, the leaders of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council held a joint meeting, the
first in the history of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that close consultations among the leaders of the
five countries and steps to institutionalize such consultations
are of great significance because they are conducive to
maintaining the authority of the U.N. and the Security Council and
to strengthening their roles.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed agreement with Li's view. He said it is very
important for the five countries to step up consultations and
cooperation in an effort to strengthen the role of the U.N. and
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the recent meetings between presidents Jiang and
Putin in Beijing and New York, as well as their speeches delivered
at the Millennium Summit, demonstrated that both countries share a
sincere desire to strengthen their ties and have broad consensus
on a series of major international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the establishment of the Sino-Russian
strategic partnership of cooperation was the historic choice made
by the two countries in accordance with the changes in post-Cold
War international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Such a partnership embodies the common aspirations of the two
countries' people who long for good-neighborly relations and
cooperation of mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that bilateral ties have broad vistas.
</P>
<P>
Putin said it is no coincidence that Russia and China share
common interests and aspirations, because both countries cherish
good-neighborly friendship, advocate the movement toward a multi-
polar world, and strive for a balance of interests in world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Chinese leader also met separately with
former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and former Russian
prime ministers Yevgeny Primakov and Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked them for their contributions to relations between
Beijing and Moscow and expressed the hope that they would continue
to help push forward bilateral ties in their present capacity as
members of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Blast Kills At Least One in Central Moscow Shop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A terrorist grenade attack in
a downtown Moscow shop killed at least one person and injured
several others Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 5:00 p.m. Moscow time (1300 GMT).
The Itar-Tass news agency cited the local police department as
saying that a man, aged about 30 and wearing black clothes, rushed
into a food store, located at the street of Talalikhin in central
Moscow and close to the building of the Moscow bureau of Xinhua
News Agency, demanded the store cashier hand out all money. After
being refused, the man threw a grenade into the crowd of customers
and ran away.
</P>
<P>
The grenade exploded, killing a buyer and injuring several
others.
</P>
<P>
The criminal had escaped before the police arrived at the
explosion scene and sealed off the place. Now the number of the
victims is being specified, an official of the city police
department told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The damage to the store is not serious and the police have got
a description of the attacker. He is announced wanted, said the
official.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Negotiations With U.S. on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- France denied Wednesday that it
has been negotiating with the United States on a coordination of
action in the market to stop the euro from falling further.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a source at the French
Ministry of Finance as saying that France rejects allegations by
the German magazine "Focus-Money" that it is negotiating with the
U.S. Federal Reserve on a coordinated intervention in the exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
France is the current rotating presidency state of the European
Union (EU) and the presidency state of the Eurogroup, which
gathers finance ministers of 11 euro zone countries.
</P>
<P>
"The French presidency denies totally the allegations published
by 'Focus-Money' and sticks to the declarations made in Versailles
" by finance ministers of 11 euro countries, AFP quoted the source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers and officials of the European Central
Bank said during a meeting held last weekend in Versailles outside
of Paris that they were ready for an intervention at any moment
and they were closely following the situation of euro.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based "Money-Focus" Wednesday quoted a French
government source as saying that the euro zone finance ministers
estimated it is necessary to intervene in the market to support
the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that France has engaged in negotiations
with the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington because it thinks only
a coordinated action with the U.S. central bank can stop the euro
from falling.
</P>
<P>
Euro has fallen nearly 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since
its launch in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Says U.N. Plays Irreplaceable Role in World Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese foreign minister,
was taking the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which kicked off here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"This organization is still playing an irreplaceable role in
world affairs. The history of the past 55 years has amply proved
the effectiveness of the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, global issues have made our interests intertwined and
modern technology has made our communication easier," he said. "In
these circumstances, we need, more than ever, to face up the
common challenges together on the basis of equality, mutual
respect and democratic consultation."
</P>
<P>
"The purposes and principles of the charter are by no means
outdated, but rather, they are of greater relevance today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the declaration adopted at the just-concluded Millennium
Summit, the three-day historic event which has attracted worldwide
attention, Tang said, "The United Nations Millennium Declaration
is what world leaders at the summit agreed upon on how to meet the
major challenges facing mankind today."
</P>
<P>
"The declaration reviews and sums up the course that the U.N.
has traversed in the past 55 years," he said. "More importantly,
it offers a blueprint for the U.N. in the new century and new
millennium and important guidance to people around the world in
their pursuit of peace, development and common progress."
</P>
<P>
"It is the primary mission of the U.N. in the new century to
hold fast to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter,
promote democracy in international relations, maintain world peace
and stability, and facilitate development and prosperity in all
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Charter is a manifestation of the people's ideal and
pursuit of equality, justice and freedom," he said. "It is
precisely because it has kept to the purposes of the charter in
safeguarding peace, developing friendship and promoting
cooperation and its principles guiding international relations
such as the core principles of sovereignty, equality and
noninterference in each other's internal affairs over the past 55
years that the U.N. has grown from strength to strength and its
membership from 51 to 189."

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Speaks on Democracy in International Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign minister, made the statement
at the general debate of the 55th General Assembly session, which
began here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Countries do differ in terms of size, strength and wealth, but
they are all equal members of the international community," he
said. "None of them should be discriminated against and their
state sovereignty brooks no encroachment."
</P>
<P>
"The internal affairs of a country should be managed by the
people of that country and major world affairs should be decided
by all countries through consultation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Response to global challenges calls for worldwide cooperation
and consultation," he said. "This is required by progress of our
times and necessitated by the establishment of a fair and just new
international political order."
</P>
<P>
"It is also the foundation and source of vitality for the U.N.
in the new century," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. reform, Tang said, "The reform of the U.N. should
give full expression to democracy in international relations."
</P>
<P>
"The reform is aimed at better safeguarding the fundamental
rights and interests of all member states and, especially, truly
reflecting the will of developing countries, which make up the
bulk of the U.N. membership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should not merely satisfy the needs of a few countries," he
said. "And the reform of the Security Council should primarily aim
at increasing representation of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
This reform should be based on extensive deliberations among
member states, he said. "It is against the will of the
overwhelming majority of the member states to arbitrarily set
deadlines or force the passage of immature plans."
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. dues, Tang said, "There is a general agreement
among the U.N. member states on basing the scale principle of
methodology of regular budget and peacekeeping assessment on the
principle of capacity to pay."
</P>
<P>
"This methodology is also one that is confirmed time and again
by the General Assembly through its resolutions and, therefore,
should be abided by in whatever circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such adjustments should be made only when there is consensus
among all member states through extensive consultation, thus
facilitating the normal and sound operation of the U.N.," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Maintenance of Global Strategic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign
minister, took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which began here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"As drastic and profound changes are taking place in the
international situation, what kind of security concept should be
embraced is a major subject before the U.N. and all its member
states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Global strategic stability is the foundation on which world
security rests," he said. "And the 1972 ABM Treaty is an important
cornerstone for global strategic stability."
</P>
<P>
"Any move to undermine the totality and effectiveness of the
treaty will have a profound negative impact on world peace and
security," he said. "The proposal for a national missile defense
system that is prohibited by the ABM Treaty is essentially aimed
at seeking unilateral military and strategic supremacy and thus a
typical example of the Cold War mentality."
</P>
<P>
"Such a plan, if implemented, will only bring serious negative
consequences to the security of the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 adoption by the General Assembly of the Resolution on
Preservation of and Compliance with the ABM Treaty at its 54th
session is "an indicator of the firm will of most countries in the
world to maintain and strictly observe the ABM Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should continue to show serious concern over the
attempt by a certain country to develop a missile defense system
to the detriment of the global strategic stability and it should
take necessary measures to stop this dangerous development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Security is mutual and relative," he said. "No country should
enhance its security at the expense of the others'. To seek '
absolute' unilateral security is not feasible and will lead to
greater insecurity."
</P>
<P>
"With increased international contacts and exchanges, countries
of the world will find themselves sharing more common interests
and facing more common challenges," he said. "Security can only be
realized through dialogue on an equal footing and in the spirit of
mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, maintained on the
basis of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, and consolidated
through mutually-beneficial cooperation and common development."
</P>
<P>
"The only way to protect the fundamental interests of all
countries and enhance the universal security is to replace the old
security concept based on military alliances and military build-up
with a new one that is characterized by equality, mutual trust,
mutual benefit, cooperation and settlement of dispute through
dialogue," he said.

MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Interior Minister
Kakha Targamadze confirmed Wednesday that David Shengelia,
commander of the anti-government Georgian Forest Brothers
guerrilla group operating in the state's conflicting region of
Abkhazia, was captured by the police Tuesday evening.

<P>
A large quantity of arms were found and confiscated during the
special action. A stolen car was also found there, Targamadze said.
</P>
<P>
Shengelia has been charged with misconduct, and other aspects
of his unlawful activities will also be investigated, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a Tuesday session of the Georgian parliament, deputy Tengiz

<HEADLINE> World Bank OKs 200 Million U.S. Dollar Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank board of
directors Tuesday approved a 200 million U.S. dollar guarantee to
Russia to improve its coal and forest industries, the Interfax
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loans, 50 million dollars will be earmarked
exclusively to support forestry transactions and another 50
million dollars for coal transactions, Interfax cited a World Bank
press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
The use of the remaining 100 million dollars will be determined
on the basis of market demand. The guarantee facility will extend
for five years from the day it comes into effect and will have to
meet the World Bank's safeguard policies ensuring that the money
only be used to support environmentally and socially sustainable
investments.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed "to protect private investors from
political risks -- risks stemming from possible government actions
that would negatively affect the investor' returns on investment,"
the release said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank expects that the guarantee facility will "help
Russian private coal and forestry sector enterprises attract the
fixed and working capital which they need to increase production,
employment and export," it said.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Priority to Open Meaningful Cyprus Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What is most important is for meaningful negotiations for a
solution to the Cyprus problem to begin and it is on this level
that everyone will be judged," Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said while commenting on the statements made by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between
Cyprus' two communities opened Tuesday afternoon at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, and Annan said in his statements that
the equal status of the two sides in Cyprus must be clearly
recognized.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Greek government's position regarding the
Annan statements, Reppas said that Athens' position was reflected
by the positions promoted by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cyprus government led by President Glafcos
Clerides should be allowed to proceed in the way that it thought
best.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the eastern
Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece, which signed a joint defense pact, have
insisted that the island must be reunited in a federation formula
in line with the U.N. resolutions. But northern Cyprus led by Rauf
Denktash and Turkey demand that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up on the island.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, former Cyprus President George
Vassiliou said here Wednesday that the European Union (EU) hoped
that the Cyprus problem was resolved, but it was careful not to
allow Turkey to determine the course of developments.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on Cyprus's European course, Vassiliou
said that as long as Turkey refused to promote a solution in
accordance with the U.N. resolutions, it should understand that it
could not keep Cyprus outside Europe.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Morocco Wednesday
urged the international community to show solidarity towards
Africa in order to set it on the track of development and peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Mohamed Benaissa, minister of foreign
affairs and cooperation of Morocco, said the marginalization of
Africa is a serious obstacle to its integration in global
development.
</P>
<P>
"Though it is a fact that the responsibility for development
lies mostly with Africans, it is no less a fact that the means
available to them are insufficient to meet the considerable needs
for African populations in all walks of life," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The increasingly urgent need is to show solidarity towards
Africa in order to set it on the track of development and peace,
particularly through the development of its human resources on the
basis of educational policies consistent with the African context,
" the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is equally necessary to examine the debt of the African
countries from a different perspective so that debt servicing will
become a wealth producing factor rather than an impediment to
development, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Help Eliminate Root Cause of Conflicts, Chinese FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign minister who spoke at the
general debate of the General Assembly, said, "The U.N.
intervention should aim at eliminating the root causes of a given
conflict rather than delaying its settlement, facilitating
reconciliation between the conflicting parties rather than
aggravating their hatred and hostility."
</P>
<P>
"In the 20th century, mankind has suffered enough from the
scourges of war," he said. "In the 21st century, humanitarian
crises of a massive scale must be prevented and the tragedy of
innocent people being slaughtered on a large scale must not be
allowed to repeat itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. shoulders a primary responsibility for the
maintenance of world peace and, therefore, it should work harder
to stop conflicts and eliminate wars," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the present-day world, hegemonism and power politics still
exist," he said. "Territorial disputes, ethnic feuds and religious
rifts have all led to incessant regional conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"Some countries and regions hope that the U.N. will assist them
in stopping conflicts, which we fully understand," he said. "At
the same time, we must not fail to see the complexity of
international intervention and the danger of inappropriate
intervention."
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that major powers and groups of countries
should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
countries concerned rather than meddling in their internal affairs
or triggering new conflicts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Major Banks Losing Small Business Share: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The six major banks of Canada
have seen their total share of the small business market shrink to
75.4 percent this year from 80.6 percent in 1989, the Canadian
Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing its national survey conducted between April and June,
CFIB President Catherine Swift said, "These market-share findings
are very significant. Even a one percentage point loss or gain for
a major bank represents thousands of small businesses."
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers include the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC), whose share has fallen to 13.3 percent from 19.3
percent; and the Royal Bank, whose share has slipped from 24.3
percent to 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall picture of losses, the Bank of Montreal is
successful in expanding its share from 10.1 percent to 12.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Scotiabank has also increased its share to 11.2 percent
from 9.3 percent, according to the CFIB.
</P>
<P>
There are telling reasons behind these types of shift, said
Swift. "For example, one in two respondents told us they switched
financial institutions because of poor service quality or lack of
credit availability," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, 40 percent said they left because they were not
satisfied with the level of service charges and 23.7 percent
changed for more competitive rates," she added.
</P>
<P>
The CFIB president urged the CIBC and the Royal, the country's
two largest banks, to "work harder" in addressing their problems,
saying "there's a benefit to be had for good services, fair credit
policies and low service charges."

<HEADLINE> Belgian Truckers Agree to Lift Fuel Price Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Transport Minister
Isabelle Durant said Wednesday that protesting truckers had agreed
to end nationwide blockades gradually after the government said it
would look for ways to solve the problem of rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The truckers have agreed to begin progressively dismantling
the blockade," Durant told reporters during negotiations with
deputies of truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
She said representatives of the transport sector had agreed to
drop their demands for a cut in the excise tax on diesel in
exchange for other measures to help relieve the burden of fuel
costs inflated by rising world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The government is to search for alternative ways in fiscal and
social security areas to compensate the losses suffered by the
sector this year," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Belgian truckers have blocked main roads into the capital, the
European Union's headquarters, since Sunday to demand cuts in
excise duty on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
The protests have widened throughout the country, with motorway
traffic brought to a standstill in both the Dutch-speaking north
and major southern cities. The Belgian-German frontier near Aachen
has also been sealed off.
</P>
<P>
The country's transport sector had demanded a cut by 1.87
Belgian francs (0.04 U.S. dollars) per liter over excise duties.
</P>
<P>
Serge Adriaens, head of the Professional Union for Road
Transport, which has led the four-day stranglehold on Brussels,
said that progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations have come out of the deep freeze and are back in
the refrigerator," said Adriaens, who stormed out of earlier
meetings with government officials. He also said the blockades
would remain in place for now but indicated that could change
within hours.
</P>
<P>
Adriaens and representatives of other national truckers' unions
met Durant, Finance Minister Didier Reyndeers and Economics
Minister Charles Picque earlier to hammer out draft proposals to
stave off the fuel tax protesters.

UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Nutritional problems
remain serious in Iraq despite some progress under the oil-for-
food program, the U.N. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said
malnutrition among children is very serious outside Baghdad and in
rural areas, reflecting the effects of drought and poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Child malnutrition rates in the central and southern parts of
the country do not appear to have improved significantly and
nutritional problems remain serious and widespread," the report
said.

"The malnutritional status of school children is a cause for
concern especially for those from rural areas and poor households.
Micronutrient deficiencies are common and iron deficiency anaemia
is high," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, agriculture in Iraq has deteriorated
significantly in the past few years due to two consecutive years
of severe drought, a lack of investment and a shortage of
essential agricultural inputs.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that malnutrition is often due to factors
other than insufficient food, and poor water and poor sanitation
are key causes of repeated infections resulting in infant and
child malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the
water and sanitation system as a priority for meeting basic needs.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Encourage Dialogues on Human Rights, China Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese foreign
minister, took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which kicked off here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"In providing humanitarian assistance, the U.N. should give
equal priority to the prevention of conflicts and the protection
of human rights on the one hand and the reduction and elimination
of poverty and the promotion of human development on the other
hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the U.N. should work in close coordination
and cooperation with the governments concerned, instead of
bypassing them, and ensure human rights to the majority of the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, such operations would trigger a humanitarian
disaster of a greater scale," he said. "Only when the above-
mentioned principles are abided by, can the U.N. play a useful
role in protecting human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Human rights improvement is an endless process," he said. "The
human rights conditions of a country are up to the people of that
country to assess and improve."
</P>
<P>
"All people live in a specific environment," he said. "The form
in which human rights are embodied changes with time and
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, how to protect and promote human rights depends on
the actual conditions and specific needs of a country," he said. "
To arbitrarily impose a fixed set of human rights rules regardless
of the differences in the specific environment and reality will
not serve the interests of the people of any country."
</P>
<P>
"To interfere in other countries' internal affairs in the name
of protecting human rights in order to advance one's own political
agenda is simply a blasphemy and betrayal of the human rights
abuse," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Los Alamos National
Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee is expected to be released later
Wednesday after pleading guilty to one count of mishandling data
in a plea agreement with government prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Parker said he is bound by the plea
agreement to sentence Lee to 278 days, one day less than the
scientist already has served in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
In court, Lee read a statement in which he admitted using an
unsecured computer to download a document relating to national
defense onto a tape, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The scientist had been charged with 59 counts of charges. But
the case began to unravel after one of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents on the case, Robert A. Messemer, recently
admitted he had made "inaccurate testimony" against Lee.
</P>
<P>
A deal was reached Sunday. However, a hearing on the plea
agreement Monday was rescheduled for Wednesday by District Judge
Parker because of wrangling of details between the two sides.

</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore met with students, parents and school

WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican

</P>
<P>
"Protecting our environment must be a shared responsibility,"

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Bomb Blast Kills Nine in Indonesian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Just a day ahead of the
second trial against Indonesian former president Soeharto, a
powerful bomb blast rocked Indonesian capital city of Jakarta
Wednesday afternoon, killing at least nine people and injuring
dozens.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at the Jakarta Stock Exchange's building,
central Jakarta, at 15:25 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were drivers as the blast took place at the
parking area of the building. The bomb was confirmed to have been
put in a "Kijiang" car and the driver was in the car when it
exploded. The explosion also destroyed dozens of cars and broke
down the wall of the parking building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Chief of the Jakarta Police told reporters after
inspecting the area that "The security will be tightened."
</P>
<P>
The police also said it was not impossible the explosion was
connected with former president Soeharto's trial scheduled for a
second session on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"(It) could be," National Police Chief General Rusdihardjo said
replying to a reporter's question after attending a meeting with
House Commission I.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, police would not jump to any conclusions
about the motive behind the incident before the perpetrator was
seized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the injured have been rushed to the nearby
hospital of Pertamina, in South Jakarta to get medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Officials asked to be anonymity said that most of the injured
were drivers who have been waiting for their bosses in the office.
Others said that among the drivers were also office boys who had
been taking a rest after serving their bosses during lunch time.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the local Police Intelligence Superintendent Hari
Montolalu said that the material of the bomb was still unknown "
but it seems to be a locally made."
</P>
<P>
The explosion which took place just 200 meters away from the
Jakarta Police Headquarters (Polda) has forced exchange officials
to suspend their trading activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 workers were evacuated from the multi-story
building which also houses the World Bank Offices, but a source
said that there are still many workers trapped in the building,
while thick smoke from the building was seen to have been
skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
The fire caused by the blast at the parking floor of the
building has not been put out completely and about 400 can not be
evacuated from the parking area, police said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The blast was fueling fears of renewed instability in the
strife-torn Indonesia as it came up just a day ahead of the second
trial against former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw a series of bomb blast attacks from unknown group
in recent weeks. On August 1, a powerful bomb exploded in the
front of the Philippine Embassy at Central Jakarta, killing two,
injuring dozens, including the envoy, Leonides Caday.
</P>
<P>
Late August, a small bomb also exploded inside an unoccupied
bus parked near by the agriculture ministry building, where former
President Soeharto was being tried for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on July 4, a bomb also blasted in a toilet at the
third floor of the attorney general office building.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred just half an hour after the youngest son
of the former president, Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra was
questioned by prosecutors at the AGO for corruption cases. Police
also found another bomb package which was ready to blast in AGO
building.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Current Account Deficit Hits New High in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. current account
deficit increased 4.6 percent in the second quarter of this year
to a record 106.1 billion U.S. dollars from 101.5 billion dollars
in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current account is considered the best measurement of a
country's international economic standing because it measures not
just the trade in goods and services but also investment flows
between countries and unilateral transfers, including U.S. foreign
aid payments.
</P>
<P>
In the April-June quarter, America's deficit in goods widened
to a record 110.2 billion dollars from 105.8 billion dollars in
the first quarter. In the services category, which measures such
things as airline travel, the United States is running a surplus,
which grew to 21 billion dollars in the second quarter from 20.7
billion dollars in the first.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in investment earnings widened to 4.5 billion
dollars in the second quarter, up from 4.4 billion dollars in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The category of unilateral transfers climbed to 12.3 billion
dollars in the second quarter. This category adds to the overall
current-account deficit because it represents payments that the U.
S. government makes in foreign aid to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The current account hit an all-time high of 331.5 billion
dollars in 1999 and is forecast to set another record of around
425 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
A soaring trade deficit has been the main flaw in an otherwise
remarkable U.S. economy. The Clinton administration insists that
the trade deficit is a sign of strength because the U.S. economy
has been growing at far faster rates than have its trading
partners'.
</P>
<P>
However, critics say the rising deficits have cost thousands of
American jobs, especially in manufacturing, and indicate the
failings of the administration's trade policy.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. economy has continued to prosper in spite of the
huge trade deficits, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
other economists have expressed concerns that the rate of increase
in the deficit is unsustainable and could cause problems down the
road if foreign investors become fearful.

<HEADLINE> Productivity Seen Up for Inflation-Free Growth in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal chief economist John McCallum forecast an averaged
productivity rate of 2.5 percent in the bank's annual fall
economic report made available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rate, which is measured as output per hour of work, was put
at 1.5 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"Canada may well be on the cusp of enjoying the productivity
miracle recently seen in the U.S.," said McCallum.
</P>
<P>
New technologies are behind the country's 20th consecutive
quarterly growth without inflation, according to the chief
economist.
</P>
<P>
"More and more markets and central bankers are buying into the
new economy thinking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line to this sort of thinking is an upward
adjustment in the economy's speed limit, owing to the acceleration
of technological progress in information technology and the
investment boom of recent years," he added.
</P>
<P>
One of the immediate benefits will be a period of stable
interest rates and the Bank of Canada will not raise rates for "
the foreseeable future," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The economist also expected machinery and equipment investment
to rise 20 percent this year and another 11 percent next year.

MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada is supportive of
Russia's position to preserve the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty between the former Soviet Union and the United States, the
Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canada recommended keeping the treaty intact as a cornerstone
of global strategic stability during Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov's visit to Ottawa on September 10-12, following the
Millenium Summit in New York, it said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Canada, Ivanov held separate talks with
Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Herbert Gray and Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy. They shared common views on how to strengthen
global security and stability, according to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "pointed out that a real opportunity exists to
set up a global regime on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,
and that Russia and Canada share a common stand in this sphere."
</P>
<P>
They also discussed preparations for the scheduled visit to
Canada by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December.
</P>
<P>
Noting the positive trend in bilateral ties, the Russian
Foreign Ministry said both sides agree that "the Russian-Canadian
summit must consolidate this trend and give an important
additional impetus to bilateral cooperation in all spheres, above
all, in the economic field."

Taipei in the second day of preliminary round to preserve their
clean slate with two wins and no loss in the Asian Junior Women's
Volleyball Championship in the northern Philippine city of Dagupan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese girls won in three straight sets but it was in the
last set where the DPRK team tried to come back only to be nosed
out by two points, 30-28, thus preventing an extension of the game
after leading in the first two sets, 25-16 and 25-11.

South Korea scored its second victory at the expense of a

<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A 580-kilometer-long water
channel linking the Yellow River with Tianjin, in north China,
will be built to alleviate the city's current water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The water transportation project--scheduled for completion in
February next year--is expected to bring clean and drinkable water
to Tianjin residents, whose daily use of water dropped from 2.74
million cubic meters to 1.69 million cubic meters this year.
</P>
<P>
The Panjiakou Reservoir, which sustains water usage for the
city's nine million population, is "drying up at a terrible speed".
Its water supply totaled 182 million cubic meters from January to
August, only 43 percent of that of the same period in 1981, the
driest year in history.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that if the water shortage is to continue,
there will be a 300-400 million cubic-meter gap in supply and
demand by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
Two provinces will be involved in the water project, Shandong
in east China and Hebei in north China. Currently, the two
provinces are clearing obstacles for easy transportation of water.

as the government is as determined as ever to ensure the safety of
the captives.
</P>
<P>
"No military action was discussed. We just simply reviewed the
options. But as we said, we would rather simply await the
developments and then at that point, maybe discuss the matter
again," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
But Puno declined to say what options were presented during the
meeting involving national security and peace and order.

Of the 21 hostages snatched by the Abu Sayyaf from a Sipadan
diving resort in Malaysia in April, only Filipino national Roland
Ullah remains in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Also in the hands of the extremist group are two French
journalists who were taken hostage after they entered the lair of
the Abu Sayyaf to do a special report on the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
American Jeffrey Schilling who reportedly went to Sulu to meet
with Abu Sayyaf leaders was also taken as captive by the Muslim
group in late August.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Abu Sayyaf struck again in Malaysia, taking with
them three Malaysians from another diving resort not far from
Sipadan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court on
Wednesday dismissed a review petition of a convict in the murder
of an Iranian diplomat and upheld his death penalty already
announced by the apex court, reported the News Network
International agency.
</P>
<P>
Haq Nawaz, belonging to a Sunni extremist group "Lashkar-e-
Jhangi" was accused of killing Director General of Iranian
Cultural Center in Lahore Sadiq Ganji on December 19,1990.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld a high court verdict, which awarded
death sentence to Haq Nawaz, in December 1999. But Nawaz later
filed a review petition against the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The most wanted terrorist in Akistan Riaz Basra and his
accomplice Javed Ahmed have also been accused in the same case.
However they have reportedly fled to Afghanistan and have been
declared absconders.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 Iranian nationals, including two diplomats and five air
force cadets, have been killed in different terrorist attacks on

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim To Find Mosquito Fossil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
found a mosquito fossil dating back to 18 million years from the
china clay mine beds of the southwestern Kerala State, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scientists from Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany (BSIP)
based in Lucknow, 490 kilometers southeast of here, recovered the
male culex mosquito from the "resin embedded beds" with a hope to
trace evolution of the insect, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
They believed that there was every possibility that the
preserved Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) might help in matching the
genetic material of early-day mosquitoes with the present ones.
</P>
<P>
BSIP scientists said the Center for Cellular and Molecular
Biology in Hyderabad, 1,490 kilometers south of here, had been
approached for "extracting and cloning the ancient DNA" and
matching it with that of its modern counterpart to understand the
evolutionary process.
</P>
<P>
Since resin can naturally keep intact an organism for a long
time by preventing degradation of organic matter, geologists
believe that the possibility of preserving DNA in a resin-embedded
insect is higher.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Cooperation Needed to Combat Terrorism: Philippine Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on Wednesday made a proposal to end the
terrorist problem in the southern Philippines with multinational
cooperation to patrol the Sulu Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during her press briefing, Arroyo said that to
consider a broader strategy against the Abu Sayyaf, arrangements
should be made with allies for a multinational approach and
quarantine of the Sulu Sea.
</P>
<P>
"As the Philippine navy cannot possibly secure the entire area
because Sulu Sea is a vast area, quarantine is imperative", the
vice president said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that when she said multinational quarantine, it means
that Sulu Sea should be patrolled by a multinational naval force
to ensure that no vessel can sail across borders without being
inspected.
</P>
<P>
She said the atrocities perpetrated by terrorist groups should
now come to an end.
</P>
<P>
"The ends of justice demand that terrorism should be excised
like cancer... I have called on for military action, the sooner,
the better," Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
By multinational approach, the vice president said, it could
have been like Malaysia, Indonesia and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that other nations should have been
involved because this is an international water that terrorists
are crossing", Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that when a terrorist kidnaps a person in a
territory controlled by another country, there is really a need
for a multinational approach.
</P>
<P>
The 21 Sipadan hostages, 20 of whom have been freed due to
ransom payment, and the three newly-kidnapped Malaysians were all
snatched from Malaysia and then taken across the Sulu Sea to Jolo
island in the southern Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's flower exports are
expected to grow by 50 percent between 2000 and 2003, according to
statistics from the Agri Business Development Center.
</P>
<P>
A September 2000 review of the floriculture industry said about
3,000 tons of roses are to be exported this year, which can earn
about 17 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth is due to increased productivity and efforts made on
research and the improvement of quality, said the review.
</P>
<P>
The review traced the history of the flower industry to 1993
when the first flower farms were established.
</P>
<P>
Uganda grows flowers on large areas of cultivated land with a
total investment of about 40 million dollars and a gross return of
about 17 million dollars per year. The sector now employs 4,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Major importers of Uganda's flower are the Netherlands which
takes 80 percent, followed by Norway, Sweden, Britain and France.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees in Namibia Ask for Luanda Govt Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Angolan
civil war refugees currently sheltered in Namibia have urged the
Luanda government to provide aid to improve their plight, said
reports issued by the Portuguese Lusa news agency reaching here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 15,000 Angolan refugees are sheltered in camps in
the arid regions in north Namibia, far from major cities and
without any possibilities to be employed, a humanitarian source
was quoted by the reports as saying, adding that their most
immediate problem is the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angolan Minister of Assistance and Social
Reintegration Albino Malungo announced on Monday that the
government planned to launch an emergency aid program to help
civil war refugees, namely those across the country's southern
border in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify when the aid operations would begin.
</P>
<P>
The 25-odd-year civil conflicts between the Angolan government
troops and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) have killed over 500,000 people and displaced some
3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 300,000 Angolans crossed the borders to
seek refuge in other countries, including 200,000 in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, some 100,000 in Zambia and 15,
000 in Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Mini ECOWAS Summit to Ease Tension Among Guinea, S. Leone, Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A mini-summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has agreed on a plan of
action to ease tension and restore trust among the leaders of
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, said a source reaching here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit came after the rising incidence of insurgency in the
sub-region, said a statement released by the ECOWAS Secretariat on
Tuesday in Nigeria's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are members of the Mano
River Union, have become the hotbed of armed groups fighting to
oust the existing leadership, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Liberia and Guinea have traded accusations of harboring rebels
fighting their respective governments since July this year when
armed groups invaded into northern Liberian towns bordering Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the relationship between Sierra Leone and Guinea
became tense in the past few days when refugees from Sierra Leone
were being driven out from their homes in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, ECOWAS expressed "acute concern" about the
increasing tense situation in the sub-region, adding that the plan
of action would be applied "in the next few days" to ease tension
on the ground and restore trust.
</P>
<P>
The summit, held on the sidelines of the Millennium Summit of
the United Nations General Assembly, was attended by ECOWAS
Chairman and President Alpa Konare of Mali, presidents of Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria and Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone, the
prime minister of Guinea and the foreign minister of Liberia, and

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Qinghong, head of the
Organization Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, has urged the prevention and correction of
wrongdoings concerning the selection of officials.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations and personnel departments at different
levels should carry out the "Provisional Regulations on Selection
of Party and Government Officials" and punish those who have
violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who is also an alternate member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and a member of the Secretariat of
the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks Tuesday at a hearing
on the implementation of the regulations held at the office of the
Organization Department in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in implementing the document
since it was issued five years ago, the official said, noting that
ill-practice has occasionally occurred, sometimes seriously, on
the selection of cadres.
</P>
<P>
Saying that officials and the public are not satisfied with
such ill-practice, he urged the study of the instructions on Party
building by Jiang Zemin, state president and general secretary of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He called Jiang's instructions a great guideline for Party
building under new historic circumstances and a powerful
ideological weapon for better selecting officials in the new
period.

lie, Ben-Ami told the Palestinian publication Al-Ayam issued on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall
and the Jewish quarter of the Old City, he added.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israel would allow Palestinians free passage overland
to Jerusalem from the West Bank without security checks, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel would retain sovereignty over the free
passageway, Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty over Jerusalem, particularly that of the Temple
Mount, the most sacred in Judaism and also home to Islamic shrines,
has been the stumbling block in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected deferring the issue of Jerusalem,
which was proposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has also insisted on securing
a comprehensive deal instead of a partial agreement when the two
sides try to settle such thorny final status issues as the status
of Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of Jewish
settlements and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' decision to delay the declaration of an
independent state has given the stalled peace talks another chance
to move ahead.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Faces Dangerous Situation: Senior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Economic Affairs Rizal Ramli said here Wednesday that
Indonesia is in danger and facing another big crisis threat as the
country has been threatened with the United Nations (U.N.)
sanction in connection with the Atambua incident.
</P>
<P>
"Now, Indonesia is absolutely in a great crisis, because
Indonesia has been threatened with the U.N. sanction," Ramli told
the House of Representative (DPR) Commission VIII for economic
affairs in a hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"But we are going to do something within this week (to deal
with the possible sanction), because if we do nothing there will
be implications (to our economy)," Ramli said.
</P>
<P>
However, he gave no details what steps will be taken by the
government in response to the possible sanction.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the decision made at a cabinet meeting Tuesday
that that government will take comprehensive steps to tackle the
Atambua case as well as East Timorese refugees.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday three UN international workers were killed by
pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias in Atambua, a city in Indonesia
East Nusa Tenggara province. But according to sources from the pro-
Jakarta group, three civilians from pro-integration camp were also
killed during the bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a resolution on September 8,
urging the Indonesia government to disband and disarm the militia
group as well as allowing the U.N. mission to launch investigation
into the incident.
</P>
<P>
But it seems the Indonesian government will not allow such a
mission as it considered the investigation could be handled by
itself.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramli was also sure that if the Indonesian
government announces steps to be taken in dealing with the Atambua
incident, it will give a positive impact to the donor countries
organized by the World Bank. "The World bank will completely
understand that Indonesia is really serious in dealing with the
Atambua case. And at last, the bank will keep giving its support
to the country's economic recovery process," Ramli said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in its Tuesday's press statement the bank indicated it
has no intention to drop or cancel its financial aid to Indonesia
but it "regretted" at the incident, saying such a case may turn up
negative impacts from international community to Indonesia and
influencing the investors' confidence to the country.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries are set to hold its meeting next month in
Tokyo, Japan
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, following the bloody incident, the country's
currency of rupiah keeps decreasing as it traded at 8,550 (buying)
and 8,700(selling) for one dollar on Wednesday or 150 points lower
than Tuesday when it traded at 8,400/8,550 per U.S. dollar. On
Monday the currency traded at 8,325/8,450 per dollar.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Do More to Improve Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has said the Zimbabwean government has to do much more
before discussions on aid programs to the southern African country
can resume.
</P>
<P>
"Clear progress over the next few months in reducing the fiscal
deficit, implementing structural reforms and improving governance
could lay the groundwork for subsequent resumption of program
discussions with the IMF staff," the IMF said in a statement
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement comes after 20 days of consultations between an
IMF mission led by assistant director of the African Department
Paulo Neuhaus and the Zimbabwean government and private sector.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the fiscal, monetary and exchange rate
measures necessary to contain inflation, reduce the government
financing requirements and ease foreign exchange shortages.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal consolidation supported by tight monetary policy would
help reduce inflationary pressures and release resources for a
recovery in private sector activity," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The mission also reviewed the government's agenda for
structural reforms aimed at increasing the economy's productivity,
the efficiency of public sector operations and the delivery of
social services.
</P>
<P>
The mission urged the authorities to formulate and secure
parliamentary approval of the budget for 2001 that targets a
substantial reduction in the overall government deficit while
protecting social programs.
</P>
<P>
It also said that a restoration of economic stability would
require addressing governance issues to rebuild investor
confidence, as well as a normalization of relations with
international creditors.
</P>
<P>
The mission noted with concern the rapid deterioration in the
country's economic and social situation and urged the government
to quickly resolve the macro-economic imbalances and create an
environment that fosters economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Adopts Report to Pardon Corrupt Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan parliament has
adopted a report which includes a proposal to establish an Amnesty
Commission to pardon corrupt officials, the New Vision daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report presented to the parliament by the government said
that a possibility of establishing the commission was being
discussed and whether such a move would stop corruption or abate
it are also under serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
Under the amnesty, those who confess their transgressions would
be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation followed increasing reports of corruption
and embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
MP Othieno Akika said, however, it would be unwise to adopt
the report with the proposal because it would make the public view
Parliament as an institution which condones corruption.
</P>
<P>
MP Winnie Babihuga proposed an amendment, seeking to
disassociate Parliament from the setting up of the Amnesty
Commission. "No amnesty should be given to corrupt leaders,"
Babihuga said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is reportedly rated as 11th most corrupt nation in the
world, and the government vows to fight against corruption with
greater efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges Private Sector to Participate in Housing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has appealed to the
private sector to join in the government's efforts to provide
decent housing for the disadvantaged people, The Guardian reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Regional Council for Africa of the
Global Parliamentarians on Habitat in the capital Abuja on Tuesday,
vice president Atiku Abubakar said the government could not
effectively provide housing for Nigerians at affordable rates
without the active involvement of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the housing scheme was one of the cardinal
programs of President Olusegun Obasanjo's administration, adding
that the budgetary allocation to housing and improvement of human
settlements showed the government's determination to achieve the
goals.
</P>
<P>
The underlining philosophy of this integrated approach to
social development was to improve the conditions of human
settlements for Nigerians and make them actualize their
aspirations and become productive citizens, said Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Seize Goods Without Clean Inspection Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
announced that all imported goods without Clean Report of
Inspection (CRI) would be seized outright from the end of this
month, the Post Express reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the capital Ajuba on Tuesday,
Minister of State for Finance Jubril Martins-Kuye said that the
tough measure became inevitable because "some unscrupulous
importers" had continued to ship non-CRI goods into the country,
in flagrant disregard of the government's import guidelines and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Kuye noted that before embarking on the measure, the government
had allowed two months' grace period but the offenders would not
change.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the government would take necessary measures
to scrutinize importers to comply with the new regime of import
regulation, adding that the Nigeria Customs Services would be
assisted to ensure proper monitoring of the scheme's
implementation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Nigeria's revenue of duty tax has been
declining in the past few years while the volume of the goods
imported into the country were on the rise as a result of
corruption of the customs officials and malpractice of the
importers.

<HEADLINE> Indiana University to Pay Knight over Dlrs 1 Million Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Septerber 13 (Xinhua) -- Indiana University will
pay fired basketball coach Bob Knight 1.3 million U.S. dollars in
deferred compensation over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
University counsel Dorothy Frapwell said Tuesday that the
university would pay Knight the money owed him from the
compensation fund, but could not say when the first payment would
be made.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the university deposited as much as 80,000 dollars
a year in a deferred compensation fund, payable to Knight after
his departure from the university. The final deposit of 80,533
dollars was made Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of his contract, Knight will forfeit the
compensation if he affiliates with any NCAA Division I men's
basketball program in the states of Indiana or Kentucky, or at any
member of the Big Ten Conference within eight years of leaving
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
In addition to collecting his deferred compensation, Knight
will also be paid the remaining two years of salary owed him under
the contract that runs out June 2002.
</P>
<P>
After having a 30,000 dollars fine deducted from his salary, he
will collect nearly 140,000 dollars this year. He will be paid
more than 170,000 dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Knight, who was as well known for his outbursts as for his
three NCAA championships, was fired Sunday for a "pattern of
unacceptable behavior."
</P>
<P>
Knight was fired after a 19-year-old freshman said the coach
grabbed him and cursed at him after the student greeted Knight by
his last name. Knight said he had simply held the student's arm
and lectured him about manners.
</P>
<P>
Knight was replaced by assistant Mike Davis on Tuesday.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Reigning Olympic champions
Nigeria survived a big scare by netting an injury goal to level
the scoreboard 3-3 for the hard-fought one point in the men's
Olympic soccer tournament that kicked off Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In Adelaide, the Super Eagles pulled off a trademark comeback
with two goals through Victor Agali and Yakubu Ayegbeni in the
last 15 minutes, preventing Honduras from reaping a harvest of
three points after its nationals established a comfortable 3-1
lead through Julio Cesar Leon and David Suazo who scored his
second from the penalty spot in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ayegbeni's long-range strike came in the third minute of injury
time after Agali headed home a cross from Ayegbeni to put the
Atlanta champions at 3-2 in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, who beat Brazil 4-3 in Atlanta four years ago, is
missing most of its European-based stars.
</P>
<P>
In Canberra, Lukas Dosek's second-half penalty enabled the
European under-21 runner-up Czech Republic to tie the United
States 2-2 after the Americans led twice through Chris Albright
and Josh Wolff in the first 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
After Marek Jankulovski grabbed an equalizer, Dosek converted
seven minutes into the second half as American defender captain
Chad McCarty brought down Marek Heinz at the top of the penalty
box.
</P>
<P>
In Melborne, Italy, seeking for its first Olympic soccer gold
for 64 years, enjoyed the blessing of Lady Luck by beating the
hosts Australia 1-0 through Andrea Pirlo nine minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Pirlo, who scored both goals as Italy won the European Under-21
final in June, scored the winner through his right foot as his
shot hit the right-hand post and span over the goal-line before
Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiatti denied the hosts several
chances through outstanding saves.
</P>
<P>
In Brisbane, the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, three-times
African Nations Cup champions, savored a 3-2 victory over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After Nasar Alothman and Hamad Altlayyar squadered sufficient
chances with their headers, unmarked Nicolas Alnoudji converted a
cross from Geremi Njitap in the 35th minute for a first half lead.
</P>
<P>
Despite a string of counter-attacks by Bashar Adbulaziz, it was
substitute Khalaf Almutairi who scored the equaliser for Kuwait in
the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
Full of professionals in the European clubs, the Lions broke
the deadlock of a seemingly draw through Patrick Mbomo in the 70th
minute before Samuel Fils ran 20 meters to beat three Kuwaiti
defenders, forcing an own goal from Kuwaiti Jamal Abdulrahman for
a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Abdulrahman saved his credit by heading home a corner in the 85
th minute, but it was the end of the Kuwaiti challenge.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeking Ways to Reduce Dependence on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is actively seeking
ways to reduce its dependence on imported oil, as local motorists,
consumers, and manufacturers have suffered from soaring oil prices
over the past months, the Thai News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) launched a
pilot project, the Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV), aimed to
install free NGV converters to over 1,000 taxis by the next year.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to liberalize trade of ethanol, a
kind of alcohol used to produce an oil substitute.
</P>
<P>
The PTT's 24 million baht (585,000 U.S. dollars) NGV project
will also cover the installation of NGV converters in 300 public
buses of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority and 400 garbage trucks
of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration by the next year.
</P>
<P>
The NGV costs 50 percent and 60 percent less than diesel and
benzene respectively, leading to a combined fuel cost saving of
over 180 million baht (4.39 million dollars) a year under the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is also planning to increase the number of
NGV filling stations, promote the use of NGV by reducing import
tariffs on equipment used for NGV conversion, and launch campaigns
to expand the use of NGV in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alongkorn Polabutr, Secretary to Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, told a television economic news program Wednesday
morning that the cabinet would soon approve a plan to develop the
farm-crop-based ethanol as an oil substitute.
</P>
<P>
Experiments to use the ethanol in vehicles, such as tractors
and vans, had yielded satisfactory results, said Alongkorn, who
chairs a national committee in charge of the development of
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
The government would also introduce measures to liberalize
trade of alcohol used to produce ethanol and promote the use of
ethanol as an oil substitute to reduce the country's dependence on
imported oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Imported oil accounted for 90 percent of Thailand's oil
consumption over the past decades, according to Alongkorn.
</P>
<P>
Thailand imported 168 billion baht (4.2 billion dollars) worth
of oil last year, a figure big enough to spark serious efforts to
explore the use of ethanol as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Sunday
to boost global crude oil output by three percent, or 800,000
barrels per day, in a bid to ease soaring prices which has sparked
worldwide concern and protests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was widely viewed as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is particularly vulnerable to changes in world oil
prices. According to a report of the U.S. banking investment
company Merrill Lynch, oil consumption in Thailand rose by nearly
80 percent from 1990 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The country's growth rate will be shaved by one percentage
point or more in 2001, due largely to higher import prices, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> 4th lead: One Killed, Seven Seriously Injured in Jakarta Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed, seven
others seriously injured when a powerful bomb exploded at the
second floor of the parking area at Indonesia's Jakarta bourse
building (JSX) about 15:25 p.m. local time on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also destroyed dozens of cars parked near by the
location.
</P>
<P>
Officials who asked for anonymity said that most of the injured
were drivers who have been waiting for their bosses in the office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of the local police intelligence
Superintendent Hari Montolalu said that the material of the bomb
was still unknown "but it seems to be a locally made," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The explosion which took place just 200 meters away from the
Jakarta Police Headquarters (Polda) has forced Exchange officials
to suspend their trading activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 workers were evacuated from the multi-story
building which also houses the World Bank Offices, but a source
said that there are still many workers  trapped in the building,
while thick smoke from the building was seen skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
The blast was fueling fears of renewed instability in the
strife-torn Indonesia as it came up just a day ahead of the second
trial against former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw a series of bomb blast attacks from unknown
groups in recent weeks. On August 1, a powerful bomb exploded in
the front of the Philippine Embassy at Central Jakarta, killing
two, injuring dozens, including the envoy, Leonides Caday.
</P>
<P>
Late August, a small bomb also exploded inside an unoccupied
bus parked near by the agriculture ministry building, where former
President Soeharto was being tried for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on July 4, a bomb also blasted in a toilet at the
third floor of the attorney general office building.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred just half an hour after the youngest son
of the former president, Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra was
questioned by prosecutors at the AGO for corruption cases. Police
also found another bomb package which was ready to blast in AGO
building.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Lawmakers Urge Cohesiveness Among Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Wednesday called
for cohesiveness among ASEAN members to make the organization a
strong regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
In closing the 21st General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-
Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) here, legislators agreed that
political cohesiveness is a critical element for ASEAN to be
strong.
</P>
<P>
They recognized that an immediate priority is to integrate
newer members into the organization as there is an economic gap
between the older and newer members.
</P>
<P>

president of the AIPO, said that AIPO welcomes the development of
the Mekong sub-region as a rallying point for ASEAN integration.
</P>
<P>
AIPO also welcomes the idea that ASEAN members with IT
capabilities should help the newer members, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
The more than 170 delegates from the eight ASEAN member
countries also reiterates the call for members to continue
structural reforms and to remain committed to ASEAN's economic
liberalization agenda.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that ASEAN countries must take steps to
prepare itself for the transformation brought about by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Besides topics like regional economic integration and
globalization, lawmakers also discussed issues like the
environment, education, the role of women in society and drugs.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, Tan Soo Khoon handed the AIPO
presidency to Thai House Speaker Bjichai Rattakul, whose country
will host the next AIPO general assembly.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> France Attacks Austria's Rightist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- French Delegate-Minister of
European Affairs Pierre Moscovici on Wednesday reiterated France's
condemnation of Austria's far-right Freedom Party and described
its leader Joerg Haider as "provocative."
</P>
<P>
In a statement one day after the European Union (EU) decided to
lift its sanctions against Austria, Moscovici said there is no
reason for Haider to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, we should make this decision because it was the
consensus of the 14 (other EU) countries... but there is at the
same time a constant vigilance against the party of Mr. Haider,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the party of Haider is "populist with an extremist
tendency, xenophobe, racist and not clear in its assessment of the
history of National-Socialism (Nazi)."
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to celebrate for the Austrian government,
the Austrian coalition and above all the provocative Mr. Haider,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Haider said Wednesday that the sanctions were lifted because
they were opposed by the public of the EU.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions were lifted to please public opinion -- for the
public it was clear that they were never justified," Haider told a
news conference in Klagenfurt, capital of Carinthia province,
where he is governor.
</P>
<P>
Haider resigned as leader of the Freedom Party in February, but
his move was seen as tactical.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed sanctions in February after the Freedom Party
entered a coalition government in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
But the three "wise men" appointed by the European Court of
Human Rights to evaluate the situation in Austria proposed last
weekend an end to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions included suspension of bilateral political
cooperation between the 14 other EU countries and Austria, a
minimum reception of Austrian ambassadors, and refusal to support
Austrian candidates for international posts.

<TEXT>
<P>
Canberra, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia was humiliated
here on Wednesday when they succumbed 3-0 to Germany in a one-
sided match which kicked off the whole competition of the Sydney
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Inka Grings turned out to be the hero of the German side as she
scored one goal and set up another which finished off Australia's
chance to fight back.
</P>
<P>
The striker opened the scoring in the 35th minute, silencing
all the home fans. Thirty-five minutes later, she curved a
pinpoint pass to unmarked Bettina Wiegmann who headed the ball
past stranded Austraila's goalie Tracey Wheeler from a close range.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Renate Linger put the icing on the cake in the
injury time when she lobbed in the conclusive goal. Wheeler
fingertipped the ball but failed to hold it.
</P>
<P>
Australian coach Chris Tanzey was disappointed with the loss. "
Obviously Germany was the better side," he said, "at a match of
this level, you can't make three deadly errors and expect to come
away with something."
</P>
<P>
"I have no argument with the result," he said.
</P>
<P>
His German counterpart Tina Theune-Meyer held that her team
deserved the win. "I was confident we will win the match from the
start, you see, we are a better team," she said.  She conceded
that the next match against Brazil would be tougher than this one,
but declined to make any further comments.
</P>
<P>
"We planned match for match," she said.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 5,000m gold medalist
Dieter Baumann of Germany will know his fate for the Olympics
Thursday when he appears at an arbitration panel hearing.
</P>
<P>
The German runner, who took gold at Barcelona 1992, arrived at
the team's training camp near Brisbane on Wednesday and left
shortly afterwards for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration panel of the athletics governing body, the IAAF,
will rule Thursday whether to uphold the German Athletics
Federation's (DLV) decision to clear Baumann of doping charges.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, 35, tested positive twice for the banned anabolic
steroid nandrolone, but was cleared after convincing prosecutors
and the DLV that he was the victim of a conspiracy after
revelations that his toothpaste was spiked.
</P>
<P>
If the IAAF rules Baumann violated doping regulations, he could
be suspended for two years.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China registered a monthly
imports record of 20.8 billion U.S. dollars in August, according
to the latest statistics from the General Administration of
Customs.
</P>
<P>
China's imports have maintained a rapid growth rate this year,
with the figure reaching 20.3 billion U.S. dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The swift increase is due to the fact that domestic and
overseas economic situations are getting better, and China's
market demand is increasing, therefore, enterprises need to expand
imports to satisfy the need of domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the prices of crude oil and non-ferrous
metals in the international market kept rising, the imports of
these commodities have naturally helped raise the import value.

<HEADLINE> Licenses Revoked for 50,000 Recreational Arcades in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 recreational
arcades in China have been stripped of their licenses during the
ongoing nationwide campaign against prostitution, gambling, drug
abuse and trafficking, which was kicked off July 1.
</P>
<P>
Tong Jianming, a senior officer with the Ministry of Public
Security, disclosed here today that Chinese police conducted
thorough inspections of more than 850,000 recreational arcades
across the country, according to statistics from 27 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, police investigated more than 30,000 cases
connected with prostitution, gambling, drug abuse and trafficking,
seizing more than 80,000 persons involved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, police handled over 4,400 cases which organized
and provided unhealthy services, leading to the dismissal of more
than 50,000 attendants of such services.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the operation, the Ministry of Public
Security has received more than 892 tips from the public, 312 of
which have proved to be reliable, according to one officer
involved in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, monitored by the ministries of public security,
supervision, culture, and the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce, aims to "adjust the general nature of China's
recreational industry, reduce the total number of recreational
arcades, and curb the occurrences of illicit activities in
recreational businesses."
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Chinese police focused on such problems as
the involvement of law-enforcement officers in prostitution,
gambling and drug-related crimes, as well as the frequent
admission of underage people into recreational facilities which
are open only to adults.
</P>
<P>
Places that have been most closely monitored in the crackdown
include dance halls, saunas and public bathing places, video
arcades, beauty salons, tea-houses, bars, Internet cafes, and
hotels.

<HEADLINE> Barak Condemns EU for Removing Austria Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has condemned the European Union's decision to lift
diplomatic sanctions against Austria, spokesman of the Prime
Minister's Office, David Baker, confirmed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released late Tuesday night, Barak said, "It is
important to impose sanctions for Austria as long as a party with
neo-fascist signs, such as the Freedom Party, remains in the
Austrian government."
</P>
<P>
Also in response to the EU's move, the Israeli Foreign Ministry
said, "We have noted the EU's decision to remove the sanctions on
Austria. On our part, Israel does not see at this stage any room
for reconsidering its position with Austria which includes (Joerg)
Haider's party in the government."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Israel has special sensitivity to the matter which
relates to xenophobia and racism," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Yaffa Ben-Ari told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Israel froze diplomatic relations with Austria after the new
Austrian coalition government which included the far-right Freedom
Party was created in February. Israel also recalled its ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The freeze on ties with Austria by the EU came last February
after Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel allowed members of the
Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider, who was notorious for his
sympathy with the Nazis and xenophobic remarks, to serve as his
coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
An EU experts committee recommended dropping the sanctions last
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 3 Foreign Oil Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's navy seized three
foreign oil tankers allegedly violating the Iranian territory
waters in the Persian Gulf, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the public relations department of the navy, the
three oil tankers under the flag of the United Arab Emirates,
Honduras and Belize were seized a month ago near the Kish Island.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, whether the tankers were carrying
illegal oil smuggled from Iraq. Iran had intercepted a number of
tankers earlier this year which were smuggling oil from Iraq in
violation of the United Nations sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
The three tankers were handed over to an Iranian court, which
issued a final verdict on September 7, the navy said.
</P>
<P>
Under the verdict, two of the tankers were "expelled" from the
Iranian territorial waters and the third one from Belize was handed
over to the security forces due to its "suspicious ownership," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Upgrade Ha Bac Fertilizer Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government plans to
upgrade Ha Bac fertilizer plant by a capital from China this month,
local daily Vietnam News (VNS) reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Improvements to the factory, which was built under the aid of
China in 1960s, are to be funded with a capital of 32.2 million U.
S. dollars from China following an economic and technical
cooperation agreement between Vietnamese and Chinese governments
on June 12, 2000.
</P>
<P>
One third of the total capital will come in the form of non-
refundable aid from China, and the rest of which will come from
interest-free loans from China, with a ten year repayment period.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will set aside a counter capital sum of 2.5 million U.S.
dollars, to cover the costs of transporting equipment, clearing
construction sites, hiring experts, and designing new facilities.
</P>
<P>
The plant will also be able to borrow Vietnamese counter
capital and additional capital at preferential interest rates, and
enjoy tax exemptions and reductions.
</P>
<P>
After the upgrades, Vietnam expects to increase the plant's
capacity to 90,000 tons of ammoniac and 150,000 tons of urea per
year, VNS said.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the plant is being seen as offering great promise
for the rebirth of one of the great bases of Vietnamese industry,
one which was once regarded as a symbol of friendship between
Vietnam and China, VNS added.

JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed, dozens
injured while dozens of cars burnt following a powerful explosion
which took place on Wednesday at the Jakarta bourse building (JSX)
about 15:25 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The trading activities were immediately suspended while more
than 1,000 workers were evacuated from the multi-story building
which also houses the World Bank Offices.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at the second floor of the parking
building of the bourse's office, was fueling fears of renewed

<P>
The explosion came up just a day ahead of the second trial
against former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw a series of bomb blast attacks from unknown
groups in recent weeks. On August 1, a powerful bomb exploded in
the front of the Philippine Embassy at Central Jakarta, killing
two, injuring dozens, including the envoy, Leonides Caday.
</P>
<P>
And late August, a small bomb also exploded inside an
unoccupied bus parked near by the agriculture ministry building,
where former President Soeharto was being tried for corruption
charges.

<HEADLINE> Russian Newspapers Hail Putin's Information Security Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia's leading newspapers
Wednesday set a positive value on the national information
security doctrine signed by President Vladimir Putin recently.
</P>
<P>
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta (Independent Newspaper) described the
doctrine as "the first ever such concept in Russian history," and
"a basic document for federal executive bodies" and "a part of the
country's national security concept."
</P>
<P>
The doctrine clearly explains the notion of information
security, determines its objectives and names four main elements
of Russia's national interests in the sphere of information, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Izvestia (News) newspaper noted that "the Kremlin intends
to stop watching idly how the mass media picture it or talk about
it, with sporadic and belated explanations or excuses offered by
officials."
</P>
<P>
The Kommersant (Businessman) newspaper stressed that the
doctrine is conspicuous thanks to the fact that each can find in
it whatever he wishes.
</P>
<P>
Its separate provisions are equally good for defending the
freedom of speech or muzzling the press, the Kommersant noted.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russia's Security Council, the top security agency
of the country, told a news briefing that Putin, also chairman of
the council, had approved the information security doctrine, which
sets out guidelines on information security and could herald
changes in liberal media laws.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency said Putin on Saturday signed the four-
part document, drafted by the Security Council last June. The
Security Council released the doctrine's highlights Tuesday and
said the 46-page document would be published in full later.
</P>
<P>
The doctrine says citizens have a constitutional right to
secure and use information. The government is obliged to explain
the basis for its policies on "socially important events in Russia
and abroad while ensuring the access of citizens to open state
information resources."
</P>
<P>
It also provided for upholding Russia's "spiritual renewal" and
"moral values, traditions of patriotism and humanism" as well as
the country's "scientific and cultural potential."
</P>
<P>
The state undertakes to develop information technology and
Russian mass media, computer techniques and telecommunications and
to protect information sources from illegal access.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council official said the doctrine was intended to
establish the status of both Russian and foreign news
organizations operating in the country, but changes would probably
be required to the country's law on mass media, adopted in the
early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Sulfuric Acid Causes Environmental Pollution in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The road connecting Kosovska
Mitrovica and Pristina was temporarily blocked early Tuesday, due
to a sulfuric acid spill at a battery factory located in Kosovska
Mitrovica, a northern city of Kosovo, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The UN-led KFOR force has taken some measures Tuesday to stop
the leak, but acid that spilled out after the pipes conveying it
burst on Monday is still leaking into the Sitnica river, some 200
meters from the spot where it flows into the Ibar river.
</P>
<P>
People were warned to keep away from the river, which flows
towards central Serbia, and to avoid contact with the contaminated
water, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Reliable Serb sources say that there are huge deposits of
sulfuric acid at the factory.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests EU Guide to Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,September 13 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Daniel
Vaillant suggested on Wednesday the establishment of a European
Union (EU) guide of "good practices" to fight money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the question of money laundering
organized by the EU presidency state France,Vaillant said that a
guide of good practices will help establish working relations
among EU countries in their respective fight against money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
He said that money laundering has become a serious threat to
European countries because organized criminal groups are entering
the national "economic tissues" by accumulating and re-investing
their illegal incomes.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the profits
accumulated through money laundering by criminal groups in the
world amount to 1,200 billion U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>

Luxembourg to discuss reinforcement of cooperation in fighting
money laundering among its 15 member countries.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Trade Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits has been growing rapidly year by year as
statistics show that cross-Straits trade via Hong Kong exceeded
100 billion U.S. dollars between 1995-1999, two times the total
amount for the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has gained a surplus of 116 billion U.S. dollars from
trade with the mainland, which plays a role in the island's
industrial upgrading and economic development, according to
sources with the fourth China Fair for International Investment
and Trade, which closed Tuesday in the port city of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
A favorable business environment in the Chinese mainland such
as economic strength, social stability and a series of
preferential policies, cited by Taiwanese businessmen, has
attracted an increasing number of Taiwanese investors.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwanese-funded enterprises set up in the
mainland in the first half of the year was 1,399, with a
contractual Taiwanese capital of 1.99 billion U.S. dollars, a year-
on-year growth of 13.65 percent and 31.29 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The more than 45,000 Taiwanese-funded enterprises now operating
in the mainland involve a combined contractual Taiwanese
investment of 45.75 billion U.S. dollars, of which 24.89 billion U.
S. dollars has been actually used.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwanese businessmen set up their first enterprise in
the mainland in 1983, they have put into the mainland more than
half of their investments made out of the Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
Li Bingcai, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council, said that the development of cross-Straits economic
exchanges and cooperation is in the best interest of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"It is the consistent policy of the mainland to encourage
Taiwan compatriots to invest in the mainland, and to protect their
legitimate rights and interests," Li noted.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Deals With Fraud in Export Rebate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in south
China's Guangdong Province dealt with more than 500 cases of fraud
export rebates in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local customs sources said the total value of the cases
exceeded 44 million yuan (about 5.3 million U.S. dollars). Both
figures showed drastic rises according to comparable statistics
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During that period, five of the cases were smuggling-related,
with the value amounting to 1.19 million yuan (about 143,373 U.S.
dollars). Both volumes went up dramatically from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
China has been offering rebates on exports to encourage foreign
trade companies to export more. The country's July 1, 1999, raise
of the export rebate ratio for certain commodities was
instrumental in lowering export costs, improving the
competitiveness of China-made commodities on the overseas market
and spurring export demand.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province is China's leading exporter. In the first
six months, the province exported 42.82 billion U.S. dollars'
worth of goods, up 32.8 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Export rebate in Guangdong for the January-June period amounted
to 8.527 billion yuan (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars), up 184.7
percent from the same period last year, accounting for 20 percent
of the national total export rebate volume.

A small loss occurred to the ten-year 010004, the top gainer of
yesterday. The bond slid 0.08 percent to 103.63 yuan, pushing the
yield up a little to 2.51 percent. The bond has an interest rate
floating 0.62 percentage points above one-year interest rate of
one-year bank deposits, which is 2.25 percent this year.

<P>
All the other bonds witnessed tame rises of no more than 0.08

China's repo market stayed quiet due to vacuity of impetuses.
Combined trade volume of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day

billion. The interest rate of the three-day repurchasing agreement
edged up from 3.3 percent t o3.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's securities investment
fund market, which was quiet in Wednesday's morning session,
became active in the afternoon, affected by the eight newly listed
restructured funds that were pulled up by Fund Tongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The discounted funds then became dynamic too till the market
close, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30 funds, 23 rose, and seven remained unchanged. No
funds dropped today.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the rebounds of restructured funds is that these
funds had moved downwards recently, and technically, it was time
for them to rebound, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts think that there is little possibility for
restructured funds to move upwards synchronously in the coming
trading session.
</P>
<P>
As for discounted funds, the top gainers today were funds whose
prices were lower than 1.1 yuan. After the recent downward trend,
these low-priced funds had no room to drop further.

Organization will conclude soon.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with President Adolf Ogi of the Swiss

Switzerland is one of the first western countries to recognize
China, and both the Chinese Government and people highly
appreciate this, Jiang said.

<P>
The Swiss Government's pursuit of the One-China principle and
its position of not engaging in any official contact with Taiwan
have laid a solid foundation for bilateral ties, he said, adding
the frequent contacts between leaders of the two countries have
also played a significant role.

<P>
ABU DHABI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A leading United Arab
Emirates newspaper Wednesday lauded the Palestinian "steadfastness"
to counter pressures exerted against them aimed at "extracting more
concessions" in the Mideast peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based "Al Bayan" said that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat had made an Arab tour that included Egypt and Oman
immediately after the Palestinian Central Council decided on Sunday
to postpone declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
"According to reliable sources in Cairo, Arafat has informed
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about some new ideas that have not
been yet determined and were discussed with the U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the sidelines of the United Nations Millennium Summit
held recently," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Washington's proposals, as pointed out by United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a press release, seems to
be aimed at continuing peace talks between the Palestinians and the
Israelis," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, Israel which seems to have scored a point in
its favour and stands on firm ground with the help of the U.S., is
hoping to get extra Palestinian concessions," the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 30,000 Jobs Created in 2Q in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Almost 30,000 jobs were
created in Singapore during the second quarter of this year,
bringing the overall gain in the first half to more than 43,000
jobs, according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Labor Market
Report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The healthy job creation did not help the unemployment
situation as the unemployment rate in June 2000 was 3.5 percent,
much higher than the average of 2 percent before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The services industries contributed the bulk of the job gains
in the second quarter, but these jobs are chasing after those who
are younger, more skilled and therefore seen as more adaptable to
the demands of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed the unemployment rate of those aged
below 30 went down by 34 percent compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the unemployment situation for those above 40
worsened by 23 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The labor market is tight in certain sectors, driving wages
upwards, with information and telecommunication professionals,
engineers and nurses as examples of highly skilled workers who are
in high demand.
</P>
<P>
MOM expects the unemployment situation to remain above the pre-
Asian crisis levels so long as there is mismatch between jobs and
the job seekers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges Continued Support for Palestinian Struggle </HEADLINE>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has pledged its
continued support for Palestinians' legitimate struggle for self-
determination.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to support the Palestinians in their just and
legitimate struggle for self-determination, and the establishment
of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in their
homeland in the near future," Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said at the Ministerial Meeting of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) Committee on Palestine during the
55th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York
Tuesday, Bernama news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the impending declaration of
Palestinian statehood was a natural and inalienable right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination, independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the long quest by the Palestinian people for
statehood would be finally realized.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia firmly believes that the security for all countries in
West Asia could only be assured through the establishment of a
just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the region, he said,
adding this should be based on the principle of land for peace and
the implementation of Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid also called on the international community to
continue to provide support for the rehabilitation of the
Palestinian economy to ensure viable and sustainable socio-
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Implementation of Investment Proposals in Bangladesh Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The present government of
Bangladesh has received more investment proposals in recent years,
but the implementation of the investment proposals received from
both home and abroad is relatively slow, according to official
statistics released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of investment proposals in the last four years
increased by 150 per cent and the amount of investment by 230 per
cent compared to those in the five years of the previous
government, according to the statistics of the Board of Investment
(BOI).
</P>
<P>
6,232 investment proposals, 5,658 local and 574 foreign, worth
13.291 billion U.S. dollars were registered with the BOI from 1996
to 2000. On the other hand, in the five years from 1991 to 1996, a
total of 4,180 proposals, 3,756 local and 424 foreign, worth 5.783
billion dollars were registered.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 per cent of the foreign investment proposals registered
with BOI from July 1996 to December 1998 has been fully
implemented so far while the implementation of the local
investment proposals registered during the same period is about 41
per cent.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration in law and order, lack of adequate infrastructure
and bureaucracy, were among the reasons responsible for slow
implementation of the investment proposals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Refuses U.N. Mission to Atambua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) strongly opposed on Wednesday the sending of
an United Nations mission to Atambua to probe into the bloody
incident during which three U.N. international workers were killed
by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias last week.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the House Commission I for security and foreign
affairs, Yasril Ananta Baharuddin said the House also refused any
form of intervention from foreign forces in Atambua (in Indonesian
East Nusa Tenggara province) incident.
</P>
<P>
"The House strongly opposes the U.N. mission to Atambua. The
whole people of Indonesia, not only the House, strongly opposed
such a plan. This is a sovereign country," Baharuddin told
reporters after presiding over a closed door meeting of the
Commission on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The House's opposition was in harmony with the government's
stance which expressed its disapproval of the U.N. mission to
Atambua.
</P>
<P>
"The planned U.N. mission to Atambua to launch an investigation
into the incident, well I think it is an intervention. We should
reject that. All elite politicians here, please leave your own
business or disputes and let's get together to oppose the
intervention. You know that (the mission) showed the arrogance of
the United States and other western countries," Baharuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Coordinating Minister for Politics, Social and
Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudoyono said the U.N. Security
Council (UNSC) decision to send a mission was to be regretted as
it was made while the Indonesian government was trying to respond
positively to the Council resolution for disbanding and disarming
the East Timorese militia group in East Nusa Tenggara or West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Baharuddin further accused the international community as "do
nothing" to deal with the East Timor problems, in particular those
who are still living at refugee camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of injustice in response to the case (Atambua
incident). They (western countries) have accused us while they
have no evidences. They have not yet launched a comprehensive
investigation, but they have made accusation that the Indonesian
government was behind the attack. They called themselves democrats
or something, but in fact, they broke the principle of innocent,"
Baharuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a parliamentarian, Tayo Tarmadi of the Indonesian
Military faction called on the U.N. Transitional Administration in
East Timor (UNTAET) to take immediate steps to deal with East
Timorese refugees who wished to go back to East Timor, saying "The
UNTAET should provide security guarantee to them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in an interview with Xinhua, Chairman of the East
Timorese-Makasar Youth Forum (Fopmatim), Wilhermino said the
number of East Timorese refugees in the border line of West Timor
reaches 130,000, and they are facing with food shortage.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices in Singapore Set to Rise Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Most oil companies in
Singapore believe that the city state's petrol prices will keep
going up if the current trend of rising crude oil prices persists.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's pump prices have gone up five times since the
beginning of the year, and they are now at their highest levels
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Even the recent decision by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise output by 800,000 barrels a
day, did little to stop the increase in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Given this, petrol companies in Singapore said they have no
choice but to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
Despite the higher prices, most petrol companies in Singapore
still find their profits much lower than before.
</P>
<P>
This is because petrol prices have gone up only by a marginal
20 percent to 30 percent since February last year if compared with
that of crude oil which has surged from about 10 U.S. dollars a
barrel to 30 U.S. dollars a barrel, or a 300 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Since Singapore's market is so transparent, when one company
raises its pump prices, the others will follow suit so as to
remain competitive. This results in similar pump prices.
</P>
<P>
Petrol companies said they have to rely on other marketing
measures to compete, like offering promotions or free gifts.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's health delivery
system will deteriorate further this year unless money can be
channeled into the health care sector, The Herald reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Stamps, Minister for Health and Child Welfare, said
Tuesday the ministry needs at least 440 million U.S. dollars in
the next budget to enable it to restore health care to the basic
levels, adding much more will be needed to significantly improve
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said that the situation has been worsened by the fact
that suppliers have stopped supplying goods and services because
of the hospitals' inability to pay.
</P>
<P>
Parirenyatwa in Harare, the country's premier referral hospital,
has to limit services as it is short of such basic needs as gloves
and essential drugs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Bill on Zimbabwean Democracy Sparks Heated Debate in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Democracy Bill
proposed by the U.S. sparked heated debate in the parliament of
Zimbabwe on Tuesday, with the ruling party's lawmakers strongly
oppose the bill while opposition lawmakers support it, newspapers
here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, which has passed through the U.S. Senate and is now
before the U.S. Congress, seeks to cancel all U.S. and other
international aid to Zimbabwe on allegations of the break-down of
the rule of law in the southern African country, a charge strongly
denied by the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
The Bill also seeks to provide over six million U.S. dollars to
the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Eddison Zvobgo, a legislator from the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf), put forward a motion
calling for the opposition of the bill.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-page speech, Zvobgo said the bill posed a serious
danger to the country and urged Zimbabweans to cast aside
transitory pains that divide them and stand as one in defense of
their fatherland.
</P>
<P>
However, MDC legislators said the Bill was a result of actions
taken by Zanu-pf and its government and they would not help oppose
it because it was not of their making.
</P>
<P>
MDC legislator Learnmore Jongwe said if passed, the effects of
the bill would last until the government restores the rule of law,
ensures free elections and implements a transparent land reform
exercise.

<HEADLINE> Russian Woman Killed in Terrorist Blast in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A woman was killed with her
daughter injured in a terrorist explosion Tuesday in Grozny,
capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, Russian news agencies
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted witnesses as saying that a man,
driving a light truck, came to a market place in the city's
Oktyabrsky district, set off an explosive device and escaped.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed a 35-year-old woman identified as Sharli
Antomirova and seriously injured her 12-year-old daughter Pidmat,
said the local police, adding that the girl has been hospitalized
and is in a grave condition.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax report, citing the Russian Interior Ministry's
temporary press center for the North Caucasus, said "a man,
driving a Gazel truck with a canvas cover and a local license
plate," set off an explosion at the market place and fled, killing
a 35-year-old woman and gravely wounded her daughter.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to establish the motives of this crime at this
stage, but law enforcement agencies view the incident as an
intimidation of the local population, which refuses to help rebel
guerrillas, the press center said.
</P>
<P>
Police have started an investigation and are searching for the
truck driver.

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Windy conditions have scared
many an athletes in Sydney as the Millennium Olympics is only two

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Xumei, Asian records holder
of women's 100 and 200 meters, said here on Wednesday it will be
hard for her to enter the top eight in the women's 100m in the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I was very unlucky in the past two years," she said. "Last
year, I suffered a knee injury and since early this year I have

</P>
<P>
"If I'm lucky enough to be drawn in a good group, perhaps I can
enter the final eight," said the 23-year-old Chinese.

Li became a world-class sprinter in the 1997 Chinese National
Games by setting the Asian 100 and 200m records. Her 100m personal
best of 10.78 seconds lifted her to the top five fastest women in
history.
</P>

Li will also compete in the women's 4X100m relay. She anchored

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite two absentees, the
Chinese sharpshooters still cherish the hope of reaping two gold
medals from the Millennium Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shengwei, head coach of the 22-member Chinese shooting

<P>
However, China will miss the men's pistol competition without
sharpshooter Zuo, coach Sun acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The medal hopes for China will be pinned upon Zhao Yinghui and
Tao Luna in the women's air rifle and pistol events respectively,
the coach said.

"We have a batch of athletes who have achieved good scorings in
the world arena these years, and they are full of confidence of

GUANGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cultural
administration workers in the economically prosperous province of
Guangdong revoked the business permits of 1,968 places of
entertainment in a province-wide effort, since August, to rectify
the province's entertainment market.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, workers inspected more than 10,000
computer game clubs, song and dance halls, video compact disc show
centers, computer and internet bars, and other cultural
entertainment establishments. The investigation found that 4,619
of these kinds of businesses were in violation of relevant rules
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to shutting down 1,968 entertainment sites, most of
them engaged in computer games and gambling, the workers also
ordered another 2,651 establishments to close down and improve
their business practices within a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, special phone numbers have also been
advertised across the province to encourage citizens to report
cases where relevant entertainment rules and regulations have been
violated. Zhuhai and Zhongshan have recruited people from
different walks of life to be supervisors and help standardize
operations at entertainment businesses.

<HEADLINE> Shantou: Two Decades of Earthshaking Changes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shantou has now shifted from an export processing base in the
early years to an industrial center where ultrasonic and
electronic, textiles and garments, chemical, machinery-building,
food processing and pharmaceutical industries are flourishing. The
high-tech industry has expanded fast in the city, and the
scientific and technological progress made there contributes 43.8
percent to the city's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The city has made good use of the privileges given by the
central government to pilot the country's reform and opening-up
drive and published a dozen preferential policies to encourage
overseas investors to invest in infrastructure there.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the investment in fixed assets surged to 99.3
billion yuan from 1981 to 1999, including 25.5 billion yuan for
transportation, telecommunications and energy.
</P>
<P>
The city has been blessed with an airport, deep-water wharves,
and an international container berth. It is connected to Guangzhou,
the provincial capital of Guangdong, by Guangzhou-Meizhou-Shantou
Railway and to Shenzhen, another SEZ neighboring Hongkong, by an
expressway.
</P>
<P>
The telephone system of the SEZ has caught with the advanced
level of the world. Shantou is also an important node of
international information expressway, as it is one end of the
Eurasia International Seabed Cable and the Sino-American Seabed
Cable.
</P>
<P>
Shantou SEZ is also the home for 10 million overseas Chinese.
The improved environment, geographic advantages of being close to
Hong Kong and Macao, privileges in policy-making, land and labor
have turned Shantou into a destination with great appeal among
domestic and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 46 multinationals have invested in Shantou, and the
city now has 3,518 overseas-financed businesses which have pumped
5.07 billion U.S. dollars of capital into this south Chinese
coastal city. It has established economic and trade relations with
153 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The non-public economy has expanded rapidly over the past two
decades and has become Shantou's pillar for development. In 1999,
more than 70 percent of the city's total industrial output value

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Encourages Private Firms to Deal in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Guangdong
Province in south China has issued a series of policies recently
to encourage more private firms to engage in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
A circular urges local governments at all levels to create
favorable conditions to promote the growth of private foreign
trade companies for the development of a broad-based economic and
trade system.
</P>
<P>
The circular also asks local governments and related government
departments to drop biased policies against private companies
involved in foreign trade and to introduce policies that equally
treat state-owned, collectively-owned and privately-owned foreign
trade businesses, so that they can compete on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policies, private foreign trade companies
in Guangdong are entitled to enjoy state policies formulated to
spur export and raise the inflow of overseas investment, covering
financial support, tax reduction and exemption, exit and entry
inspection and quarantine, among others.
</P>
<P>
Private foreign trade companies in the province are encouraged
to attract more foreign capital and will get genuine aids when
they apply for permits to organize import and export. Their
business representatives will also be given convenient services in
completing procedures for overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is one of China's leading foreign trade players. It
did 140.35 billion U.S. dollars in imports and exports last year,
a rise of 8.13 percent over 1998.

<HEADLINE> Police Combat Fake Money in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The police have discovered 3.6
million yuan (about 434,000 U.S. dollars) worth of counterfeit
money and seized 162 suspects in Fujian Province, east China, over
the past five months.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling and selling counterfeit money is rampant in Fujian,
which is geographically close to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
Criminals often consider the coastal province as an important
passage for their illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Many of the criminals that have been caught by police have been
sternly dealt with, a police source said today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, counterfeit money with a face value of 36 million
yuan was seized in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The police found that the technology used to make counterfeit
money has improved constantly. Most of the fake bills have a large
face value, but there are also small bills that have been
counterfeited.
</P>
<P>
The police have focused their efforts on the port cities of
Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Putian, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Financial departments have conducted training courses for
employees so that they will know how to recognize counterfeit
money.
</P>
<P>
In the following months, the police said they will continue
with their investigations and try to prevent fake money in the
province from spreading to neighboring provinces.

<HEADLINE> China Sees West Movement of Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth margin of foreign-
funded firms in China's resource-rich western region has surpassed
that of the better-off eastern area, which Chinese economists see
as a good indication of more balanced economic development.
</P>
<P>
The message was released today by experts from the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) present at the Fourth China Fair
for Investment and Trade, which closed here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A report provided by the CASS economists shows that after 1990,
the number of foreign-funded firms increased by 44.65 percent
annually in the western region which is 14 percent higher than the
coastal area in the east.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded projects in the western region have been larger
in scale in recent years than before, with most of the investment
flowing to infrastructure, capital and technology intensive
industries and State-owned enterprises, said Hu Jingyan, director
of Foreign Investment Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The trend has been further encouraged by the country's
strategic development of the western region, which makes up 57
percent of the country's land, and has 90 percent of the total
impoverished population.
</P>
<P>
At the state-level annual investment fair in the coastal city
of Xiamen in southeast China's Fujian Province, companies from
China's midwest clinched 501 contracts involving 4.1 billion U.S.
dollars, much higher than the figures in any previous investment
fairs.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most active parts of China's opening-up policy,
foreign investment has been regarded as a significant component of
the economic development.
</P>
<P>
China wants the investment to go to the energy, mineral,
farming and animal husbandry, tourism, environmental protection
and new electronic component industries in the western region.
</P>
<P>
In order to give foreign investors a clear view of preferential
projects, China has issued a catalog on projects opened for
foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, pledged that the country would further relax
restrictions on the range and approval procedures of foreign
investment in the west.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed an increased contractual foreign investment
this year amounting to 27.64 billion U.S. dollars in the January-
July period. The amount to the western region accounted for 10
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China started to attract overseas investment in 1980. The year
1993 has been the seventh successive one for China to be the
largest country in absorbing overseas investment among the
developing countries. More than 350,000 overseas-funded firms have
started their operations in China by now.

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The second edition of a
Chinese book on economics, the only one in the world that reflects
the revolutionary change in economic thinking in the past two
decades, was published in Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Stiglitz, the author of the book and also a noted
American economist, gave a lecture on China's economic reform at a
press conference Tuesday in the People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz's book on economics is the bible of many university
economics majors and economics enthusiasts since its first Chinese
edition debuted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that compared with the first edition, the
new one is richer and comprehensive in content, with hundreds of
concepts and ideas.
</P>
<P>
The new edition concludes with a chapter focusing particularly
on China's economic reform. In the chapter, Stiglitz presents the
main characters of the socialist market economic system with
Chinese characteristics and offers suggestions for the "second
step" reform of the system.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China will bring in more
qualified personnel into its education system in the coming years
to improve the professional skills of the country's teachers, the
Ministry of Education said today.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that teachers possess the necessary skills, China has
set up a number of independent normal colleges to train primary
and high school educators.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, China had a total of 227 normal colleges
and universities with 845,000 students, according to ministry
statistics.
</P>
<P>
As the ministry encourages non-normal universities to help
train teachers, some universities are planning to set up colleges
or graduate schools specializing in education, a ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will recruit people with teaching certificates
from non-normal schools to improve the overall quality of the
teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry has initiated a state-funded talent-
recruitment project to attract students in schools overseas back
to domestic colleges and universities.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China has had a total of 17
college professors under age 30 since the country began its
profession designation system in 1986, according to the Ministry
of Education today.
</P>

Up to the end of last year, there were 425,600 teachers in
China's colleges, including 39,300 professors and 125,900

</P>
<P>
The country's current system of profession designation is
largely responsible for stirring teachers' desire to improve their
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The system helps improve teachers living conditions and social
status, and also provides a base for a new salary system for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
By last year, 67 out of China's 206,000 senior teachers in
China's middle schools were under 25 years old, and 45 out of 6,

SHANTOU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- After two decades of
development, Shantou, one of China's five Special Economic Zones (
SEZ), has rapidly moved to a higher position among large and
medium-sized Chinese cities in terms of comprehensive economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
The Shantou SEZ, a medium-sized city on the eastern coast of
south China's Guangdong Province, created 21.9 billion yuan in
gross domestic product (GDP) last year, about 36 times the
comparable statistics in 1981, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The SEZ was set up in 1980 and recently celebrated its 20th
anniversary of its founding in late August.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning the SEZ was just a small export processing
zone in the city, taking up 1.6 square kilometers of space. In
1991, the SEZ expanded to cover the whole city with a total area
of 234 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
After two decades of efforts, Shantou has turned into a

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sees No Cases of West Nile Fever: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has seen no cases of the
fatal West Nile Fever, a mosquito- and virus-borne endemic which
has claimed seven lives in neighboring Israel, the semiofficial
Jordan Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Tareq Suheimat stressed that the public need
not to worry about the disease as the kingdom's dry weather does
not provide a fertile breeding ground for the species of mosquitoes
which carry and transmit the virus of the disease, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The particular type of mosquitoes, only present in humid
environment, transmit virus for West Nile Fever to human beings if
the mosquitoes are infected themselves.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that birds are the original host of the
virus, but the virus can not be transmitted from birds to birds,
nor from one person to another unless they are bitten by the
infected mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Israel has been reportedly affected by the
endemic disease and seven people died as a result.
</P>
<P>
The Hod Hasharon Municipality in northern Israel has been
spraying pesticides to check the proliferation of the mosquitoes.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak admitted Tuesday that he
will not be able to gain Knesset (parliament) support for a
permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing closed meetings of One Israel cabinet ministers and
Knesset members, Barak said that as long as the peace process
continues, his only hope is to include 50 legislators in his
coalition and gain the support of another 10 from the outside,
mostly Arab Israeli deputies.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Northern District Police Commander Alik Ron has asked
Yossi Sedbon, the head of the Investigations Branch, to authorize
an investigation against Mohammed Barakeh, an Arab Israeli Knesset
member, on suspicion that he incited Arab citizens in the north of
the country to attack policeman.
</P>
<P>
The suspicion focused in part on a declaration Barakeh made
recently about the demolition of houses of Arabs in the Galilee.
Barakeh maintains that the most extreme statement he made in that
connection was that "the right to a roof over one's head takes
precedence over the duty to obey the law."
</P>
<P>
Knesset member (MK) Ahmed Tibi of Balad (Arab Movement for
Renewal) faction accused the police of engaging in "witch hunts
against Arab MKs, each in his turn. This is police terrorism, led
mainly by Alik Ron." Tibi also accused Ron of making "racist"
statements.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A special "fogging" was sprayed in the town of Hod Hasharon
and Karmiel Tuesday evening in order to kill mosquitoes, potential
carriers of the West Nile Fever virus.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry Tuesday authorized eight local
governments to combat the spread of the disease by using the
special method, which is said to be more potent than normal
spraying.
</P>
<P>
Eighty Israelis have reportedly fallen with the disease, and
seven died since the beginning of August. The Health Ministry
reported another 17 cases on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Twelve residents of the Arab city of Umm al Fahm have been
indicted in Haifa District Court on suspicion of using and trading
weapons and other armament. The indictment alleges that they were
involved in illicit transactions with residents of the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
A separate group of 29 Arab Israeli residents of the same city
had also been charged in Haifa District Court with what the police
say are nationalist-inspired offenses, including illegally
purchasing of guns and cooperating with elements in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Northern District Police Commander Alik Ron maintained
that the activities of the two groups could lead to terror.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lankan Election Chief's Anti-fraud Decision Causes Widespread Concern  By Zhang Yadong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The anti-fraud decision made
by the Elections Commissioner of Sri Lanka to use the first ever
introduced special stickers on the polling cards for the upcoming
general elections has caused widespread concern and controversy in
recent days in this small island country.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner K. Senanayake told the state owned Daily
News Tuesday that the Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake
has decided to use the special polling card stickers to prevent
fraudulent cards in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Since last week when the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
discovered the special polling card stickers at a private printing
press Dissanayake has been put on the spotlight of a controversy.
</P>
<P>
In a raid to a private printing press in Colombo, capital of
Sri Lanka last week, the CID seized a total of 100,000 secret
stickers printed for the general elections on an order issued by
the Election Department. President Kumaratunga has ordered a full
inquiry into the matter. The CID has formed a special team headed
by its director to carry out the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Political parties, election organizations and the general
public have been deeply concerned that Dissanayake's decision was
not able to ensure the security and confidentiality in the
elections, running counter to his intention for a free and fair
election.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Freedom Party (SLFP) general secretary S. B.
Dissanayake, who is also the Samurdhi, Youth Affairs and Sports
Minister, accused Dissanayake of not conveying his decision to
President Kumaratunga and the government. "This has raised doubts
in the minds of the government and the general public," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has questioned why Dissanayake entrusted the
printing of the stickers to a private printer instead of a state
printing department, which normally undertakes all poll-related
printing tasks.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation, however, Dissanayake said that
it is the commissioner's responsibility to adopt "whatever legal
methods he thinks fit" to conduct elections in a free and fair
manner. He was to disclose this measure to contesting political
parties, independent groups and the media at the "appropriate time
" in order to prevent any unscrupulous persons from attempting to
sabotage the secret plan, he argued.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United National Party (UNP) general
secretary Gamini Atukorale said that if the Commissioner of
Elections has printed stickers with the objective of holding the
forthcoming general elections in a free and fair manner, his party
would approve it.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the UNP are arch rivals
to dominate the 11th Parliamentary general elections. The SLFP is
the flagship party in PA.
</P>
<P>
PA's media coordinator Ananda Goonatilake even filed his
complaint with the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission through a
special petition against Dissanayake, accusing him of violating
human rights of voters.
</P>
<P>
The JVP, or the People's Liberation Front also accused the
government of attempting to win the elections through fraudulent
means and not allowing Dissanayake to carry out his job in an
independent manner required under law.
</P>
<P>
The People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), an
election monitoring agent, said in a press release Tuesday that
the printed material appears to have reached unauthorized persons
who may make unlawful use of it for election-related purposes.
</P>
<P>
It said that PAFFREL has received numerous inquiries from the
media as well as people concerned regarding the stickers that had
been discovered by the CID at a private printing press.
</P>
<P>
PAFFREl was involved in the election monitoring process during
last December presidential election together with the Movement for
Free and Fair Elections. The two election monitoring bodies have
planned to mobilize a total of 8,000 to 10,000 local volunteers to
serve as election observers in the polls.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 political parties and 99 independent groups with
5,048 candidates, the largest number in the history of polls in
Sri Lanka, are to contest the elections scheduled on October 10.
Some 12 million eligible voters will cast their ballots in 22
electoral districts to elect 225 parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Since the dissolution of the Parliament on October 18, election-
related violent incidents are on a rapid increase. The center for
Monitoring Election Violence said Tuesday that it had recorded a
total of 204 incidents of election-related violence. The campaign
period of the 2000 general election is only one week old but it
already shows signs of being one of the most violent in Sri Lanka
in recent times, it added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday unidentified gunmen attacked a motorcade of UNP
candidates including Anura Bandaranaike, brother of President
Kumaratunga, in the suburbs of Colombo. Three people were admitted
to the Colombo national hospital due to the gunshot injuries.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Police has beefed up security around
Dissanayake's residence after he said he had received telephone
calls threatening his life. His neighbors claimed that they had
spotted armed motorcyclists roaming around his house.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's election campaigns in the past are marred by
violent incidents. Although the government has tightened security
in the run-up to the general elections, more election-related
violence seems not to be halted.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions' Strike in Bangladesh Disrupts Production in Mills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 48-hour countrywide strike,
enforced by the Bangladesh Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (
Bangladesh Workers and Employees Solidarity Front), ended
Wednesday morning amid widespread disruption in the production at
various state-owned and private mills and factories.
</P>
<P>
The Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (SKOP) held the strike to
press home it's 8-point demands, including announcement of minimum
national wages, immediate implementation of the wage commission,
shelving the privatization process, reopening of all laid off
mills and factories, reinstatement of all retrenched workers and
exercising trade union rights in all industrial units including
those in the export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
According to reports available, normal production in the state-
owned mills and factories at many places across the country was
disrupted due to the strike. The response to the rail-road
blockade program was, however, little.
</P>
<P>
During the 48-hour strike, workers brought out processions in
industrial belts in main cities including the capital, in support
of the strike and demonstrated in front of their respective mills.
In some districts, rival factions of workers locked in chase and
counter chase during processions. Police used tear gas to disperse
the angry workers.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the SKOP, a platform of 16 national federations,
having some 2,500 trade unions, will sit together soon and decide
their future strategies to realize their demands.
</P>
<P>
Representing about five million workers and employees of state-
owned and private-owned jute and textile mills, garment industries,
riverine vessels, the SKOP signed an agreement with the government
more than two years ago stating the implementation of the minimum
wages for workers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Although 32 months have passed after signing the agreement, the
government has failed to announce the minimum wages for workers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Drops Further on Weak Regional Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso further
skidded against the U.S. dollar early Wednesday amid trailing
softer currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.700, weaker compared to the previous close
of 45.600.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso tracked the downward direction of the
Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
The rising political woes in the country further dampened the
sentiment on the peso.
</P>
<P>
They said, the government's plan to consider a military assault
against the Muslim bandit group Abu Sayyaf to end the prolonged
hostage crisis in the southern Philippines has also caused the

MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine

The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, fell 7.49

But the broader all-shares index rose 8.25 points to 694.13.

Analysts said the government's plan to launch military attack
against the Muslim bandit group Abu Sayyaf to end the prolonged
hostage crisis in Mindanao has weighed further down the market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The falling peso, the new round of oil price hikes and the
anticipation of more interest rate increases, are also keeping
investors away from the market, they added.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Kenyans Arrested over Illegal Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)
has arrested 116 people for illegally felling indigenous trees in
the Mount Kenya Forest Reserve since mid-August, the major
newspaper Daily Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The KWS has dispatched 30 armed rangers to the Mount Kenya
Forest, said Nehemiah Rotich, director of the governmental agency,
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A forester and an accountant working with Kenyan Environment
Ministry have been charged with possessing 140 cedar poles,
according to the KWS, the agency responsible for the wildlife in
the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"Those two forestry guys must realize that they have to work
together to curb illegal activities in natural forests," said
Rotich.
</P>
<P>
The KWS have had 90 percent of the illegal logging activities
under control, Rotich noted.
</P>
<P>
Due to the severe drought and increased demand for timber, some
people have invaded the forest and illegally felled trees since
last month.
</P>
<P>
Mount Kenya Forest has been listed as one of the world's
natural treasures by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization because of its temperate-zone even cold-
zone wild plants and animals near the equator.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy in Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth rate
is estimated to have declined to 0.9 percent in the 12 months to
June, down from 1.4 percent in 1999 and 1.8 percent in 1998, the
Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted Tuesday in its monthly economic review for
September that the reduced economic activity was notable mainly in
agriculture, manufacturing and the service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, for instance, which contributes the largest share
of the real gross domestic product, is estimated to have expanded
by only 0.8 percent in the period, compared with 1.2 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the decline to the prolonged drought that
has adversely affected electricity and water supply, as well as to
the poor road network.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that caused to the slowdown in economic
performance, the bank said, were inefficient telecommunications,
port and railways services, and inefficient delivery of public
services.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the government has taken several measures to
eliminate the constraints to economic growth, including
restructuring parastatals in the agriculture and service sectors,
and improving governance through restructuring watchdog
institutions such as the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority and the
Central Tender Board.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the country's external debt declined
slightly to 4.56 billion U.S. dollars at the end of July from 4.57
billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
While domestic debt rose to 2.2 billion dollars at the end of
July from 2.1 billion dollars in June due to higher domestic
borrowing requirements as government receipts fell below target,
the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Anti-Money Laundering Headquarters to be Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 13 (Xinhua) An African regional
organization of anti-money laundering is scheduled to set up its
secretariat here before the end of this year, the official Daily
News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The information about the establishment of the secretariat of
the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group is
contained in a report to be presented by the Minister for Finance,
Daniel Yona, at the Commonwealth finance ministers' three-day
meeting which starts in Malta next Tuesday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian finance minister will inform the meeting of the
dispatch of Commonwealth experts here in the near future to start
work on the proposed secretariat, a senior official at the
Treasury was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that eight countries have signed a memorandum
of understanding for the secretariat, namely Kenya, Uganda,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, South Africa and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The anti-money laundering group was established in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha in August last year, which decided to set
up a secretariat a year later.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that the aim of the organization is to
curb money laundering in the region because the vice distorts
trade flow, destabilize
financial markets and is a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
At the Malta meeting, Yona, who is also chairman of the group,
is also expected to report on the strategies drawn up by the group
to fight the vice.

releasing more oil to the market alone will not help dampen

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) on Tuesday offered evidence for a mid-sized
black hole.
</P>
<P>
Black holes, matter-sucking vacuums in space, usually come in
only two sizes: small or extra large. Astronomers have theorized
for years that "missing links" or medium-sized holes exist. Using
NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists have
detected a black hole with the mass of 500 suns packed into a
region the size of Earth's moon in the M82 galaxy, some 12 million
to 15 million light years away. (U.S.-NASA-Black Hole)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 foreign funded
companies in Beijing have paid 3.7 billion yuan (445.8 million U.S.
dollars) in taxes during the January-August period this year, up
nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase mainly came from the tax on profits and income
taxes, according to statistics provided by Beijing Local Taxation
Bureau (BLTB). Over 90 percent of the 3.7 billion yuan of taxes
came from the two tax sources.
</P>
<P>
The BLTB attributed the taxation increase to an improved
investment climate in the Chinese capital, and the sound
performance of foreign businesses. The rapidly growing high-tech
companies represented by electronics and telecommunications also
accelerated the increase in tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and apartments for foreigners and advanced office
buildings have made more profits this year as they paid 20 percent
more taxes than the previous year. The hotel occupancy rate in
Beijing has increased due to dozens of international conferences
held in Beijing and more foreign visitors.

<HEADLINE> Graving of New Dunhuang Grottos Along Silk Road (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Silence lasting for six
centuries has been broken in Dunhuang, the location of many
ancient grottos, to create the modern Dunhuang grottos.
</P>
<P>
Named the Dunhuang Modern Grotto Art Project, the herculean
project was initiated by Chang Shuhong, famous artist and the
first director of the Dunhuang Research Institute. Groundwork for
the graving was launched in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new grottos were created on 30-meter high cliffs on the
side of the Danghe River, twenty kilometers from where the Mogao
Grottos, listed as a world heritage site, are perched.
</P>
<P>
Construction for the modern art project has taken place.
Tunnels linking the grotto gate on the cliff to the caves
underground are also under construction.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 year ago, a Buddhist monk dug out the first
grotto on cliffs of the Sanwei Hill, Dunhuang. Continuous grotto-
cutting and Buddhism-related artistic creations lasted one
thousand years, leaving modern Chinese people a heritage of 45,000
square meters of mural paintings in over 700 grottos, which are
prided as one of the world's largest and most beautiful art
treasures.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shuhong, had made great contributions to the protection
and research work on the Mogao Grottos since he abandoned the
painter's life in Paris and returned to China in 1920s.

<P>
"Modern Chinese should resume grotto-cutting work, which
stopped 600 years ago in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) when the
imperial rulers gave up control of the Dunhuang area, because
grotto art is the mirror of ages and reflection of history," said
Chang Jiahuang, son of Chang Shuhong.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1958, Chang Shuhong proposed to "record great
manifestations of the ages" through grotto art. "Cutting new
grottos is the posthumous task of my father and his long-cherished
wish before his death," Chang Jiahuang said, who inherited his
father's ambition to study traditional Chinese paintings
techniques in Dunhuang's grottos.
</P>
<P>
"Our task lies not only in protecting, studying and publicizing
Dunhuang's art, but also in displaying modern art," Chang Jiahuang
said.
</P>
<P>
At this belief, the artist began an unprecedented huge cultural
project: to cut new grottos.
</P>
<P>
He ended his vagrant life in Japan and came back to Dunhuang in
1996 to start the project. He raised fund by selling his paintings
and was financially supported by his mother's savings.
</P>
<P>
"The motif of new grottos should be concentrated on and in line
with folk features and can not be copied anywhere," he said,
adding that it would better have support from world-class art
masters.

<HEADLINE> More People with Ethnic Background Take Teaching Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 900,000 people with
ethnic backgrounds are now taking teaching positions in China,
accounting for 7.7 percent of the country's total population of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education said that due to
efforts made by the central government, including establishing
normal colleges, reinforcing training and improving the status of
teachers' living conditions in predominantly ethnic areas, more
people from ethnic backgrounds want to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, about 288,820 middle school teachers in China were of
different ethnic backgrounds, 107 times that of 1949 when People's
Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, about 16
primary school students share a teacher, and the ratio is ranked
third in the country. The official said that this indicates that
the Chinese government has paid close attention to education and
teachers in predominantly ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
China now has about 40 normal academies in predominantly ethnic
areas, and 110 normal middle schools, with nearly 100,000 students
with ethnic backgrounds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Organ Donation Increases 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released
Tuesday show that organ donation had increased by nearly 4 percent
in the United States during the first half of 2000, after
remaining flat in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There were 2,978 organ donors in the first six months of the
year, a moderate increase from 2,875 during the same period of
1999, according to statistics compiled by U.S. Department of
Health and Human Service and the Association of Organ Procurement
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to raise awareness about the importance of organ
donation appear to be paying off, but with 71,000 people on the
transplant waiting list, we still have a long way to go," Donna
Shalala, secretary of the department, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Organ donation rose 6 percent in 1998, the first substantial
increase since 1995, but was unchanged in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The department released guidelines on the same day to help
hospitals and organ banks implement new rules that require
hospitals to notify organ banks whenever someone dies in the
hospital. The goal is to be sure that organ donation professionals
evaluate each potential donor and talk with their families when
appropriate.

<HEADLINE> Dokic's Father Has to Pay for Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian tennis star Jelena
Dokic's father Damir Dokic will have to pay for his tickets if he
wants to see his daughter play at the Sydney Olympic Games,
officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dokic was not accredited as his daughter's coach, Australian
Olympic Committee Assistant Chef de Mission Peter Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Dokic is not a member of our team, but we are keen that he
will be able to purchase tickets the way the other parents (of
players) have done through the tickets provided by the Australian
Olympic Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He's not an accredited coach and he won't have that pass,"
Australian women's team coach Lesley Bowrey said.
</P>
<P>
The elder Dokic was banished from Wimbledon in July and a
junior event in England earlier in his daughter's career for rowdy
drunken behavior.
</P>
<P>
Last month he was chased from the US Open by security staff for
an angry scene in a cafeteria and now faces the prospect of being
barred from the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
Officials are to announce imminently whether Dokic will be
banished from future WTA tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Jelena Dokic is expected to arrive in her home town from Europe
late Thursday and would be at Friday's opening ceremony, Bowrey
said.

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- England's Wendy Toms would be
unable to referee the women's soccer match between China and
Nigeria after she slipped on the floor of her hotel bathroom and
slightly sprained an ankle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Toms, the first woman ever to run the line at an English

competition.
</P>
<P>
FIFA called in Norwegian referee Vibeke Karlsen to take charge
of the China-Nigeria match while Toms recovers.
</P>
<P>
Toms is the only British representative involved in the
football competition. Britain does not enter a team for the
Olympics because England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are
all individual members of FIFA, but Britain is a member of the
International Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Father of Multiple Births (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1992, a low-income family with triplets in Yuhang city of
the province was plunged into financial difficulty as a result of
their new additions.
</P>
<P>
Hearing their story, Lou contacted a baby food company,
Beingmate, and convinced the president to donate 2,000 yuan to the
family. The president was so willing to help that he arranged for
his company to provide food for the three kids until they are
three years old.
</P>
<P>
But Lou didn't stop there, asking the company to give special
treatment to all families that have multiple births. The generous
executive agreed.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, Beingmate has helped more than 200
families that have multiple births with more than 1 million yuan (
about 120,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In February of 1998, a young migrant worker in Hangzhou gave
birth prematurely to triplets, two boys and a girl who suffered
from congenital birth defects. The woman considered abandoned them
as they could not afford their high medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Lou wrote an article about her situation that resulted in
donations of 25,000 yuan (about 3,000 U.S. dollars) from people of
all walks of life. The triplets received the necessary medical
attention and now call Lou "Daddy." The mother was so grateful
that she asked Lou to name her children. He chose "Yi," "Hang" and
"Zhou," which, put together, means "remember Hangzhou."
</P>
<P>
"As a journalist, I have responsibilities to help those special
families," Lou said.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Vilification of Religious Situation in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Administration of Religious Affairs today refuted the slander
about China's religious situation in the 2000 Report on
International Religious Freedom by the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
"The report vilifies China's policy of religious freedom by
distorting facts and spreading rumors," the spokesman said,
stressing that the U.S. government is "grossly interfering in
China's internal affairs" under the pretext of religion, and that
China is "extremely indignant" about it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report, completely disregarding the true nature of
Falun Gong cult and its damage to the society, blamed China's
crackdown on the cult, "this is extremely ridiculous and
unreasonable," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong, an out-and-out evil cult, is directly responsible
for the deaths of more than 1,600 followers who committed suicide,
or died from refusing medical care because cult leaders told them
to, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 651 became mentally ill and thousands upon thousands of
families were shattered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has maintained that the majority of
Falun Gong practitioners have no idea about its cultic essence.
They have been cheated and finally become victims of the cult, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has adopted a policy of persuasion,
education and protection toward these people without
discrimination or exclusion, which has helped most of them rid
themselves from the psychological control of the cult, according
to the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government has been dealing with the Falun Gong cult in
accordance with the law, showing extreme tolerance in persuading
and helping the victims, and its efforts are irreproachable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Should we protect human rights by following suit with the U.S.
government -- sending armored vehicles, helicopters and cannons in
to deal with cults?" the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the U.S. report has been based
on rumors and lies.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Xu Yongze, mentioned in the report, who
was sentenced to prison for breaking the penal codes of China but
has served his term and been released. Another person, cited in
the report, Su Zhimin, was once detained for disrupting social
order.
</P>
<P>
The report claims that the release of the two has been
postponed or their whereabouts are unknown. "This is not true,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhiguo, who has been engaged in some improper activities,
has not been given any criminal punishment at all because he has
not committed a crime. But in the report, Jia was described as
having been arrested even though he was innocent. The truth is
that "Jia has always been leading a normal life," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that after the young Garmaba, a living
buddha of Lamaism, left China, his temple, the Tsurphu Monastery
near Lhasa, was closed and tourists are forbidden to visit.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the temporary closure of the Monastery was because
renovation was being done to a valuable fresco. Pieces of the
fresco have been falling off, seriously damaging the building, and
it was closed for restoration in response to experts' proposals
and the Monastery reopened shortly after the renovation was done,
he said.

"Relying solely on rumors and lies to accuse other governments
and interfere in internal affairs of other countries is a mistake
repeatedly made by the U.S. State Department report," the
spokesman said, adding that "This bad habit should be addressed."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the so-called suppressing
the underground Catholic churches and family gatherings of
Protestants in China is groundless.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Patriotic Association of China and the Catholic
Bishops' Conference of China uphold the same religious beliefs as
other Catholic churches across the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years and more, there has been an annual
increase of up to 50,000 Catholic followers and there is no need
for them to go "underground," he said.
</P>
<P>
China fully respects Bible study gatherings of Protestants,
usually attended by relatives and friends, in which they pray and
discuss the Bible, and never interferes in their religious
activities, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The government does not require religious followers to register
their family gatherings with regulatory bodies, does not restrict
or interfere with their normal religious activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the U.S. report does not really
say anything new, but is merely "playing the same old string."
</P>
<P>
It just quotes stories and rumors that have been clarified and
refuted, which shows that the United States doesn't truly care
about religious freedom, it just wants to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs and seek hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
"Such deeds should naturally be unpopular," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh National Airline Looks for Strategic Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Authorities of Biman
Bangladesh Airlines, after signing a deal with the Collective
Bargaining Agents (CBAs), are now looking for an internationally
reputed strategic partner under the restructuring and
commercialization program to make it a profitable concern, The
Bangladesh Observer quoted official sources as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alongside improving professional skills of the airline staff,
Biman also needs a number of new generation aircraft, which it
could not purchase or add to the fleet for want of money.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government earlier this year appointed
American CitiBank Consortium under a World Bank-financed program
for restructuring and commercialization to make the airline
internationally competitive and commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
Sensing possible retrenchment, Biman's CBAs initially went for
protest demonstration, but ultimately ended up with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the restructuring program, 40 percent share of
the Biman will go to its strategic partner. In turn, Biman will
get an equity of 6-7 billion taka (111-130 million U.S. dollars).
The partner will operate on behalf of Biman in certain
destinations where Biman will not be able to cover.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 9 percent stake will be enjoyed by the officers and
employees of Biman Corporation and the remaining 51 will be
retained by the government.
</P>
<P>
The much-talked-about strategic partner will be an experienced
airline, which has no "business conflict" with Biman Bangladesh
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
"An American airline is most likely to be the strategic
partner since they have no problem with us anyway," an official of
Biman predicted.
</P>
<P>
Biman's fleet now consists of five wide-body DC 10-30s, three
wide-body Airbus A-310s, three F-28 executive jets and two ATPs.
It is now covering 25 destinations across three continents.
</P>
<P>
However, the national flag carrier is facing a setback in
coping with other international airlines on international routes
since its operational cost goes high for various reasons.

that "the time has come for Canada and Austria to re-engage at the
ministerial level, and resume full bilateral cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said he has read "the September 8 report of the '
Wisemen' mandated by the 14 other members of the European Union to
examine the Austrian government's commitment to European values
and the evolution of the Freedom Party of Austria."
</P>
<P>
Canada will continue to pay attention to the situation in
Austria with particular emphasis on the Freedom Party, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada imposed sanctions on February 7 this year for fear that
the ultra-right Freedom Party of Austria would lead the newly
formed coalition government towards racism.
</P>
<P>
"Since the imposition of the Canadian measures," the Austrian
government has introduced amendments to the Constitution to embody
the protection of ethnic groups and has tabled a study on the anti-
racism measures it has undertaken, according to the Canadian
government.

<HEADLINE> Study: Blood Transfusion May Kill Kidney Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A study released on
Tuesday shows that a new, experimental approach to treating tumors
-- transfusing blood cells from a patient's sibling -- can reverse
the spread of kidney cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, said the cancer killers are T-cells, the roving attack
dogs of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest advance in kidney cancer in my research
career -- in my almost 22 years of doing kidney cancer research,"
said Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang of the University of Chicago, a
medical adviser for the Kidney Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
The study describes the first 19 people to get transfusions to
treat cancer which had spread from the kidney. Tumors disappeared
completely in three, and shrank to half their former size in seven
others.
</P>
<P>
Only two of those seven had a later relapse, and one of them
improved again after additional treatment with a different immune
therapy.
</P>
<P>
The patients got transfusions of both stem cells, the immature
cells which develop into various kinds of blood cells, and T-cells.
</P>
<P>
Transfusions have been used for decades to treat leukemia and
other blood cancers, according to the authors who stressed that
this is their first use against solid cancers.
</P>
<P>
However, the authors at the U.S. National Institutes of Health
cautioned that the approach is still being studied and is itself
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that another problem is finding a donor.
There's only a one in four chance that a brother's or sister's
blood will be a good enough match for the patient's, they
explained.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 new cases of kidney cancer are found each year in
the United States. If it is caught before it spreads, removing the
kidney may cure the patient. But in about 11,000, it is out of the
kidney before it is found. Then it moves swiftly, often killing
within a year.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Olympic Official Sues News Outlets for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Gafur Rakhimov, vice president
of the Olympic Council of Asia and a member of the National
Olympic Committee of Uzbekistan, is suing three news outlets for
libel, his lawyer Mark O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said Rakhimov launched the action in Sydney and
claimed reports by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, the
Australian Broadcasting Corp. and Andrew Jennings, a British
journalist and author, are libelous.
</P>
<P>
Rakhimov was one of two Olympic officials refused entry to
Australia last week by the government, which cited "the safety and
security of the Australian community" as its main concern. Hong
Kong businessman and basketball official Carl Ching was the other
banned official.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch sought an explanation for the entry bans from Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, and accepted the decision after
receiving it.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read Wednesday by O'Brien, Rakhimov denied any
criminal links.
</P>
<P>
"I state categorically and unconditionally that there is no
truth in the allegations that I am involved in drug trafficking or
that I am a member of any organized crime syndicate at home in
Uzbekistan or anywhere else in the world," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Corporal Punishment Banned in Thai Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New regulations will only allow teachers to reprimand primary
and junior secondary students, to assign them extracurricular
activities or to place them on probation. Senior secondary
students and vocational students also may be suspended for up to
seven days.
</P>
<P>
College and university students will be subject to reprimands,
activity assignments, probation, suspension and expulsion.
</P>
<P>
Thai Education Minister Somsak Prissanananthakul was quoted as
saying that the new regulations complied with the 1999 National
Education Act.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Somsak said, the evidence indicated that corporal
punishment was not good for children.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should instead give the students advice and
inculcate a good conscience in them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somsak said teachers would be allowed to reproach students in
class, but more severe punishment would require the approval of a
special school committee.
</P>
<P>
"A committee considering the punishment of the students should
be set up in each institution to ensure that the children will be
treated fairly and to prevent the teachers' emotions from getting
at students," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parents who believed their children had been unfairly punished
could appeal to the committee. "Teachers breaking the new rules
can face investigations," Somsak said.

According to Forrester Research, the processes that are barely
able to handle today's 57 billion U.S. dollars in worldwide e-
commerce trade will be paralyzed by global e-commerce expected to
reach 6.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2004. "The high variability in

<HEADLINE> Report Says Computers Can Harm Young Children  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report by the Alliance for Childhood, a private non-profit
group that focuses on child development, explained that computers
and the Internet prevent preschool children from interacting with
each other and adults.
</P>
<P>
"Children need a healthy education, and computers cannot
provide them with a healthy education because children need a
living education -- with live people," said Joan Almon, a former
preschool teacher and U.S. coordinator to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Almon said some U.S. schools have cut back on teachers, library
books, music and arts programs, and field trips to parks, while
spending millions on computer hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
However, studies show that introduction to computers at an
early age does not heighten children's creativity and can cause
eye strain, repetitive stress injuries and obesity.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, children's social skill's are hindered as
schools reduce recess time, and increase computer lab time. It is
particularly damaging at a young age because the brain is most
active in terms of the socialization process, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
When children are playing with a computer they are not playing
with each other, said one educator, who believe that what computer
can create is a virtual world, not a real one.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agreed with the report. Alan Delamater, a
child psychologist at the University of Miami, acknowledged risks
such as posture problems and obesity, but said this was outweighed
by benefits such as educational games.
</P>
<P>
He said children need to learn to use computers at an early age
because they are part of modern life, but stressed that parents
need to monitor things like computer games.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Towering Giant Ready to Challenge US Dream Team by Sportswriter Xu Jicheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- September 12 was a special day
for towering Chinese cager Yao Ming, who arrived in Sydney in the
morning and celebrated his 20th birthday in the evening.
</P>
<P>
What made it more special for Yao Ming was that he had to leave
his parents in Shanghai for Sydney Olympics while his countrymen
were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, a Chinese tradition for
family get-together.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unique birthday for me, " said sweat-soaked Yao
Ming after one hour and 30 minutes training session in the evening.
"but I am happy with it."
</P>
<P>
Yao Ming was among the 279-member Chinese delegation who
arrived here yesterday and registered as an Olympian at the Sydney
airport.
</P>
<P>
"I became an Olympian just eight hours before I turned 20.
This is my first Olympic Games and I'm sure it wouldn't be the
last." added Yao.
</P>
<P>
Standing at 2.27 meters (7-6 feet), Yao Ming, the tallest in
the 10,000-residents Olympic village, will be the backbone for the
Chinese team with his rebounding and blocking threats.
</P>
<P>
One of Yao's mission in Sydney is to lead the Chinese team to
challenge the defending champion the United States in their group
A opening game on September 17.
</P>
<P>
"I don't fear the Dream Team," Yao said, "No matter who you are,
I will block anyone who want to make a shot in front of me."
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Yao holds a record of 18 blocks a game in
China's CBA League, where half of the 12 teams have American big
men as centers.
</P>
<P>
Yao Ming was born in Shanghai and his mother, 1.88-meters tall,
and his father, 2.08 meters tall, were both basketball players
during the 1970's and Yao Ming was their only child.
</P>
<P>
Before he was 13, Yao showed no interest in basketball and his
goal at that time was became a water polo star. But soon he found
the swimming pool was not deep enough for him. The 13-year-boy
often walked instead swam in the water.
</P>
<P>
After taking basketball for three years, the 16-year-old and 2.
20-meter tall "Little Giant", as fans at home called him, lifted
the Shanghai Sharks from the second division into the first
division in CBA. After another three years, Yao, seven centimeters
(2-1/2 inches) taller, propelled the Sharks to the runners-up from
sixth on the CBA standings.
</P>
<P>
Nobody doubted Yao will head to the NBA, some NBA scouts even
compared him with Rik Smits of the Indiana Pacers. But Yao does
not agree with it.
</P>
<P>
"I have everything Rik Smits has, yet Rike Smits doesn't have
something I have."

<HEADLINE> Kelly Free to Use New Pedal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Shane
Kelly of Australia is free to use new pedal system as it does not
breach any regulations, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI)
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's no problem. We do not have a special regulation for this
system," UCI chief Martin Swinkels said.
</P>
<P>
Kelly was considered an unbeatable favourite for the gold medal
in the one kilometer time-trial in Atlanta but lost any chance of
winning when his foot slipped out of the pedal straps.
</P>
<P>
Desperate to avoid a similar mishap in Sydney, Australia's team
mechanics developed their own slip-proof pedal which involves
strapping Kelly on to his bike then wheeling him into the starting
gates.
</P>
<P>
Kelly had tried to use a similar device at last year's world
championships in Berlin but was not allowed. Cycling Australia
president Ray Godkin said the new system was technically fine but
he needed UCI permission for team officials to wheel Kelly into
the starting gate once he was locked in.
</P>
<P>
Swinkels said the pedal would be allowed because there were no
specific rules on how a rider gets to the start as long as he does
it within the time limit.
</P>
<P>
"We only have the 50 seconds regulations for the start and
that's all. What happens in that 50 seconds is up to the coach
and riders to decide," Swinkels said.
</P>
<P>
The favourite to win the time trial gold in Sydney is Frenchman
Arnaud Tournant, the current world champion and world record
holder.

<HEADLINE> NASA Offers Evidence For Mid-Sized Black Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Tuesday offered
evidence for a mid-sized black hole.
</P>
<P>
Black holes, matter-sucking vacuums in space, usually come in
only two sizes: small or extra large. Astronomers have theorized
for years that "missing links" or medium-sized holes exist.
</P>
<P>
Using NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists
have detected a black hole with the mass of 500 suns packed into a
region the size of Earth's moon in the M82 galaxy, some 12 million
to 15 million light years away.
</P>
<P>
Unlike black holes with a mass of up to a billion stars that
tend to lie at a galaxy's center, the mid-sized black hole is
located some 600 light years from the heart of M82.
</P>
<P>
Small-sized black holes, known as stellar black holes because
many have the mass of just a single star, are scattered throughout
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
Black holes, which gobble up everything that comes near them,
not even letting light escape, are invisible to scientists but can
be detected by activity around their edges.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers had suspected that M82 might contain a mid-mass
black hole, but these suspicions were not confirmed until high-
resolution images made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory found that
most X-rays in the galaxy were coming from a single, bright source.
</P>
<P>
NASA scientists said that repeated observations of the M82
galaxy also show that the X-rays flicker, brightening and dimming
every 10 minutes or so. This flicker is the tell-tale sign of a
black hole slurping gas from a nearby star or cloud, they added.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the superior resolution of the Chandra
observatory played a key role in solving the scientific mystery.

The shrinkage in the surplus came as imports, boosted by rises

</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus contracted 15.5 percent to 1,163.
4 billion yen (10.9 billion dollars), with imports surging 10.8
percent from a year earlier to 2,984.6 billion yen (28.2 billion
dollars) while exports rising 1.9 percent to 4,148.0 billion yen (
39.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Crude oil imports rose 54.4 percent as the average price was up
75.5 percent to 29.28 dollars a barrel in the reporting month.
</P>
<P>
The service trade deficit shrank to 458.0 billion yen (4.3
billion dollars) from last July's 542.6 billion yen (5.1 billion
dollars), the fourth consecutive month of contraction.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Arrives in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuban high jumper Javier
Sotomayor arrived in Australia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old world record holder, whose two-year ban for
taking cocaine was halved to allow him to compete at the Sydney
Olympics, told reporters he had recovered from a leg strain upon
arrival.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, International Olympic Committee (IOC) vice-
president Dick Pound criticized the decision by the world
athletics governing body to cut Sotomayor's ban.
</P>
<P>
"It does seem to me something that is rather off-message in the
anti-doping field," Pound said. "This is not just a steroid. This
is a drug that is a serious problem in society in general."
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, the 1992 Barcelona Olympic champion, tested positive
for the recreational stimulant at the Pan-American Games last year.
</P>
<P>
He was cleared by the Cuban federation but banned for two years
by the International Amateur Athletic Federation's (IAAF)
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
Last month the IAAF's ruling council decided to halve the ban
on humanitarian grounds and allow Sotomayor to take part in what
he has said will be his last Games.
</P>
<P>
The case came under the spotlight again when senior IAAF vice-
president Arne Ljungqvist said Sotomayor had tested positive for
the same drug at least once since the Pan-American Games.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Encourages Use of Recycled Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Many primary school pupils in
Beijing have been encouraged to use recycled-paper notebooks for
their homework in an effort to save the trees.
</P>
<P>
The recycled paper, made from wastepaper instead of wood pulp,
has been widely used in industrial countries, with the recycling
rate of wastepaper in such countries over 60 percent. While the
rate in Beijing is less than 10 percent, or only some 100,000 tons
every year per 1.1 million tons of wastepaper.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Beijing's government offices have substituted
the recycled paper for regular paper. And the Beijing mayor and
deputy mayor now have recycled-paper business cards.
</P>
<P>
However, for the idea to gain popularity, local residents and
companies will have to support it. Paper producers said the
monthly sales of recycled paper stand at only about 60 tons.
Officials with the State Environmental Protection Administration
said the country is to carry out related policies to encourage the
use of recycled paper.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that one ton of wastepaper can produce some 850 kg

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to reclaim
more fallow and virgin lands in four years' time beginning April
2001, the start of the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The reclamation is to be made in the country's northernmost
Kachin state and northwestern Sagaing division where there are
large areas of untapped lands and resources, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 810,000 hectares of lands in the two regions will be
reclaimed for agricultural activities and livestock breeding on
commercial scale, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1999, a total of 467,370 hectares of vacant,
virgin, fallow and wetlands in Myanmar's six divisions and states
have been reportedly reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has abundance of cultivable land stretching 18.22
million hectares, of which only 9.31 million hectares are under
cultivation while 8.91 million hectares remained to be utilized.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture accounts for 37 percent of the gross
domestic product and 25 percent of the export value.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the fiscal year 1999-2000
which ended in March, Myanmar yielded over 19.8 million tons of

<HEADLINE> Sulfuric Acid Leak Pollutes Environment in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The road connecting Kosovska
Mitrovica and Pristina was temporarily blocked early Tuesday, due
to a sulfuric acid leak at a battery factory in the southern part
of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
The acid pipes burst on Monday morning, when a large quantity
of the toxic liquid flowed onto the Kosovska Mitrovica-Pristina
road. The leak was contained until Tuesday, the Yugoslav News
Agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
A specialist U.N. peacekeeping forces team attempted to stop
the leak with lime, gypsum and chemicals, but despite their
efforts, the acid continues to leak into the Sitnica River, a
tributary of the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
Residents were warned to keep away from the river, which flows
towards central Serbia, and to avoid contact with the contaminated
water.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that there are huge deposits of sulphuric acid at
the factory.
</P>
<P>
Mike Keats, spokesman of the U.N. Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo, said that enormous efforts have been made to
stop the leak. He also noted that the air quality around the town
of Kosovska Mitrovica, located in the north of Serbian Kosovo-
Metohija Province, has not been affected.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Climbing Out of OPEC's Control, Says Venezuelan Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela said Tuesday that
world oil prices have run out of OPEC's control and output lift
alone will not douse overheated oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Alvaro Calderon said prices
fluctuation following Sunday's output raise indicated that
releasing more oil to the market alone will not help dampen
soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that consuming nations should come with a more
cooperative attitude and divert their attention to other factors
contributing to price climbing, such as transporting, refining and
high taxation.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices slipped lower Monday after the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Counties agreed to raise output by 3 percent,
or 800,000 barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Consuming nations should not make requests for further output
lift from OPEC members as they have done everything to cool the
market, Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's newspapers said Tuesday that a world oil crisis
will be likely if oil prices keep hovering.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Arrests Two War Crimes Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Croatian police on Tuesday
arrested two Croats linked to war crimes, at the request of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
based in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Croatian television citing unofficial sources reported that the
two arrested war crimes suspects were Gen. Ivan Andabaka, a Croat
from Bosnia who served in the Croatian Army, and former Brigadier
Ignac Kostroman.
</P>
<P>
According to Croatian television, Andabaka was arrested in
Karlovac, 40 kilometers south of Zagreb. He admitted that he used
to be a member of a radical Croatian denizen organization and had
got a prison sentence for planting bombs in Yugoslav Airlines'
agency in Frankfort before the war broke out in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Andabaka fought in Bosnia-Hercegovina during the 1992-1995 war
as second in command, and was granted the rank of general in the
so-called "Convicts Battalion" under Mladen Naletilic, who is
being tried in the ICTY for war crimes. Andabaka has been accused
by the ICTY of atrocities against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The second suspect, Ignac Kostroman, was arrested in the town
of Knin. Croatian media has long speculated that he was involved
in the 1993 massacre of more than 100 Muslims in the village of
Ahmici, central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
These two arrests underline the new Croatian government's
commitment to strengthen cooperation with the ICTY to deal with
crimes and terrorism that occurred during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Debuts Super Server </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co.
Tuesday unveiled the latest weapon in the ongoing battle for
market shares among the top suppliers of computer systems for
Internet-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
The company rolled out its much-anticipated HP 9000 Superdome
server, which is the most powerful of such systems in HP's product
line. A news release from the Silicon-based company said
executives are aiming the new servers at large dot-coms, service
providers and other data-intensive environments.
</P>
<P>
The Superdome introduction is the latest salvo in HP's server
battle with Sun Microsystems, currently the market leader, and IBM,
which is running third. HP is running second in the server market,
according to technology research firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
With the new Superdome system, which executives said is priced
starting at about 400,000 dollars and will start shipping in
volume in December, HP said it is raising the bar in the server
market.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that the Superdome system currently is
available with as many as 32 PA-8600 microprocessors operating at
552MHz and as much as 256 gigahertz of memory. HP also said it
has been designed to enable users to easily upgrade it to the 64-
bit Itanium processors, HP's co-designing product with Intel.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the better performance, according to HP,
Superdome has been designed to support multiple computer operating
systems simultaneously, including Unix, Microsoft's Windows NT and
the freely distributed Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
The company said it already has 150 customers "in the funnel,"
and 16 of the Superdome systems already have been installed at
customer sites.
</P>
<P>
Among these are Internet retailing giant Amazon.com; First
Union, which plans to use it in certain areas of its banking
business; and European IT services provider IT Services, HP said.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's aim to win a gold
medal from track and field remains unchanged though its team has
been cut to 26 from the original 38, a top athletics official said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Xie Yalong, president of the Chinese Athletics Management
Center which governs China's athletics, said that China's gold
chance still lies in the women's 20km walk.

Liu Hongyu and Wang Yan finished 1-2 in the event at last

of the Olympics due to injuries just weeks before leaving for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fuxin, their coach for five years, will also miss the
Olympics because one of his male walker Liu Yunfeng, was found to
have a "suspicous" urine sample in a test in Duoba training camp
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Liu has returned to Beijing from Duoba camp and she will
arrive in Sydney on September 22nd," Xie said. "She is now in good
form and I believe the changes will not affect her chance of
winning a gold medal."

<HEADLINE> New Life of a Tibetan Herdsman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Ser Gya, a young Tibetan
herdsman, is now the owner of his own pastureland with 80 hectares,
50 yaks and a mini-bus.
</P>
<P>
Only four years ago, Ser was one of the poorest men in his
village with only seven yaks.
</P>
<P>
Ser Gya and his wife and three sons live in the Tibetan and
Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of Aba in southwest China's Sichuan
Province. The Hongyuan Grassland, where Ser's village is located,
was once a remote area. The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red
Army came to the region in a major strategic movement during the
famous Long March in 1934-35. Local herdsmen used to roam about
the grassland to search for water and grass.
</P>
<P>
"We used to move once a month to search for grass. We had as
many as 90 yaks 17 years ago. But most of them had died of either
hunger or cold. Only seven were left by 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most significant change was a historical shift from a
nomadic lifestyle to settlements on permanent grazing lands. "The
government has helped build new settlements for us and we are
living a relatively comfortable life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We drove cattle and sheep into a warm shed built with the help
of the Provincial Grassland Research Institute. Solar energy has
replaced oil lamp for lighting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ser Gya raises two new bred milk cows presented by the Sichuan
Provincial Grassland Research Institute. Each cow produces 15 kg
of milk a day, equivalent to the output of 10 yaks.
</P>
<P>
He has bought a mini-bus for transportation, earning about 500
yuan of pocket money a month.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the life will be further improved with each passing
year," Ser Gya said.

<HEADLINE> Giant Telecommunication Alliance Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom, the country's
second largest mobile communications operator, has set up a joint
venture with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampon Limited.
</P>
<P>
The new partnership will focus on telecom consultancy and
marketing services in China, according to a senior official from
the company.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yunjie, chief technology officer with the firm, confirmed
the establishment of a joint venture, to be called Beijing Tonghe
Telecom Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
"The new company will initially provide great network
opportunities for China Unicom," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, of which China Unicom has a 51 percent stake
and Hutchison Telecom 49 percent, will also link up marketing and
telecom employee training activities.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Beijing Tonghe will extend its services to the country
's other telecom operators at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts say the birth of the joint venture
demonstrates China Unicom's ambition to spread its business across
China.
</P>
<P>
The soaring expansion of the telecommunication network,
including fixed-line and wireless communications, has resulted in
a big demand for network improvements in China.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation with China Unicom also provides an
opportunities for Hutchison Whampon to enter the Chinese mainland'
s telecom market.
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's telecom giants are seeking ways to
penetrate China's telecom business before the world's most
populous country enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"One step towards that goal means a better chance of getting
involved in China's telecom market," said a telecom consultant.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to open up its telecom service market after
joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, overcoming a host of unanticipated difficulties
on its road to going public, was oversubscribed by three times
when it initially issued shares, receiving nearly 5 billion U.S.
dollars in its June flotation.
</P>
<P>
With support from the government, China Unicom has become a
major player in the country's telecom sector. The company provides
a full service of fixed-line and mobile communications, including
paging, IP phones and Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Free Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN) Tuesday freed congressman Juan Manuel Corzo
in northern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Corzo, a member of the Chamber of Representatives for the
northern department of Santander, was released a few days after
civilians in southern Bolivar proposed a new neutral zone for the
ELN to hold a national convention.
</P>
<P>
His release coincided with a meeting held Monday in Paris,
France, by a high committee member for peace, Camilo Gomez, and
the ELN's second leader, Antonio Garcia, to review advances
towards rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Corzo was kidnapped on April 12, 1999, while traveling with 45
other people -- five of whom were guerrillas mingling with
passengers. They were flying from Bucaramanga to Bogota on an
Avianca (a Colombian airline) "Fokker 50" plane.
</P>
<P>
Three of the 41 passengers and crew aboard the Avianca flight
were forced into rebel territory are still in the hands of the ELN.
</P>
<P>
The ELN rebel group, founded in 1965, is the second largest
guerrilla force in Columbia with about 5,000 members. The largest
is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The ELN demands a government troop withdrawal from areas near
San Pablo as a condition for holding negotiations.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana has focused his peace efforts on talks with
the FARC and has made a withdrawal concession to the largest
guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
Mass rebel abductions, including the ELN's kidnapping of
hundreds of people from the Avianca plane, helped push the
country's world-leading kidnapping rate even higher in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 cases of kidnappings were reported in 1999 and
1750 cases in the first seven months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela May Increase Oil Production: Oil Firm President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela may increase its
oil production to satisfy international market needs, said Hector
Ciavaldini, president of the state company Venezuela Petroleum (
PDVSA), the world's third largest, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are many countries that are already reaching their limit
(of oil production). Venezuela and Saudi Arabia aren't among them,
" Ciavaldini told reporters, referring to comments made by experts
who believe Venezuela lacks the technical ability to increase
crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
Ciavaldini said that, just as the state firm was able to "
produce the 125,000 barrels and over 60,000 barrels (that were
granted in increases approved by OPEC in recent months), now we'll
be able to put out 88,000 barrels" daily. OPEC approved last
Sunday a new 800,000 barrel increase to stop crude oil's
inflationary rise.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculations, Venezuela's oil reserves total
around 7.2 billion barrels. "We have the capacity and these
barrels will be on the market in October," he added.

<HEADLINE> Copper Price to Keep Rising in First Half of 2001, Says Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices in the
international market will continue to rise in 2000 and the first
half of 2001, the Chilean economic newspaper "Estrategia" reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
William O'neill, chief of the Merrill Lynch Corporation's
brokering department of Chile and also a famous market analyst,
told the newspaper the copper price was expected to reach 100 or
105 U.S. cents per pound next year compared with the closing price
of 88.95 U.S cents last week.
</P>
<P>
He said that the growing trend was the result of 300,000 tons
gap between demand and supply in the market next year.
</P>
<P>
The strong demand was also explained by the sustained
development of the global economy despite the slowdown of the U.S.
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the expert estimated that the price will regress to the
normal level in the latter half of the next year with the growth
in copper production by major firms.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the world's leading copper producer.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Navy Seizes Tons of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian Navy seized
three tons of cocaine from a fishing vessel in Caribbean
international waters and arrested its five Colombian crew members,
said Colombia Navy officer Admiral Sergio Garcia Torres on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officer said the drugs were discovered, with support from U.
S. Coast Guards, inside the boat "Tauro" which was about 960
kilometers west of Cartagena city, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Naval personnel searched the boat after it collided with
another boat to which it was giving fuel, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was packed into 85 bags, each weighing about 35
kilos, said Admiral Garcia, adding that the drugs were believed to
be en route to a U.S. port.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Colombia and the United States signed a "
maritime interdiction" accord that aims to strengthen drug control
at ports and seas and limit drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government's Web Sites Violate Rules on Privacy, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the U.S.
government's Web sites don't fully comply with its privacy
standards for commercial Web sites, said a Congressional study
released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study of 65 government sites, which the Clinton
administration has dismissed as misleading was done by the General
Accounting Office (GAO), a nonpartisan investigative and audit arm
of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The GAO study said that only three percent of surveyed
government sites fully met the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s "
fair information principles" for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, even the Web site run by FTC itself did not meet
the FTC standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study said that 14 percent allow third parties
to deploy tracking devices called "cookies," an e-commerce
practice that privacy advocates criticize.
</P>
<P>
The White House's Office of Management and Budget disputed the
report as misleading. It said the FTC's proposed rules were not
meant to apply to U.S. agencies, which are covered by a range of
laws, including the Privacy Act.

<HEADLINE> EU Questions Lawfulness of Belgian Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it had asked Belgium to provide information about
whether a three-day-long protest by truck drivers against rising
oil prices was undermining free movement of goods in the European
Union's single market.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said it might take legal actions against
Belgium if it found that Brussels has not made sure EU laws on the
free movement of goods are respected.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said it had given Belgium 24 hours to
reply to its request for information on protest action at
frontiers or main routes which could hinder the free movement of
goods, one of four basic principles in the EU's single market.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted by road blockades at two border crossings
with Germany and France, the commission said in a statement. If
Belgium did not give a satisfactory reply, the EU executive could
ask the Belgian government to take steps to ensure the
implementation of free movement of goods. If the government failed
to do so, the EU Commission could open formal legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission sent a similar information request to
France last week over fuel price-related protests but dropped the
action after nationwide blockades ended in France.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the EU moved into a single market with four
basic freedoms: the free circulation of goods, personnel, services
and capital. The single market with no internal economic frontiers
is the catalyst for economic integration of the European Union,
the European Commission said.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Duck Drug Tests in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Several Olympic competitors
have gone into hiding to avoid the drug-busters, The Daily
Telegraph said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Olympians at pre-Games training camps around Australia are
locking their apartment doors when the drug testers hit town, one
senior source explained.
</P>
<P>
Australian Sports Drug Agency spokeswoman Vicki Kapernick
confirmed that not all competitors had been co-operative, but
refused to discuss specific cases.
</P>
<P>
"Some have done some interesting things," said Kapernick,
adding that sampling officials have filed reports on several
incidents.
</P>
<P>
"It's been an interesting thing for us, and I think we've done
pretty well," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under International Olympic Committee anti-doping rules, an
athlete who refuses to give a sample for testing risks being
banned for two years, the same penalty as testing positive for a
banned substance.
</P>
<P>
But if a competitor is not available when the sampling
officials arrive to conduct a test, then it is unlikely any
sanction would be applied.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee yesterday declared it
preferred to "scare' athletes out of taking drugs than try to
catch them at the Games.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The 2002 Olympic Winter Games
in Salt Lake City might be upset by bribery scandal, International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 members have been expelled from the IOC in the last
two years after being accused of breaking rules on accepting gifts
from Salt Lake City when it was bidding for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department is still investigating the affair
and Samaranch told an IOC meeting in Sydney that it was possible
that documents about IOC members could be made public during the
Games by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"During the Olympics documents can be published that will make
a lot of bad image not only for the IOC but also for the Games in
Salt Lake City," Samaranch told representatives of the U.S. city
who were presenting a report to the IOC session.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much worried that this problem goes on and on and
will not be finished during the Games in Salt Lake City,"he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kyocera of Japan announced
that it would pump another 90 million U.S. dollars into the
construction of a high-tech industrial park in Shilong Town of
Dongguan City, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the projected park will have an
area of 200,000 sq.m. and will be used as a building place for
high-tech products of advanced standards, such as multi-functional
digital Xerox machines.
</P>
<P>
When production begins at the park, its annual output value
will amount to 10 billion yuan, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Kyocera started investing in the town 12 years ago. It has
altogether invested 150 million yuan in starting up businesses in
Shilong Town, mainly for the production of optical and electronic
products, including cameras. Shilong Town has become Kyocera's
largest production base in China.
</P>
<P>
Kyocera's successful investment has prompted a dozen other
Japanese companies to follow suit. Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., for
instance, also built an industrial town, with an area of 110,000
sq.m., in Shilong Town, last year.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan City is a famous export processing center and a

</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met Tuesday in Beijing with
Robert H. Benmosche, the president and chief executive officer of
MetLife, a leading insurance company of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefly described China's economic and financial reform
as well as the growth of its social security system. He pointed
out that the development of China-US relations asks for support
from both the governments and people of all circles in both
countries, expressing the hope that the US financial circle would
do more for the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has emphasized that the
development of the economically backward western China is a long-
term, historic task calling for a strong sense of urgency and the
preparedness for long-term strife.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Politburo, made
the remark during his recent tour of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region from September 4-10.
</P>
<P>
He called for the crackdown on separatists, religious
fundamentalists and terrorists to build the western border region
into a rock-hard stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin, also chairman of the Central
Military Commission, recently issued decrees to commend a number
of servicemen of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) for
their meritorious service.

</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji expressed hope Tuesday in Beijing
that Switzerland would adopt a flexible attitude during the on-
going bilateral negotiations on China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) so as to achieve an early deal.

<HEADLINE> NZ Intends to Host 2002 World Bodybuilding Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand intends to
host the world bodybuilding championships in 2002, according to
Wellington-based newspaper The Dominion.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Wednesday quoted New Zealand bodybuilding
promoter Boris Borodin as saying "I want to bring the world
bodybuilding championships to Wellington in 2002."
</P>
<P>
Borodin said hosting the world championships, which would
involve about 250 competitors from 70 countries, would be great
for Wellington.
</P>
<P>
The world championships of the influential international sport
would attract a big worldwide television audience, he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's bid for the 2002 championships should be
confirmed in November when the 2000 event is held in Malaysia,
Borodin said.
</P>
<P>
Two other countries are bidding for the 2002 event but New
Zealand has an advantage because the International Federation of
Body Builders is "interested in promoting the sport in the regions
where it is not that big," Borodin said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Tests Mainly to Scare Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- IOC officials have confessed
that the drug test developed for Sydney is designed to scare
cheats rather than catch them, said The Australian on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Schamasch, medical director of the International
Olympic Committee, likened it to a radar trap for speeding
motorists, saying that "the deterrent effect is very important, I
prefer to scare an athlete."
</P>
<P>
"When you put the radar on the motorway, it just tells the
driver to be scared. I prefer the driver to be scared than to
cure the driver who has an accident."
</P>
<P>
As debate continued over the EPO test, IOC vice-president Dick
Pound criticised the appearance of Cuba's high jump world record
holder Javier Sotomayor.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were surprised at the lifting of the ban and
you can count me as one of them. He should have served the full
two-year ban."
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor tested positive for cocaine last year and banned two
years, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation cut back
his sentence earlier this year, citing exceptional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Although the EPO tests were introduced to the Sydney Games, the
IOC rejected a test that could detect EPO use from up to 28 days
before screening, preferring one that only detected use in the
previous five days.

ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Culture and Sports Minister of
Greece Theodore Pangalos decided at the last minute to stay away
from the Sydney Olympic Games and called his staff down from a
plane where they were ready for take-off.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos decided he did not have time to attend the world's
premiere sporting event, staff said.
</P>
<P>
"Several files in his ministry are pending and the minister has
to make some decisions fast. His presence in Athens was therefore
necessary," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is well in place in Sydney. The Greek delegation,
led by Gianna Angelopoulos Daskalaki (the president of the Athens
2004 organizing committee), is well represented," the official
added.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos explained his position to the Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, who gave his approval for the minister to miss the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ministry team, already on a plane waiting to set off for
Sydney, were told to disembark.
</P>
<P>
Greek media reacted saying Pangalos had decided to remain in
Athens to concentrate on working to bring the Greek capital up to
speed in time for the 2004 Olympics, which it is hosting.

<HEADLINE> Performance-Enhancing Dietary Supplements for Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Amid the fierce battle against
drug cheats worldwide, the Americans and the Australians have
resorted to the performance-enhancing diets to claim the most
coveted honors in the Millennium Olympics to be started on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian swimming team has a typical breakfast of toast
and cereal, maybe some eggs and pancakes, with a noodle stirfry
for lunch and perhaps a juicy bit of steak for dinner with low-fat
potato wedges on the sides, The Australian reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a menu that would provoke shrieks of horror among the US
swimmers who have abandoned their their carbo-loading diets of old
and replaced them with high-protein meals accompanied by large
doses of dietary supplements."
</P>
<P>
Bizarre as it may sound, however, many of the top US swimmers
believe their regimen of dietary supplements will give them a
competitive edge in the pool and even help them beat the drug
cheats.
</P>
<P>
"You can achieve what the steroid athletes achieve, you can do
steroid-like performences," said US women's swimming squad head
coach Richard Quick in July when the US Olympic trials were held
in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Spearheading the US experiment with dietary supplements is
cancer specialist Glen Luepnitz who prescribes top swimmers of
Misty Hyman, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres 15 to 20 types of
supplements a day to be eaten at specific times and with certain
foods, no artificial colourings or preservatives allowed.
</P>
<P>
Australian Institute of Sports nutritionist Louise Burke, who
works full-time with Australian swimming team, introduces her own
dietary supplement with a hefty grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
"Our supplement policy is a bit more conservative than the
Americans'. There is no doubt that some supplements can be useful
and there's no denying that supplements are attractive to the
athletes," she said.
</P>
<P>
One of Luepnitz's favorites is the amino-acid glutamine, which
he says when taken at night produces a four-fold stimulus of
natural human growth hormone (HGH) during sleep, enabling the
athlete to workout longer, absorb nutrients better and maintain
body weight.
</P>
<P>
"Amino acids given intravenously can stimulate human growth
hormone, but taking them orally can produce an entirely different
result, and there's a huge surge in human growth hormone
production during sleep anyway," said Burke.

<P>
"Al-Sabee is very promising, I am sure he could give people a

<P>
He predicted that the gold-medal-jump in Sydney could be 8.50
meters, a fly of 8.33 meters could propell Al-Sabee to the podium.
</P>

Al-Sabee, at the age of 20, has a personal best of 8.33 and he

International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
The IOC ruled that Miranda lacked the required waiver from his
former country, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to get a negative response," Mitch
Geller, Canada's diving coach, said Wednesday. "I thought they
were quite regretful they had to give a negative reply."
</P>
<P>
Miranda was born in Havana but became a Canadian citizen in
December. The Edmonton resident had competed for Cuba in the past
and to, dive for Canada, he needed a release from his former
country under IOC rules.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans refused to grant the release and protested Miranda's
presence on the Canadian team. The IOC ruled him ineligible last
week.

ROME, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Nutritional problems remain
serious in the central and southern parts of Iraq and malnutrition
among children is very serious outside Baghdad and in rural areas,
according to a joint report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
"Child nutrition rates in the central and southern parts of the
country do not appear to have improved significantly and
nutritional problems remain serious and widespread," the report
said, contrasting this with the northern part of the country where
there had been significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, the rates of infant and child mortality
have more than doubled since the start of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the Iraqi rural areas, for instance, "micro-nutrient
deficiencies are common and iron deficiency anemia is high," the

<HEADLINE> Use of Wireless Data Technology Expected to Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Primarily driven by
messaging, wireless data adoption over the next few years will
skyrocket worldwide, according to a report released by a U.S. high-
tech market research firm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cahners In-Stat Group predicted that the wireless data market
will grow from about 170 million subscribers worldwide in 2000 to
greater than 1.3 billion in 2004. As a result, more than 1.5
billion handsets, personal digital assistants and Internet
appliances are expected to be equipped with wireless capabilities
by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The number of wireless messages sent per month will increase
from 3 billion in December to 244 billion by December 2004, the
report said. Other features such as mobile commerce applications,
entertainment, real-time financial information, travel and
location-based information services will also be popular but will
take longer to reach the market.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the potential for wireless data, In-Stat cited the
United States, where there are more than 60 million households
with wired Internet access and more than 100 million wireless
phones. The high rate of Internet penetration in the United States
could discourage some from subscribing to wireless data services
as many Americans are accustomed to high-speed wireline
connections to the Web that deliver graphic-rich data. Wireless
data cannot match those speeds. But the research firm said that
many will still opt for the technology to gain increased mobility
and convenience.
</P>
<P>
Due to lower PC and wired Internet penetration rate and higher
wired line prices, many European and Japanese are not used to high-
speed Web service and their primary access to the Internet or
email is through their mobile phones, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed with the blue chips falling while the tech shares rising
Wednesday as investors continued to worry about corporate earnings
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
51.05 at 11,182.18 points. The blue chip stock index rose 37.74
points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 44.38 at 3,893.89 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 2.92 at 1,484.91.
</P>
<P>
The market today reversed Tuesday's close, when the Dow index
rose while the Nasdaq composite falling amid earnings worries.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty about corporate earnings continued to dominate
the market today after SCI Systems, the electronics manufacturer,
said its earnings in the third quarter would not meet expectations
because of lower demand for its products. The fresh warning added
to investors' worries about the future reports on earnings.
</P>
<P>
Since last Friday, a number of companies had warned that their
earnings would fall below expectations because of higher costs and
lower demands for their products in the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The merger announcement in the financial sector did not help
the Dow index. Chase Manhattan Bank announced today that it agreed
to acquire J.P. Morgan for about 36 billion U.S. dollars in stock
and shares of two companies fell.
</P>
<P>
The tech shares rose as investors cashed out of the blue chip
stocks and moved some money into the tech sector for bargain-
hunting. The Nasdaq index fell 248.84 points in the previous three
sessions.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.62 at 675.22 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.86 at 963.55. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.57 at 534.00.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,466 down, 1,420 up and 487
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.06 billion shares from 974.40
million shares in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Truckers blockade Antwerp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian truckers blockaded
the port of Antwerp, the second largest in Europe, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All major roads to the port are blocked and dock officials are
warning that if the blockade lasts for a couple of days the
effects could be "catastrophic".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the roadblocks have been set up on motorways across
the country, and the streets of the Belgian capital, Brussels,
remained virtually empty on Wednesday as their protest against
high fuel prices entered into the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
The blockades, which have now spread to several other European
countries, follow the action of French road haulers who last week
forced their government to reduce fuel taxes after a week of
action.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, talks are continuing between union leaders
and the Belgian government amid signs that the two sides may be
nearing an agreement, which could lead to the lifting of the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has so far ruled out immediate lowering
of high fuel prices, the truck drivers' key demand, and is instead
offering a series of measures designed to soften their impact.
</P>
<P>
The protesters had vowed to keep up their actions for as long
as it takes to force the government to climb down.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President in Britain, Discussing Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo is in London on Wednesday to discuss prospects for debt
relief with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
In a visit which reflects his country's improved relations with
Britain, Obasanjo held talks with Blair about the possibility of
relieving his country's debt to Britain and some other Western
nations.
</P>
<P>
He also met Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who is
responsible for the affairs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
British officials said Hain and Obasanjo discussed Sierra Leone
-- where both Britain and Nigeria are trying to end a civil war,
conflict resolution and the dialogue between the Group of Eight
industrialized countries and poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was due to attend a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
British media reported that Nigeria owes members of the Paris
Club of official creditor nations, including Britain, two-thirds
of its arrears, estimated 30 billion U.S. dollars. But Nigeria
says it is too poor to meet its repayment obligations of over 3
billion dollars per year and at the same time regenerate the
nation of 120 million people.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Blair had made any commitment to pushing for a
reduction in Nigeria's debt after their talks, Obasanjo replied: "
The British government has always given us commitments."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's visit comes at a time when relations between Nigeria
and its former colonial ruler are at their strongest for some time.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Canada spearheaded the diplomatic offensive in the
Commonwealth that led to the international isolation of the regime
of Nigerian former leader Sani Abacha from late 1995 until his
death in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Blair met Obasanjo after holding emergency talks with his
ministers and senior oil executives in a bid to get fuel flowing
back to Britain's petrol stations, after six days of protests over
high fuel taxes cut off nearly all supplies to drivers.

<P>
HAVANA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Qatar Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa Al-Thani arrived Wednesday in this capital for a two-day
official visit, invited by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The Emir is the first head of state from the Persian Gulf to
visit Cuba, and his stay here indicates the will of the two
countries to strengthen and consolidate friendship and cooperation,
said Wednesday the Granma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Qatar leader agenda includes official talks Thursday with
Castro, who will decorate him with the Jose Marti Order, the top
distinction the Cuban government grants to foreign personalities.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thani will sign agreements to promote cooperation in various
sectors. He will also visit the Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology Center.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Qatar established diplomatic relations in December of
1989. Qatar, located on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula,
has an area of 11,400 square kilometers and its economy is based
on oil production.

<HEADLINE> EU Scientists Disagree with Italian GMO Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The SCF said the seven food products derived from genetically
modified organisms (GMO) are currently on the EU market. The
products concerned are oils from three genetically modified
oilseed rapes and processed products from four gene altered corn
varieties.
</P>
<P>
In early last month, the Italian government suspended the
marketing of products derived from the four gene altered corn
varieties, which the EU committee said invoked the safeguard
clause of the EU's Novel Foods Regulation.
</P>
<P>
Under the law of the 15-nation EU, if a member state has
detailed grounds as a result of information for considering that
the use of a food or a food ingredient endangers human health or
environment, the member state may either temporarily restrict or
suspend the trade of the product in question on its territory.
</P>
<P>
But the SCF said it has examined the scientific arguments
presented by the Italian authorities and found that no detailed
scientific ground are given for confirming that the concerned
foods posed a risk to human health or environment.
</P>
<P>
Although the gene altered food products had already receive
approval for sale EU-wide, Italy exercised an emergency procedure
to ban them on its territory, a move which automatically leads EU
scientific committees to look at the case.
</P>
<P>
The SCF's opinion could eventually lead the European Commission,
the EU's executive arm, to require Italy to lift its ban on GMO
derived products.

LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) - The number of people unemployed
in Britain has fallen to a 20-year low and the rate of growth in
wages has dropped back, according to new figures released
Wednesday.
</P>

The jobless total last month fell by 18,000 people to stand at
1,051,300 - the lowest level since December 1979, said the Office

This represented a slowing from the 4.1 percent growth recorded
for the three months to June and 6 percent in February when
millennium-related bonuses were at their height.
</P>
<P>
It was also marginally lower than the 4 percent growth expected
by economists, and below the 4.5 percent that the Bank of England
says is the danger signal for inflation.

<HEADLINE> High Customer Expectations to Lift Worldwide CRM Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Customers' elevated
expectations and the impact of e-business are driving worldwide
demand for customer relationship management (CRM) services, a U.S.
market researcher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide
revenues in the CRM services markets will increase at an annual
growth rate of 29 percent from 34.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1999
to 125 billion dollars in 2004. This growth rate is more than
twice as fast as the expected increase in the overall information
technology services market.
</P>
<P>
CRM is an integrated information system that is used to plan,
schedule and control the presales and postsales activities in an
organization. It has become an integral component of the modern
enterprise business strategy. Nowadays many companies are turning
to wireless devices to improve their CRM.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the CRM market growth, IDC said that e-business
has not only changed how companies conduct business, but also how
they interact with and relate to their customers. "In addition to
creating new communication channels and alternative interaction
options for consumers," IDC said, "e-business has changed the
rules and expectations surrounding customer service, fundamentally
altering the consumer experience."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, META, a U.S. information technology research and
consulting firm, predicted a 50 percent annual growth rate for the
global CRM market and projected it will grow from 13 billion U.S.
dollars in 2000 to 67 billion dollars in 2004.

lower demands for their products in the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The merger announcement in the financial sector did not help
the Dow index. Chase Manhattan Bank announced today that it agreed
to acquire J.P. Morgan for about 36 billion U.S. dollars in stock
and shares of two companies fell.
</P>
<P>
The tech shares rose as investors cashed out of the blue chip
stocks and moved some money into the tech sector for bargain-
hunting. The Nasdaq index fell 248.84 points in the previous three
sessions.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.62 at 675.22 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.86 at 963.55. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.57 at 534.00.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,466 down, 1,420 up and 487
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.06 billion shares from 974.40
million shares in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Truckers blockade Antwerp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian truckers blockaded
the port of Antwerp, the second largest in Europe, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All major roads to the port are blocked and dock officials are
warning that if the blockade lasts for a couple of days the
effects could be "catastrophic".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the roadblocks have been set up on motorways across
the country, and the streets of the Belgian capital, Brussels,
remained virtually empty on Wednesday as their protest against
high fuel prices entered into the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
The blockades, which have now spread to several other European
countries, follow the action of French road haulers who last week
forced their government to reduce fuel taxes after a week of
action.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, talks are continuing between union leaders
and the Belgian government amid signs that the two sides may be
nearing an agreement, which could lead to the lifting of the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has so far ruled out immediate lowering
of high fuel prices, the truck drivers' key demand, and is instead
offering a series of measures designed to soften their impact.
</P>
<P>
The protesters had vowed to keep up their actions for as long
as it takes to force the government to climb down.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President in Britain, Discussing Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo is in London on Wednesday to discuss prospects for debt
relief with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
In a visit which reflects his country's improved relations with
Britain, Obasanjo held talks with Blair about the possibility of
relieving his country's debt to Britain and some other Western
nations.
</P>
<P>
He also met Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who is
responsible for the affairs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
British officials said Hain and Obasanjo discussed Sierra Leone
-- where both Britain and Nigeria are trying to end a civil war,
conflict resolution and the dialogue between the Group of Eight
industrialized countries and poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was due to attend a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
British media reported that Nigeria owes members of the Paris
Club of official creditor nations, including Britain, two-thirds
of its arrears, estimated 30 billion U.S. dollars. But Nigeria
says it is too poor to meet its repayment obligations of over 3
billion dollars per year and at the same time regenerate the
nation of 120 million people.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Blair had made any commitment to pushing for a
reduction in Nigeria's debt after their talks, Obasanjo replied: "
The British government has always given us commitments."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo's visit comes at a time when relations between Nigeria
and its former colonial ruler are at their strongest for some time.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Canada spearheaded the diplomatic offensive in the
Commonwealth that led to the international isolation of the regime
of Nigerian former leader Sani Abacha from late 1995 until his
death in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Blair met Obasanjo after holding emergency talks with his
ministers and senior oil executives in a bid to get fuel flowing
back to Britain's petrol stations, after six days of protests over
high fuel taxes cut off nearly all supplies to drivers.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Emir Arrives Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Qatar Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa Al-Thani arrived Wednesday in this capital for a two-day
official visit, invited by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The Emir is the first head of state from the Persian Gulf to
visit Cuba, and his stay here indicates the will of the two
countries to strengthen and consolidate friendship and cooperation,
said Wednesday the Granma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Qatar leader agenda includes official talks Thursday with
Castro, who will decorate him with the Jose Marti Order, the top
distinction the Cuban government grants to foreign personalities.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thani will sign agreements to promote cooperation in various
sectors. He will also visit the Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology Center.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Qatar established diplomatic relations in December of
1989. Qatar, located on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula,
has an area of 11,400 square kilometers and its economy is based
on oil production.

<HEADLINE> Czech Government Lifts Sanctions Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen EU countries on Tuesday agreed to lift their ban on
political contacts with Vienna after three "wish men" recommended
them to do so.
</P>
<P>
"We consider it appropriate to follow the rules of the club we
want to become a member of," Zeman told a press conference, adding
that "the approach of the Czech Republic corresponds with the
approach of the EU."
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic joined the EU boycotts imposed on Austria in
February after the far-right Freedom Party entered the government
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Czech-Austrian relations have been recently burdened by
disputes over the launch of the nuclear power station in Temelin,
south Bohemia. The Czech government planned to activate the plant
near Austrian borders in early October at the latest.

<HEADLINE> EU Scientists Disagree with Italian GMO Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The SCF said the seven food products derived from genetically
modified organisms (GMO) are currently on the EU market. The
products concerned are oils from three genetically modified
oilseed rapes and processed products from four gene altered corn
varieties.
</P>
<P>
In early last month, the Italian government suspended the
marketing of products derived from the four gene altered corn
varieties, which the EU committee said invoked the safeguard
clause of the EU's Novel Foods Regulation.
</P>
<P>
Under the law of the 15-nation EU, if a member state has
detailed grounds as a result of information for considering that
the use of a food or a food ingredient endangers human health or
environment, the member state may either temporarily restrict or
suspend the trade of the product in question on its territory.
</P>
<P>
But the SCF said it has examined the scientific arguments
presented by the Italian authorities and found that no detailed
scientific ground are given for confirming that the concerned
foods posed a risk to human health or environment.
</P>
<P>
Although the gene altered food products had already receive
approval for sale EU-wide, Italy exercised an emergency procedure
to ban them on its territory, a move which automatically leads EU
scientific committees to look at the case.
</P>
<P>
The SCF's opinion could eventually lead the European Commission,
the EU's executive arm, to require Italy to lift its ban on GMO
derived products.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Figure Hits 20-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) - The number of people unemployed
in Britain has fallen to a 20-year low and the rate of growth in
wages has dropped back, according to new figures released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless total last month fell by 18,000 people to stand at
1,051,300 - the lowest level since December 1979, said the Office
for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
This represented a slowing from the 4.1 percent growth recorded
for the three months to June and 6 percent in February when
millennium-related bonuses were at their height.
</P>
<P>
It was also marginally lower than the 4 percent growth expected
by economists, and below the 4.5 percent that the Bank of England
says is the danger signal for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the data increased the probability that the Bank'
s Monetary Policy Committee would keep interest rates on hold next
month.

<HEADLINE> High Customer Expectations to Lift Worldwide CRM Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Customers' elevated
expectations and the impact of e-business are driving worldwide
demand for customer relationship management (CRM) services, a U.S.
market researcher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide
revenues in the CRM services markets will increase at an annual
growth rate of 29 percent from 34.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1999
to 125 billion dollars in 2004. This growth rate is more than
twice as fast as the expected increase in the overall information
technology services market.
</P>
<P>
CRM is an integrated information system that is used to plan,
schedule and control the presales and postsales activities in an
organization. It has become an integral component of the modern
enterprise business strategy. Nowadays many companies are turning
to wireless devices to improve their CRM.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the CRM market growth, IDC said that e-business
has not only changed how companies conduct business, but also how
they interact with and relate to their customers. "In addition to
creating new communication channels and alternative interaction
options for consumers," IDC said, "e-business has changed the
rules and expectations surrounding customer service, fundamentally
altering the consumer experience."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, META, a U.S. information technology research and
consulting firm, predicted a 50 percent annual growth rate for the
global CRM market and projected it will grow from 13 billion U.S.
dollars in 2000 to 67 billion dollars in 2004.
