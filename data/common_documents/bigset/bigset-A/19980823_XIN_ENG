HANOI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has expressed great
concern and regret over U.S. air strikes on sites in Afghanistan
and Sudan suspected to be involved in recent terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam disapproves of any international terrorist acts," a

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Urged to Review Moratorium Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) asked the Indian government Saturday to review its
offer of unilateral moratorium on further nuclear tests, made
after the nuclear tests last May.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by BJP National Executive Saturday
asserted that India had the strength and capacity to withstand and
survive the economic sanctions imposed by many countries and
international organizations following the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The National Executive began a three-day meeting Friday in
BJP's power base in Jaipur, capital city of northwest Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the executives
favored reviewing the decision of the BJP-led government on
nuclear moratorium if future developments jeopardized India's
national strategic and security interests.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the executives asked the government
not to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the ground that
it is "discriminatory".
</P>
<P>
Members of the Executive were critical of the failure of the
coalition government to curb mounting prices in the country since
the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
An economic resolution adopted Saturday by the executives
blamed the price rise on the previous governments and unfavorable
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted party sources as saying that the BJP-led coalition
came in for sharp criticism by some members at the meeting for its
failure to ease the price rise.
</P>
<P>
The BJP elite suggested that the public distribution system be
streamlined and strengthened and distribution of essential
commodities at reasonable rates be ensured so that the common
people are relieved of the burden of back-breaking prices and
shortages created by hoarders.
</P>
<P>
The prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed since the
BJP-led government came to power last March, especially since the
S22085HAB211I0822QU00:3500:381248
country conducted nuclear tests in May, with prices of some
YCC085HAB211I0822QU00:3500:381248
commodities increasing by more than 10 times.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Saturday expressed support for the anti-crisis measures taken by
the Russian government, the Russian presidential press service
said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, Kohl expressed satisfaction with Russia's reiteration of
its obligations with regard to foreign debt, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted the press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The phone call came days after the Russian government and
central bank devalued the ruble and imposed a 90-day moratorium on
repayment of foreign debts at the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also talked about such international issues as
Kosovo and the situation on the world financial markets in their
lengthy conversation, the service said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made similar calls on Thursday to French President
Jacques and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Envoy Late for Pretoria Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The representative of
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Laurent Kabila, will
arrive in South Africa late Saturday for talks with Uganda and Rwanda
over the DRC crisis, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said DRC
Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo had left the DRC in a cargo plane at 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo was sent in Kabila's place as Kabila was unable to attend
the talks for health reasons, Mankahlana said earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
SAPA earlier quoted a Waterkloof air base official as saying the
DRC representative would not be able to be in South Africa Saturday.
Waterkloof is the place where delegations for the peace talks are
expected.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu had no intention of ditching the talks and were presently
locked in a meeting with South African President Nelson Mandela, said
Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda were accused by Kabila of supporting rebels in
the DRC, but the two countries have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's peace talks were aimed at finding a peaceful solution
to the crisis in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the meeting would produce a peace proposal which
would be tabled at Sunday's Southern African Development Community
summit.
</P>
<P>
Another head of state in the region who has been invited to
Saturday's talks, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, refused to
attend the meeting. He also refused to be present at Sunday's summit.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe distanced himself from South Africa, which believes in a
peaceful solution to the military conflict in the DRC. Mugabe had
reportedly sent troops to the DRC to help Kabila quell the revolt.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who is also in favor of
military intervention, would not attend Sunday's summit for "medical
reasons".

<HEADLINE> Museveni Concerned About Situation in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has expressed concern about the events unfolding in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the State House here Saturday said
that it is Museveni who previously suggested that a regional
summit be held to discuss the volatile situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the summit in Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe
earlier this month did not decisively put a halt to the fighting
so as to solve the problems politically.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni has been in contact with many African
leaders, but consensus has not yet emerged, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some countries are beginning to intervene in
democratic Congo without waiting for the consensus to emerge,
probably due to the fact that the anti-Kabila alliance has been
gaining ground rapidly, it said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni sees dangers in foreign intervention, the release
said, adding that he urges all external players to restrain
themselves and to hold a summit meeting quickly to crystalize the
lacking consensus.
</P>
<P>
If unilateral intervention intensifies, Uganda may be forced
to take actions to protect its own security interests, said the
Ugandan president.
</P>
<P>
The press release said Uganda's main interests in the DRC are
threefold: to prevent Sudan from infiltrating terrorism into
Uganda; to stop the Interahamwe of Rwanda from using the
Congolese territory to kill people in the southwestern district
of Kisoro; together with international community, to avoid
massacres like those in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
It once again refuted reports of Ugandan invasion of
democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been having two battalions in the DRC to combat
rebels and lawless elements according to mutual understanding
with Kabila's administration. This is the only extent of our
involvement in the Congo up to now, it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release pointed out that President Museveni still
hopes the problem in the DRC can be solved politically,
suggesting that regional summit meetings be held to call for a
cease-fire to be followed by talks between the DRC government and
its armed opponents as well as other political forces.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Carpet Export Records 30 Years' Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The export of Iran's famous
hand-woven carpets has plunged into the lowest level in 30 years,
the evening daily Resalat reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The export dropped to 114.5 million U.S. dollars during the
first four months of the current Iranian year (starting from March
21), showing 31.7 percent decrease compared with the same period
of last Iranian year, the paper quoted Khosrow Sobhe, a member of
the Carpet Exporters Union, as saying.
</P>
<P>
If hurdles on the way were removed with a change in the
country's regulations on exports, Iran's annual carpet export
could reach 1 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without going to details about the hurdles, Sobhe said that at
present, Iran only covers 30 percent of the world carpet exports
which stands at about 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 35 years ago, Iran dominated over half of the world
demand, but the rate sharply declined due to the country's
complicated export procedures and challenges from other
carpet-exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Iran's carpet export stood at 1.64 billion dollars,
but the figure dropped to 561 million dollars in 1997, Iranian
officials announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to Sobhe, nearly 2 million Iranians are currently
employed in carpet weaving industry.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Meets With Sudanese Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday met with Sudanese opposition leader and the
meeting "dealt with consultations and understanding on the events
in Khartoum," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Mohamed Osma Mirghani, leader of
Sudan's National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the umbrella group of
all opposition factions in the north and south, declined to give
any comments on Sudan's developments following the U.S. strikes
against a pharmaceutical plant near Khartoum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition has spelled out its stance on the
U.S. strike against alleged terrorist-associated Sudanese
facilities in a statement issued earlier.
</P>
<P>
The statement Mirghani mentioned was issued following a meeting
of the opposition groups in Cairo Saturday morning. It urged the
formation of a fact-finding mission to collect evidence of Sudan's
chemical weapons production, and supported an Egyptian call for
convening an international conference on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fired cruise missiles Thursday night at a
pharmaceutical factory near Khartoum in what it claimed
retaliation for bombings on August 7 of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Sudan of sponsoring international
terrorism and claimed that the factory was manufacturing chemical
weapons agents that could be used by Islamic militants to launch
new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrea-based NDA held three days of meetings here starting
from August 15. It is the first such meeting ever hosted by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has a border dispute and other hanging issues with
its southern neighbor, had kept a low profile in the 15-year civil
conflicts in Sudan but is apparently adjusting the stance as
fightings have escalated and the famine crisis in southern Sudan
degenerated.
</P>
<P>
The war between the Sudanese government troops and rebel forces
fighting for autonomy in southern Sudan since 1983, combined with
famine, had taken a toll of more than 1.5 million lives.

KUWAIT CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) is keen on finding a peaceful solution to the
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea so that East Africa
YPR147CAB072I22TAQL01:5001:531150
S25147CAB072I22TAQL01:5001:531150
can be stable, GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hujailan made this remark during his meeting in Riyadh with the
Ethiopian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Ibrahim, Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by the GCC's Secretariat General said
that Hujailan was briefed about the latest developments of the
Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the GCC and Ethiopia were also discussed
during the meeting, the press statement said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis erupted between the two east African countries last
May when Eritrean troops entered a number of disputed border
areas, which led to heavy military confrontations between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Mediation efforts by the international community have not
brought to an end to the crisis, as Ethiopia was still insisting
for an Eritrean withdrawal before any direct negotiation, a matter
of which is rejected by Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, during its 67th ministerial meeting last June in
Riyadh, had called on the two countries to solve their dispute
through dialogs and urged them to halt armed confrontations to
achieve regional stability.
</P>
<P>
GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).

</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the State House Saturday evening

Considering the worsening situation in the DRC and the
divisions among the Southern African Development Community (SADC)

issue.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe supports sending military aid to help DRC
President Laurent Kabila while some other countries in SADC do
not like this choice.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Kabila sent his ministers to
represent him at the talks because a crowded timetable prevented
him from attending.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni was accompanied by Amama Mbabazi, the
Minister of State for Regional Cooperation.

CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday that actions aimed at stubbing out
terrorism should be ratified by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Moussa called on the U.N. Security
Council to take necessary measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that all measures taken to confront terrorism
should be through international legitimacy and under the umbrella
of the U.N.," he pointed out.

"The U.N. Security Council remains the supreme world authority
charged with maintaining world peace and security," he said.

It urged the Security Council to take appropriate measures in
line with the U.N. Charter to fight and root out terrorism and
bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
"Since that terrorism wreaks havoc in many world communities,
Egypt believes that the whole world, instead of just one country,
must agree on a definitive measure in this respect. And the
Security Council is just the quarter to decide on that," Moussa
told reporters.

"We have no MIG fighters in the DRC. For them (rebels) to

Charamba dismissed the rebel claims as " propaganda", adding

Congo (k) Rebel foreign affairs spokesman Bizima Karaha

HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has no plan to attend a twin summit on the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) called by South African
President Nelson Mandela, presidential spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman George Charamba told reporters that there are no
indications of a presidential trip to South Africa for Mugabe to

</P>
<P>
This meeting will be followed by a full Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit at the same venue Sunday.

"I have no information to the effect that the president is

Zimbabwe insisted that it will not participate at both
the emergency meeting and the SADC summit unless four other
countries aiding the embattled DRC government -- Angola, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia -- are also present.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- In its first official reaction
to the bombings of the two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
the United Arab Emirates condemns all forms of terrorism on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A UAE Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on customary
practice of anonymity, told reporters that his country calls on
the U.N. Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and adopt
appropriate anti-terrorist measures.
</P>
<P>
The UAE also calls on the international community to take
urgent and collective moves through the Security Council to uproot
terrorism and define the responsibility of the countries that
support the terrorist organizations, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The official concluded by saying that the UAE expresses time

and again its deep belief that terrorism is a grave phenomenon
which is utterly alien to the tolerant and merciful Islam.
</P>

The remarks of the UAE official followed the U.S. air raids on
suspected terrorist-related sites in Sudan and Afghanistan on
Thursday.

The U.S. missile strikes were a retaliatory measure against the
August 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newly-appointed cabinet
ministers were sworn in Saturday in the capital Abuja and the
post of Minister for Petroleum Resources is still vacant, the
Nigerian TV Authority said.
</P>
<P>
A source from the State House was quoted as saying that the
activities of the Oil Ministry will be handled by a special
adviser under the presidency.
</P>
<P>
At the swearing-in ceremony, Nigerian Head of State Abdulsalam
Abubakar urged his ministers to shun corruption during the period
before the power hand-over on May 29 next year.
</P>
<P>
"We will therefore closely monitor all of you, as well as any
public officer given positions of trust and responsibility, to
ensure that their assignments are not used as springboards for
launch into criminal affluence," Abubakar stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the assignment of minister portfolio,Ismaila
Usman, a central banker, was named finance minister while former
ambassador to the United States Ignatius Olisemeka appointed
foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
The 31-member new cabinet was announced on August 20, one
month after the old cabinet was dissolved following the sudden
death of former head of state Sani Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Abuja explained that the long delay in naming the
cabinet ministers was to ensure the posts were shared out fairly
among various regions and tribes in the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Welcomes Egypt's Anti-Terrorism Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Ambassador in Cairo Ahmed
Abdel Halim said Saturday that Sudan welcomed an Egyptian proposal
for convening an international conference on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following talks here with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, during which they briefed each other on their
governments' stances on Thursday's U.S. air raids on alleged
terrorist-related facilities in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Sudan of sponsoring international terrorism,
fired cruise missiles Thursday night at a pharmaceutical factory
in Khartoum in what it claimed retaliation for bombings on August
7 of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Moussa told me that Egypt is keen on dealing
with terrorism within international legitimacy and does not
approve any unilateral measure in this regard," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Halim said that Sudan had signed the Arab Anti-terrorism
Pact and relevant international documents. "It welcomes Egypt's
proposal (of an international anti-terrorism conference,)" he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt's delegate to the U.N. has voiced Egypt's
sympathy with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador denounced the U.S. attack as "unjustified and
not based on any evidence."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. administration tried to launch an act of thuggery
after it had been accused of being unable to protect its embassies
and citizens abroad and following the scandal facing the
U.S. president," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, the Sudanese factory which came
under attack was a pharmaceutical plant, where the United Nations
contracted with the Sudanese government to purchase the produced
medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it was owned by a Sudanese national called Salah
Idriss and not Saudi billionaire Osama Ben Laden, the No. 1
terrorist wanted by the U.S. for a series of terrorist attacks, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the factory, financed by Laden, was
manufacturing chemical weapons agents that could be used by
Islamic militants to launch new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has asked the U.N. Security Council and the
U.N. secretary general to dispatch a team to get acquainted with
the bombed factory's capabilities, the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan, the two Nile neighbors, have been in disputes
over border and other hanging issues, and traded accusations of
harboring militants against each other.
</P>
<P>
Cairo, for the first time, hosted last week a meeting of
Sudan's opposition parties, viewed as a policy shift towards
enhanced involvement in its southern neighbor's 15-year civil
conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Launch Tsetse Fly Wipe-Out in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The ministry of agriculture
of Ethiopia announces Saturday that a new project aimed at
eradicating Tsetse fly from Ethiopia will commence in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gebre-Medhin Belay, Head of Planning and Program Department of
the ministry told reporters that the project will be implemented
in Deddesa and Wamma rift valleys and Abay basins with an annual
cost of 17.6 million Birr (2.5 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Belay disclosed that the Ethiopian government plans to rid
550,000 hectares of land in Deddesa and Wamma rift valleys of
Tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis in four years beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tsetse fly is affecting 18 percent of the
country, covering 200,000 square kilometers of land. Ten million
cattle, 6.1 million sheep and goats, one million camel and 1.2
million pack animals are exposed to trypanosomiasis in Ethiopia,
for which the country loses over 200 million U.S. Dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
The project to be undertaken through the agreement reached
between the Ethiopian government and the European Economic
Commission is part of the east African sub-region program
coordinated by the Organization of African Unity, Belay said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also be carried out in Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's PM Denounces Terrorism, Proposes Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh Saturday denounced terrorism, but also criticized the
resort to force to settle problems.
</P>
<P>
Jordan condemned all forms of terrorism whether they were
committed by individuals or organized entities, because they led
to the killing of innocent people, Tarawneh said in a press
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government proposed that all conflicting parties
should drop acts of terrorism and open dialog, especially
security dialog, said Tarawneh, who was just appointed prime
minister on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh expressed the hope that all the countries in the world
would talk to each other openly in the same spirit and not rely
on force to settle conflicts, adding that the international and
the United Nations Charter should be the decisive factor in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after Thursday's U.S. missile attacks on a
number of suspected terrorist-related sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister welcomed the Sudanese
government's decision to invite the world media to visit the site
in Khartoum that the U.S. missile attacked.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said that the site was only a pharmaceutic plant for
producing medicines and did not accommodate any equipment for
manufacturing chemical arms or poisonous gas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. alleged that the site was a military base of the
terrorists lead by Saudi "dissident" Osama Ben Laden who
reportedly masterminded and sponsored the explosions of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Jordan maintains close relations with both Sudan and the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Condemns U.S. Attack on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Saturday condemned the Thursday U.S. attack on a
Sudanese factory and announced his support for Khartoum to
complain against Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Sudanese counterpart Omar
Ahmed al-Bashir, Khatami termed the U.S. attack as an obvious
aggression against Sudan and violated the international laws and
the world's security.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sympathy with the Sudanese government and nation
over the issue, the state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched simultaneous missile attacks Thursday night
on what it described as "terrorist-related" targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan following the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government termed the U.S. attack as "a barbaric
act."
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), the Iranian president said that the attack on an
OIC member should be double condemned.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the explosions at the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, he condemned Washington for using the
incidents as a pretext to violate the international laws.
</P>
<P>
He announced support for Sudan to lodge complaint against the
U.S. in the United Nations, particularly the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bashir briefed Khatami on the attack and said the
U.S. targeted a pharmaceutical factory and killed many innocent
people.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals Threaten Security in Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Wild animals are posing
threats to residents in the Tunduru District in the Ruvuma Region,
southern Tanzania, a local government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, wild animals have killed 15 people in the
Lukumbule and Malasi Divisions in Tunduru, the district Commissioner
Tatu Rutta told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Of the victims, eight have been killed by crocodiles, five by
elephants and two by lions, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a bitter tone, the district commissioner said that wild
beasts are a threat in the district, sandwiched by the Selous Game
Reserve and River Ruvuma which are densely populated by wild animals.
</P>
<P>
She said apart from threatening people's lives, the wild animals
are devastating agricultural crops in farms and even eating those
stored in locally constructed storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
Every year more than 30 percent of food crops are destroyed by the
animals, thus causing food shortages, she said.
</P>
<P>
The official said shortage of game officers is one of the factors
contributing to the insecurity of local residents and their farms. She
said each division of the district has only one game officer, adding
that more are needed for the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a good reputation for wildlife conservation, but
people in the east African country often complain that they are
threatened by wild animals and are inadequately compensated by the
government for their losses.

<HEADLINE> Arab League to Meet on U.S. Strike in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Council will
hold an extraordinary session Monday at the level of chief
delegates to look into the U.S. shelling of a pharmaceutical
factory in Sudan, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the Cairo-based AL will seek a unified Arab stance
on this score, said Ahmad Bin Heli, AL assistant secretary general.
</P>
<P>
AL secretary general Esmat Abdel Meguid has received a
memorandum from Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail
calling for holding an emergency session by the league council, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid also received a report from the Sudanese foreign
minister on the scope of damage done to the vaccine-producing
factory.
</P>
<P>
In the report, he further expressed Sudan's readiness to
receive an international fact-finding mission to explore the
nature of the factory.
</P>
<P>
The AL has strongly condemned the U.S. bombardment Thursday of
a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudanese capital Khartoum which left
a number of civilians dead and flattened a facility providing the
country with 50 percent of its needs of medicines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the AL Secretariat said it
deemed the unwarranted action a serious aggression on a sovereign
Arab country and a flagrant violation of the international law and
conventions and the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The AL urged the U.S., as a permanent Security Council member
and a super power shouldering the responsibility for maintaining
world peace and security, to respect international legitimacy and
desist from such acts that violate world countries' sovereignty
and encourage acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced support for Sudan in the face of threats
to its stability, unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched the attacks in what it claimed retaliation
for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August
7. It has accused Sudan of sponsoring international terrorism and
claimed the factory was manufacturing chemical weapons agents that
could be used by Islamic militants to launch new attacks against
U.S. targets.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Million Angolan Children Vaccinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- In the first phase of the
national anti-polio campaign in Angola, about 550,000 children
under the age of five years have taken vaccine drops, the Angolan
health ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that nearly three million Angolan children
under five will be given polio vaccine free of charge during
the anti-polio drive.
</P>
<P>
Starting from Wednesday, local media in capital Luanda
launched a mass mobilization drive, calling on the parents to
bring their children to the vaccination centers. Leaders of
governments, churches and mass organizations personally gave
drops of vaccine against polio to the children.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for African countries to implement a national
vaccination campaign. Therefore, the health ministry mobilized
3,900 people in 317 teams to serve the children around the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Some of the wokers had to pass a long journey to the remote
areas, risking the scattered land mines and rampant
banditry.
</P>
<P>
Because of the prolonged civil war, malnutrition and various
diseases, Angola has the highest child mortality rate in the
world -- one of every four children in Angola dies before the age
of five years.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and some non-governmental organizations
have provided their supports for the anti-polio campaign.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the drive will begin at the end of
September this year.

CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) said it will cast in
the market a new 1,000-riyal (7.46 U.S. dollars) bank note, the
biggest of its kind in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The CBY printed the new bank note in Germany with special
characteristics including a number of secret features and other
technical features that can protect it against damage, Saturday's
Arabic daily Al-Hayat quoted a CBY official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CBY will declare the date of starting the circulation of
the new bank note soon, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The bank had issued a 500-riyal bank note in February, 1997,
and a 200-riyal bank note in 1996 under the financial and fiscal
reforms, he noted.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The damage inflicted by environmental pollution in
Morocco is estimated at 8.2 percent of the gross national products
(GDP) or 4 billion U.S. dollars annually, apart from the
non-economic damage, according to the lastest statistics of the
Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
The damage resulting from the liquid waste exceeds 2.2 billion
dollars a year and is also on the rise due to the increasing
population, Saturday's Al-Hayat newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the environment deterioration in
Morocco and worldwide to natural causes such as desertification
and human causes such as the industrial liquid and solid waste and
gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Port Said Container Plant, an affiliate of the
Holding Co. for Transport on the Mediterranean Sea, is expected to

<P>
BEIRUT -- The World Bank has decided to set up an office in
Beirut in order to further provide Lebanon with a financial
support for its post-civil war reconstruction, the Daily Star

The World Bank started lending money to Lebanon in 1992 after
the country embarked on a reconstruction process after the
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
A total of 667 million U.S. dollars in loans and guarantees
have been approved for Lebanon. But only 191 million dollars, or
28 percent, had actually been spent up to last June.

AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent said Saturday that Jordan will continue its support for
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This is the first remark the regent made on the issue of the
Palestinians since King Hussein temporarily transferred most of
his rights to Hassan on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the cabinet members and some parliament deputies,
Hassan said Jordan has a "commitment towards the Palestinians to
achieve their legitimate rights on their national soil."
</P>
<P>
His remarks are totally in line with Hussein's policy on the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
The power transfer has been the first one in Hussein's ruling
history. It happened after the king had to stay in the United
States for a long period of time to treat the cancer in his
lymphatic tissue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been keeping a close watch on the developments of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. It supports the
Palestinians to establish an independent state with its capital in
Jerusalem, while it sticks to a policy of normalizing ties with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now Israel's closest ally in the Arab world. And it
is one of the two Arab countries to have reached peace treaty with
Israel.

military one.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Luanda International Airport, Wolpe said that
the U.S. government fears that the situation in the DRC could "be

conditions for a lasting peace there."
</P>
<P>
Wolpe conveyed to Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos a

</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy noted that diplomatic and political solution is
the only way out and his government has ruled out the possibility
of a military solution to the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wolpe arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit to the
southern African country. He held talks with Angolan Deputy
Foreign Minister Jorge Chicote at the airport.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Parliament Condemns U.S. Missile Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Lower House of
Parliament fiercely denounced on Saturday the Thursday missile
attacks by the United States in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile attacks were "an aggression on the
sovereignty and territorial integrity" of these two countries
"under the pretext of pursuing terrorism," the house said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Such aggression also represented "a deliberate provocation of
the peoples' rights," the house added in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched the attacks on a number of suspected
terrorist-related sites in Afghanistan and Sudan Thursday in
retaliation against the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lower House said the best way to fight terrorism
is through international cooperation and peaceful and diplomatic
methods.
</P>
<P>
The nationalist-dominated Lower House often adopts hard
policies against Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the Lower House's statement, Jordan's Royal
Court and government were relatively mild while commenting on
this issue. They did not criticize the U.S. missile attacks, but
instead condemned terrorism in general.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has declared Jordan as its third para-allied country
in the Middle East after Israel and Egypt. Its economic and
military aid for Jordan reached 225 million U.S. dollars in
1998.

KHARTOUM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudan Saturday asked the U.N.
Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the recent U.S. air
raid on an alleged terrorist-related site in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Security Council, the Sudanese Ministry of
Foreign Relations asked the Security Council to shoulder its
responsibility under the U.N. Charter and condemn the
U.S. aggression, Sudanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Sudan of sponsoring international terrorism,
fired cruise missiles Thursday night at a pharmaceutical factory
in Khartoum in what it claimed retaliation for the twin bombings
of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people were killed and 5,000 others wounded in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Sudan requested that the United Nations set up
a technical fact-finding committee to probe the claims of the
United States and adopt measures to prevent the repetition of
similar strikes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Such actions are "grave behavior and flagrant violation of the
U.N. Charter," said the message.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that the U.S. moves are aimed at
defaming Sudan and undermining its relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Sudan held the United States responsible for
all the human and material losses resulting from the aggression,
asserting its readiness to provide all relevant information on the
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sudan does not attack or threaten the U.S. interests on the
basis of principle of Islam and humanity and is ready for full
cooperation in tracking down the perpetrators of the bombings of
the two U.S. embassies, the foreign ministry said in the message.

TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has ordered the release of 84 prisoners jailed for
defaulting on debts.

<HEADLINE> Six Taiwan Residents Killed In Bus Accident In Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven people, 6 of them tourists
from Taiwan, were killed Saturday, when the bus they were riding
in was involved in a head-on collision with a truck in the city of
Jiuquan in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The accident occured at 4:30 p.m. The bus, which belonged to
China International Travel Service's Jiuquan Branch, was carrying
17 people, 14 of them Taiwanese. The bus driver and 5 of the
Taiwan residents were killed instantly and another Taiwan resident
died later.
</P>
<P>
The 6 Taiwan residents, 5 men and 1 woman, were in their 60s or
70s. One Taiwan resident who was seriously injured was
hospitalized but is now out of danger.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to a hospital in the city of Yumen for
emergency care and were moved to another hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Gansu provincial government is treating the matter very
seriously and officials from Beijing's Association for Relations
across the Taiwan Strait are expected to come to Gansu. Relatives
of the victims will come to Lanzhou, the provincial capital, or to
Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, as will travel agency officials.
</P>
<P>
The accident is still under investigation, but initial reports
are that it occurred when the truck crossed the medial strip into
the oncoming bus's path. But the high speed of both vehicles is
also believed to be a factor, local officials say.

<P>
Flooding on the Yangtze has caused at least 200 billion yuan
(24.1 billion U.S. dollars) worth of damage. The disaster also
claimed thousands of lives and affected more than 240 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said today that at least 19 people died in
flooding caused by torrential rains in Sichuan Province, in the
Southwest, between August 19 and 21, and another three people were
reported missing.
</P>
<P>
More than 8.5 million people, or a quarter of the population of
Heilongjiang Province, have been affected by this year's
devastating floods, and agricultural losses are estimated at 14
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has postponed a visit to Japan and Russia
because of the flooding. Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, spoke with leaders of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Saturday evening about the
flood situation there and to inquire about people involved in the
fight. Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is still
inspecting the flood situation in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters had sent 200 million yuan worth of goods to areas
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, Nenjiang and
Songhua.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.7 billion yuan worth of donations had been sent to
China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Red Cross Society of China,
and the All-China Charity Federation by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The eight non-communist parties and the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce have contributed 613,900 yuan. A few days
ago, blankets, tents, and water purifiers donated by the United
States government were sent to Hunan by air. China Daily reports
that the People's Insurance Company of China group (PICC) had paid
1 billion yuan for damage in flood-hit areas by August 20.

<P>
Flood-stricken areas are expecting more cotton quilts, drinking
water, drugs, and other items.

Floods are often accompanied by epidemic diseases, and Health
Minister Zhang Wenkang says that the disease situation in China's
flooded areas is under control but that infectious diseases are
still a threat.
</P>
<P>
About 400 cases of snail fever have been reported in Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, where the worst
flooding has taken place, and more cases are expected in the near
future because snail fever takes a fairly long time, about 40
days, to develop.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that the incidence of intestinal disease,
dysentery, hepatitis, and colds is greater than for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
A large number of medical teams are working day and night to
treat the sick.
</P>
<P>
China said today that it would stop the cutting of timber in
the western part of Sichuan on the upper reaches of the Yangtze to
stop the soil erosion there that has made the flooding worse.
</P>
<P>
The felling of trees on 4.63 million hectares of Chuanxi Forest
Area land will cease and lumber sellers there will be closed down,
without exception, on September 1, Sichuan's Governor Song Baorui
told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka-Delhi Relations May Deteriorate Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India are at a row
over the so-called "illegal Bangladeshi nationals" in India, which
analysts said might undermine relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A report in Sunday's edition of the national English-language
newspaper, The Independent, said that the Indian government has
decided to formulate a "national policy on infiltration, and
identification and deportation of Bangladeshi nationals" living in
India illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government convened on Monday a meeting of officials
of the states of West Bengal and Maharashtra on the deportation
issue, a signal showing that India would take a "tough decision to
end 'infiltration,'" the report said.
</P>
<P>
And in West Bengal, the issue of push-back of alleged
Bangladeshi nationals has come full circle, following an official
pronouncement by the West Bengal government to extradite 46
Bengali-speaking people, allegedly Bangladeshis, a volte-face of
its original stance over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the West Bengal government held that among the
would-be Bengali-speaking deportees from the southwestern Indian
state of Maharashtra there were a large number of Indians
belonging to West Bengal state, strongly protesting against the
proposed deportation of so-called Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
In-built compulsions within the state compelled the government
to shift its position on the issue of deportation of
"Bangladeshis," allegedly living in Maharashtra and other states
of India, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of deporting Bengali-speaking people in Maharashtra
was raised in India's parliament last month by Home Minister Lal
Krishna Advani, and was strongly opposed by West Bengal. West
Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu said that his state would be
heavily affected if Bengali-speaking nationals were overthrown
from Bombay and Maharashtra, a commentary in the newspaper The New
Nation daily said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
India's "push-back" issue was first raised in 1993 by the then
Indian Congress government and died down when Bangladesh applied
force by deploying security forces to resist such moves, and
nothing was heard from India since then, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a report in The Independent daily said that
Bangladesh would not accept anybody pushed into its territory "in
the name of push-back," as "no Bangladeshi is staying in India
illegally," quoting a source of an inter-ministerial meeting
presided over by Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad, which
discussed the latest situation arising out of the "push-back" of
so-called Bangladeshis by India.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to accept them as Bangladeshi -- if they (the
Indian authorities) suspect anybody as Bangladeshi, they have to
follow internationally accepted norms and procedure for
repatriation," as "push-back is not a legal procedure," the report
quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on August 13, the foreign minister said
that there were no illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India
and so there was no question of repatriating Bangladeshis from
India. He urged India not to take any unilateral decision on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the present Indian government would
not do anything that would jeopardize the "excellent relations"
existing between the two countries. "We hope that they would
continue with the relations of cooperation, friendship and
understanding between India and Bangladesh," he said.
</P>
<P>
And at a press conference early this month, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina also denied that there were any illegal Bangladeshis
in India.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the so-called "illegal Bangladeshis" in India
between the two neighbors would inevitably have a negative impact
on their relations, whatever the motives behind the moves of the
Indians, according to the analysts.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Intensifies Search for Missing Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- As bad weather blocked
helicopters from searching for the plane missing since Friday
morning, Nepal intensified the ground efforts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As it was raining and cloudy on top of the mountains and
jungles, the search operation by the four helicopters were
interrupted time and again, a duty officer at the Rescue and
Coordination Center (RCC) of the capital's Tribhuvan International
Airport told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Ananda Prasad Dhungana
told the Lower House of Parliament Sunday that the ground
operation has been intensified.
</P>
<P>
He said that the area has been determined and a strategy has
been worked out for continuing vigorously the search and rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
The twin Otter plane with 18 people on board including three
crew members and three Indians lost contact five minutes after it
took off at 11:10 am Friday in Jomsom, western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane which belongs to the private-owned Lumbini
Airways was scheduled to arrive in Pokhara, 80 kilometres away, at
11:30.
</P>
<P>
The army and police are joining in the search operation
together with local people.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Search and Rescue Organization had been requested to
help track the plane through satellite, but the duty officer at
RCC said that the longitude and latitude determined by the Indian
side is not an area lying on the route.
</P>
<P>
Minister Dhungana said that airports in New Delhi, Calcutta,
Patna and Bangalore of India had been contacted, but no
significant information was available.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Snubs Mandela's Mediation Efforts on Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An emergency southern African
summit on the crisis in Democratic Republic of congo (DRC) called
for by South African President Nelson Mandela got underway Sunday
afternoon in Pretoria despite the absence of Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's presidential spokesman George Charamba told the
country's news agency ZIANA Sunday that Mugabe was not going to
attend the talks called by Mandela, chairman of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), to broker a ceasefire in
the DRC which is facing a rebellion from Tutsis-led soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC met and took a decision through its defense
ministers last week in Harare and that decision is being
implemented so we cannot go back on that decision to see whether
it is proper for the region to deploy troops in the DRC,"
Charamba said.
</P>
<P>
"The definite answer is that we are not going to attend the
summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nine SADC defense ministers met here last Tuesday and agreed
that the region should intervene in the DRC crisis militarily and
Zimbabwean troops numbering over 600 have been reportedly
deployed alongside Congolese troops in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana, however, told
journalists in South Africa that efforts to get Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos and Mugabe to the twin summit which began
Saturday were still underway.
</P>
<P>
Already in Pretoria for the talks are Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu, Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, and representatives
sent in by DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos has, like Kabila, claimed illness saying he will
send a representative.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Mandela have differences over the running of the
regional organ on politics, defense and security which Mandela
thinks should fall under SADC structures, which he currently
chairs.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also differed on how best to deal with the DRC
crisis with Mandela favoring a diplomatic solution whereas
Mugabe, who chairs the security organ has steadfastly defended
the military option.
</P>
<P>
A Tutsi-led rebellion against Kabila's regime began in the DRC
on August 2. The rebels claimed Sunday to have occupied the city
Kisangani, the third largest city in the vast central African
country, as well as the strategic airport of Kitona in the
southwest.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Message of Jiang Zemin to Rehabilitation Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A message from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin was read by Deng Pufang, chairman of the
China Disabled Persons' Federation, at the opening ceremony of the
11th Rehabilitation International Asia and the Pacific Regional
Conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the message is as follows:
</P>
<P>
The 11th Rehabilitation International Asia and the Pacific
Regional Conference,
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the convening of the 11th Rehabilitation
International Asia and the Pacific Regional Conference cum the
Campaign '98 for the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons
(1993-2002) in Hong Kong, I would like to express, on behalf of
the Chinese government and people as well as in my own name, warm
congratulations to the conference and good wishes to all delegates
and participants!
</P>
<P>
It is of special significance for Hong Kong to host this
conference after her return to the motherland. Friends from all
over the world could witness the successful practice in Hong Kong
of the Chinese government's policies of "one country, two
systems", "Hong Kong people administrating Hong Kong affairs" and
high degree of autonomy, and could feel the efforts of the Chinese
government and the government of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region to promote the general progress of social civilization
along with their dedication to economic development.
</P>
<P>
Disability exists along with human beings. People with
disabilities have the desire and ability to participate in
community life and are equally creators of social wealth for which
they make much greater efforts than people without disabilities.
They, as all others, should be entitled to all human dignity and
rights. The emancipation of disabled people as the most
under-privileged group in the society symbolizes significantly the
development of human civilization and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The 48th Session of the UNESCAP held in Beijing in April, 1992
adopted unanimously the resolution, proclaiming 1993-2002 as the
Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons. Such an effort and
that of Rehabilitation International for improving rehabilitation
service to disabled people expresses the lofty pursuit of the
international community for further improving the status of
disabled people and giving more play to their roles in society.
The convening of this conference will make new contribution to the
promotion of the undertaking of disabled people.
</P>
<P>
By following the United Nations World Program concerning
Disabled Persons and the ESCAP resolution on the Asian and Pacific
Decade of Disabled Persons, the Chinese government has adopted
many effective measures in light with the specific situation of
her disabled people to protect the rights and interest of disabled
people. China promulgated the Law on the Protection of Disabled
People, formulated and are implementing three consecutive 5-year
work programs for promoting work on disability, support the
establishment of organizations of disabled people, encourage the
self-efforts by disabled people, all of which have remarkably
changed and improved the status of disabled people in the aspects
of rehabilitation, education, employment as well as material and
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
China takes a considerable portion in the world population with
disabilities. The Chinese government and people are willing to
work together with the international community and share our
efforts for realizing the goals of "equality, participating and
sharing" of disabled people and for our endeavor of human
civilization and progress!
</P>
<P>
I wish the conference success!

WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton vowed that the United States
would use "all the tools at our disposal" to fight the terrorist
network of Osama bin Laden, as the Administration outlined efforts
to squeeze him financially after Thursday's cruise-missiles
strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's defense of his private conduct this year
may have endangered more than his reputation and credibility. The
legal battles he has fought to avoid acknowledging that his
behavior with Monica S. Lewinsky was inappropriate may have eroded
Presidential power and prerogatives for Presidents in the future,
legal experts, constitutional scholars and political scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Americans continue to see U.S. President Bill Clinton as a
strong leader in touch with their problems even as a growing
majority express doubts about his honesty, integrity and moral
character, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey.
</P>
<P>
-- As a planned peace summit fizzled, the Congo conflict
escalated into a full-blown regional fight Saturday with Angolan
ans Zimbabwean troops, backed by planes and tanks, reportedly
fighting with President Laurent Kabila's forces to defeat
Rwandan-backed rebels trying to oust him.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,500
representatives from various countries and regions in the world
attended the 11th Rehabilitation International Asia and the
Pacific Regional Conference which was opened here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims at maintaining a complementary balance
between the East and the West, the tradition and the modern, and
presenting both historical perspectives and new trends of the
rehabilitation for the disabled people, said Harry Fang,
chairperson of the Joint Council for the Physically and Mentally
Disabled at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A message from Chinese President Jiang Zemin was read by Deng
Pufang, president of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, at
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Jiang extended his warm congratulations to the
conference on behalf of the Chinese government and people as well
as in his own name.
</P>
<P>
He said that disability exists along with human beings. People
with disabilities have the desire and ability to participate in

held in Beijing in April, 1992 adopted unanimously a resolution,
proclaiming 1993-2002 as the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled

</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), said at the opening ceremony: "we
have been making great strides in developing rehabilitation
services, promoting awareness and understanding, and moving
towards our shared goal of equal opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Our achievements are results of the joint efforts of
government departments, statutory bodies and non-governmental
organizations including self-help organizations. We will enhance
these partnerships and pursue together the goals set out in our
White Paper on Rehabilitation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that the needs of people with disabilities should
 not be neglected under the present economic climate and he
expressed the hope that the conference would build on the progress
 made and contribute to the well being of people with disability
by promoting regional cooperation and support.
</P>

In his speech, Deng Pufang said that over the past decade, 3
million disabled people in China received various rehabilitation

Through poverty alleviation projects, 5 million poor disabled
people in rural areas have been helped out of poverty, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medical Team Arrives In Lhasa To Help Tibetans With Eye Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical team arrived in
the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region today to do eye operations
for some 1,000 Tibetans for free.
</P>
<P>
The project is a cooperative affair of the China Disabled
Persons Federation and Lions Clubs International, with 23 doctors
performing cataract operations on Tibetan patients in Lhasa and in
Qamdo, Nyingchi and Shannan prefectures.
</P>
<P>
A China Disabled Persons Federation spokesperson says that this
will be the first large scale cataract operation ever in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of cataracts in Tibet is double that of other
parts of China because of the high elevation and extreme exposure
to the sun's ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
The underdeveloped economy and lack of access to medical and
communications services there make it almost impossible for
cataract sufferers to regain their eyesight.

<HEADLINE> Weizman: Peace Process Must Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said Sunday that the Middle East peace process must continue
despite the killing of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said this while in a condolence call at Raanan's
family. The 63-year-old rabbi was stabbed to death in his home
Thursday night by a Palestinian intruder in Tel Rumeida, Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Israel security forces imposed a curfew
in the city forbidding the Palestinians leaving and entering,
particularly in the city sector under their control.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, some local Jewish settler's leaders
criticized Weizman for his support to the peace process, saying
he is a "spy" for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"For my whole life I have fought for the security and benefit of
Israel and no body can expressed his doubt about that," Weizman
said, rejecting the criticism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his sorrow for the killing of the rabbi, but said
that Israel could live in complete peace only after reaching an
peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The killing of Raanan caused great concern in Israel. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has contacted Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, demanding the assailant, believed to have
fled to the Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron, be arrested.
</P>
<P>
He said the killing reinforced his resolve not to sign a deal
on a troop withdrawal from the West Bank unless the Palestinians
guarantee they will meet their security obligations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet members discussed this issue at the weekly
meeting on Sunday and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
preventive security measures must be taken to ensure the safety of
Jewish settlers in the city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces maintained a high profile in Hebron
over the weekend, as a tense calm prevailed. The Palestinian
security forces are also investigating the incident, but the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) did not condemn the killing.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the PNA leaders openly condemn the
killing incident and they must take strict measures to ensure that
such incident will not happen again," Weizman said during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Jewish settlers are living in Hebron, a city with a
30,000 Palestinian population, and only seven Jewish families
living in Tel Rumeida.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak rejected on Sunday the
Hebron Jewish settler leader's criticism about Weizman, saying
they must be brought to court for their treatment of the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that Weizman is a key peace maker in the region and
respected by not only the Israeli people, but the people of all
countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zimbabwe Not to Attend SADC Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's attempts to
bring a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and heal a rift in the 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) was being hampered Sunday due to the absence of
key players in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Angola nor Zimbabwe will be involved at all in the
SADC summit," Parks Mankahlana, spokesman for South African
President Nelson Mandela, told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said they would not send delegations, but efforts
to get them to have peace negotiation in South Africa have not
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Both Zimbabwe and Angola are at the forefront of the SADC camp
favoring military intervention in the DRC and have sent troops
and arms to support President Laurent Kabila, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attempts to broker peace between the DRC government
and Uganda and Rwanda, which are allegedly backing the rebels,
were also being frustrated.
</P>
<P>
A DRC delegation attending the talks hosted by Mandela was
consulting Kabila about a South African proposal for peace tabled
in Pretoria earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties have yet to meet at the negotiating table
and South African leaders are shuffling between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
The peace proposal, if accepted by the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda,
will be tabled at the SADC summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting later Sunday will also be attended by Kenya's
President Daniel arap Moi (who is not a member of the SADC) and a
representative of the Organization of African Unity, diplomatic
sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar will leave for Johannesburg Sunday for a
four-day state visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which is at the invitation of South African
President Nelson Mandela, would afford the two leaders the
opportunity to discuss bilateral and multi-lateral issues
particularly as it concerns peace and stability in Africa, the
official New Nigerian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the South African Foreign Ministry said Nigeria's
transition to democratic civil rule would top the agenda of talks
between Abubakar and Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The visit to South Africa would be Abubakar's first trip
abroad since he came to power on June 9.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first visit by a Nigerian leader to
Johannesburg since 1995, when bilateral relations got strained as
Mandela led the call for international sanctions against Nigeria
for executing nine minority activists.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ice between the two leading African nations began
to break after Abubakar assumed power in June and took moves to
promote democracy and human rights in the most populous African
country, including releasing all political detainees and starting
dialog with opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki visited Nigeria in
July in the height of the political crisis in Nigeria, following
the death in detention of Moshood Abiola, the believed winner of
the annulled 1993 presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Chambishi Plants Sold for $50 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Chambishi cobalt and
acid plants have been sold to Avmin of South Africa at 50 million
U.S. Dollars, raising optimism for a higher price for Nkana and
Nchanga divisions of the country's two largest copper mines.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to be sealed within next week, Times of
Zambia said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiating team in charge of privatizing
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) said prospects of
selling Nkana and Nchanga divisions at a higher price were high,
considering the sum of 150 million Dollars offered by the
collapsed Kafue Consortium, a trans-national corporation, to the
two mines together with the Chambishi cobalt and acid plants.
</P>
<P>
The coming back of Avmin, one of the major companies in the
Kafue Consortium which intended to buy the Nkana and Nchanga
mines last year and later gave up following its collapse, has
raised much excitement and hope that other companies would join
the race to bid for the remaining ZCCM divisions individually.
</P>
<P>
Avmin, according to the paper, will construct a new processing
facility for the slug material which will be commissioned in 30
months' time. And the workers in the Chambishi components will
be transferred to the company.
</P>
<P>
The Nkana and Nchanga mines register over 60 percent of ZCCM's
copper output. Their privatization is a precondition set by the
Paris Club to release its 530 million Dollars of pledged aid to
Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Launch National Malaria Mobilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim has announced that a national malaria social
mobilization week will be launched from August 24 to 30 to
enhance public awareness on the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Herald, Adem told a press
conference Saturday though the government has been in the past
supporting efforts to bring malaria under control, the
participation of non-governmental and other sectors was less than
expected.
</P>
<P>
The lukewarm to the fight against malaria was due to lack of
public awareness about the challenge and lack of information on
the systematic approach to contain the spread of the epidemic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 to 500 million people who suffer from malaria and
the more than two million who die of malaria in the world
annually, 90 percent are Africans, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, where two-thirds of the population is affected by
malaria, the disease is "unstable" due to the environment which
worsens the situation than in the other sub-Saharan countries,
Ibrahim added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the mobilization week will be observed by
conducting malaria prevention activities and providing education
on the prevention and control of the disease in all regional
states.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the malaria week are to inform the public
about the socio-economic effects of the disease and the measures
to be taken to control it as well as enhance the role of
governmental, non-governmental organizations and the public at
large in efforts being undertaken in its prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
The prevention and control of malaria is one of priority tasks
indicated in the government's health policy, he said, adding that
malaria control will be the major duty of health institutions
followed by implementing health management strategy in the coming
years.

<P>
While most flood-stranded victims have been evacuated, flood
control workers and soldiers are consolidating dykes and
embankments to prepare for possible new floods, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia suffered severe flooding since July, with bursts
and mud-rock flows spotted frequently along more than 20 rivers in
the region's eastern part.
</P>
<P>
Local people and soldiers have worked hard for the past month
to fight the floods. The Beijing Military Area Command and the
Shenyang Military Area Command have sent more than five thousand
soldiers and six helicopters to join in the anti-flood work.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the 813 bursts have been plugged and some 42
kilometres of embankments have been consolidated.
</P>
<P>
While more than 900,000 flood victims have been evacuated to
safe places, about 10,000 people still besieged by floods have got
out of danger and have food, medicines and daily necessities.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Condemns U.S. Attacks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri Sunday condemned the recent United
States air raids on Sudan and Afghanistan as proof of
state-sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Majlis, Nateq-Nouri said the strikes were clear
examples of terrorist acts conducted by a government despite a
pretext that they were launched to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched surprise air attacks Thursday night against
six sites in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan,
which Washington described as key bases used by terrorists behind
the August 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in capitals of Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee that Washington will not attack any
other country, Nateq-Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the law of jungle that Washington allows
itself to violate international norms and regulations and attack
any country it chooses.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the U.S. administration faces a domestic problem, it
tries to divert the public attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at this time, the objective was to shift the
attention away from the sex scandal involving U.S. President Bill
Clinton who admitted last week that he had an inappropriate
relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Despite the repeated U.S. accusations against Iran of
harboring and supporting terrorism, Nateq-Nouri said that Iran
deplores terrorism, state terrorism in particular, because it is
also a victim of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami Saturday condemned the U.S.
missile attacks and voiced support for Khartoum to lodge complain
to the United Nations against Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Sudanese counterpart Omar
Hassan al-Bashir, Khatami termed the U.S. attack as an aggression
against Sudan, violation of international laws and threat to the
world security.

</P>
<P>
An organizing committee official who demanded anonymity said

competition.
</P>

He hoped at least five more would send their soccer teams to
the Games which are to start in December in Bangkok.

Olympic Council of Asia would persuade Saudi Arabia, Syria,

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The annual South Pacific
Forum (SPF) heads of government meeting is scheduled to begin
Monday in Pohnpei, capital of the Federated States of Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
Issues expected to be discussed at the two-day meeting of the
heads of government of SPF's 16 member countries include trade
liberalization and economic reforms, the impact of the Asian
financial crisis on the Pacific region, climate change, regional
security, nuclear testing and management of fisheries.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, prime ministers of New Zealand,
Australia, Papua New Guinea and Samoa will be unable to attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first time both the Australian and New
 Zealand prime ministers are absent from the forum.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, grappling with
Australia's tax reforms and an imminent election, will be
represented at the forum by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced in a
statement a few days ago that Foreign Minister Don McKinnon would
represent New Zealand on her behalf at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said she was disappointed that she was unable to meet
Pacific leaders, because of the "domestic political situation."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that New Zealand and Australia will use the
forum in Pohnpei to seek support for a South Pacific whale
sanctuary, to complement existing sanctuaries in the Southern and
Indian Oceans. Under the plan, the entire southern hemisphere
could become a whale sanctuary.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Special Finance Scheme for Small, Medium-sized Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
launch a Special Finance Scheme on Monday to provide guarantees
for loans for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which have
difficulties in obtaining adequate finance from lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The 2.5 billion-HK-dollar (320 million U.S. dollars) scheme is
part of the package of the special relief measures announced by
the government on June 22 to ease Hong Kong's economic adjustment,
 a press release by the Government Information Service said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the government will act as the guarantor for
loans to SMEs approved by lending institutions. The maximum amount
of the guarantee in each case is 2 million HK dollars (256,410
U.S. dollars) or 50 percent of the approved loan, whichever is the
less.
</P>
<P>
In addition, if the concerned institution is a licensed bank,
the government will provide a matching deposit in that bank so
that the loan to deposit ratio of the bank will be maintained at a
comfortable level after loans are extended to SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would be market-driven. It would rely on the lending
institutions to exercise their usual prudent professional judgment
in assessing applicants' credit worthiness.
</P>
<P>
The risk of default would be shared by the lenders and the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
All companies registered in Hong Kong are eligible to apply for
the scheme. The loans covered by the scheme may be offered as term
loans or in the form of a new credit lines and the guarantee
period is up to a maximum of 365 days.
</P>
<P>
Other than those limitations on the use of the loans which may
be imposed by the lending institutions, the scheme will not impose
limitations on the specific uses of the loans.
</P>
<P>
The lending institutions will determine the interest for the
loans they offer to SMEs in accordance with their established
principles and the government will not intervene in such
commercial decisions.
</P>
<P>
All applications must be lodged through banks or deposit taking
companies which have participated in the Scheme. So far, 26 banks
or deposit taking companies have signed the deed to join the
school.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju left here Sunday for a
four-day visit to Iran and three Central Asian countries for talks
mainly focusing on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The first stop of Kanju's four-day tour will be Tehran, where
he is scheduled to have wide-ranging exchange of views with the
Iranian leaders, according to a statement by Kanju before his
departure.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to Iran, Kanju is also to visit Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral matters, the Afghan issue will prominently
figure in the talks with leaders of Iran and the three Central
Asian countries, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Central Asian countries have expressed serious concern
over the Taliban militia's recent victories in northern
Afghanistan and some of them accused Pakistan of backing the
Taliban. However, the charges have been denied by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is our close and fraternal neighbor and we always consult
each other on such occasion," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In the Central Asian states, Kanju is to apprise their
leadership of Pakistan's assessment of the situation in
Afghanistan and the ways of ensuring regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions would also focus on bilateral relations with
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which are based on
historical bonds of faith and kinship," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Kanju said he was looking forward to "very constructive
exchange of views during the visit to these brotherly countries"
and was hopeful of "a positive outcome."

<HEADLINE> Adult Education Prosperous in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In addition to the development of
higher learning education, adult education in Macao has been
booming over the past dozen years, a government official said
during a two-day seminar on adult education which closed here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chan Kai Chon, an official with the Education and
Youth Department of the Macao government, more than 80
institutions in Macao are engaged in adult education.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-97 school year, nearly 47,000 people took adult
education courses of various kinds, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Adult education which lasts for people's entire life has
become the trend of adult-educational reform and development in
the world today, and such a trend is surely responded in Macao,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Among the adult educational institutions in Macao, less than
one-third are run by the government. Most of them are managed by
churches, social bodies and charitable or individual
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Major courses include language (including Portuguese, English
and Chinese), mathematics, accounting, computer, administration,
business management and other practical skills.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Sparetime Study Center, which was founded by the
Macao Federation of Trade Unions in 1982, is a major institution
on adult education in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up to help the large number of new
immigrants in Macao acquire better working skills, while Macao was
experiencing a fledgling economy at that time, said Lei Pui Lam,
president of the center.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 16 years, more than 81,000 persons have received
training at the center. That means one out of five Macao residents
is the center's beneficiary, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Macao government has been making concerted
efforts with social bodies and individuals in Macao to boost adult
education.
</P>
<P>
The government sets aside more than one million patacas (about
125,000 U.S. dollars) each year for adult education, according to
government sources.

<HEADLINE> China Stops Lumbering of Natural Forests in Western Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China announced today to stop
lumbering of natural forests in the western part of Sichuan
Province on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in a bid to
curb severe soil erosion that exacerbates the threat of floods.
</P>
<P>
Felling of natural trees in the Chuanxi Forest Area, totaling
4.63 million hectares, will be prohibited and wood markets there
will be closed down without any exception from September 1, Song
Baorui, provincial governor, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by the provincial government will greatly
help protect forest resources and improve ecological balance on
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move comes at a time when devastating Yangtze floods
have caused hundreds of billion yuan economic losses and claimed
thousands of lives so far this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, a total of 54 counties in the
western part of Sichuan, one of the most densely-populated
provinces in southwest China, are subject to the unconditioned
prohibition order.
</P>
<P>
The Chuanxi Forest Area, one of the three largest forest areas
in China, has a major role in conserving headwaters of the Yangtze
River. But excessive felling has remarkably weakened its role.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that more than 70 lumbering firms have
been operating in the area and sold some 120 million cubic metres
of wood out of the area for the past decades.
</P>
<P>
As a result of reduction in natural forests and ecological
imbalance, the area of soil erosion in the western part of Sichuan
has almost doubled from 60,000 square kilometres in the 1950s to
110,000 square kilometres at present.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of both local environment and all the Yangtze
areas, we now have to act promptly to protect the natural forests
and curb soil erosion," said Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
According to a comprehensive afforestation program of the
province, strict protection will be exercised in the Chuanxi
Forest Area upon the ceasing of lumbering, while forest
regeneration will be conducted in another 1.83 million hectares of
land between 1998 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 8.97 million hectares of hillsides will be
closed to livestock grazing and fuel gathering so as to facilitate
afforestation. Workers of the current lumbering firms will be
responsible for planting and protecting trees.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the Chuanxi Forest Area will be capable of
conserving 39 billion cubic metres of headwaters and soil erosion
in the area will be basically under control, thus greatly reducing
the danger caused by Yangtze floods, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeking Extension of IMF-WB Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is seeking to extend the
economic reform program co-sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in a bid to spur the economic
development, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed Jordanian cabinet has applied for the
extension for at least one year, citing Jordan's economy will fall
short of the expectations of the 1988-1999 IMF-WB program when it
expires in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The program has succeeded on the macro-economic level,
including stabilizing the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar
and Jordan's currency dinar and increasing Jordan's foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
But it has failed to help the kingdom achieve sustainable
economic growth, the paper quoted economists and bankers as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth was healthy and sustainable only in the
first three years of the IMF-WB reform, but after that it became
volatile and even decreased to 0.8 percent in 1996, much lower
than the 5.2 percent target set by the previous government, said
Fahed Fanek, a leading economist at the Privatization Unite of the
Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economic growth rate in 1997 was estimated at 2.5 to 3
percent, and the government has revised its forecast of the 1998
growth rate from 6 percent to 3.2 percent and even set a 2.2
percent target for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lower growth rates have led to declining living standards,
higher unemployment and increased poverty, in view of a higher
annual population growth rate of 3.5 percent, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the kingdom was estimated at 27
percent in March this year. About 45 percent of the families are
living under the poverty line, earning less than 210 U.S. dollars
a month.
</P>
<P>
With the one-year extension of the IMF-WB reform, Jordanian new
government hopes to realize a 6 percent economic growth rate in
2000 so to curb unemployment, combat poverty and improve
people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministers Fayez Tarawneh, who formed the government last
Thursday, has placed economic development as the priority of his
government. He has began preparations for the extension of the
IMF-WB reform program and seeking other international help to help
reinvigorate Jordan's economy.

<HEADLINE> Papers Circulated on Secession of Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Seditious materials on the
status of Zambia's Western Province have surfaced in the capital
city of Lusaka, prompting the government warning to deal with
those distributing them ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
The brochures printed on high quality papers are being
circulated by a group calling itself the Barotse Patriotic Front
on Self-Determination (BPF), government-owned Times of Zambia
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BPF is distributing brochures justifying continued secession
claims by proponents of the dead Barotseland Agreement signed
between the government of the former ruling United National
Independence Party (UNIP) and the Litunga (general chief) of
Western Province in 1964 when Zambia won its independence from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Western Province, which was called Barotseland, enjoyed half
independence under British colonial rule and strived to become an
independent country before it became part of Zambia in 1964 and
in 1969 got its present name.
</P>
<P>
The seditious papers which demand independence of the Western
Province from the central government contained the proposed
national anthem and constitution of Barotseland, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
BPF alleges despite the fact that Barotseland joined Zambia
through a trade-off over its government and resources, the
des-empowering and deliberate impoverishment of Barotseland could
not be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
In response to the seditious propaganda, Home Affairs Minister
Peter Machungwa warned in Lusaka Saturday that those breaking the
law will be dealt with in accordance with the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
Times newspaper quoted him as saying that it is a "very
serious matter that calls for thorough study".
</P>
<P>
Richard Sakala, press and public relations assistant at the
State House, described the materials contained in the brochures
as "seditious" and "treasonable".
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe said authenticity of the
claims contained in the brochures would be investigated and
"appropriate" action could be taken.
</P>
<P>
In the brochures being circulated, BPF alleges that the
Zambian government has stifled the people of Barotseland of their
democratic right for a long time and that time had come to
correct the situation.
</P>
<P>
Because Barotseland voluntarily entered into the agreement to
join in Zambia several decades ago, it was only logical for it to
voluntarily divorce itself now from the agreement and revert to
its original status, claimed BPF.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that the recognition of Barotseland's inherent
right to self-government is overdue and not an attempt to rewrite
the past but to build a better future for all its people," reads
one of the brochures.

<HEADLINE> Relief Supplies Reach Flooded Areas in Shortest Possible Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs
has managed to distribute the donated relief goods within the
shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry's disaster relief department said
the flood stricken areas urgently need cotton quilts, clean drink
water, pharmaceuticals and other necessary goods and his ministry
must ensure that the supplies reach the areas without any delay.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the donated goods sent to the ministry, public
servants there would connect with airport, railway and highway
administrative departments to confirm that the goods be delivered
the same day as they were received.
</P>
<P>
Hunan needs 1,586 tons of steel products. A provincial civil
affairs official on Friday rushed to the Beijing-based Shougang
Corporation which had promised to offer the steel products to the
flooded areas for help.
</P>
<P>
On the same day a transportation team set off for Hunan with
the steel products in various types Hunan needed.
</P>
<P>
The goods were expected to reach Hunan within three or four
days. In usual cases, such large amount of steel products would
reach Hunan in at least one week.
</P>
<P>
The official from Hunan also arranged a "train trip" within two
hours for 1,000 blankets donated for his province at the donation
center of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, a batch of blankets, makeshift tents and water
purifiers donated by the United States government were sent to
Hunan by air. As soon as the plane landed the airport, big trucks
arranged by the provincial civil affairs department unloaded the
goods and sent them to the flooded areas immediately.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Stands for Convening Special UN Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Sunday it was
appropriate for a special session of the United Nations Security
Council to be convened as attention should be drawn to vital
issues related to the question of terrorism and the issue of the
U.S. action in violating the sovereignty of another country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said this
after launching his ministry's Family Day in Kepong near here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This issue involves a principle which is most crucial and
which should not be ignored," the foreign minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Malaysia's regret over the U.S. action, Abdullah
said that launching missile attacks on targets in Sudan or in any
other country was not the way to overcome the problem of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the U.S. action violated the sovereignty of that
independent nation which is also a member of the United Nations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that based on reports he had received, efforts
were underway for a special session to be convened.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.S. stand that it was striking back
following the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
Abdullah said that as far as he knew, the UN had not given its
blessings.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that the support from the U.S. allies was
expected but still such missile attacks should not be resorted to
as it would not overcome the problem of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We are also against terrorism and we condemn all forms of
terrorism," he said, adding Malaysia was concerned that the
missile strikes by the U.S. would further trigger terrorist
activities which would have far worse consequences.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Community in Australia Holds Anti-U.S. Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- About 300 People from the
Afghan community in Sydney Sunday held a rally condemning last
week's U.S. missile strikes on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Long live Afghanistan" and anti-U.S. slogans, the
protesters denied there were terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan, saying Clinton had committed an act of terrorism
equal to the twin bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa, the
Australian Associated Press reported (AAP).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missiles which hit targets in Afghanistan and
Sudan Friday, which Clinton claimed were linked with Saudi
millionaire Osama Bin Laden, who he believed was the mastermind
behind the U.S. embassy bombings on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources and hospital officials in Pakistan have said
that the U.S. strikes killed 26 people in Afghanistan, and injured
around 40.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden Saturday called on Muslims around the world to take
up arms against the U.S. in retaliation against the U.S. bombings.
</P>
<P>
Alkozli claimed there were no terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan, and said the Afghan community was opposed to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Carrying anti-US banners, the protesters met at Sydney Town
Hall before marching to the U.S. consulate in Martin Place.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rival Negotiators Still to Face Each </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators for a
ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have yet
to meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
Talks entered the second day in Pretoria Sunday with South
African leaders shuttling between the opposing camps, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit involving a representative of DRC President
Laurent Kabila and the presidents of Uganda and Rwanda began
Saturday night after the DRC representative arrived more than six
hours late.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties did not meet face-to-face, but exchanged
notes instead in a brief session.
</P>
<P>
Before the arrival of DRC Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo,
Kabila's representative, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu held talks with Mandela
and his deputy, Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise, Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo and his deputy Aziz Pahad were also present.
</P>
<P>
Although Mandela's aide Parks Mankahlana denied that the
presidents of Uganda and Rwanda were miffed at being snubbed by
Kabila, it is understood the arrival of a junior DRC negotiator
has produced a protocol nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Kabila told Mandela by phone Saturday that he was unable to
attend as his doctor had ordered him to rest.
</P>
<P>
However, it is understood that Kabila wants Uganda and Rwanda,
which he blames for supporting the rebel invasion in the DRC, to
call a ceasefire first, before he will negotiate, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
It could not be confirmed whether Kabila had been persuaded to
arrive for the talks Sunday, which will be followed by an
emergency summit of the 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC), which is split on how to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
An official at Waterkloof air base told SAPA a plane from the
DRC was scheduled to land later in the day, but it could not be
confirmed immediately whether Kabila would be on board.
</P>
<P>
Twelve planes were expected to land during the morning, two of
which had already arrived.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who heads the SADC faction
in favor of military intervention, will not attend the summit.
Nor will Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whose troops
are backing Kabila along with Zimbabwe, be present. Dos Santos is
reportedly ill and will send a representative.

initiative.
</P>
<P>
"The continuous invasion by a group of people with
expansionist plans should stop. There ought to be a point when
leadership in the region has to rise and put a stop to this type
of destabilization," said Ben Mucheche, president of Indigenous
Business Development Center.
</P>
<P>
Nhlanhla Masuku, president of Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce, said there was no way Zimbabwe could be wrong judging
by the support given by the U.N. Security Council and other
regional bodies.
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament Richard Shambambeva-Nyandoro said, "I
feel very strongly that as SADC countries, the first thing we
should do is have unity in protecting each other as a region. We
should do everything possible to see that there are no
infiltrators as has happened to Congo, not only at SADC level,
but also as member states of the Organisation of African Unity."
</P>
<P>
Political commentator and theater activist Ngugi Wa Mirii said
the whole of Zimbabwe should support the government's position.
"We need to settle the Congo (issue) once and for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if African heads of state could not solve their
problems based on selfishness, the continent could experience
another Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament Lazarue Nzarayebani said, "The decision
to intervene militarily to assist in the restoration of law and
order, democracy and rule of law in the DRC is a very progressive
move."
</P>
<P>
However, independent MP Margaret Dongo said the decision by
Zimbabwe to intervene in the DRC was made without consulting
parliament and as such was a decision of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean National Students' Union and opposition United
Parties also issued the statements condemning Mugabe's military
intervention.

MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has finally submitted to Congress the proposed
579.5-billion-peso (13.5 billion U.S. dollars) national budget for
1999, presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barican said Estrada submitted the budget proposal Saturday
night to the members of the House of Representatives led by
Speaker Manny Villar during the dinner the President hosted.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the proposed budget, Speaker Villar said the
lower chamber of Congress will act on it expeditiously, Barican
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Estrada described the budget as "market-friendly
and pro-poor" because it intends to balance the need to stimulate
economic activities, the need to provide basic services and the
need to ensure the private sector of credit resources.
</P>
<P>
The biggest chunk of the budget went to the social services
sector with a total allocation of 159.4 billion pesos (3.7 billion
dollars), or 44.1 percent, Barican said.
</P>
<P>
The social services sector was followed by the economic sector
with 94.6 billion pesos (2.2 billion dollars); the general public
sector, 77.2 billion pesos (1.8 billion dollars); the defense,
30.2 billion pesos (702 million dollars) and other sectors, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The opposition parties of
Cambodia organized a large demonstration here on Sunday morning,
protesting at the results of the election despite Thursday night's
deadly grenade attack and a Ministry of Interior ban.
</P>
<P>
Many people held placards which wrote with slogans such as
"Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy Party Unites to Rebuild the Country!"
"Cambodian People Votes for Democracy!" "Recognize the Results of
Election Is to Betray People's Will!" "Our Votes Were Stolen!"
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that about 12,000 people took part in the
demonstration, which was called by the National United Front of
Funcinpec, the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), the Son Sann Party,
Cambodian Neutral Party and six other small parties.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy addressed the rally, demanding for investigation
into election fraud and asked the Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
to change the premier candidate from Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
to some other people such as CPP President Chea Sim or Co-Interior
Minister Sar Kheng.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodia's Constitution, Hun Sen, candidate of the CPP,
is expected to head the next coalition government as his party, in
accordance with the results announced by the National Election
Committee, won the country's general elections held on July 26,
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition political parties -- the Funcinpec
and the SRP -- had been refusing to accept the results and
insisted that the National Election Committee and the
Constitutional Council must investigate alleged election
irregularities before the formation of next government.

MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Local livestock producers are
asking the Philippine government to import 25,000 metric tons of
yellow corn on top of the proposed 300,000 metric tons for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nemesio Co, chairman of the National Federation of Hog Farmers
Inc., said his group had made this request to the National Food
Authority, but has not yet received any reply, the Philippines
News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the projected shortage, I think the industry would
be needing the volume aside from the proposed 300,000 metric
tons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Co said the industry expects a supply shortfall of at least
200,000 metric tons despite the projected one-million-metric-ton
corn harvest next month.
</P>
<P>
"We (producers) evaluated whether there is a shortage or not.
We found out that definitely there is a shortage even during this
harvest season because this is only good for September and
October," he said.
</P>
<P>
Federation spokesman Francis Wong said it is also uncertain for
the producers to have good a corn harvest considering the El Nino
drought and the arrival of La Nina this year.

CARACAS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Caracas Stock Exchange
closed 22 percent lower this weekend than the previous week,
accumulating a loss of 895.30 units with all the work days of the
week closed with losses.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas stock market registered its lowest level of the
last 28 months on Thursday with a 9.31 percent fall (363.82
points) to close at 3,460.64 points.
</P>
<P>
Stock brokers attributed the market fall to the lack of
confidence of investors in the Venezuelan national market.
</P>
<P>
They said the political crisis in Russia, where the State Duma
requested President Boris Yeltsin to resign, has sent shockwaves
across the European and U.S. markets, and was another reason for
the Venezuelan market collapse.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian crisis affected the international markets, and
Venezuela was not spared," said one broker.
</P>
<P>
Although the Venezuelan economic minister has tried to
stabilize the market, saying that there is no imminent devaluation
of the Venezuelan currency nor exchange control, investors
continue leaving the country, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Forum Ends Meeting on Promoting Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Caribbean Forum (Cariforum)
concluded its two-day meeting in Santo Domingo, capital of the
Dominican Republic, Saturday, with a joint declaration stressing the
region's integration in face of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Cariforum, attended by 16 members and Cuba as its observer,
officially accepted Cuba as its full member, recognizing the
country is "part of the Caribbean family."
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration warns that the globalization process is
generating fundamental changes to the region's economies and
increasing the risk of excluding the smallest and most vulnerable
from rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
It points to the burden of foreign debts as a major obstacle to
the region's economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the positive role of the World Trade
Organization, the Cariforum expressed concerns about a fair
distribution of the benefits of trade globalization and
liberalization, which it says must take into account the bigger
needs of less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The forum urged its members to actively participate in the
negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) to
secure the interests of smaller economies and their full
engagement.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean countries voiced their disappointment with the
failure by the United States to approve a legislation guaranteeing
Caribbean producers the equality with their counterparts in
Mexico, Canada and the United States -- members of the North
America Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the policy to strengthen cooperation with
Central American countries, noting that the two regions had a lot
in common in their concerns about relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Santo Domingo declaration also reaffirmed the region's
support for environment protection and commitment to concerted
actions against drug trafficking and abuse.

NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Equities on the Bombay Stock

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Muslim Groups Furious Over U.S. Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Muslim groups in Sri Lanka are
angry over the recent United States' attacks on Sudan and
Afghanistan, Muslim groups sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that any acts of terrorism in any part of the
world should be condemned. "If the U.S. action is part of a global
effort to combat terrorism, the American should have first, bombed
Israel where state-sponsored terrorism is practiced," the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan have violated
international law and basic human rights, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Washington on Thursday launched missile strikes on alleged
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in response to the twin
bombings on August 7 in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257
people and injured more than 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
General secretary of the Sri Lankan Muslim Welfare Association
(SLMWA) A. Shaul Hameed said here Saturday, "the SLMWA strongly
condemns acts of terrorism in any part of the world. But we must
also express our shock and dismay over the indiscriminate bombing
by the U.S. in Afghanistan and Sudan."
</P>
<P>
Several other Muslim parties have also condemned the U.S.
missile attacks, saying the U.S. action was disrespectful and
disregard for international norms.
</P>
<P>
They called on the United nations to take immediate action
against the U.S. for its attacks.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls for Single Standard on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
said Saturday that the Yugoslav Federal Republic firmly condemns
terrorism of all forms and that the international community must
fight terrorism by applying one unified single standard in
accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued a statement in response to the U.S.
military strikes against alleged terrorist sites in Afghanistan
and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Yugoslavia is of the view that it is
dangerous and unacceptable to apply double standards on
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It said that some people attempted to categorize international
terrorism as "good" and "bad." Toward those "good terrorists,"
they adopt a policy of protection, even deprive some sovereign
nations of their rights to fight terrorists on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
To those "bad terrorists," they adopt a policy of striking,
resorting to massive use of destructive weapons against the
territory of sovereign nations, even bypassing the Untied Nations
and violating the basic principles governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement concluded that Yugoslavia believes that the fight
against international terrorism must be carried out on the basis
of respect for the U.N. Charter and the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of nations.

<HEADLINE> hke082310 - Roundup: Bangladesh's New Jute Policy Awaits Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Jute
Ministry-drafted new jute policy is awaiting Cabinet approval,
which emphasizes on privatization of public sector jute mills to
get rid of staggering losses and revitalize of the important
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative loss incurred by the country's 33 public sector
jute mills reached 23.16 million taka (bout 492.8 million U.S.
dollars) till the end of July 1996-June 1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Ministry said it was necessary to gradually
transfer the public sector jute mills to private entrepreneurs and
free the mills from huge losses, according to the draft jute
policy.
</P>
<P>
The current jute policy needs a timely reform to boost jute
goods production and export, Jute Ministry sources stated.
</P>
<P>
The policy was last revised during the 1988-89 fiscal year, for
 some of its contents were not suitable to the changing
circumstances in the jute industrial environment.
</P>
<P>
After evaluating the overall situation in the jute sector, the
new policy framers identified two key factors that cause losses in
jute production -- one is the continuous downtrend in jute demand
and lower prices of jute in the international market, the other is
the higher jute-goods production cost than the selling prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of raw jute declined to 40 dollars from 60 dollars
per bale (180 kilograms) last year in the international market.
And due to this reason, the earnings declined by 21 percent though
Bangladesh exported more jute last year than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The government should continue its privatization policy of the
state-owned jute mills, and the mills which would not be possible
to sell out should be liquidated, the policy framers said.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested to produce jute goods to keep consistency
with the international market, and according to the current
demand, production of jute goods should be kept below 0.5 million
tons per year.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, out of a total 26,000 looms at 33 public
sector mills, the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) would
only need to operate 15,000 to 20,000 looms to produce the
above-said amount.
</P>
<P>
Giving an outline of the jute production in the country, the
draft policy says that around 4.8 million bales (1 bale is 180
kilograms) of jute would be produced from about 0.48 million
hectares of land in the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The total availability of jute will stand at 6.187 million
bales including last year's carry-over of 1.387 million bales, and
out of these, 3.125 million bales would be necessary for local
consumption while around 2 million bales would be exported, with
the remaining 1.062 million bales being stored for next year.
</P>
<P>
The earnings from raw jute export have been estimated to be
around 4 billion taka (about 85.11 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Around 400,000 tons of jute goods will be exported, earning 12
billion taka (about 255.3 million dollars), the new policy
predicts.
</P>
<P>
During last fiscal year, Bangladesh's jute goods export and
earnings faced a short fall of target by 24 percent and 26 percent
respectively. The targets were to export 482,000 tons of jute
goods from which to earn 14.87 billion taka (about 316.4 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new policy also gives emphasis on diversification and
increasing the production of high quality jute.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh launched a project styled "comprehensive jute
production and marketing" in March 1997 to increase production of
high-quality jute. Around 85,000 bales of higher quality jute were
produced during the year 1997-98 though the target was fixed at
120,000 bales under the project.
</P>
<P>
Jute is the main cash crop in the country, with about 25
percent of the total 127 million-population involving in the
jute-related activities. And around 0.25 million workers,
employees and 3 million growers directly depend on the jute
sector, and another 100,000 traders earn their livelihood from
jute business.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Bogota
Stock Exchange Index (IBB) and Medellin Stock Exchange Index
(IBOMED) dropped steadily this week, but the collapse intensified
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IBB slid by 5.96 percent and the IBOMED by 4.30 percent at
the close of Friday's transactions, compared with 3.34 and 2.96
respectively a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The dollar price increased by 3.5 percent in the past week,
going from 1,384.50 pesos on August 14 to 1,429.00 on August 21.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts described the turbulence as an expected
consequence of the Asian and Russian currency crises as well as
slower growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Investment dropped by 18 percent in the first half of the year
in Latin America and a high of 40 percent in Colombia, according
to Burson-Marsteller, an international consulting firm covering 32
emerging markets in six regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Banco de la Republica, Colombia's central bank, attributed the
rise in the dollar value to a growing demand by the real sector of
the economy, especially foreign funds that bought 47 million
dollars, and the intermediate financiers who decided to strengthen
their position in the U.S. currency.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Pull out Staff from Afghanistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has decided
to withdraw all its staff from Afghanistan following the killing
of its military adviser in an attack by unidentified gunmen in
Kabul on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Frontier Post quoted authentic sources as
saying Sunday the U.N. has also informed the Taliban authorities
and the Pakistani government of its decision to pull out all its
staff from the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"The decision (on Saturday) is apparently driven by the
deteriorating security environment in Afghanistan, which is
manifested in the killing of U.N. military advisor Lt-Col. Carmine
Calo," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, ACBAR, a joint body of about 674 registered
non-governmental organizations working in Afghanistan, was
reported to have called back its volunteers and officials from the
war-battered country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report most Americans and other foreigners
working for ACBAR had already left Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province, for Islamabad on Friday while the
remaining few departed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamabad-based U.N. representative for Afghanistan, James
Cobby, handed a strongly-worded communique Saturday to the Taliban
militia, protesting the attacks on U.N. officers in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Taliban militia in Kabul that if it failed to
protect the U.N. personnel and property in Afghanistan, it would
be compelled to withdraw its staff from the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative also demanded stringent actions against
the culprits responsible for attacking the U.N. staff in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Carmine Calo, the military adviser of the
U.N. mission in Kabul, who along with another U.N. official had
received grievous injuries in a shooting attack in Kabul Friday,
succumbed to injuries.
</P>
<P>
The dead body of Carmine Calo, a 42-year-old Italian national,
was airlifted from Kabul to Islamabad Saturday afternoon in a U.N.
chartered plane.
</P>
<P>
Carmine Calo had received severe bullet wounds. Another U.N.
officer at the mission, French national Eric Lavertu, was also
injured in the attack on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Lavertu was also evacuated from Kabul and is now under
treatment in Islamabad. The U.N. sources said that Lavertu is in
stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Row Ruled Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In response to an
anti-discrimination investigation launched recently by the US
Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), Chinese authorities have
expressed hope that such bilateral trade friction can be dealt
with on the basis of negotiation rather that tit-for-tat action.
</P>
<P>
"We are not willing to retaliate in view of the progress the
two sides have made in maritime relations," a spokesman with the
Ministry of Communications told Business Weekly of "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokesman said US shipping companies have enjoyed
fair treatment in accordance with Chinese laws and
regulations. "We have offered US shipping companies full
most-favored nation status for their operations in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sea-Land and APL, the only two US shipping operators in China,
operate services on 12 shipping routes and have established four
wholly-owned subsidiaries in the country's ports.
</P>
<P>
The issues at stake include US shippers' inability to open
branch offices in China and a Chinese rule that foreign shippers
must get official permission or licenses to open new liner
shipping routes.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that as a developing country, China has to
open up its shipping market gradually since the country's
fledgling sectors need a transitional period. The threat of
sanctions from the FMC could strain maritime relations between the
giant trading powers.
</P>
<P>
Last December, US and Chinese negotiators reached a tentative
agreement to mutually improve port access. China promised to
approve six new shipping routes for US companies and Sea-Land's
co-operative project in Tianjin, while the United States engaged
to give greater priority to China's shipping operators.
</P>
<P>
China endorsed the six new routes early this year and is
preparing to approve the Tianjin project, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"But it hinges on the operational progress of China's shipping
companies, which the US side has pledged to foster," he said.
</P>
<P>
China Ocean Shipping Companies Group (Cosco), the country's
biggest shipping operator, is still not able to operate and
compete freely and openly in the United States, said Sun Jiakang,
general manager of the group's transportation department.
</P>
<P>
"Our company is till considered a controlled carrier in the
United States," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
The United States has listed 37 foreign carriers, mostly from
communist countries, as "controlled," meaning their bidding prices
take 30 days to be approved while common carriers need only 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the S414 Act this
month, which will impose discriminatory conditions on China's
shipping operators when it becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. delegation led by Administrator Clyde Hart of the
Transportation Department's Maritime Administration will visit
China next week to restart negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar, Thailand Strengthen Trade and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between Myanmar and Thailand
which falls on August 24, has witnessed significant achievements
of close trade and economic cooperation between the two southeast
Asian nations in the past 50 years especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, former Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
visited Myanmar, setting the stage for enhancing trade and
economic cooperation and good neighborly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on border crossing was then signed and notes on
jurisdiction over the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the Moei
(Thaungyin) River exchanged, signifying a step forward in
facilitating trade, transport and communications between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Friendship Bridge, which links border towns of Myawaddy
(Myanmar) and Maesot (Thailand), was opened later in August in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
In last December, foreign ministers of Myanmar and Thailand
agreed at the 4th meeting of the Myanmar-Thai Joint Commission for
Bilateral Cooperation in Bangkok to enhance their bilateral
cooperation in the sectors of culture, health, education,
technology, agriculture, tourism, trade, investment,
communications, energy, fishery and drug control.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of Myanmar's major trading partners, began border
trade with the country in March 1996 at three border points --
Maesai-Tachilek, Maesod-Myawaddy and Ranong-Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, bilateral trade including
border trade stood at 330 million U.S. dollars in the 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March, up from 289 million dollars in
1996-97. The balance of trade was in Thailand's favor.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the leading foreign investors in Myanmar,
ranked the third after Britain and Singapore with 1.16 billion
dollars in 42 projects out of the 7-billion-dollar total foreign
investment at the end of March this year. The investment covers
such sectors as oil and gas, hotels and tourism, livestock
breeding and fishery, industrial estate and transport.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment was also highlighted by its involvement
in the development of two Myanmar offshore natural gas fields, the
Yadana and the Yetagun, where gas is due to be sold to Thailand
later this year and the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Thailand's private sector began to join in the
infrastructural development of Myanmar's Hlaingtharya Industrial
Zone in Yangon in April 1997, bringing the zone to the third
foreign-invested industrial zone status after the Mingaladon and
the Thanlyin-Kyauktan.
</P>
<P>
On the telecommunications sector, Myanmar prepares to use the
Thaicom satellite transponder for its domestic satellite
communication services under a lease contract with the Sinawatra
Group of Thailand initiated in March this year, thus replacing the
one leased earlier from Hong Kong's Asiasat-1 and 2 for its
telecast of the military-run Myawaddy TV station.
</P>
<P>
With regard to transport links, Thailand has granted two loans
of 150 million and 11.5 million U.S. dollars respectively for
building Myanmar's new Mandalay International Airport and
upgrading the Tachilek-Kengtung road which leads up to Bangkok
through Chiang Rai.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also plan to develop two deep seaports -- one
in Thailand's Bagan Saphan on the gulf of Thailand and the other
in Myanmar's Bokpyin area along the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Myanmar and Thailand initiated an agreement on
cooperation in tourism, which opened up more opportunities in
cultural exchange. This is seen as a contribution to fostering and
enhancing of closer relationship between the two countries and two
peoples.

<HEADLINE> Mine Closure Scheme to Overcome Coal Glut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to shut down 22,000
small coal mines operating without production licenses by 2000,
today's "China Daily" quoted a leading official with the State
Coal Industry Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mines to be closed include those that produce low quality
coal and pollute the environment. Workers laid off as a result of
the closures will be transferred to other industries and
services, according to Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the
State Coal Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's coal stockpile had reached 65.58 million tons by the
end of June, 9.35 million tons higher than at the beginning of the
year. Wang attributed the serious glut to rampant production by
small coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The closures are expected to reduce annual coal output by 200
million tons and balance demand and supply on the domestic market,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Coal
Industry Bureau and other State administrations are co-operating
in the drafting of specific measures to implement the closure
decision, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the shutting down of small mines, the State
Council has decided to transfer supervision rights for 94 State
key coal mines from the former Ministry of Coal Industry to
provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's coal industry finally put an end to the
serious losses of the 1984-96 period, with the key State coal
mines earning 200 million yuan (24.1 million US dollars) in net
profits.
</P>
<P>
But in the first half of this year, the key coal firms reported
aggregate deficits of 1.75 billion yuan. The formidable losses
resulted from a flagging market caused by massive oversupply of
coal.
</P>
<P>
China has 94 key State coal mines, 2,500 local State coal mines
and 75,000 township and village coal mines. Some small mines have
become black sheep in the sector because they disrupt the market,
squander resources and bring about numerous fatalities, Wang
said.

prefers that," Krajicek said. "Iknew it was a big game at 5-4. I
felt if I can hold on maybe that was a shot."

<HEADLINE> Insurance Companies Pay Out to Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Insurance companies
reacted quickly to settle compensations claims arising from the
the heavy floods sweeping China Since July.
</P>
<P>
Today's Business Weekly of China Daily reported that the
People's Insurance Company of China Group (PICC Group) has
provided advance payments totalling 1 billion yuan (120 million
U.S. dollars) to the flood-hit areas by August 20.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said other big companies as Ping An Insurance
Compay and Pacific Insurance Company are also reported to have
offered huge sum of compensation, although specific figures are
not available yet.
</P>
<P>
The floods had destroyed 5.58 million houses, damaged another
12.05 million and forced 13.8 million people to move to safe
places by August 9.
</P>
<P>
The floods on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
had caused at least 39.7 billion yuan (4.7 billion U.S. dollars)
in economic losses to Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi provinces by August
9.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Property, an insurance arm of the PICC Group, has
received claims totalling 3.1 billion yuan (373.4 million
U.S. dollars) from insured enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Group branches in the flooded provinces have sent more
than 3,000 agents to the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei branch of the PICC Property on August 7 paid
compensation to 76 enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Experts said compensation for flood losses has been rising
sharply in recent years. In coastal areas and provinces along the
major rivers, compensation for flood losses has accounted for 50 to
80 percent of all insurance payouts.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believed that Chinese companys' awareness of
the role of insurance in lessening risks is still weak.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Venezuelan basket of crudes (VBC) and byproducts this week
registered a slight increase of 15 cents of a U.S. dollar to end
at 9.83 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mines and Energy Ministry, the VBC registered
so far this month an average of 10.07 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) basket
of seven crudes closed Friday with an average of 11.74 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
To shore up the depressed oil prices, Venezuela has promoted a
global strategy of reduction of exports and agreed to reduce its
daily output to a total of 525,000 barrels a day until June 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop of oil prices in the international markets and
the cuts in oil output have affected Venezuelan earnings which are
expected to lose more than 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said Friday that his
country will not make more adjustments to its crude production.
</P>
<P>
"The production cuts have already been adopted and no more cuts
are planned," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Steel Complex Acting as Steel Bulwark Against Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex
in the capital of central China's Hubei Province, one of the
hardest-hit regions in this flood season, has played an
indispensable role in combating the floods.
</P>
<P>
The plant has been responsible for the safety of a
7.5-kilometer-long Yangtze River embankment, which is one-third of
the river length that runs through the city, and also its most
dangerous section.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,560 plant personnel have been fortifying and manning the
bank in shifts around-the-clock since flooding hit the city in
June.
</P>
<P>
In addition to manpower, the plant has donated 2.8 million yuan
for disaster relief and provided 8,000 cubic meters of material
for filling levee breaches.
</P>
<P>
The flood-control effort, however, has not held up production,
although torrential rains and the suspension of navigation on the
Yangtze have created harsh difficulties. This has been attributed
to the plant's early precautions such has accumulating enough raw
materials in May and June to sustain a month and a half of
production.
</P>
<P>
In July, the plant surpassed its production targets
for the output of iron, steel and rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
A few other companies in Wuhan have also maintained
performance while contributing to the flood-control battle.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-French joint venture, Shenlong (Citroen) Automotive
Co. Ltd., responsible for the safety of a more than
one-kilometer-long dike, saw its output in the first seven months
increase by 33 percent, and turnovers by 26.8 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
By August 14, Citroen had donated two vehicles and 959,000 yuan
to the city's flood control efforts.

WASHINGTON -- President Bill Clinton on Saturday launched a new
offensive against U.S. arch-foe Osama bin Laden by blocking all
financial transactions between U.S. companies and the Saudi
millionaire, accused by Washington of masterminding the bombings
of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"I have just signed an executive order directing the Treasury
to block all financial transactions between the bin Laden
terrorist group and American persons and companies," Clinton said
in the weekly radio address. He also urged other governments to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow sanctuary for terrorism, not for terrorists
or for their money," he added. "It takes money, lots of it, to
build the network bin Laden has. We'll do our best to see that he
has less of it."
</P>
<P>
But some of senior officials admitted Clinton's order was
unlikely to have an impact on much of bin Laden's fortune,
estimated at 300 million U.S. dollars, because they did not
believe much of his assets were subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
But they said the United States would ask some of its allies to
take the similar action. (US-Strikes-Clinton-Sanctions)

KHARTOUM -- Sudan Saturday asked the U.N. Security Council to
hold an urgent meeting on the recent U.S. air raid on an alleged
terrorist-related site in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Security Council, the Sudanese Ministry of
Foreign Relations asked the Security Council to shoulder its
responsibility under the U.N. Charter and condemn the
U.S. aggression, Sudanese News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., accusing Sudan of sponsoring international terrorism,
fired cruise missiles Thursday night at a pharmaceutical factory
in Khartoum in what it claimed retaliation for the twin bombings
of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people were killed and 5,000 others wounded in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Sudan requested that the United Nations set up
a technical fact-finding committee to probe the claims of the
United States and adopt measures to prevent the repetition of
similar strikes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Such actions are "grave behavior and flagrant violation of the
U.N. Charter," said the message. (Sudan-UN-US Raid)

BEIJING -- The floods are still flowing at a high-water level
Saturday in China, a sign of continuing difficulty in the
anti-disaster effort.
</P>
<P>
The third flood crest on the Songhua River Saturday passed through
Harbin, a major heavy-industrial city in China's northernmost
province of Heilongjiang, with the water level climbing to 120.89
meters, 0.84 meters higher than the historic high, while the water
flow rate reaching 17,300 cubic meters per second by 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the city has not yet lowered much, according
to evening reports from China Central Television (CCTV).
Authorities attributed this to poor distribution on the river
section, noting that the width there ranges from 1-to-10 km, which
adds difficulties for the flow of the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
"It is at a crucial moment to counter the flooding," said an
on-the-spot water control expert. A total of 400,000 soldiers and
civilians are safeguarding the city.
</P>
<P>
The sixth flood crest on the Yangtze River has reached Jiujiang
in east China's Jiangxi Province. It will have passed through
Jiujiang by Sunday afternoon. The water level at the city stood at
22.46 m at 2 p.m. Saturday, 0.04 m more than Friday's level,
according to the latest information from the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters (SFCDRH). (China-Roundup-Today's

PRAGUE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak foreign debts soared
to 11.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of May this year, the
highest since 1993 when the country gained independence, according
to news reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Bank of Slovakia was quoted by

Foreign debts have currently accounted for more than 50 percent
of the country's gross domestic product, far above the warning

WUHAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Flood-stricken Hubei Province in
central China registered a fast economic growth in the first half
of this year, official figures showed.
</P>

tons, the third largest harvest in the history, while the
incremental output of industries grew by 9.9 percent, two
percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, fiscal revenue and foreign trade also
witnessed remarkable growth, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Last month when flooding became worse, the provincial
government asked all localities to concentrate on flood control
and facilitate industrial and agricultural production.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Coffee Output Expected to Drop by 6.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican coffee output
may drop by some 200,000 46-kilo bags during the 1998-99 season,
down 6.3 percent from the 1997-98 figure.
</P>
<P>
The estimate was made by the Coffee Institute in a report
published Saturday about the coffee harvest that began in july and
will be completed in March or April of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Executive officer of the institute Guillermo Canet explained
that coffee production is cyclical and based on this theory, the
1997-1998 output was 3.2 million bags and the 1998-99 harvest is
initially estimated at 3 million bags.
</P>
<P>
He said coffee production may have been affected by "El Nino,"
especially in the main coffee producing provinces of Alajuela and
Heredia.
</P>
<P>
The main effect was the delay in the start of the rainy season,
which affected first the blossoming and then the growth of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
The official said the estimated drop in coffee harvest in Costa
Rica and other countries in Latin America like Mexico, and
especially one of the biggest producers, Indonesia, may trigger a
rebound of coffer prices in the international coffee market.

<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- World Cup legend boy Michael
Owen, who signed a new five-year deal with Liverpool, failed to
reproduce his scintillating World Cup form in a English Premier
league match against Arsenal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old star was denied any genuine chances by the
defending champions' defence, which produced a typically assured
display even in the absence of skipper Tony Adams with food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
And eventually it was another Liverpool's young man,
20-year-old Jamie Carragher who secured a point for his side 10
minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Ray Parlour's long ball found the fast-moving Marc Overmars,
who squeezed his shot past Liverpool keeper Brad Friedel.
</P>
<P>
But Carragher, switched this season from midfield to the
center of defence, raced back to block the ball on the line.
</P>
<P>
It meant that the clash of the Frenchmen -- Liverpool's Gerard
Houllier and Arsenal's Arsene Wenger -- ended with a draw.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger would take more satisfaction from the result than
Houllier, in his first Premier league home match since joining
Liverpool as joint boss with Roy Evans.
</P>
<P>
Indeed the Gunners were so effective at thwarting Liverpool's
attacking instincts, that it was the visitors who ended up
producing the best moments of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal midfielder Parlour wasted the best chance of the match
by blazing over the bar from close range in the 34th minute after
Friedel had pulled off a stunning save to deny Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
Overmars came close to grabbing a winner ten minutes from time,
but after outpacing the defence, he beat Friedel only to see
Carragher block his shot on the line.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool rarely troubled David Seamen in the Arsenal goal
with Steve McManaman sending several speculative shots spinning
wide.
</P>
<P>
But the England goalkeeper did need the help of defender
Martin Keown in the 57th minute after he failed to hold a low
drive from Vegard Heggem. The ball ran loose to Karlheinz Riedle
who saw his effort blocked on the line by the England defender.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Wenger said: "They played against strong
strikers in Owen and Riedle ... their average age is 33 or more
and they still looked very good.
</P>
<P>
"That is down to experience, intelligence and motivation. My
dream would have been to have them ten years earlier," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool joint boss Gerard Houllier was happy to take a point
from the match.
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was a fair draw, but we do need a bit more
composure and confidence on the ball," he said afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Owen Signs New Five-Year Deal with Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 18-year-old World Cup sensation signed a 10,000
pounds-a-week deal a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But his success with England has earned Owen a new contract on
at least 20,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool made the announcement to the crowd ten minutes
before its home match against Arsenal, after Owen received the
Carling No. 1 award for his scoring success last season.
</P>
<P>
Owen said:"I had a clause in my last contract which said that
I could renegotiate when I had played for England in a
competitive international."
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken with the board recently and I'm pleased to have
extended my contract until 2003.
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do now is to focus on my football and help
Liverpool bring more silverware back to Anfield," he said.

<HEADLINE> Charlton Leads English Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Charlton Athletic, which was
promoted to the English Premier League from Division A last
season, led the team standings of the league after thrashing
Southampton 5-0 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, much fancied Tottenham Hotspur was in trouble with
second successive defeat in the league.
</P>
<P>
While Clive Mendonca's hat-trick helped Charlton to their
great win, Tottenham fans were demonstrating outside the ground
after their team went down 3-0 at home to Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The big match-up of the day, Liverpool against champions
Arsenal, produced plenty of chances for both sides but no goals,
while Manchester United also drew 0-0, in a disappointing game at
West Ham.
</P>
<P>
Charlton had no such trouble finding the net as John Robert
son, in the third minute, and Neil Redfearn, a minute into the
second half, had the Londoners in control.
</P>
<P>
Southampton goalkeeper Paul Jones was then sent off and
Mendonca, as usual, took center stage.
</P>
<P>
The man who scored a hat-trick in last season's first division
play-off final, converted a penalty and then banged in two more.
</P>
<P>
While the Charlton fans sang "We're going to win the league,"
Tottenham's troubled supporters gathered outside the ground to
shout "sack the board".
</P>
<P>
First half goals by Peter Atherton and Italian Paolo Di Canio
and a late strike by Andy Hinchliffe gave Wednesday a comfortable
win and their first points.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham, who spent much of last season fighting relegation,
hoped for better things this time but manager Christian Gross is
already the bookmakers' favourite to be the first premier league
coach to get the sack.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the fans are disappointed, they love their
club and no-one likes to lose," said Gross.
</P>
<P>
"There's only one way to change it - by hard work."
</P>
<P>
Gross said he believed in the quality of his players but said
he would have them in for extra training on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Everton, another big club who struggled last season, also had
a bad day. Their summer spending spree counted for little as
Leicester cruised to a 2-0 home victory.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea also failed to shine, having most of the game but
managing only a 1-1 home draw with Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
A Steve Stone goal gave promoted Nottingham Forest their first
points of the season in a 1-0 home win over Coventry.
</P>
<P>
Derby against Wimbledon ended 0-0. Aston Villa play
Middlesbrough on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Expresses Worry about Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Saturday held a telephone conservations with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and expressed worry about the escalation of violence
in Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, a German government spokesman
said Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
During his half-an-hour telephone conservations with Yeltsin,
Kohl expressed particular worry about the sufferings of civilians
in the Kosovo conflict as well as the growing number of refugees
from that region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed disappointment about the failure of the
Yugoslav government in particular in delivering their promises to
end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone talks, the two leaders also discussed the
recent Russian financial crisis, with Kohl expressing the hope
that Russia could manage to restore investors' confidence as soon
as possible, the German spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also reiterated Germany's willingness to offer advice to
Moscow on issues such as taxation policy and bank supervision, but
he also stressed that it would depend on Russia itself to create
the preconditions for a long-term solution to the financial
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Thousands in N. Irish Town Omagh to Remember Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people
packed into the streets of Omagh on Saturday to remember the
victims of last week's bomb.
</P>
<P>
Men, women and children crowded the narrow streets in front of
the courthouse for an open-air ceremony attended by British and
Irish political leaders from the Catholic and Protestant
communities.
</P>
<P>
"At this hour last Saturday, 28 good and deeply loved people,
one carrying twins awaiting birth, were alive in these
streets...This space within our town, where all our futures were
changed one week ago, is today a silent sanctuary of remembrance,
hearing the silence of the inner sanctuaries of broken hearts and
families," Catholic priest Kevin Mullan told the hushed crowd.
</P>
<P>
The blast, the worst incident in the past 30 years in Northern
Ireland, has killed 28 people and injured 220.
</P>
<P>
Mullan said each day and night had been filled with "horror,
pain and grief."
</P>
<P>
Huge red curtains draped the front of the 19th century
courthouse where 50,000 people gathered to observe a moment of
silence at 3.10 pm (1410 gmt) -- the moment a 225 kg car bomb
ripped through Omagh's busy shopping street.
</P>
<P>
Irish President Mary McAleese, Irish premier Bertie Ahern,
Britain's deputy prime minister John Prescott and Northern
Ireland's political leaders were among those who attended.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five people are still being treated in hospital after
the blast. Fourteen of them are children, several are critically
injured.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders to Cut bin Laden's Financial Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Saturday launched a new offensive against U.S. arch-foe Osama bin
Laden by blocking all financial transactions between U.S.
companies and the Saudi millionaire, accused by Washington of
masterminding the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"I have just signed an executive order directing the Treasury
to block all financial transactions between the bin Laden
terrorist group and American persons and companies," Clinton said
in the weekly radio address. He also urged other governments to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow sanctuary for terrorism, not for terrorists
or for their money," he added. "It takes money, lots of it, to
build the network bin Laden has. We'll do our best to see that he
has less of it."
</P>
<P>
But some of senior officials admitted Clinton's order was
unlikely to have an impact on much of bin Laden's fortune,
estimated at $300 million, because they did not believe much of
his assets were subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
But they said the United States would ask some of its allies to
take the similar action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United
States now had intelligence providing further proof that all six
militant training camps hit by missiles in Afghanistan sustained
"moderate to severe damage."
</P>
<P>
"Each of the six camps sustained some level of damage," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Islamic radicals speaking for bin Laden insisted that, despite
Clinton's assertion of having "convincing" evidence of his role
in the August 7 bombings at the two embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, he had nothing to do with the explosions that killed
more than 250 people and injured over 5,000.
